62968481	the  wingandwing   or   le feufollet   a tale  by  j fenimore cooper        know     without star or angel for their guide     who worship god shall find him     preface  it is difficult to say of which there is most in the world a blind belief in religious dogmas or a presumptuous and ignorant cavilling on revelation the impression has gone abroad that france was an example of the last during the height of her great revolutionary mania a charge that was scarcely true as respects the nation however just it might be in connection with her bolder and more unquiet spirits most of the excesses of france during that momentous period were to be attributed to the agency of a few the bulk of the nation having little to do with any part of them beyond yielding their physical and pecuniary aid to an audacious and mystifying political combination one of the baneful results however of these great errors of the times was the letting loose of the audacious from all the venerable and healthful restraints of the church to set them afloat on the sea of speculation and conceit there is something so gratifying to human vanity in fancying ourselves superior to most around us that we believe few young men attain their majority without imbibing more or less of the taint of unbelief and passing through the mists of a vapid moral atmosphere before they come to the clear manly and yet humble perceptions that teach most of us in the end our own insignificance the great benevolence as well as wisdom of the scheme of redemption and the philosophy of the christian religion as well as its divinity  perhaps the greatest stumblingblock of the young is a disposition not to yield to their belief unless it conforms to their own crude notions of propriety and reason if the powers of man were equal to analyzing the nature of the deity to comprehending his being and power and motives there would be some little show of sense in thus setting up the pretence of satisfying our judgments in all things before we yield our credence to a religious system but the first step we take brings with it the instructive lesson of our incapacity and teaches the wholesome lesson of humility from arrogantly claiming a right to worship a deity we comprehend we soon come to feel that the impenetrable veil that is cast around the godhead is an indispensable condition of our faith reverence and submission a being that can be comprehended is not a being to be worshipped  in this book there is an attempt to set these conflicting tendencies in a full but amicable contrast to each other we believe there is nothing in the design opposed to probability and it seems to us that the amiable tenderness of a confiding but justviewing female heart might under the circumstances be expected to manifest the mingled weakness and strength that it has here been our aim to portray  we acknowledge a strong paternal feeling in behalf of this book placing it very high in the estimate of its merits as compared with other books from the same pen a species of commendation that need wound no man perhaps some knowledge of italian character is necessary to enjoy the vicegovernatore veechygovernatore and the podest√† but we confess they have given us in reading over these pages for the first time since they were written quite as much amusement as if they were altogether from an unknown hand  as for the mediterranean that unrivalled sea its pictures always afford us delight the hue of the water the delicious and voluptuous calm the breathings of the storm from the alps and apennines the noble mountainsides basking in the light of the region or shrouded in mists that increase their grandeur the picturesque craft the islands bays rocks volcanoes and the thousand objects of art contribute to render it the centre of all that is delightful and soothing to both the mind and the senses  the reader will recollect the painful history of caraccioli we have taken some liberties with his private history admitting frankly that we have no other authority for them than that which we share in common with all writers of romance the granddaughter we have given the unfortunate admiral is so much in accordance with italian practices that no wrong is done to the morale of naples whatever may be the extent of the liberty taken with the individual  nelson seems to have lived and died under the influence of the unprincipled woman who then governed him with the arts of a siren his nature was noble and his moral impressions even were not bad but his simple and confiding nature was not equal to contending with one as practised in profligacy as the woman into whose arms he was thrown at a most evil moment for his reputation  there is nothing more repugnant to the general sense of rights than the prostitution of public justice to the purposes of private vengeance such would seem to have been the reason of the very general odium attached to the execution of admiral prince caraccioli who was the victim of circumstances rather than the promoter of treason the whole transaction makes a melancholy episode in the history of modern europe we have made such use of it as is permitted to fiction neither neglecting the leading and known facts of the event nor adhering to the minuter circumstances more closely than the connection of our tale demanded    wingandwing  chapter i       filled with the face of heaven which from afar      comes down upon the waters all its hues      from the rich sunset to the rising star      their magical variety diffuse      and now they change a paler shadow strews      its mantle oer the mountains parting day      dies like the dolphin whom each pang imbues      with a new color as it gasps away      the last still loveliest tilltis goneand all is grey       childe harold  the charms of the tyrrhenian sea have been sung since the days of homer that the mediterranean generally and its beautiful boundaries of alps and apennines with its deeply indented and irregular shores forms the most delightful region of the known earth in all that relates to climate productions and physical formation will be readily enough conceded by the traveller the countries that border on this midland water with their promontories buttressing a mimic oceantheir mountainsides teeming with the picturesque of human lifetheir heights crowned with watchtowerstheir rocky shelves consecrated by hermitages and their unrivalled sheet dotted with sails rigged as it might be expressly to produce effect in a picture form a sort of world apart that is replete with charms which not only fascinate the beholder but which linger in the memories of the absent like visions of a glorious past  our present business is with this fragment of a creation that is so eminently beautiful even in its worst aspects but which is so often marred by the passions of man in its best while all admit how much nature has done for the mediterranean none will deny that until quite recently it has been the scene of more ruthless violence and of deeper personal wrongs perhaps than any other portion of the globe with different races more widely separated by destinies than even by origin habits and religion occupying its northern and southern shores the outwork as it might be of christianity and mohammedanism and of an antiquity that defies history the bosom of this blue expanse has mirrored more violence has witnessed more scenes of slaughter and heard more shouts of victory between the days of agamemnon and nelson than all the rest of the dominions of neptune together nature and the passions have united to render it like the human countenance which conceals by its smiles and godlike expression the furnace that so often glows within the heart and the volcano that consumes our happiness for centuries the turk and the moor rendered it unsafe for the european to navigate these smiling coasts and when the barbarians power temporarily ceased it was merely to give place to the struggles of those who drove him from the arena  the circumstances which rendered the period that occurred between the years 1790 and 1815 the most eventful of modern times are familiar to all though the incidents which chequered that memorable quarter of a century have already passed into history all the elements of strife that then agitated the world appear now to have subsided as completely as if they owed their existence to a remote age and living men recall the events of their youth as they regard the recorded incidents of other centuries then each month brought its defeat or its victory its account of a government overturned or of a province conquered the world was agitated like men in a tumult on that epoch the timid look back with wonder the young with doubt and the restless with envy  the years 1798 and 1799 were two of the most memorable of this evermemorable period and to that stirring and teeming season we must carry the mind of the reader in order to place it in the midst of the scenes it is our object to portray  toward the close of a fine day in the month of august a light fairylike craft was fanning her way before a gentle westerly air into what is called the canal of piombino steering easterly the rigs of the mediterranean are proverbial for their picturesque beauty and quaintness embracing the xebeque the felucca the polacre and the bombarda or ketch all unknown or nearly so to our own seas and occasionally the lugger the latter a species of craft however much less common in the waters of italy than in the bay of biscay and the british channel was the construction of the vessel in question a circumstance that the mariners who eyed her from the shores of elba deemed indicative of mischief a threemasted lugger that spread a wide breadth of canvas with a low dark hull relieved by a single and almost imperceptible line of red beneath her channels and a waist so deep that nothing was visible above it but the hat of some mariner taller than common was considered a suspicious vessel and not even a fisherman would have ventured out within reach of a shot so long as her character was unknown privateers or corsairs as it was the fashion to term them and the name with even its english signification was often merited by their acts not unfrequently glided down that coast and it was sometimes dangerous for those who belonged to friendly nations to meet them in moments when the plunder that a relic of barbarism still legalizes had failed  the lugger was actually of about one hundred and eighty tons admeasurement but her dark paint and low hull gave her an appearance of being much smaller than she really was still the spread of her canvas as she came down before the wind wingandwing as seamen term it or with a sail fanning like the heavy pinions of a seafowl on each side betrayed her pursuits and as has been intimated the mariners on the shore who watched her movements shook their heads in distrust as they communed among themselves in very indifferent italian concerning her destination and object this observation with its accompanying discourse occurred on the rocky bluff above the town of porto ferrajo in the island of elba a spot that has since become so renowned as the capital of the mimic dominion of napoleon indeed the very dwelling which was subsequently used by the fallen emperor as a palace stood within a hundred yards of the speakers looking out toward the entrance of the canal and the mountains of tuscany or rather of the little principality of piombino the system of merging the smaller in the larger states of europe not having yet been brought into extensive operation this house a building of the size of a better sort of country residence of our own was then as now occupied by the florentine governor of the tuscan portion of the island it stands on the extremity of a low rocky promontory that forms the western ramparts of the deep extensive bay on the side of which ensconced behind a very convenient curvature of the rocks which here incline westward in the form of a hook lies the small port completely concealed from the sea as if in dread of visits like those which might be expected from craft resembling the suspicious stranger this little port not as large in itself as a modern dock in places like london or liverpool was sufficiently protected against any probable dangers by suitable batteries and as for the elements a vessel laid upon a shelf in a closet would be scarcely more secure in this domestic little basin which with the exception of a narrow entrance was completely surrounded by buildings lay a few feluccas that traded between the island and the adjacent main and a solitary austrian ship which had come from the head of the adriatic in quest of iron  at the moment of which we are writing however but a dozen living beings were visible in or about all these craft the intelligence that a strange lugger resembling the one described was in the offing and had drawn nearly all the mariners ashore and most of the habitu√©s of the port had followed them up the broad steps of the crooked streets which led to the heights behind the town or to the rocky elevation that overlooks the sea from northeast to west the approach of the lugger produced some such effect on the mariners of this unsophisticated and little frequented port as that of the hawk is known to excite among the timid tenants of the barnyard the rig of the stranger had been noted two hours before by one or two old coasters who habitually passed their idle moments on the heights examining the signs of the weather and indulging in gossip and their conjectures had drawn to the porto ferrajo mall some twenty men who fancied themselves or who actually were cognoscenti in matters of the sea when however the low long dark hull which upheld such wide sheets of canvas became fairly visible the omens thickened rumors spread and hundreds collected on the spot which in manhattanese parlance would probably have been called a battery nor would the name have been altogether inappropriate as a small battery was established there and that too in a position which would easily throw a shot twothirds of a league into the offing or about the distance that the stranger was now from the shore  tommaso tonti was the oldest mariner of elba and luckily being a sober and usually a discreet man he was the oracle of the island in most things that related to the sea as each citizen winedealer grocer innkeeper or worker in iron came up on the height he incontinently inquired for tonti or maso as he was generally called and getting the bearings and distance of the grayheaded old seaman he invariably made his way to his side until a group of some two hundred men women and children had clustered near the person of the pilota as the faithful gather about a favorite expounder of the law in moments of religious excitement it was worthy of remark too with how much consideration this little crowd of gentle italians treated their aged seaman on this occasion none bawling out their questions and all using the greatest care not to get in front of his person lest they might intercept his means of observation five or six old sailors like himself were close at his side these it is true did not hesitate to speak as became their experience but tonti had obtained no small part of his reputation by exercising great moderation in delivering his oracles and perhaps by seeming to know more than he actually revealed he was reserved therefore and while his brethren of the sea ventured on sundry conflicting opinions concerning the character of the stranger and a hundred idle conjectures had flown from mouth to mouth among the landsmen and females not a syllable that could commit the old man escaped his lips he let the others talk at will as for himself it suited his habits and possibly his doubts to maintain a grave and portentous silence  we have spoken of females as a matter of course an event like this in a town of some three or four thousand souls would be likely to draw a due proportion of the gentler sex to the heights most of them contrived to get as near as possible to the aged seaman in order to obtain the first intelligence that it might be the sooner circulated but it would seem that among the younger of these there was also a sort of oracle of their own about whose person gathered a dozen of the prettiest girls either anxious to hear what ghita might have to say in the premises or perhaps influenced by the pride and modesty of their sex and condition which taught them to maintain a little more reserve than was necessary to the less refined portion of their companions in speaking of condition however the words must be understood with an exceedingly limited meaning porto ferrajo had but two classes of society the tradespeople and the laborers although there were perhaps a dozen exceptions in the persons of a few humble functionaries of the government an avvocato a medico and a few priests the governor of the island was a tuscan of rank but he seldom honored the place with his presence and his deputy was a professional man a native of the town whose original position was too well known to allow him to give himself airs on the spot where he was born ghitas companions then were daughters of shopkeepers and persons of that class who having been taught to read and occasionally going to leghorn besides being admitted by the deputy to the presence of his housekeeper had got to regard themselves as a little elevated above the more vulgar curiosity of the less cultivated girls of the port ghita herself however owed her ascendency to her qualities rather than to the adventitious advantage of being a grocers or an innkeepers daughter her origin being unknown to most of those around her as indeed was her family name she had been landed six weeks before and left by one who passed for her father at the inn of christoforo dovi as a boarder and had acquired all her influence as so many reach notoriety in our own simple society by the distinction of having travelled aided somewhat by her strong sense great decision of character perfect modesty and propriety of deportment with a form which was singularly graceful and feminine and a face that while it could scarcely be called beautiful was in the highest degree winning and attractive no one thought of asking her family name and she never appeared to deem it necessary to mention it ghita was sufficient it was familiar to every one and although there were two or three others of the same appellation in porto ferrajo this by common consent got to be the ghita within a week after she had landed  ghita it was known had travelled for she had publicly reached elba in a felucca coming as was said from the neapolitan states if this were true she was probably the only person of her sex in the town who had ever seen vesuvius or planted her eyes on the wonders of a part of italy that has a reputation second only to that of rome of course if any girl in porto ferrajo could imagine the character of the stranger it must be ghita and it was on this supposition that she had unwittingly and if the truth must be owned unwillingly collected around her a clientelle of at least a dozen girls of her own age and apparently of her own class the latter however felt no necessity for the reserve maintained by the curious who pressed near maso for while they respected their guest and friend and would rather listen to her surmises than to those of any other person they had such a prompting desire to hear their own voices that not a minute escaped without a question or a conjecture both volubly and quite audibly expressed the interjections too were somewhat numerous as the guesses were crude and absurd one said it was a vessel with despatches from livorno possibly with his eccellenza on board but she was reminded that leghorn lay to the north and not to the west another thought it was a cargo of priests going from corsica to rome but she was told that priests were not in sufficient favor just then in france to get a vessel so obviously superior to the ordinary craft of the mediterranean to carry them about while a third more imaginative than either ventured to doubt whether it was a vessel at all deceptive appearances of this sort not being of rare occurrence and usually taking the aspect of something out of the ordinary way  si said annina but that would be a miracle maria and why should we have a miracle now that lent and most of the holidays are past i believe it is a real vessel  the others laughed and after a good deal of eager chattering on the subject it was quite generally admitted that the stranger was a bona fide craft of some species or another though all agreed she was not a felucca a bombarda or a sparanara all this time ghita was thoughtful and silent quite as much so indeed as tommaso himself though from a very different motive nothwithstanding all the gossip and the many ludicrous opinions of her companions her eyes scarcely turned an instant from the lugger on which they seemed to be riveted by a sort of fascination had there been one there sufficiently unoccupied to observe this interesting girl he might have been struck with the varying expression of a countenance that was teeming with sensibility and which too often reflected the passing emotions of its mistresss mind now an expression of anxiety and even of alarm would have been detected by such an observer if acute enough to separate these emotions in the liveliness of sentiment from the more vulgar feelings of her companions and now something like gleamings of delight and happiness flashed across her eloquent countenance the color came and went often and there was an instant during which the lugger varied her course hauling to the wind and then falling off again like a dolphin at its sports when the radiance of the pleasure that glowed about her soft blue eyes rendered the girl perfectly beautiful but none of these passing expressions were noticed by the garrulous group around the stranger female who was left very much to the indulgence of the impulses that gave them birth unquestioned and altogether unsuspected  although the cluster of girls had with feminine sensitiveness gathered a little apart from the general crowd there were but a few yards between the spot where it stood and that occupied by maso so that when the latter spoke an attentive listener among the former might hear his words this was an office that tonti did not choose to undertake however until he was questioned by the podest√† vito viti who now appeared on the hill in person puffing like a whale that rises to breathe from the vigor of his ascent  what dost thou make of her good maso demanded the magistrate after he had examined the stranger himself some time in silence feeling authorized in virtue of his office to question whom he pleased  signore it is a lugger was the brief and certainly the accurate reply  aye a lugger we all understand that neighbor tonti but what sort of a lugger there are feluccaluggers and polacreluggers and bombardaluggers and all sorts of luggers which sort of lugger is this  signor podest√† this is not the language of the port we call a felucca a felucca a bombarda a bombarda a polacre a polacre and a lugger a lugger this is therefore a lugger  maso spoke authoritatively for he felt that he was now not out of his depth and it was grateful to him to let the public know how much better he understood all these matters than a magistrate on the other hand the podest√† was nettled and disappointed into the bargain for he really imagined he was drawing nice distinctions much as it was his wont to do in legal proceedings and it was his ambition to be thought to know something of everything  well tonti answered signor viti in a protecting manner and with an affable smile as this is not an affair that is likely to go to the higher courts at florence your explanations may be taken as sufficient and i have no wish to disturb thema lugger is a lugger  si signore that is just what we say in the port a lugger is a lugger  and yonder strange craft you maintain and at need are ready to swear is a lugger  now maso seeing no necessity for any oath in the affair and being always somewhat conscientious in such matters whenever the customhouse officers did not hold the book was a little startled at this suggestion and he took another and a long look at the stranger before he answered  si signore he replied after satisfying his mind once more through his eyes i will swear that the stranger yonder is a lugger  and canst thou add honest tonti of what nation the nation is of as much moment in these troubled times as the rig  you say truly signor podest√† for if an algerine or a moor or even a frenchman he will be an unwelcome visitor in the canal of elba there are many different signs about him that sometimes make me think he belongs to one people and then to another and i crave your pardon if i ask a little leisure to let him draw nearer before i give a positive opinion  as this request was reasonable no objection was raised the podest√† turned aside and observing ghita who had visited his niece and of whose intelligence he entertained a favorable opinion he drew nearer to the girl determined to lose a moment in dignified trifling  honest maso poor fellow is sadly puzzled he observed smiling benevolently as if in pity for the pilots embarrassment he wishes to persuade us that the strange craft yonder is a lugger though he cannot himself say to what country she belongs  it is a lugger signore returned the girl drawing a long breath as if relieved by hearing the sound of her own voice  how dost thou pretend to be so skilled in vessels as to distinguish these particulars at the distance of a league  i do not think it a league signorenot more than half a league and the distance lessens fast though the wind is so light as for knowing a lugger from a felucca it is as easy as to know a house from a church or one of the reverend padri in the streets from a mariner  aye so i would have told maso on the spot had the obstinate old fellow been inclined to hear me the distance is just about what you say and nothing is easier than to see that the stranger is a lugger as to the nation  that may not be so easily told signore unless the vessel show us her nag  by san antonio thou art right child and it is fitting she should show us her flag nothing has a right to approach so near the port of his imperial and royal highness that does not show its flag thereby declaring its honest purpose and its nation my friends are the guns in the battery loaded as usual  the answer being in the affirmative there was a hurried consultation among some of the principal men in the crowd and then the podest√† walked toward the governmenthouse with an important air in five minutes soldiers were seen in the batteries and preparations were made for levelling an eighteenpounder in the direction of the stranger most of the females turned aside and stopped their ears the battery being within a hundred yards of the spot where they stood but ghita with a face that was pale certainly though with an eye that was steady and without the least indications of fear as respected herself intensely watched every movement when it was evident the artillerists were about to fire anxiety induced her to break silence  they surely will not aim at the lugger she exclaimed that cannot be necessary signor podest√† to make the stranger hoist his flag never have i seen that done in the south  you are unacquainted with our tuscan bombardiers signorina answered the magistrate with a bland smile and an exulting gesture it is well for europe that the grand duchy is so small since such troops might prove even more troublesome than the french  ghita however paid no attention to this touch of provincial pride but pressing her hands on her heart she stood like a statue of suspense while the men in the battery executed their duty in a minute the match was applied and the gun was discharged though all her companions uttered invocations to the saints and other exclamations and some even crouched to the earth in terror ghita the most delicate of any in appearance and with more real sensibility than all united expressed in her face stood firm and erect the flash and the explosion evidently had no effect on her not an artillerist among them was less unmoved in frame at the report than this slight girl she even imitated the manner of the soldiers by turning to watch the flight of the shot though she clasped her hands as she did so and appeared to wait the result with trembling the few seconds of suspense were soon past when the ball was seen to strike the water fully a quarter of a mile astern of the lugger and to skip along the placid sea for twice that distance further when it sank to the bottom by its own gravity  santa maria be praised murmured the girl a smile half pleasure half irony lighting her face as unconsciously to herself she spoke these tuscan artillerists are no fatal marksmen  that was most dexterously done bella ghita exclaimed the magistrate removing his two hands from his ears that was amazingly well aimed another such shot as far ahead with a third fairly between the two and the stranger will learn to respect the rights of tuscany what sayst thou now honest masowill this lugger tell us her country or will she further brave our power  if wise she will hoist her ensign and yet i see no signs of preparations for such an act  sure enough the stranger though quite within effective range of shot from the heights showed no disposition to gratify the curiosity or to appease the apprehensions of those in the town two or three of her people were visible in her rigging but even these did not hasten their work or in any manner seem deranged at the salutation they had just received after a few minutes however the lugger jibed her mainsail and then hauled up a little so as to look more toward the headland as if disposed to steer for the bay by doubling the promontory this movement caused the artillerists to suspend their own and the lugger had fairly come within a mile of the cliffs ere she lazily turned aside again and shaped her course once more in the direction of the entrance of the canal this drew another shot which effectually justified the magistrates eulogy for it certainly flew as much ahead of the stranger as the first had flown astern  there signore cried ghita eagerly as she turned to the magistrate they are about to hoist their ensign for now they know your wishes the soldiers surely will not fire again  that would be in the teeth of the law of nations signorina and a blot on tuscan civilization ah you perceive the artillerists are aware of what you say and are putting aside their tools cospetto tis a thousand pities too they couldnt fire the third shot that you might see it strike the lugger as yet you have only beheld their preparations  it is enough signor podest√† returned ghita smiling for she could smile now that she saw the soldiers intended no further mischief we have all heard of your elba gunners and what i have seen convinces me of what they can do when there is occasion look signore the lugger is about to satisfy our curiosity  sure enough the stranger saw fit to comply with the usages of nations it has been said already that the lugger was coming down before the wind wingandwing or with a sail expanded to the air on each side of her hull a disposition of the canvas that gives to the felucca and to the lugger in particular the most picturesque of all their graceful attitudes unlike the narrowheaded sails that a want of hands has introduced among ourselves these foreign we might almost say classical mariners send forth their long pointed yards aloft confining the width below by the necessary limits of the sheet making up for the difference in elevation by the greater breadth of their canvas the idea of the feluccas sails in particular would seem to have been literally taken from the wing of the large seafowl the shape so nearly corresponding that with the canvas spread in the manner just mentioned one of those light craft has a very close resemblance to the gull or the hawk as it poises itself in the air or is sweeping down upon its prey the lugger has less of the beauty that adorns a picture perhaps than the strictly latine rig but it approaches so near it as to be always pleasing to the eye and in the particular evolution described is scarcely less attractive to the seaman however it brings with it an air of greater service being a mode of carrying canvas that will buffet with the heaviest gales or the roughest seas while it appears so pleasant to the eye in the blandest airs and smoothest water  the lugger that was now beneath the heights of elba had three masts though sails were spread only on the two that were forward the third mast was stepped on the taffrail it was small and carried a little sail that in english is termed a jigger its principal use being to press the bows of the craft up to the wind when closehauled and render her what is termed weatherly on the present occasion there could scarcely be said to be anything deserving the name of wind though ghita felt her cheek which was warmed with the rich blood of her country fanned by an air so gentle that occasionally it blew aside tresses that seemed to vie with the floss silk of her native land had the natural ringlets been less light however so gentle a respiration of the sea air could scarcely have disturbed them but the lugger had her lightest duck spreadreserving the heavier canvas for the stormsand it opened like the folds of a balloon even before these gentle impulses occasionally collapsing it is true as the groundswell swung the yards to and fro but on the whole standing out and receiving the air as if guided more by volition than any mechanical power the effect on the hull was almost magical for notwithstanding the nearly imperceptible force of the propelling power owing to the lightness and exquisite mould of the craft it served to urge her through the water at the rate of some three or four knots in the hour or quite as fast as an ordinarily active man is apt to walk her motion was nearly unobservable to all on board and might rather be termed gliding than sailing the ripple under her cutwater not much exceeding that which is made by the finger as it is moved swiftly through the element still the slightest variation of the helm changed her course and this so easily and gracefully as to render her deviations and inclinations like those of the duck in her present situation too the jigger which was brailed and hung festooned from its light yard ready for use should occasion suddenly demand it added singularly to the smart air which everything wore about this craft giving her in the seamans eyes that particularly knowing and suspicious look which had awakened masos distrust  the preparations to show the ensign which caught the quick and understanding glance of ghita and which had not escaped even the duller vision of the artillerists were made at the outer end of this jiggeryard a boy appeared on the taffrail and he was evidently clearing the ensignhalyards for that purpose in half a minute however he disappeared then a flag rose steadily and by a continued pull to its station at first the bunting hung suspended in a line so as to evade all examination but as if everything on board this light craft were on a scale as airy and buoyant as herself the folds soon expanded showing a white field traversed at right angles with a red cross and having a union of the same tint in its upper and inner corner  inglese exclaimed maso infinitely aided in this conjecture by the sight of the strangers ensignsi signore it is an englishman i thought so from the first but as the lugger is not a common rig for vessels of that nation i did not like to risk anything by saying it  well honest tommaso it is a happiness to have a mariner as skilful as yourself in these troublesome times at ones elbow i do not know how else we should ever have found out the strangers country an inglese corpo di bacco who would have thought that a nation so maritime and which lies so far off would send so small a craft this vast distance why ghita it is a voyage from elba to livorno and yet i dare say england is twenty times further  signore i know little of england but i have heard that it lies beyond our own sea this is the flag of the country however for that have i often beheld many ships of that nation come upon the coast further south  yes it is a great country for mariners though they tell me it has neither wine nor oil they are allies of the emperor too and deadly enemies of the french who have done so much harm in upper italy that is something ghita and every italian should honor the flag i fear the stranger does not intend to enter our harbor  he steers as if he did not certainly signor podest√† said ghita sighing so gently that the respiration was audible only to herself perhaps he is in search of some of the french of which they say so many were seen last year going east  aye that was truly an enterprise answered the magistrate gesticulating on a large scale and opening his eyes by way of accompaniments general bonaparte he who had been playing the devil in the milanese and the states of the pope for the last two years sailed they sent us word with two or three hundred ships the saints at first knew whither some said it was to destroy the holy sepulchre some to overturn the grand turk and some thought to seize the islands there was a craft in here the same week which said he had got possession of the island of malta in which case we might look out for trouble in elba i had my suspicions from the first  all this i heard at the time signore and my uncle probably could tell you morehow we all felt at the tidings  well that is all over now and the french are in egypt your uncle ghita has gone upon the main i hear this was said inquiringly and it was intended to be said carelessly but the podest√† could not prevent a glance of suspicion from accompanying the question  signore i believe he has but i know little of his affairs the time has come however when i ought to expect him see eccellenza a title that never failed to mollify the magistrate and turn his attention from others entirely to himself the lugger really appears disposed to look into your bay if not actually to enter it  this sufficed to change the discourse nor was it said altogether without reason the lugger which by this time had passed the western promontory actually appearing disposed to do as ghita conjectured she jibed her mainsailbrought both sheets of canvas on her larboard side and luffed a little so as to cause her head to look toward the opposite side of the bay instead of standing on as before in the direction of the canal this change in the luggers course produced a general movement in the crowd which began to quit the heights hastening to descend the terraced streets in order to reach the haven maso and the podest√† led the van in this descent and the girls with ghita in their midst followed with equal curiosity but with eager steps by the time the throng was assembled on the quays in the streets on the decks of feluccas or at other points that commanded the view the stranger was seen gliding past in the centre of the wide and deep bay with his jigger hauled out and his sheets aft looking up nearly into the winds eye if that could be called wind which was still little more than the sighing of the classical zephyr his motion was necessarily slow but it continued light easy and graceful after passing the entrance of the port a mile or more he tacked and looked up toward the haven by this time however he had got so near in to the western cliffs that their lee deprived him of all air and after keeping his canvas open half an hour in the little roads it was all suddenly drawn to the yards and the lugger anchored    chapter ii        his stock a few french phrases got by heart      with much to learn but nothing to impart      the youth obedient to his sires commands      sets off a wanderer into foreign lands       cowper  it was now nearly dark and the crowd having satisfied its idle curiosity began slowly to disperse the signor viti remained till the last conceiving it to be his duty to be on the alert in such troubled times but with all his bustling activity it escaped his vigilance and means of observation to detect the circumstance that the stranger while he steered into the bay with so much confidence had contrived to bring up at a point where not a single gun from the batteries could be brought to bear on him while his own shot had he been disposed to hostilities would have completely raked the little haven but vito viti though so enthusiastic an admirer of the art was no gunner himself and little liked to dwell on the effect of shot except as it applied to others and not at all to himself  of all the suspicious apprehensive and curious who had been collected in and about the port since it was known the lugger intended to come into the bay ghita and maso alone remained on watch after the vessel was anchored a loud hail had been given by those intrusted with the execution of the quarantine laws the great physical bugbear and moral mystification of the mediterranean and the questions put had been answered in a way to satisfy all scruples for the moment the from whence came ye asked however in an italian idiom had been answered by inghilterra touching at lisbon and gibraltar all regions beyond distrust as to the plague and all happening at that moment to give clean bills of health but the name of the craft herself had been given in a way to puzzle all the proficients in saxon english that porto ferrajo could produce it had been distinctly enough pronounced by some one on board and at the request of the quarantine department had been three times slowly repeated very much after the following form viz  come chiamate il vostro bastimento  the wingandwing  come  the wingandwing  a long pause during which the officials put their heads together first to compare the sounds of each with those of his companions ears and then to inquire of one who professed to understand english but whose knowledge was such as is generally met with in a linguist of a littlefrequented port the meaning of the term  vingyving growled this functionary not a little puzzled what ze devil sort of name is zat ask zem again  come si chiama la vostra barca signori inglesi repeated he who hailed  diable growled one back in french she is called ze wingandwingala e ala giving a very literal translation of the name in italian  ala e ala repeated they of the quarantine first looking at each other in surprise and then laughing though in a perplexed and doubtful manner vingyving  this passed just as the lugger anchored and the crowd had begun to disperse it caused some merriment and it was soon spread in the little town that a craft had just arrived from inghilterra whose name in the dialect of that island was vingyving which meant ala e ala in italian a cognomen that struck the listeners as sufficiently absurd in confirmation of the fact however the lugger hoisted a small square flag at the end of her mainyard on which were painted or wrought two large wings as they are sometimes delineated in heraldry with the beak of a galley between them giving the whole conceit something very like the appearance that the human imagination has assigned to those heavenly beings cherubs this emblem seemed to satisfy the minds of the observers who were too much accustomed to the images of art not to obtain some tolerably distinct notions in the end of what ala e ala meant  but maso as has been said remained after the rest had departed to their homes and their suppers as did ghita the pilot for such was tontis usual appellation in consequence of his familiarity with the coast and his being principally employed to direct the navigation of the different craft in which he served kept his station on board a felucca to which he belonged watching the movements of the lugger while the girl had taken her stand on the quay in a position that better became her sex since it removed her from immediate contact with the rough spirits of the port while it enabled her to see what occurred about the wingandwing more than half an hour elapsed however before there were any signs of an intention to land but by the time it was dark a boat was ready and it was seen making its way to the common stairs where one or two of the regular officials were ready to receive it  it is unnecessary to dwell on the forms of the pratique officers these troublesome persons had their lanterns and were vigilant in examining papers as is customary but it would seem the mariner in the boat had everything en r√®gle for he was soon suffered to land at this instant ghita passed near the group and took a close and keen survey of the strangers form and face her own person being so enveloped in a mantle as to render a recognition of it difficult if not impossible the girl seemed satisfied with this scrutiny for she immediately disappeared not so with maso who by this time had hurried round from the felucca and was at the stairs in season to say a word to the stranger  signore said the pilot his eccellenza the podest√† has bidden me say to you that he expects the honor of your company at his house which stands so near us hard by here in the principle street as will make it only a pleasure to go there i know he would be disappointed if he failed of the happiness of seeing you  his excellenza is a man not to be disappointed returned the stranger in very good italian and five minutes shall prove to him how eager i am to salute him then turning to the crew of his boat he ordered them to return on board the lugger and not to fail to look out for the signal by which he might call them ashore  maso as he led the way to the dwelling of vito viti would fain ask a few questions in the hope of appeasing certain doubts that beset him  since when signor capitano he inquired have you english taken to sailing luggers it is a novel rig for one of your craft  corpo di bacco answered the other laughing friend of mine if you can tell the precise day when brandy and laces were first smuggled from france into my country i will answer your question i think you have never navigated as far north as the bay of biscay and our english channel or you would know that a guernseyman is better acquainted with the rig of a lugger than with that of a ship  guernsey is a country i never heard of answered maso simply is it like hollandor more like lisbon  very little of either guernsey is a country that was once french and where many of the people still speak the french language but of which the english have been masters this many an age it is an island subject to king george but which is still half gallic in names and usages this is the reason why we like the lugger better than the cutter which is a more english rig  maso was silent for if true the answer at once removed many misgivings he had seen so much about the strange craft which struck him as french that doubts of her character obtruded but if her captains account could only be substantiated there was an end of distrust what could be more natural than the circumstance that a vessel fitted out in an island of french origin should betray some of the peculiarities of the people who built her  the podest√† was at home in expectation of this visit and maso was first admitted to a private conference leaving the stranger in an outer room during this brief conference the pilot communicated all he had to sayboth his suspicions and the seeming solution of the difficulties and then he took his leave after receiving the boon of a paul vito viti now joined his guest but it was so dark lights not having yet been introduced that neither could distinguish the others countenance  signor capitano observed the magistrate the deputygovernor is at his residence on the hill and he will expect me to do him the favor to bring you thither that he may do you the honors of the port  this was said so civilly and was in itself both so reasonable and so much in conformity with usage that the other had not a word to say against it together then they left the house and proceeded toward the governmentdwellinga building which has since become celebrated as having been the residence of a soldier who came so near subjugating europe vito viti was a short pursy man and he took his time to ascend the stairsresembling street but his companion stepped from terrace to terrace with an ease and activity that of themselves would have declared him to be young had not this been made apparent by his general bearing and his mien as seen through the obscurity  andrea barrofaldi the vicegovernatore was a very different sort of person from his friend the podest√† although little more acquainted with the world by practice the vicegovernatore was deeply read in books owing his situation in short to the circumstance of his having written several clever works of no great reputation certainly for genius but which were useful in their way and manifested scholarship it is very seldom that a man of mere letters is qualified for public life and yet there is an affectation in all governments most especially in those which care little for literature in general of considering some professions of respect for it necessary to their own characters andrea barrofaldi had been inducted into his present office without even the sentimental profession of never having asked for it the situation had been given to him by the fossombrone of his day without a word having been said in the journals of tuscany of his doubts about accepting it and everything passed as things are apt to pass when there are true simplicity and good faith at the bottom without pretension or comment he had now been ten years in office and had got to be exceedingly expert in discharging all the ordinary functions of his post which he certainly did with zeal and fidelity still he did not desert his beloved books and quite √†propos of the matter about to come before him the signor barrofaldi had just finished a severe profound and extensive course of study in geography  the stranger was left in the antechamber while vito viti entered an inner room and had a short communication with his friend the vicegovernatore as soon as this was ended the former returned and ushered his companion into the presence of the substitute for the grand duke as this was the sailors first appearance within the influence of a light sufficiently strong to enable the podest√† to examine his person both he and andrea barrofaldi turned their eyes on him with lively curiosity the instant the rays of a strong lamp enabled them to scrutinize his appearance neither was disappointed in one sense at least the countenance figure and mien of the mariner much more than equalling his expectations  the stranger was a man of sixandtwenty who stood five feet ten in his stockings and whose frame was the very figure of activity united to a muscle that gave very fair indications of strength he was attired in an undress naval uniform which he wore with a smart air that one who understood these matters more by means of experience and less by means of books than andrea barrofaldi would at once have detected did not belong to the manly simplicity of the english wardrobe nor were his features in the slightest degree those of one of the islanders the outline being beautifully classical more especially about the mouth and chin while the cheeks were colorless and the skin swarthy his eye too was black as jet and his cheek was half covered in whiskers of a hue dark as the ravens wing his face as a whole was singularly beautifulfor handsome is a word not strong enough to express all the character that was conveyed by a conformation that might be supposed to have been copied from some antique medal more especially when illuminated by a smile that at times rendered the whole countenance almost as bewitching as that of a lovely woman there was nothing effeminate in the appearance of the young stranger notwithstanding his manly though sweet voice wellknit frame and firm look affording every pledge of resolution and spirit  both the vicegovernatore and the podest√† were struck with the unusual personal advantages and smart air of the stranger and each stood looking at him half a minute in silence after the usual salutations had passed and before the party were seated then as the three took chairs on a motion from signor barrofaldi the latter opened the discourse  they tell me that we have the honor to receive into our little haven a vessel of inghilterra signor capitano observed the vicegovernatore earnestly regarding the other through his spectacles as he spoke and that too in a manner not altogether free from distrust  signer vicegovernatore such is the flag under which i have the honor to serve returned the mariner  you are an inglese yourself i trust signor capitanowhat name shall i enter in my book here  jaques smeet answered the other betraying what might have proved two very fatal shibboleths in the ears of those who were practised in the finesse of our very unmusical language by attempting to say jack smith  jaques smeet repeated the vicegovernatorethat is giacomo in our italian  nonosignore hastily interrupted captain smeet not jaqueomo but jaquesgiovanni turned into jaques by the aid of a little salt water  ahi begin to understand you signore you english have this usage in your language though you have softened the word a little in mercy to our ears but we italians are not afraid of such sounds and i know the namegiac smeetil capitano giac smeeti have long suspected my english master of ignorance for he was merely one of our leghorn pilots who has sailed in a bastimento de guerra of your countryhe called your honorable name smees signore  he was very wrong signor vicegovernatore answered the other clearing his throat by a slight effort we always call our family smeet  and the name of your lugger signor capitano smeet suspending his pen over the paper in expectation of the answer  ze vingandving pronouncing the ws in a very different way from what they had been sounded in answering the hails  ze vingyving repeated signor barrofaldi writing the name in a manner to show it was not the first time he had heard it ze vingyving that is a poetical appellation signor capitano may i presume to ask what it signifies  ala e ala in your italian mister vicegovernatore when a craft like mine has a sail spread on each side resembling a bird we say in english that she marches vingandving  andrea barrofaldi mused in silence near a minute during this interval he was thinking of the improbability of any but a bon√¢fide englishmans dreaming of giving a vessel an appellation so thoroughly idiomatic and was fast mystifying himself as so often happens by tyros in any particular branch of knowledge by his own critical acumen then he half whispered a conjecture on the subject to vito viti influenced quite as much by a desire to show his neighbor his own readiness in such matters as by any other feeling the podest√† was less struck by the distinction than his superior but as became one of his limited means he did not venture an objection  signor capitano resumed andrea barrofaldi since when have you english adopted the rig of the lugger it is an unusual craft for so great a naval nation they tell me  bah i see how it is signor vicegovernatoreyou suspect me of being a frenchman or a spaniard or something else than i claim to be on this head however you may set your heart at rest and put full faith in what i tell you my name is capitaine jaques smeet my vessel is ze vingandving and my service that of the king of england  is your craft then a kings vessel or does she sail with the commission of a corsair  do i look like a corsair signor demanded le capitaine smeet with an offended air i have reason to feel myself injured by so unworthy an imputation  your pardon signor capitano smeesbut our duty is a very delicate one on this unprotected island in times as troubled as these in which we live it has been stated to me as coming from the most experienced pilot of our haven that your lugger has not altogether the appearance of a vessel of the inglese while she has many that belong to the corsairs of france and a prudent caution imposes on me the office of making certain of your nation once assured of that it will be the delight of the elbans to prove how much we honor and esteem our illustrious allies  this is so reasonable and so much according to what i do myself when i meet a stranger at sea cried the captain stretching forth both arms in a frank and inviting manner that none but a knave would object to it pursue your own course signor vicegovernatore and satisfy all your scruples in your own manner how shall this be donewill you go on board ze vingandving and look for yourselfsend this honorable magistrate or shall i show you my commission here is the last altogether at your service and that of his imperial highness the grand duke  i flatter myself with having sufficient knowledge of inghilterra signor capitano though it be by means of books to discover an impostor could i believe you capable of appearing in so unworthy a character and that too in a very brief conversation we bookworms added andrea barrofaldi with a glance of triumph at his neighbor for he now expected to give the podest√† an illustration of the practical benefits of general learning a subject that had often been discussed between them we bookworms can manage these trifles in our own way and if you will consent to enter into a short dialogue on the subject of england her habits language and laws this question will be speedily put at rest  you have me at command and nothing would delight me more than to chat for a few minutes about that little island it is not large signore and is doubtless of little worth but as my country it is much in my eyes  this is natural and now signor capitano added andrea glancing at the podest√† to make sure that he was listening will you have the goodness to explain to me what sort of a government this inghilterra possesseswhether monarchy aristocracy or democracy  pestethat is not so easily answered there is a king and yet there are powerful lords and a democracy too that sometimes gives trouble enough your question might puzzle a philosopher signor vicegovernatore  this may be true enough neighbor vito viti for the constitution of inghilterra is an instrument of many strings your answer convinces me you have thought on the subject of your government capitano and i honor a reflecting man in all situations in life what is the religion of the country  corpo di bacco that is harder to answer than all the rest we have as many religions in england as we have people it is true the law says one thing on this head but then the men women and children say another nothing has troubled me more than this same matter of religion  ah you sailors do not disquiet your souls with such thoughts if the truth must be said well we will be indulgent on this subjectthough out of doubt you and all your people are luterani  set us down as what you please answered the captain with an ironical smile our fathers at any rate were all good catholics once but seamanship and the altar are the best of friends living quite independent of each other  that i will answer for it is much the same here caro vito viti though our mariners do burn so many lamps and offer up so many aves  your pardon signor vicegovernatore interrupted the signor smeet with a little earnestness this is the great mistake of your seamen in general did they pray less and look to their duties more their voyages would be shorter and the profits more certain  scandalous exclaimed the podest√† in hotter zeal than it was usual for him to betray  nay worthy vito viti it is even so interrupted the deputy with a wave of the hand that was as authoritative as the concession was liberal and indicative of a spirit enlightened by study the fact must be conceded there is the fable of hercules and the wagoner to confirm it did our men first strive and then pray more would be done than by first praying and then striving and now signor capitano a word on your language of which i have some small knowledge and which doubtless you speak like a native  sairtainlee answered the captain with perfect selfcomposure changing the form of speech from the italian to the english with a readiness that proved how strong he felt himself on this point one cannot fail to speak ze tongue of his own muzzair  this was said without any confusion of manner and with an accent that might very well mislead a foreigner and it sounded imposing to the vicegovernatore who felt a secret consciousness that he could not have uttered such a sentence to save his own life without venturing out of his depth therefore he pursued the discourse in italian  your language signore observed andrea barrofaldi with warmth is no doubt a very noble one for the language in which shakespeare and milton wrote cannot be else but you will permit me to say that it has a uniformity of sound with words of different letters that i find as unreasonable as it is embarrassing to a foreigner  i have heard such complaints before answered the captain not at all sorry to find the examination which had proved so awkward to himself likely to be transferred to a language about which he cared not at all and have little to say in its defence but as an example of what you mean  why signore here are several words that i have written on this bit of paper which sound nearly alike though as you perceive they are quite differently spelled bix bax box bux and bocks continued andrea endeavoring to pronounce big bag bog bug and box all of which it seemed to him had a very close family resemblance in sound though certainly spelled with different letters these are words signore that are enough to drive a foreigner to abandon your tongue in despair  indeed they are and i often told the person who taught me the language  how did you not learn your own tongue as we all get our native forms of speech by ear when a child demanded the vicegovernatore his suspicions suddenly revived  without question signore but i speak of books and of learning to read when big bag bog bug and box reading from the paper in a steady voice and a very tolerable pronunciation first came before me i felt all the embarrassment of which you speak  and did you only pronounce these words when first taught to read them  this question was awkward to answer but vito viti began to weary of a discourse in which he could take no part and most opportunely he interposed an objection of his own  signor barrofaldi he said stick to the lugger all our motives of suspicion came from tommaso tonti and all of his from the rig of signor smees vessel if the lugger can be explained what do we care about bixy buxy boxy  the vicegovernatore was not sorry to get creditably out of the difficulties of the language and smiling on his friend he made a gentle bow of compliance then he reflected a moment in order to plan another mode of proceeding and pursued the inquiry  my neighbor vito viti is right he said and we will stick to the lugger tommaso tonti is a mariner of experience and the oldest pilot of elba he tells us that the lugger is a craft much in use among the french and not at all among the english so far as he has ever witnessed  in that tommaso tonti is no seaman many luggers are to be found among the english though more certainly among the french but i have already given the signor viti to understand that there is such an island as guernsey which was once french but which is now english and that accounts for the appearances he has observed we are guernseymenthe lugger is from guernseyand no doubt we have a guernsey look this is being half french i allow  that alters the matter altogether neighbor viti this is all true about the island and about its habits and its origin and if one could be as certain about the names why nothing more need be said are giac smees and vingyving guernsey names  they are not particularly so returned the sailor with difficulty refraining from laughing in the vicegovernatores face jaques smeet being so english that we are the largest family perhaps in all inghilterra half the nobles of the island are called smeet and not a few are named jaques but little guernsey was conquered and our ancestors who performed that office brought their names with them signore as for vingandving it is capital english  i do not see vito but this is reasonable if the capitano now only had his commission with him you and i might go to bed in peace and sleep till morning  here then signore are your sleeping potions continued the laughing sailor drawing from his pocket several papers these are my orders from the admiral and as they are not secret you can cast your eyes over them this is my commission signor vicegovernatorethis is the signature of the english minister of marineand here is my own jaques smeet as you see and here is the order to me as a lieutenant to take command of the vingandving  all the orders and names were there certainly written in a clear fair hand and in perfectly good english the only thing that one who understood the language would have been apt to advert to was the circumstance that the words which the sailor pronounced jaques smeet were written plainly enough jack smithan innovation on the common practice which to own the truth had proceeded from his own obstinacy and had been done in the very teeth of the objections of the scribe who forged the papers but andrea was still too little of an english scholar to understand the blunder and the jack passed with him quite as currently as would john edward or any other appellation as to the wingandwing all was right though as the words were pointed out and pronounced by both parties one pertinaciously insisted on calling them vingandving and the other vingyving all this evidence had a great tendency toward smoothing down every difficulty and maso tontis objections were pretty nearly forgotten by both the italians when the papers were returned to their proper owner  it was an improbable thing that an enemy or a corsair would venture into this haven of ours vito viti said the vicegovernatore in a selfapproving manner we have a reputation for being vigilant and for knowing our business as well as the authorities of livorno or genova or napoli  and that too signore with nothing in the world to gain but hard knocks and a prison added the captain smeet with one of his most winning smilesa smile that even softened the heart of the podest√† while it so far warmed that of his superior as to induce him to invite the stranger to share his own frugal supper the invitation was accepted as frankly as it had been given and the table being ready in an adjoining room in a few minutes il capitano smees and vito viti were sharing the vicegovernatores evening meal  from that moment if distrust existed any longer in the breasts of the two functionaries of porto ferrajo it was so effectually smothered as to be known only to themselves the light fare of an italian kitchen and the light wines of tuscany just served to strengthen the system and enliven the spirits the conversation becoming general and lively us the business of the moment proceeded at that day tea was known throughout southern europe as an ingredient only for the apothecarys keeping nor was it often to be found among his stores and the convives used as a substitute large draughts of the pleasant mountain liquors of the adjacent main which produced an excitement scarcely greater while it may be questioned if it did as much injury to the health the stranger however both ate and drank sparingly for while he affected to join cordially in the discourse and the business of restoration he greatly desired to be at liberty to pursue his own designs  andrea barrofaldi did not let so excellent an opportunity to show his acquirements to the podest√† go by neglected he talked much of england its history its religion government laws climate and industry making frequent appeals to the capitano smees for the truth of his opinions in most cases the parties agreed surprisingly for the stranger started with a deliberate intention to assent to everything but even this compliant temper had its embarrassments since the vicegovernatore so put his interrogatories as occasionally to give to acquiescence the appearance of dissent the other floundered through his difficulties tolerably well notwithstanding and so successful was he in particular in flattering andreas selflove by expressions of astonishment that a foreigner should understand his own country so wellbetter indeed in many respects than he understood it himselfand that he should be so familiar with its habits institutions and geography that by the time the flask was emptied the superior functionary whispered to his inferior that the stranger manifested so much information and good sense he should not be surprised if he turned out in the long run to be some secret agent of the british government employed to make philosophical inquiries as to the trade and navigation of italy with a view to improve the business relations between the two countries  you are an admirer of nobility and a devotee of aristocracy added andrea barrofaldi in pursuit of the subject then in hand if the truth were known a scion of some noble house yourself signor  ipestei hate an aristocrat signor vicegovernatore as i do the devil  this was said just after the freest draught the stranger had taken and with an unguarded warmth that he himself immediately regretted  this is extraordinary in an inglese ahi see how it isyou are in the opposizione and find it necessary to say this it is most extraordinary good vito viti that these inglese are divided into two political castes that contradict each other in everything if one maintains that an object is white the other side swears it is black and so vice vers√¢ both parties profess to love their country better than anything else but the one that is out of power abuses even power itself until it falls into its own hands  this is so much like giorgio grondis course toward me signore that i could almost swear he was one of these very opposizione i never approve of a thing that he does not condemn or condemn that he does not approve do you confess this much signor capitano  il vicegovernatore knows us better than we know ourselves i fear there is too much truth in his account of our politics but signori rising from his chair i now crave your permission to look at your town and to return to my vessel the darkness has come and discipline must be observed  as andrea barrofaldi had pretty well exhausted his stores of knowledge no opposition was made and returning his thanks the stranger took his departure leaving the two functionaries to discuss his appearance and character over the remainder of the flask    chapter iii       theres jonathan that lucky lad      who knows it from the root sir      he sucks in all thats to be had      and always trades for boot sir       14763d verse of yankee doodle  il capitano smeet was not sorry to get out of the government housepalazzo as some of the simple people of elba called the unambitious dwelling he had been well badgered by the persevering erudition of the vicegovernatore and stored as he was with nautical anecdotes and a tolerable personal acquaintance with sundry seaports for any expected occasion of this sort he had never anticipated a conversation which would aspire as high as the institutions religion and laws of his adopted country had the worthy andrea heard the numberless maledictions that the stranger muttered between his teeth as he left the house it would have shocked all his sensibilities if it did not revive his suspicions  it was now night but a starry calm voluptuous evening such as are familiar to those who are acquainted with the mediterranean and its shores there was scarcely a breath of wind though the cool air that appeared to be a gentle respiration of the sea induced a few idlers still to linger on the heights where there was a considerable extent of land that might serve for a promenade along this walk the mariner proceeded undetermined for the moment what to do next he had scarcely got into the open space however before a female with her form closely enveloped in a mantle brushed near him anxiously gazing into his face her motions were too quick and sudden for him to obtain a look in return but perceiving that she held her way along the heights beyond the spot most frequented by the idlers he followed until she stopped  ghita said the young man in a tone of delight when he had got near enough to the female to recognize a face and form she no longer attempted to conceal this is being fortunate indeed and saves a vast deal of trouble a thousand thousand thanks dearest ghita for this one act of kindness i might have brought trouble on you as well as on myself in striving to find your residence  it is for that reason raoul that i have ventured so much more than is becoming in my sex to meet you a thousand eyes in this gossiping little town are on your lugger at this moment and be certain they will also be on its captain as soon as it is known he has landed i fear you do not know for what you and your people are suspected at this very instant  for nothing discreditable i hope dear ghita if it be only not to dishonor your friends  many think and say you are frenchmen and that the english flag is only a disguise  if that be all we must bear the infamy answered raoul yvard laughing why this is just what we are to a man a single american excepted who is an excellent fellow to make out british commissions and help us to a little english when harder pushed than common and why should we be offended if the good inhabitants of porto ferrajo take us for what we are  not offended raoul but endangered if the vicegovernatore gets this notion he will order the batteries to fire upon you and will destroy you as an enemy  not he ghita he is too fond of le capitaine smeet to do so cruel a thing and then he must shift all his guns before they will hurt le feufollet where she lies i never leave my little jackolantern1 within reach of an enemys hand look here ghita you can see her through this opening in the housesthat dark spot on the bay thereand you will perceive no gun from any battery in porto ferrajo can as much as frighten much less harm her  1 the english of feu follet  i know her position raoul and understand why you anchored in that spot i knew or thought i knew you from the first moment you came in plain sight and so long as you remained outside i was not sorry to look on so old a friendnay i will go further and say i rejoiced for it seemed to me you passed so near the island just to let some whom you knew to be on it understand you had not forgotten them but when you came into the bay i thought you mad  mad i should have been dearest ghita had i lived longer without seeing you what are these mis√©rables of elbans that i should fear them they have no cruiseronly a few feluccasall of which are not worth the trouble of burning let them but point a finger at us and we will tow their austrian polacre out into the bay and burn her before their eyes le feufollet deserves her name she is here there and everywhere before her enemies suspect her  but her enemies suspect her now and you cannot be too cautious my heart was in my throat a dozen times while the batteries were firing at you this evening  and what harm did they they cost the grand duke two cartridges and two shot without even changing the luggers course you have seen too much of these things ghita to be alarmed by smoke and noise  i have seen enough of these things raoul to know that a heavy shot fired from these heights would have gone through your little feufollet and coming out under water would have sunk you to the bottom of the mediterranean  we should have had our boats then answered raoul yvard with an indifference that was not affected for reckless daring was his vice rather than his virtue besides a shot must first hit before it can harm as the fish must be taken before it can be cooked but enough of this ghita i get quite enough of shot and ships and sinkings in everyday life and now i have at last found this blessed moment we will not throw away the opportunity by talking of such matters  nay raoul i can think of nothing else and therefore can talk of nothing else suppose the vicegovernatore should suddenly take it into his head to send a party of soldiers to le feufollet with orders to seize herwhat would then be your situation  let him and i would send a boats crew to his palazzo herethe conversation was in french which ghita spoke fluently though with an italian accentand take him on a cruise after the english and his beloved austrians bahthe idea will not cross his constitutional brain and there is little use in talking about it in the morning i will send my prime minister mon barras mon carnot mon cambac√©r√®s mon ithuel bolt to converse with him on politics and religion  religion repeated ghita in a saddened tone the less you say on that holy subject raoul the better i shall like it and the better it will be for yourself in the end the state of your country makes your want of religion matter of regret rather than of accusation but it is none the less a dreadful evil  well then resumed the sailor who felt he had touched a dangerous ground we will talk of other things even supposing we are taken what great evil have we to apprehend we are honest corsairs duly commissioned and acting under the protection of the french republic one and undivided and can but be made prisoners of war that is a fortune which has once befallen me and no greater calamity followed than my having to call myself le capitaine smeet and finding out the means of mystifying le vicegovernatore  ghita laughed in spite of the fears she entertained for it was one of the most powerful of the agencies the sailor employed in making others converts to his opinions to cause them to sympathize with his lighthearted gayety whether it suited their natural temperaments or not she knew that raoul had already been a prisoner in england two years where as he often said himself he stayed just long enough to acquire a very respectable acquaintance with the language if not with the institutions manners and religion when he made his escape aided by the american called ithuel bolt an impressed seaman of our own republic who fully entering into all the plans imagined by his more enterprising friend and fellowsufferer had cheerfully enlisted in the execution of his future schemes of revenge states like powerful individuals in private life usually feel themselves too strong to allow any considerations of the direct consequences of departures from the right to influence their policy and a nation is apt to fancy its power of such a character as to despise all worldly amends while its moral responsibility is divided among too many to make it a matter of much concern to its particular citizens nevertheless the truth will show that none are so low but they may become dangerous to the highest and even powerful communities seldom fail to meet with their punishment for every departure from justice it would seem indeed that a principle pervades nature which renders it impossible for man to escape the consequences of his own evil deeds even in this life as if god had decreed the universal predominance of truth and the neverfailing downfall of falsehood from the beginning the success of wrong being ever temporary while the triumph of the right is eternal to apply these consoling considerations to the matter more immediately before us the practice of impressment in its day raised a feeling among the seamen of other nations as well as in fact among those of great britain herself that probably has had as much effect in destroying the prestige of her nautical invincibility supported as was that prestige by a vast existing force as any other one cause whatever it was necessary to witness the feeling of hatred and resentment that was raised by the practice of this despotic power more especially among those who felt that their foreign birth ought at least to have insured them immunity from the abuse in order fully to appreciate what might so readily become its consequences ithuel bolt the seaman just mentioned was a proof in a small way of the harm that even an insignificant individual can effect when his mind is fully and wholly bent on revenge ghita knew him well and although she little liked either his character or his appearance she had often been obliged to smile at the narrative of the deceptions he practised on the english and of the thousand low inventions he had devised to do them injury she was not slow now to imagine that his agency had not been trifling in carrying on the present fraud  you do not openly call your lugger le feufollet raoul she answered after a minutes pause that would be a dangerous name to utter even in porto ferrajo it is not a week since i heard a mariner dwelling on her misdeeds and the reasons that all good italians have to detest her it is fortunate the man is away or he could not fail to know you  of that i am not so certain ghita we alter our paint often and at need can alter our rig you may be certain however that we hide our jackolantern and sail under another name the lugger now she is in the english service is called the vingandving  i heard the answer given to the hail from the shore but it sounded different from this  nonvingandving ithuel answered for us and you may be sure he can speak his own tongue vingandving is the word and he pronounces it as i do  vingyving repeated ghita in her pretty italian tones dropping naturally into the vicegovernatores fault of pronunciationit is an odd name and i like it less than feufollet  i wish dearest ghita i could persuade you to like the name of yvard rejoined the young man in a halfreproachful halftender manner and i should care nothing for any other you accuse me of disrespect for priests but no son could ever kneel to a father for his blessing half so readily or half so devoutly as i could kneel with thee before any friar in italy to receive that nuptial benediction which i have so often asked at your hand but which you have so constantly and so cruelly refused  i am afraid the name would not then be feufollet but ghitafolie said the girl laughing though she felt a bitter pang at the heart that cost her an effort to control no more of this now raoul we may be observed and watched it is necessary that we separate  a hurried conversation of more interest to the young couple themselves than it would prove to the reader though it might not have been wholly without the latter but which it would be premature to relate now followed when ghita left raoul on the hill insisting that she knew the town too well to have any apprehensions about threading its narrow and steep streets at any hour by herself this much in sooth must be said in favor of andrea barrofaldis administration of justice he had made it safe for the gentle the feeble and the poor equally to move about the island by day or by night it seldom happening that so great an enemy to peace and tranquillity appeared among his simple dependants as was the fact at this precise moment  in the mean time there was not quite as much tranquillity in porto ferrajo as the profound silence which reigned in the place might have induced a stranger to imagine tommaso tonti was a man of influence within his sphere as well as the vicegovernatore and having parted from vito viti as has been related he sought the little clientelle  of padroni and piloti who were in the habit of listening to his opinions as if they were oracles the usual place of resort of this set after dark was a certain house kept by a widow of the name of benedetta galopo the uses of which were plainly enough indicated by a small bush that hung dangling from a short pole fastened above the door if benedetta knew anything of the proverb that good wine needs no bush she had not sufficient faith in the contents of her own casks to trust to their reputation for this bush of hers was as regularly renewed as its withering leaves required indeed it was a common remark among her customers that her bush was always as fresh as her face and that the latter was one of the most comely that was to be met with on the island a circumstance that aided much indifferent wine in finding a market benedetta bore a reasonably good name nevertheless though it was oftener felt perhaps than said that she was a confirmed coquette she tolerated maso principally on two accounts because if he were old and unattractive in his own person many of his followers were among the smartest seamen of the port and because he not only drank his full proportion but paid with punctuality these inducements rendered the pilot always a welcome guest at la santa maria degli venti as the house was called though it had no other sign than the oftenrenewed bush already mentioned  at the very moment then when raoul yvard and ghita parted on the hill maso was seated in his usual place at the table in benedettas upper room the windows of which commanded as full a view of the lugger as the hour permitted that craft being anchored about a cables length distant and as a sailor might have expressed it just abeam on this occasion he had selected the upper room and but three companions because it was his wish that as few should enter into his counsels as at all comported with the love of homage to his own experience the party had been assembled a quarter of an hour and there had been time to cause the tide to ebb materially in the flask which it may be well to tell the reader at once contained very little less than half a gallon of liquor such as it was  i have told it all to the podest√† said maso with an important manner as he put down his glass after potation the second which quite equalled potation the first in quantity yes i have told it all to vito viti and no doubt he has told it to il signor vicegovernatore who now knows as much about the whole matter as either of us four cospettoto think such a thing dare happen in a haven like porto ferrajo had it come to pass over on the other side of the island at porto longone one wouldnt think so much of it for they are never much on the lookout but to take place here in the very capital of elba i should as soon have expected it in livorno  but maso put in daniele bruno in the manner of one who was a little sceptical i have often seen the pavilion of the inglese and this is as much like that which all their frigates and corvettes wear as one of our feluccas is like another the flag at least is right  what signifies a flag daniele when a french hand can hoist an english ensign as easily as the king of inghilterra himself if that lugger was not built by the francese you were not built by an italian father and mother but i should not think so much of the hull for that may have been captured as the english take many of their enemies on the high seas but look at the rigging and sailssanta maria i could go to the shop of the very sailmaker in marseilles who made that foresail his name is pierre benoit and a very good workman he is as all will allow who have had occasion to employ him  this particularity greatly aided the argument common minds being seldom above yielding to the circumstances which are so often made to corroborate imaginary facts tommaso tonti though so near the truth as to his main pointthe character of the visitorwas singularly out as to the sail notwithstanding le feufollet having been built equipped and manned at nantes and pierre benoit never having seen her or her foresail either but it mattered not in the way of discussion and assertion one sailmaker being as good as another provided he was french  and have you mentioned t his to the podest√† inquired benedetta who stood with the empty flask in her hand listening to the discourse i should think that sail would open his eyes  i cannot say i have but then i told him so many other things more to the point that he cannot do less than believe this when he hears it signor viti promised to meet me here after he has had a conversation with the vicegovernatore and we may now expect him every minute  il signor podest√† will be welcome said benedetta wiping off a spare table and bustling round the room to make things look a little smarter than they ordinarily did he may frequent grander winehouses than this but he will hardly find better liquor  poverinadont think that the podest√† comes here on any such errand he comes to meet me answered maso with an indulgent smile he takes his wine too often on the heights to wish to come as low as this after a glass friends of mine amigi mii there is wine up at that house that when the oil is once out of the neck of the flask2 goes down a mans throat as smoothly as if it were all oil itself i could drink a flask of it without once stopping to take breath it is that liquor which makes the nobles so light and airy  2 it is a practice in tuscany to put a few drops of oil in the neck of each flask of the more delicate wines to exclude the air  i know the washy stuff put in benedetta with more warmth than she was used to betray to her customers well may you call it smooth a good spring running near each of the winepresses that have made it i have seen some of it that even oil would not float on  this assertion was a fair counterpoise to that of the sail being about as true but benedetta had too much experience in the inconstancy of men not to be aware that if the three or four customers who were present should seriously take up the notion that the island contained any better liquor than that she habitually placed before them her value might be sensibly diminished in their eyes as became a woman who had to struggle singly with the world too her native shrewdness taught her that the best moment to refute a calumny was to stop it as soon as it began to circulate and her answer was as warm in manner as it was positive in terms this was an excellent opening for an animated discussion and one would have been very likely to occur had there not fortunately been steps heard without that induced maso to expect the podest√† sure enough the door opened and vito viti appeared followed to the astonishment of all the guests and to the absolute awe of benedetta by the vicegovernatore himself  the solution of this unexpected visit is very easily given after the departure of the capitano smees vito viti returned to the subject of masos suspicions and by suggesting certain little circumstances in the mariners manner that he had noted during the interview he so far succeeded in making an impression on himself that in the end his own distrust revived and with it that of the deputygovernor neither however could be said to be more than uneasy and the podest√† happening to mention his appointment with the pilot andrea determined to accompany him in order to reconnoitre the strange craft in person both the functionaries wore their cloaks by no means an unusual thing in the cool night air of the coast even in midsummer which served them for all the disguise that circumstances required  il signor vicegovernatore almost gasped benedetta dusting a chair and then the table and disposing the former near the latter by a sort of mechanical process as if only one errand could ever bring a guest within her doors your eccellenza is most welcome and it is an honor i could oftener ask we are humble people down here at the water side but i hope we are just as good christians as if we lived upon the hill  doubt it not worthy bettina  my name is benedetta at your eccellenzas commandbenedittina if it please the vicegovernatore but not bettina we think much of our names down here at the water side eccellenza  let it be so then good benedetta and i make no doubt you are excellent christiansa flask of your wine if it be convenient  the woman dropped a curtsey that was full of gratitude and the glance of triumph that she cast at her other guests may be said to have terminated the discussion that was about to commence as the dignitaries appeared it disposed of the question of the wine at once and for ever silenced cavilling if the vicegovernatore could drink her liquor what mariner would henceforth dare calumniate it  eccellenza with a thousand welcomes benedetta continued as she placed the flask on the table after having carefully removed the cotton and the oil with her own plump hand this being one of half a dozen flasks of really sound wellflavored tuscan liquor that she kept for especial occasions as she well might the cost being only a paul or ten cents for near half a gallon eccellenza a million times welcome this is an honor that dont befall the santa maria degli venti more than once in a century and you too signor podest√† once before only have you ever had leisure to darken my poor door  we bachelorsthe podest√† as well as the vicegovernor belonged to the fraternitywe bachelors are afraid to trust ourselves too often in the company of a sprightly widow like yourself whose beauty has rather improved than lessened by a few years  this brought a coquettish answer during which time andrea barrofaldi having first satisfied himself that the wine might be swallowed with impunity was occupied in surveying the party of silent and humble mariners who were seated at the other table his object was to ascertain how far he might have committed himself by appearing in such a place when his visit could not well be attributed to more than one motive maso he knew as the oldest pilot of the place and he had also some knowledge of daniele bruno but the three other seamen were strangers to him  inquire if we are among friends here and worthy subjects of the grand duke all observed andrea to vito viti in a low voice  thou hearest maso observed the podest√† canst thou answer for all of thy companions  every one of them signore this is daniele bruno whose father was killed in a battle with the algerines and whose mother was the daughter of a mariner as well known in elba as  never mind the particulars tommaso tonti interrupted the vicegovernatoreit is sufficient that thou knowest all thy companions to be honest men and faithful servants of the sovrano you all know most probably the errand which has brought the signor viti and myself to this house tonight  the men looked at each other as the illinstructed are apt to do when it becomes necessary to answer a question that concerns many assisting the workings of their minds as it might be with the aid of the senses and then daniele bruno took on himself the office of spokesman  signore vostro eccellenza we think we do answered the man our fellow maso here has given us to understand that he suspects the inglese that is anchored in the bay to be no inglese at all but either a pirate or a frenchman the blessed maria preserve us but in these troubled times it does not make much difference which  i will not say as much as that friendfor one would be an outcast among all people while the other would have the rights which shield the servants of civilized nations returned the scrupulous and justminded functionary the time was when his imperial majesty the emperor and his illustrious brother our sovereign the grand duke did not allow that the republican government of france was a lawful government but the fortune of war removed his scruples and a treaty of peace has allowed the contrary since the late alliance it is our duty to consider all frenchmen as enemies though it by no means follows that we are to consider them as pirates  but their corsairs seize all our craft signore and treat their people as if they were no better than dogs then they tell me that they are not christiansno not even luterani or heretics  that religion does not flourish among them is true answered andrea who loved so well to discourse on such subjects that he would have stopped to reason on religion or manners with the beggar to whom he gave a pittance did he only meet with encouragement but it is not as bad in france on this important head as it has been and we may hope that there will be further improvement in due time  but signor vicegovernatore put in maso these people have treated the holy father and his states in a way that one would not treat an infidel or a turk  aye that is it signori observed benedettaa poor woman cannot go to mass without having her mind disturbed by the thoughts of the wrongs done the head of the church had these things come from luterani it might have been borne but they say the francese were once all good catholics  so were the luterani bella benedetta to their chief schismatic and leader the german monk himself  this piece of information caused great surprise even the podest√† himself turning an inquiring glance at his superior as much as to acknowledge his own wonder that a protestant should ever have been anything but a protestantor rather a lutheran anything but a lutheranthe word protestant being too significant to be in favor among those who deny there were any just grounds for a protest at all that luther had ever been a romanist was perfectly wonderful even in the eyes of vito viti  signore you would hardly mislead these honest people in a matter as grave as this exclaimed the podest√†  i do but tell you truth and one of these days you shall hear the whole story neighbor viti tis worth an hour of leisure to any man and is very consoling and useful to a christian but whom have you below benedettai hear steps on the stairs and wish not to be seen  the widow stepped promptly forward to meet her new guests and to show them into a commoner room below stairs when her movement was anticipated by the doors opening and a mans standing on the threshold it was now too late to prevent the intrusion and a little surprise at the appearance of the newcomer held all mute and observant for a minute  the person who had followed his ears and thus reached the sanctum sanctorum of benedetta was no other than ithuel bolt the american seaman already named in the earlier part of this chapter he was backed by a genoese who had come in the double capacity of interpreter and boon companion that the reader may the better understand the character he has to deal with however it may be necessary to digress by giving a short account of the history appearance and peculiarities of the former individual  ithuel bolt was a native of what in this great union is called the granite state notwithstanding he was not absolutely made of the stone in question there was an absence of the ordinary symptoms of natural feeling about him that had induced many of his french acquaintances in particular to affirm that there was a good deal more of marble in his moral temperament at least than usually fell to the lot of human beings he had the outline of a good frame but it was miserably deficient in the filling up the bone predominated the sinews came next in consideration nor was the man without a proper share of muscle but this last was so disposed of as to present nothing but angles whichever way he was viewed even his thumbs and fingers were nearer square than round and his very neck which was bare though a black silk kerchief was tied loosely round the throat had a sort of pentagon look about it that defied all symmetry or grace his stature was just six feet and an inch when he straightened himself as he did from time to time seemingly with a desire to relieve a very inveterate stoop in his shoulders though it was an inch or two less in the position he most affected his hair was dark and his skin had got several coats of confirmed brown on it by exposure though originally rather fair while the features were good the forehead being broad and full and the mouth positively handsome this singular countenance was illuminated by two keen restless whitish eyes that resembled not spots on the sun but rather suns on a spot  ithuel had gone through all the ordinary vicissitudes of an american life beneath those pursuits which are commonly thought to be confined to the class of gentlemen he had been farmers boy printers devil schoolmaster stagedriver and tinpedlar before he ever saw the sea in the way of what he called chores too he had practised all the known devices of rustic domestic economy having assisted even in the washing and housecleaning besides having passed the evenings of an entire winter in making brooms  ithuel had reached his thirtieth year before he dreamed of going to sea an accident then put preferment in this form before his eyes and he engaged as the mate of a small coaster for his very first voyage fortunately the master never found out his deficiencies for ithuel had a selfpossessed confident way with him that prevented discovery until they were outside of the port from which they sailed when the former was knocked overboard by the main boom and drowned most men so circumstanced would have returned but bolt never laid his hand to the plough and looked back besides one course was quite easy to him as another whatever he undertook he usually completed in some fashion or other though it were often much better had it never been attempted fortunately it was summer the wind was fair and the crew wanted little ordering and as it was quite a matter of course to steer in the right direction until the schooner was carried safely into her proper port she arrived safely her people swearing that the new mate was the easiest and cleverest officer they had ever sailed with and well they might for ithuel took care not to issue an order until he had heard it suggested in terms by one of the hands and then he never failed to repeat it word for word as if it were a suggestion of his own as for the reputation of cleverest officer which he so easily obtained it will be understood of course that the term was used in the provincial signification that is so common in the part of the world from which ithuel came he was clever in this sense precisely in proportion as he was ignorant his success on this occasion gained him friends and he was immediately sent out again as the regular master of the craft in which he had so unexpectedly received his promotion he now threw all the duty on the mate but so ready was he in acquiring that by the end of six months he was a much better sailor than most europeans would have made in three years as the pitcher that goes too often to the well is finally broken so did ithuel meet with shipwreck at last in consequence of gross ignorance on the subject of navigation this induced him to try a long voyage in a more subordinate situation until in the course of time he was impressed by the commander of an english frigate who had lost so many of his men by the yellow fever that he seized upon all he could lay his hands on to supply their places even ithuel being acceptable in such a strait    chapter iv       the ship is here put in      a veronese michael cassio      lieutenant to the warlike moor othello      is come on shore       othello  the glance which ithuel cast around him was brief but comprehensive he saw that two of the party in the room were much superior to the other four and that the last were common mediterranean mariners the position which benedetta occupied in the household could not be mistaken for she proclaimed herself its mistress by her very air whether it were in the upper or in the lower room  vino said ithuel with a flourish of the hand to help along his italian this and one or two more being the only words of the language he ventured to use directly or without calling in the assistance of his interpreter vinovino vino signora  si si si signore answered benedetta laughing and this with her meaning eyes so keenly riveted on the person of her new guest as to make it very questionable whether she were amused by anything but his appearance your eccellenza shall be served but whether at a paul or a halfpaul the flask depends on your own pleasure we keep wine at both prices and glancing toward the table of andrea barrofaldi usually serve the first to signori of rank and distinction  what does the woman say growled ithuel to his interpreter a genoese who from having served several years in the british navy spoke english with a very tolerable facility you know what we want and just tell her to hand it over and i will fork out her st paul without more words what a desperate liking your folks have for saints philipofor so ithuel pronounced filippo the name of his companionwhat a desperate liking your folks have for saints philipo that they must even call their money after them  it not so in america signor bolto asked the genoese after he had explained his wishes to benedetta in italian it no ze fashion in your country to honor ze saints  honor the saints repeated ithuel looking curiously round him as he took a seat at a third table shoving aside the glasses at the same time and otherwise disposing of everything within reach of his hand so as to suit his own notions of order and then leaning back on his chair until the two ends of the uprights dug into the plaster behind him while the legs on which the fabric was poised cracked with his weight honor the saints we should be much more like to dishonor them what does any one want to honor a saint for a saint is but a humana man like you and me after all the fuss you make about em saints abound in my country if youd believe peoples account of themselves  not quite so signor bolto you and me no great saint italian honor saint because he holy and good  by this time ithuel had got his two feet on the round of his seat his knees spread so as to occupy as much space as an unusual length of leg would permit and his arms extended on the tops of two chairs one on each side of him in a way to resemble what is termed a spread eagle  andrea barrofaldi regarded all this with wonder it is true he expected to meet with no great refinement in a winehouse like that of benedetta but he was unaccustomed to see such nonchalance of manner in a man of the strangers class or indeed of any class the italian mariners present occupying their chairs in simple and respectful attitudes as if each man had the wish to be as little obtrusive as possible still he let no sign of his surprise escape him noting all that passed in a grave but attentive silence perhaps he saw traces of national peculiarities if not of national history in the circumstances  honor saint because he holy and good said ithuel with a very illconcealed disdainwhy that is the very reason why we dont honor em when you honor a holy man mankind may consait you do it on that very account and so fall into the notion you worship him which would be idolatry the awfullest of all sins and the one to which every raal christian gives the widest bairth i would rather worship this flask of wine any day than worship the best saint on your parsons books  as filippo was no casuist but merely a believer and ithuel applied the end of the flask to his mouth at that moment from an old habit of drinking out of jugs and bottles the genoese made no answer keeping his eyes on the flask which by the length of time it remained at the others mouth appeared to be in great danger of being exhausted a matter of some moment to one of his own relish for the liquor  do you call this wine exclaimed ithuel when he stopped literally to take breath there isnt as much true granite in a gallon ont as in a pint of our cider i could swallow a butt and then walk a plank as narrow as your religion philipo  this was said nevertheless with a look of happiness which proved how much the inward man was consoled by what it had received and a richness of expression about the handsome mouth that denoted a sort of consciousness that it had been the channel of a most agreeable communication to the stomach sooth to say benedetta had brought up a flask at a paul or at about four cents a bottle a flask of the very quality which she had put before the vicegovernatore and this was a liquor that flowed so smoothly over the palate and of a quality so really delicate that ithuel was by no means aware of the potency of the guest which he had admitted to his interior  all this time the vicegovernatore was making up his mind concerning the nation and character of the stranger that he should mistake bolt for an englishman was natural enough and the fact had an influence in again unsettling his opinion as to the real flag under which the lugger sailed like most italians of that day he regarded all the families of the northern hordes as a species of barbariansan opinion that the air and deportment of ithuel had no direct agency in changing for while this singular being was not brawlingly rude and vulgar like the coarser set of his own countrymen with whom he had occasionally been brought in contact he was so manifestly uncivilized in many material points as to put his claim to gentility much beyond a cavil and that in a negative way  you are a genoese said andrea to filippo speaking with the authority of one who had a right to question  signore i am at your eccellenzas orders though in foreign service at this present moment  in what service friend i am in authority here in elba and ask no more than is my duty  eccellenza i can well believe this answered filippo rising and making a respectful salutation and one too that was without any of the awkwardness of the same act in a more northern man as it is to be seen in your appearance i am now in the service of the king of england  filippo said this steadily though his eyes dropped to the floor under the searching scrutiny they endured the answer of the vicegovernatore was delivered coolly though it was much to the point  you are happy he said in getting so honorable masters more especially as your own country has again fallen into the hands of the french every italian heart must yearn for a government that has its existence and its motives on this side of the alps  signore we are a republic today and ever have been you know  ayesuch as it is but your companion speaks no italianhe is an inglese  no signorean americano a sort of an inglese and yet no inglese after all he loves england very little if i can judge by his discourse  un americano repeated andrea barrofaldi americano exclaimed vito viti americano said each of the marines in succession every eye turning with lively curiosity toward the subject of the discourse who bore it all with appropriate steadiness and dignity the reader is not to be surprised that an american was then regarded with curiosity in a country like italy for two years later when an american ship of war anchored suddenly before the town of constantinople and announced her nation the authorities of the sublime porte were ignorant that such a country existed it is true leghorn was beginning to be much frequented by american ships in the year 1799 but even with these evidences before their eyes the people of the very ports into which these traders entered were accustomed to consider their crews a species of englishmen who managed to sail the vessels for the negroes at home3 in a word two centuries and a half of national existence and more than half a century of national independence have not yet sufficed to teach all the inhabitants of the old world that the great modern republic is peopled by men of a european origin and possessing white skins even of those who are aware of the fact the larger proportion perhaps have obtained their information through works of a light character similar to this of our own rather than by the more legitimate course of regular study and a knowledge of history  3 as recently as 1828 the author of this book was at leghorn the delaware so had just left there and speaking of her appearance to a native of the place who supposed the writer to be an englishman the latter observed of course her people were all blacks i thought so too signore until i went on board the ship was the answer but they are as white as you and i are  si repeated ithuel with emphasis as soon as he heard his nationality thus alluded to and found all eyes on himselfsi oon americanoim not ashamed of my country and if youre any way particlar in such matters i come from new hampshireor what we call the granite state tell em this philipo and let me know their idees in answer  filippo translated this speech as well as he could as he did the reply and it may as well be stated here once for all that in the dialogue which succeeded the instrumentality of this interpreter was necessary that the parties might understand each other the reader will therefore give filippo credit for this arrangement although we shall furnish the different speeches very much as if the parties fully comprehended what was said  uno stato di granito repeated the vicegovernatore looking at the podest√† with some doubt in the expression of his countenanceit must be a painful existence which these poor people endure to toil for their food in such a region ask him good filippo if they have any wine in his part of the world  wine echoed ithuel tell the signore that we shouldnt call this stuff wine at all nothing goes down our throats that doesnt rasp like a file and burn like a chip of vesuvius i wish now we had a drink of new england rum here in order to show him the difference i despise the man who thinks all his own things the best just because theyre hisn but taste is taste ater all and theres no denying it  perhaps the signor americano can give us an insight into the religion of his countryor are the americani pagans i do not remember vito to have read anything of the religion of that quarter of the world  religion toowell a question like this now would make a stir among our folks in new hampshire look here signore we dont call your ceremonies and images and robes and ringing of bells and bowing and scraping a religion at all any more than we should call this smooth liquor wine  ithuel was more under the influence of this smooth liquor than he was aware of or he would not have been so loud in the expression of his dissent as experience had taught him the necessity of reserve on such subjects in most catholic communities but of all this the signor barrofaldi was ignorant and he made his answer with the severity of a good catholic though it was with the temper of a gentleman  what the americano calls our ceremonies and images and ringing of bells are probably not understood by him he said since a country as little civilized as his own cannot very well comprehend the mysteries of a profound and ancient religion  civilized i calculate that it would stump this part of the world to produce such a civilization as our very youngest children are brought up on but its of no use talking and so we will drink  andrea perceiving indeed that there was not much use in talking more especially as filippo had been a good deal mystified by the word stump was now disposed to abandon the idea of a dissertation on religion manners and laws to come at once to the matter that brought him into the present company  this americano is also a servant of the english king it would seem he carelessly remarked i remember to have heard that there was a war between his country and that of the inglesi in which the french assisted the americani to obtain a sort of national independence what that independence is i do not know but it is probable that the people of the new world are still obliged to find mariners to serve in the navy of their former masters  ithuels muscles twitched and an expression of intense bitterness darkened his countenance then he smiled in a sort of derision and gave vent to his feelings in words  perhaps youre right signore perhaps this is the raal truth of the matter for the british do take our people just the same as if they had the best right in the world to em after all we may be serving our masters and all we say and think at home about independence is just a flash in the pan notwithstanding some on us contrive by hook or by crook to take our revenge when occasion offers and if i dont sarve master john bull an ill turn whenever luck throws a chance in my way may i never see a bit of the old state againgranite or rotten wood  this speech was not very closely translated but enough was said to awaken curiosity in the vicegovernatore who thought it odd one who served among the english should entertain such feelings toward them as for ithuel himself he had not observed his usual caution but unknown to himself the oily wine had more granite in it than he imagined and then he seldom spoke of the abuse of impressment without losing more or less of his ordinary selfcommand  ask the americano when he first entered into the service of the king of inghilterra said andrea and why he stays in it if it is unpleasant to him when so many opportunities of quitting it offer  i never entered returned ithuel taking the word in its technical meaning they pressed me as if i had been a dog they wanted to turn a spit and kept me seven long years fighting their accursed battles and otherwise sarving their eends i was over here last year at the mouth of the nile and in that pretty bit of workand off cape st vincent tooand in a dozen more of their battles and sorely against my will on every account this was hard to be borne but the hardest of it has not yet been said nor do i know that i shall tell ont at all  anything the americano may think proper to relate will be listened to with pleasure  ithuel was a good deal undecided whether to go on or not but taking a fresh pull at the flask it warmed his feelings to the sticking point  why it was adding insult to injury its bad enough to injure a man but when it comes to insulting him into the bargain there must be but little grit in his natur if it dont strike fire  and yet few are wronged who are not calumniated observed the philosophical vicegovernatore this is only too much the case with our italy worthy neighbor vito viti  i calculate the english treat all mankind alike whether its in italy or ameriky for so ithuel would pronounce this word notwithstanding he had now been cruising in and near the mediterranean several years but what i found hardest to be borne was their running their rigs on me about my language and ways which they were all the time laughing at as yankee conversation and usages while they pretended that the body out of which all on it come was an english body and so they set it up to be shot at by any of their inimies that might happen to be jogging along our road then squire it is generally consaited among us in ameriky that we speak much the best english agoing and sure am i that none on us call a hog an og an anchor a hanchor or a horse an orse what is thought of that matter in this part of the world signor squire  we are not critics in your language but it is reasonable to suppose that the english speak their own tongue better than any other people that much must be conceded to them at least signor bolto  i shall acknowledge no such advantage as belonging to them i have not been to school for nothing not i the english call clerk clark and cucumber cowcumber and angel aingel and no reasoning can convince me thats right ive got a string of words of this sort that they pronounce out of all reason thats as long as a pair of leadinglines or a ships tillerrope you must know signor squire i kept school in the early part of my life  non e possible exclaimed the vicegovernatore astonishment actually getting the better of his habitual good breeding you must mean signor americano that you gave lessons in the art of rigging and sailing luggers  you never was more mistaken signore i taught on the general system all sorts of things in the edication way and had one of my scholars made such a blunder as to say clark or aingel or harth or cowcumber he wouldnt have heard the last of it for that week at least but i despise an englishman from the very bottom of my soul for heart isnt deep enough for my feelings  absurd as ithuels critical dissertations must appear to all who have any familiarity with real english they were not greatly below many criticisms on the same subject that often illustrate the ephemeral literature of the country and in his last speech he had made a provincial use of the word despise that is getting to be so common as almost to supplant the true signification by despising ithuel meant that he hated the passion perhaps of all others the most removed from the feeling described by the word he had used inasmuch as it is not easy to elevate those for whom we have a contempt to the level necessary to be hated  notwithstanding the inglese are not a despicable people answered andrea who was obliged to take the stranger literally since he knew nothing of his provincial use of terms for a nation of the north they have done marvellous things of late years especially on the ocean  this was more than ithuel could bear all his personal wrongs and sooth to say they had been of a most grievous nature arose before his mind incited and inflamed by national dislike and he broke out into such an incoherent tirade of abuse as completely set all filippos knowledge of english at fault rendering a translation impossible by this time ithuel had swallowed so much of the wine a liquor which had far more body than he supposed that he was ripe for mischief and it was only his extreme violence that prevented him from betraying more than just at the moment would have been prudent the vicegovernatore listened with attention in the hope of catching something useful but it all came to his ears a confused mass of incoherent vituperation from which he could extract nothing the scene consequently soon became unpleasant and andrea barrofaldi took measures to put an end to it watching a favorable occasion to speak he put in a word as the excited bolt paused an instant to take breath  signore observed the vicegovernatore all this may be very true but as coming from one who serves the inglese to one who is the servant of their ally the grand duke of tuscany it is quite as extraordinary as it is uncalled for and we will talk of other things this lugger on board which you sail is out of all question english notwithstanding what you tell us of the nation  aye she is english answered ithuel with a grim smile and a pretty boat she is but then it is no fault of hers and what cant be cured must be endured a guernsey craft and a desperate goer when she wakes up and puts on her travelling boots  these mariners have a language of their own remarked andrea to vito viti smiling as in consideration of ithuels nautical habits to you and me the idea of a vessels using boots neighbor seems ridiculous but the seamen in their imaginations bestow all sorts of objects on them it is curious to hear them converse good vito and now i am dwelling here on our island i have often thought of collecting a number of their images in order to aid in illustrating the sort of literature that belongs to their calling this idea of a luggers putting on her boots is quite heroic  now vito viti though an italian with so musical a name was no poet but a man so very literal withal as to render him exceedingly matter of fact in most of his notions accordingly he saw no particular beauty in the idea of a vessels wearing boots and though much accustomed to defer to the vicegovernatores superior knowledge and more extensive reading he had the courage on this occasion to put in an objection to the probability of the circumstance mentioned  signor vicegovernatore he replied all is not gold that glitters fine words sometimes cover poor thoughts and i take it this is an instance of what i mean long as i have lived in porto ferrajo and that is now quite fifty years seeing that i was born here and have been off the island but four times in my lifeand long therefore as i have lived here i never saw a vessel in the harbor that wore boots or even shoes  this is metaphorical good vito and must be looked at in a poetical point of view homer speaks of goddesses holding shields before their favorite warriors while ariosto makes rats and asses hold discourse together as if they were members of an academy all this is merely the effect of imagination signore and he who has the most is the aptest at inventing circumstances which though not strictly true are vastly agreeable  as for homer and ariosto signor vicegovernatore i doubt if either ever saw a vessel with a boot on or if either ever knew as much about craft in general as we who live here in porto ferrajo harkee friend filippo just ask this americano if in his country he ever saw vessels wear boots put the question plainly and without any of your accursed poetry  filippo did as desired leaving ithuel to put his own construction on the object of the inquiry all that had just passed being sealed to him in consequence of its having been uttered in good tuscan  boots repeated the native of the granite state looking round him drolly perhaps not exactly the footpart and the soles for they ought in reason to be under water but every vessel that isnt coppered shows her boottopof them ill swear ive seen ten thousand more or less  this answer mystified the vicegovernatore and completely puzzled vito viti the grave mariners at the other table too thought it odd for in no other tongue is the language of the sea as poetical or figurative as in the english and the term of boottop as applied to a vessel was greek to them as well as to the other listeners they conversed among themselves on the subject while their two superiors were holding a secret conference on the other side of the room giving the american time to rally his recollection and remember the precise circumstances in which not only he himself but all his shipmates were placed no one could be more wily and ingenious than this man when on his guard though the inextinguishable hatred with which he regarded england and englishmen had come so near causing him to betray a secret which it was extremely important at that moment to conceal at length a general silence prevailed the different groups of speakers ceasing to converse and all looking towards the vicegovernatore as if in expectation that he was about to suggest something that might give a turn to the discourse nor was this a mistake for after inquiring of benedetta if she had a private room he invited ithuel and the interpreter to follow him into it leading the way attended by the podest√† as soon as these four were thus separated from the others the door was closed and the two tuscans came at once to the point  signor americano commenced the vicegovernatore between those who understand each other there is little need of many words this is a language which is comprehended all over the world and i put it before you in the plainest manner that we may have no mistake  it is tolerable plain sartain exclaimed ithueltwofoursixeighttenall goodlooking gold pieces that in this part of the world you call zecchinior sequins as we name em in english what have i done signor squire or what am i to do for these twenty dollars name your tarms this working in the dark is agin the grain of my natur  you are to tell the truth we suspect the lugger of being french and by putting the proof in our hands you will make us your friends and serve yourself  andrea barrofaldi knew little of america and americans but he had imbibed the common european notion that money was the great deity worshipped in this hemisphere and that all he had to do was to offer a bribe in order to purchase a man of ithuels deportment and appearance in his own island ten sequins would buy almost any mariner of the port to do any act short of positive legal criminality and the idea that a barbarian of the west would refuse such a sum in preference to selling his shipmates never crossed his mind little however did the italian understand the american a greater knave than ithuel in his own way it was not easy to find but it shocked all his notions of personal dignity selfrespect and republican virtue to be thus unequivocally offered a bribe and had the lugger not been so awkwardly circumstanced he would have been apt to bring matters to a crisis at once by throwing the gold into the vicegovernatores face although knowing where it was to be found he might have set about devising some means of cheating the owner out of it at the very next instant boon or bribe directly or unequivocally offered in the shape of money as coming from the superior to the inferior or from the corrupter to the corrupted had he never taken and it would have appeared in his eyes a species of degradation to receive the first and of treason to his nationality to accept the last though he would lie invent manage and contrive from morning till night in order to transfer even copper from the pocket of his neighbor to his own under the forms of opinion and usage in a word ithuel as relates to such things is what is commonly called lawhonest with certain broad salvoes in favor of smuggling of all sorts in foreign countries at home he never dreamed of such a thing customhouse oaths and legal trickery and this is just the class of men apt to declaim the loudest against the roguery of the rest of mankind had there been a law giving half to the informer he might not have hesitated to betray the lugger and all she contained more especially in the way of regular business but he had long before determined that every italian was a treacherous rogue and not at all to be trusted like an american rogue and then his indomitable dislike of england would have kept him true in a case of much less complicated risk than this commanding himself however and regarding the sequins with natural longing he answered with a simplicity of manner that both surprised and imposed on the vicegovernatore  nonosignor squire he said in the first place ive no secret to tell and it would be a trickish thing to touch your money and not give you its worth in return and then the lugger is guernsey built and carries a good king georges commission in my part of the world we never take gold unless we sell something of equal valie gifts and begging we look upon as mean and unbecoming and the next thing to going on to the town as a pauper though if i can sarve you lawfully like im just as willing to work for your money as for that of any other man ive no preference for kings in that particlar  all this time ithuel held out the sequins with a show of returning them though in a very reluctant manner leaving andrea who comprehended his actions much better than his words to understand that he declined selling his secret  you can keep the money friend observed the vicegovernatore for when we give in italy it is not our practice to take the gift back again in the morning perhaps you will remember something that it may be useful for me to know  ive no occasion for gifts nor is it exactly accordin to the granite rule to accept em answered ithuel a little sharply handsome conduct is handsome conduct and i call the fellowcreetur that would oppress and overcome another with a gift little better than an english aristocrat hand out the dollars in the way of trade in as large amounts as you will and i will find the man and that too in the lugger who will see you out int to your hearts content harkee philipo tell the gentleman in an undertone like about the three kegs of tobacco we got out of the virginy ship the day we made the north end of corsica and perhaps that will satisfy him we are not his enemies there is no use in bawling it out so that the woman can hear what you say or the men who are drinking in the other room  signor ithuello answered the genoese in english it will not do to let these gentlemen know anything of them kegsone being the deputygovernor and the other a magistrate the lugger will be seized for a smuggler which will be the next thing to being seized for an enemy  yet ive a longing for them ere sequins to tell you the truth philipo i see no other means of getting at em except it be through them three kegs of tobacco  why you dont take em when the signore put em into your very hand all you do is put him in your pocket and say eccellenza what you please to wish  that isnt granite man but more in the natur of you italians the most disgraceful thing on airth is a paupeso ithuel pronounced pauperthe next is a streetbeggar after him comes your chaps who takes sixpences and shillins in the way of small gifts and last of all an englishman all these i despise but let this signore say but the word in the way of trade and hell find me as ready and expairt as he can wish id defy the devil in a trade  filippo shook his head positively declining to do so foolish a thing as to mention a contraband article to those whose duty it would be to punish a violation of the revenue laws in the meanwhile the sequins remained in the hands of andrea barrofaldi who seemed greatly at a loss to understand the character of the strange being whom chance had thus thrown in his way the money was returned to his purse but his distrust and doubts were by no means removed  answer me one thing signor bolto asked the vicegovernatore after a minute of thought if you hate the english so much why do you serve in their ships why not quit them on the first good occasion the land is as wide as the sea and you must be often on it  i calculate signor squire you dont often study charts or you wouldnt fall into such a consait theres twice as much water as solid ground on this airth to begin with as in reason there ought to be seeing that an acre of good productive land is worth five or six of oceans and then you have little knowledge of my character and prospects to ask such a question i sarve the king of england to make him pay well for it if you want to take an advantage of a man first get him in debt then you can work your will on him in the most profitable and safe manner  all this was unintelligible to the vicegovernatore who after a few more questions and answers took a civil leave of the strangers intimating to benedetta that they were not to follow him back into the room he had just quitted  as for ithuel the disappearance of the two gentlemen gave him no concern but as he felt that it might be unsafe to drink any more wine he threw down his reckoning and strolled into the street followed by his companion within an hour from that moment the three kegs of tobacco were in the possession of a shopkeeper of the place that brief interval sufficing to enable the man to make his bargain and to deliver the articles which was his real object on shore this little smuggling transaction was carried on altogether without the knowledge of raoul yvard who was to all intents and purposes the captain of his own lugger and in whose character there were many traits of chivalrous honor mixed up with habits and pursuits that would not seem to promise qualities so elevated but this want of a propensity to turn a penny in his own way was not the only distinguishing characteristic between the commander of the little craft and the being he occasionally used as a mask to his true purposes      chapter v       the great contention of the sea and skies      parted our fellowshipbut hark a sail       cassio  whatever may have been the result of the vicegovernatores further inquiries and speculations that night they were not known after consuming an hour in the lower part of the town in and around the port he and the podest√† sought their homes and their pillows leaving the lugger riding quietly at her anchor in the spot where she was last presented to the readers attention if raoul yvard and ghita had another interview too it was so secretly managed as to escape all observation and can form no part of this narrative  a mediterranean morning at midsummer is one of those balmy and soothing periods of the day that affect the mind as well as the body everywhere we have the mellow and advancing light that precedes the appearance of the sunthe shifting hues of the skythat pearly softness that seems to have been invented to make us love the works of gods hand and the warm glow of the brilliant sun but it is not everywhere that these fascinating changes occur on a sea whose blue vies with the darkest depths of the void of space beneath a climate that is as winning as the scenes it adorns and amid mountains whose faces reflect every varying shade of light with the truth and the poetry of nature such a morning as this last was that which succeeded the night with which our tale opened bringing with it the reviving movements of the port and town italy as a whole is remarkable for an appearance of quiet and repose that are little known in the more bustling scenes of the greedier commerce of our own quarter of the world or indeed in those of most of the northern nations of europe there is in her aspect modes of living and even in her habits of business an air of decayed gentility that is wanting to the ports shops and marts of the more vulgar parts of the world as if conscious of having been so long the focus of human refinement it was unbecoming in these later days to throw aside all traces of her history and power man and the climate too seem in unison one meeting the cares of life with a far niente manner that is singularly in accordance with the dreamy and soothing atmosphere he respires  just as day dawned the fall of a billet of wood on the deck of the feufollet gave the first intimation that any one was stirring in or near the haven if there had been a watch on board that craft throughout the nightand doubtless such had been the caseit had been kept in so quiet and unobtrusive a manner as to render it questionable to the jealous eyes which had been riveted on her from the shore until long past midnight now however everything was in motion and in less than five minutes after that billet of wood had fallen from the hands of the cook as he was about to light his galley fire the tops of the hats and caps of some fifty or sixty sailors were seen moving to and fro just above the upper edge of the bulwarks three minutes later and two men appeared near the knightheads each with his arms folded looking at the vessels hawse and taking a survey of the state of the harbor and of objects on the surrounding shore  the two individuals who were standing in the conspicuous position named were raoul yvard himself and ithuel bolt their conversation was in french the part borne by the last being most execrably pronounced and paying little or no attention to grammar but it is necessary that we should render what was said by both into the vernacular with the peculiarities that belonged to the men  i see only the austrian that is worth the trouble of a movement quietly observed raoul whose eye was scanning the inner harbor his own vessel lying two hundred yards without it it will be rememberedand she is light and would scarce pay for sending her to toulon these feluccas would embarrass us without affording much reward and then their loss would ruin the poor devils of owners and bring misery into many a family  well thats a new idee for a privateer said ithuel sneeringly lucks luck in these matters and every man must count on what war turns up i wish youd read the history of our revolution and then youd ha seen that liberty and equality are not to be had without some ups and downs in fortins and chances  the austrian might do added raoul who paid little attention to his companions remarks if he were a streak or two lower in the waterbut after all etooellfor so he pronounced the others namei do not like a capture that is made without any √©clat or spirit in the attack and defence  wellthis word ithuel invariably pronounced waalwell to my notion the most profitable and the most agreeable battles are the shortest and the pleasantest victories are them in which theres the most prize money howsever as that brig is only an austrian i care little what you may detairmine to do with her was she english id head a boat myself to go in and tow her out here expressly to have the satisfaction of burning her english ships make a cheerful fire  and that would be a useless waste of property and perhaps of blood and would do no one any good etooell  but it would do the accursed english harm and that counts for a something in my reckoning nelson wasnt so overscrupulous at the nile about burning your ships mr rule  tonnerre why do you always bring in that malheureux  nileis it not enough that we were beatendisgraceddestroyedthat a friend must tell us of it so often  you forget mr rule that i was an inimy then returned ithuel with a grin and a grim smile if youll take the trouble to examine my back youll find on it the marks of the lashes i got for just telling my captain that it was agin the grain for me a republican as i was by idee and natur to fight other republicans he told me he would first try the grain of my skin and see how that would agree with what he called my duty and i must own he got the best ont i fit like a tiger agin you rather than be flogged twice the same day flogging on a sore back is an awful argument  and now has come the hour of revenge pauvre etooell  this time you are on the right side and may fight with heart and mind those you so much hate  a long and gloomy silence followed during which raoul turned his face aft and stood looking at the movements of the men as they washed the decks while ithuel seated himself on a knighthead and his chin resting on his hand he sat ruminating in bitterness of spirit like miltons devil in some of his dire cogitations on the atrocious wrong of which he had really been the subject bodies of men are proverbially heartless they commit injustice without reflection and vindicate their abuses without remorse and yet it may be doubtful if either a nation or an individual ever tolerated or was an accessory in a wrong that the act sooner or later did not recoil on the offending party through that mysterious principle of right which is implanted in the nature of things bringing forth its own results as the seed produces its grain and the tree its fruits a supervision of holiness that it is usual to term and rightly enough when we remember who created principles the providence of god let that people dread the future who in their collective capacity systematically encourage injustice of any sort since their own eventual demoralization will follow as a necessary consequence even though they escape punishment in a more direct form  we shall not stop to relate the moody musings of the new hampshire man unnurtured and in many respects unprincipled as he was he had his clear conceptions of the injustice of which he had been one among thousands of other victims and at that moment he would have held life itself as a cheap sacrifice could he have had his fill of revenge time and again while a captive on board the english ship in which he had been immured for years had he meditated the desperate expedient of blowing up the vessel and had not the means been wanting mercenary and selfish as he ordinarily seemed he was every way equal to executing so dire a scheme in order to put an end to the lives of those who were the agents in wronging him and his own sufferings together the subject never recurred to his mind without momentarily changing the current of its thoughts and tinging all his feelings with an intensity of bitterness that it was painful to bear at length sighing heavily he rose from the knighthead and turned toward the mouth of the bay as if to conceal from raoul the expression of his countenance this act however was scarcely done ere he started and an exclamation escaped him that induced his companion to turn quickly on his heel and face the sea there indeed the growing light enabled both to discover an object that could scarcely be other than one of interest to men in their situation  it has been said already that the deep bay on the side of which stands the town of porto ferrajo opens to the north looking in the direction of the headland of piombino on the right of the bay the land high and broken stretches several miles ere it forms what is called the canal while on the left it terminates with the low bluff on which stands the residence then occupied by andrea barrofaldi and which has since become so celebrated as the abode of one far greater than the worthy vicegovernatore the haven lying under these heights on the left of the bay and by the side of the town it followed as a matter of course that the anchorage of the lugger was also in this quarter of the bay commanding a clear view to the north in the direction of the main land as far as the eye could reach the width of the canal or of the passage between elba and the point of piombino may be some six or seven miles and at the distance of less than one mile from the northern end of the former stands a small rocky islet which has since become known to the world as the spot on which napoleon stationed a corporals guard by way of taking possession when he found his whole empire dwindled to the seagirt mountains in its vicinity with the existence and position of this island both raoul and ithuel were necessarily acquainted for they had seen it and noted its situation the previous night though it had escaped their notice that from the place where the feufollet had brought up it was not visible in their first look to seaward that morning which was ere the light had grown sufficiently strong to render the houses on the opposite side of the bay distinct an object had been seen in this quarter which had then been mistaken for the rock but by this time the light was strong enough to show that it was a very different thing in a word that which both raoul and ithuel had fancied an islet was neither more nor less than a ship  the strangers head was to the northward and his motion before a light southerly air could not have exceeded a knot an hour he had no other canvas spread than his three topsails and jib though his courses were hanging in the brails his black hull was just beginning to show its details and along the line of light yellow that enlivened his side were visible the dark intervals of thirteen ports a real gun frowning in each although the hammocks were not stowed and the hammockcloths had that empty and undressed look which is so common to a manofwar in the night it was apparent that the ship had an upper deck with quarterdeck and forecastle batteries or in other words that she was a frigate as she had opened the town of porto ferrajo several minutes before she was herself seen from the feu follet an ensign was hanging from the end of her gaff though there was not sufficient air to open its folds in a way to let the national character of the stranger be known  peste exclaimed raoul yvard as soon as he had gazed a minute at the stranger in silence a pretty cul de sac are we in if that gentleman should happen to be an englishman what say you etooell can you make out anything of that ensignyour eyes are the best in the lugger  it is too much for any sight to detairmine at this distance and that before the sun is risen but by having a glass ready we shall soon know five minutes will bring us the great luminary as our minister used to call him  ithuel had descended from the bulwark while speaking and he now went aft in quest of a glass returning to his old station bringing two of the instruments one of which he handed to his commander while he kept the other himself in another minute both had levelled their glasses at the stranger whom each surveyed attentively for some time in profound silence  pardie exclaimed raoul that ensign is the tricolor or my eyes are untrue to my own country let me see etooell what ship of fortytwo or fortyfour has the republic on this coast  not that monsieur yvard answered ithuel with a manner so changed and an emphasis so marked as at once to draw his companions attention from the frigate to his own countenance not that monsieur capitaing it is not easy for a bird to forget the cage in which he was shut up for two years if that is not the accursed proserpine i have forgotten the cut of my own jib  la proserpine repeated raoul who was familiar with his shipmates adventures and did not require to be told his meaning if you are not mistaken etooell le feufollet needs put her lantern under a shade this is only a forty if i can count her ports  i care nothing for ports or guns it is the proserpine and the only harm i wish her is that she were at the bottom of the ocean the proserpine thirtysix captain cuffe though captain flog would have been a better name for him yes the proserpine thirtysix captain cuffe heaven bless her  bahthis vessel has fortyfour gunsnow i can see to count them i make twentytwo of a side  aye thats just her measurea thirtysix on the list and by rate and fortyfour by count twentysix long eighteens below twelve thirtytwos carronades on her quarterdeck and four more carronades with two barkers forard shed just extinguish your jackolantern monsieur rule at one broadside for what are ten twelvepound carronades and seventy men to such a frigate  i am not madman enough etooell to dream of fighting a frigate or even a heavy sloopofwar with the force you have just mentioned but i have followed the sea too long to be alarmed before i am certain o¬£ my danger la railleuse is just such a ship as that  hearken to reason monsieur rule answered ithuel earnestly la railleuse nor no other french frigate would show her colors to an enemys port for it would be uselessly telling her errand now an english ship might show a french ensign for she always has it in her power to change it and then she might be benefited by the cheat the proserpine is french built and has french legs too boots or no bootshere ithuel laughed a little involuntarily but his face instantly became serious againand i have heard she was a sister vessel of the other so much for size and appearance but every shroud and port and sail about yonder craft is registered on my back in a way that no sponge will ever wash out  saacrrre muttered raoul between his teeth etooell if an englishman he may very well take it into his head to come in here and perhaps anchor within halfacables length of us what think you of that mon brave am√©ricain  that it may very well come to pass though one hardly sees either what is to bring a cruiser into such a place as this every one hasnt the curiosity of a jackolantern  mais que diable allaitil faire dans cette gal√®rebien we must take the weather as it comes sometimes a gale and sometimes a calm as he shows his own ensign so loyally let us return the compliment and show ours hoist the ensign there aft  which one monsieur demanded an old demurelooking quartermaster who was charged with that duty and who was never known to laugh the captain will remember we came into port under the drapeau of monsieur jean bull  bienhoist the drapeau of monsieur jean bull again we must brazen it out now we have put on the mask monsieur lieutenant clap on the hawser and run the lugger ahead over her anchor and see everything clear for spreading our pockethandkerchiefs no one knows when le feufollet may have occasion to wipe her face ahnow etooell we can make out his broadside fairly he is heading more to the westward  the two seamen levelled their glasses and renewed their examinations ithuel had a peculiarity that not only characterized the man but which is so common among americans of his class as in a sense to be national on ordinary occasions he was talkative and disposed to gossip but whenever action and decision became necessary he was thoughtful silent and though in a way of his own even dignified this last fit was on him and he waited for raoul to lead the conversation the other however was disposed to be as reserved as himself for he quitted the knighthead and took refuge from the splashing of the water used in washing the decks in his own cabin  two hours though they brought the sun with the activity and hum of the morning had made no great change in the relative positions of things within and without the bay the people of le feufollet had breakfasted had got everything on board their little craft in its proper place and were moody observant and silent one of the lessons that ithuel had succeeded in teaching his shipmates was to impress on them the necessity of commanding their voluble propensities if they would wish to pass for englishmen it is certain more words would have been uttered in this little lugger in one hour had her crew been indulged to the top of their bent than would have been uttered in an english firstrate in two but the danger of using their own language and the english peculiarity of grumness had been so thoroughly taught them that her people rather caricatured than otherwise ce grand talent pour le silence that was thought to distinguish their enemies ithuel who had a waggery of his own smiled as he saw the seamen folding their arms throwing discontent and surliness into their countenances and pacing the deck singly as if misanthropical and disdaining to converse whenever a boat came alongside from the shore several of these visitors arrived in the course of the two hours mentioned but the sentinel at the gangway who had his orders repulsed every attempt to come on board pretending not to understand french when permission was asked in that language  raoul had a boats crew of four all of whom had acquired the english like himself in a prisonship and with these men he now prepared to land for as yet he had made little progress in the business which brought him into his present awkward predicament and he was not a man to abandon an object so dear to him lightly finding himself in a dilemma he was resolved to make an effort to reap if possible some advantage from his critical situation accordingly after he had taken his coffee and given his orders the boats crew was called and he left the luggers side all this was done tranquilly as if the appearance of the stranger in the offing gave no trouble to any in le feufollet  on this occasion the boat pulled boldly into the little harbor its officer touching the shore at the common landing nor were the men in any haste to return they lounged about the quay in waiting for their captain cheapening fruits chatting with the women in such italian as they could muster and affecting to understand the french of the old seadogs that drew near them all of whom knew more or less of that universal language with difficulty that they were the objects of suspicion their captain had sufficiently warned them and practice rendered them all good actors the time they remained in waiting for raoul was consequently spent in eluding attempts to induce them to betray themselves and in caricaturing englishmen two of the four folded their arms endeavored to look surly and paced the quay in silence refusing even to unbend to the blandishments of the gentler sex three or four of whom endeavored to insinuate themselves into their confidence by offerings of fruit and flowers  amico said annunziate one of the prettiest girls of her class in porto ferrajo and who had been expressly employed by vito viti to perform this office here are figs from the main land will you please to eat a few that when you go back to inghilterra you may tell your countrymen how we poor elbans live  bad figsputtered jacques raouls cockswain to whom this offering was made and speaking in broken english better at ome pick up better in ze street of portsmout  but signore you need not look as if they would hurt you or bite you you can eat them and take my word for it you will find them as pleasant as the melons of napoli  no melon good but english melon english melon plenty as pomme de terresbah  yes signore as the melons of napoli continued annunziate who did not understand a syllable of the ungracious answers she received signor vito viti our podest√† ordered me to offer these figs to the forestierithe inglesi who are in the bay  goddam returned jacques in a quick sententious manner that was intended to get rid of the fair tormentor and which temporarily at least was not without its effect  but leaving the boats crew to be badgered in this manner until relief came as will be hereafter related we must follow our hero in his way through the streets of the town raoul guided by an instinct or having some special object before his eyes walked swiftly up the heights ascending to the promontory so often mentioned as he passed every eye was turned on him for by this time the distrust in the place was general and the sudden appearance of a frigate wearing a french ensign before the port had given rise to apprehensions of a much more serious nature than any which could possibly attend the arrival of a craft as light as the lugger by herself vito viti had long before gone up the street to see the vicegovernatore and eight or ten of the principal men of the place had been summoned to a council including the two senior military dignitaries of the island the batteries it was known were manned and although it would have puzzled the acutest mind of elba to give a reason why the french should risk so unprofitable an attack as one on their principal port long ere raoul was seen among them such a result was not only dreaded but in a measure anticipated with confidence as a matter of course then every eye followed his movements as he went with bounding steps up the narrow terraces of the steep street and the least of his actions was subjeected to the narrowest and most jealous scrutiny  the heights were again thronged with spectators of all ages and classes and of both sexes the mantles and flowing dresses of females prevailed as usual for whatever is connected with curiosity is certain to collect an undue proportion of a sex whose imaginations are so apt to get the start of their judgments on a terrace in front of the palace as it was the custom to designate the dwelling of the governor was the group of magnates all of them paying the gravest attention to the smallest change in the direction of the ship which had now become an object of general solicitude and apprehension so intent indeed were they in gazing at this apprehended enemy that raoul stood in front of andrea barrofaldi cap in hand and bowing his salutation before his approach was even anticipated this sudden and unannounced arrival created great surprise and some little confusion one or two of the group turning away instinctively as it might be to conceal the flushes that mounted to their cheeks at being so unexpectedly confronted by the very man whom the minute before they had been strongly denouncing  bon giorno signor vicegovernatore commenced raoul in his gay easy and courteous manner and certainly with an air that betrayed any feeling but those of apprehension and guilt we have a fine morning on the land here and apparently a fine frigate of the french republic in the offing yonder  we were conversing of that vessel signor smees answered andrea as you approached what in your judgment c an induce a frenchman to appear before our town in so menacing a manner  cospetto you might as well ask me signore what induces these republicans to do a thousand other outoftheway things what has made them behead louis xvi what has made them overrun half of your italy conquer egypt and drive the austrians back upon their danube  to say nothing of their letting nelsoni destroy them at aboukir added vito viti with a grunt  true signore or letting nelson my gallant countryman annihilate them near the mouth of the nile i did not consider it proper to boast of english glory though that case too may very well be included we have several men in ze vingandving who were in that glorious battle particularly our sailingmaster etooell bolt who was on board nelsons own ship having been accidentally sent on service from the frigate to which he properly belonged and carried off expressly to share as it might be in the glory of this famous battle  i have seen the signore dryly remarked andrea barrofaldi√© uno americano  an american exclaimed raoul starting a little in spite of his assumed indifference of manner why yes i believe bolt was born in americaenglish america you know signori and that is much the same thing as having been born in england herself we look upon ze yank√©s as but a part of our own people and take them into our service most cheerfully  so the signor ituello has given us reason to believe he is seemingly a great lover of the english nation  raoul was uneasy for he was entirely ignorant of all that had passed in the winehouse and he thought he detected irony in the manner of the vicegovernatore  certainly signore he answered however with unmoved steadiness certainly signore the americani adore inghilterra and well they may considering all that great nation has done for them but signor vicegovernatore i have come to offer you the service of my lugger should this frenchman really intend mischief we are small it is true and our guns are but light nevertheless we may break the frigates cabinwindows while you are doing him still greater injury from these heights i trust you will assign ze vingandving some honorable station should you come to blows with the republicans  and what particular service would it be most agreeable to you to undertake signore inquired the vicegovernatore with considerate courtesy we are no mariners and must leave the choice to yourself the colonello here expects some firing and has his artillerists already at their guns  the preparation of porto ferrajo is celebrated among the mariners of the mediterranean and should the frenchman venture within reach of your shot i expect to see him unrigged faster than if he were in a dockyard as for ze leetl vingandving in my opinion while the frigate is busy with these batteries it might be well for us to steer along the shore on the east side of the bay until we can get outside of her when we shall have the beggars between two fires that was just what nelson did at aboukir signor podest√† a battle you seem so much to admire  that would be a manoeuvre worthy of a follower of nelsoni signore observed the colonel if the metal of your guns were heavier with short pieces of twelve however you would hardly venture within reach of long pieces of eighteen although the first should be manned by inglese and the last by fran√ßese  one never knows at the nile one of our fifties laid the orient a threedecker athwarthawse and did her lots of injury the vaisseau in fact was blown up naval combats are decided on principles altogether different from engagements on the land signor colonello  it must be so truly answered the soldier but what means this movement you as a seaman may be able to tell us capitano  this drew all eyes to the frigate again where indeed were movements that indicated some important changes as these movements have an intimate connection with the incidents of the tale it will be necessary to relate them in a manner to render them more intelligible to the reader  the distance of the frigate from the town might now have been five english miles of current there was none and there being no tides in the mediterranean the ship would have lain perfectly stationary all the morning but for a very light air from the southward before this air however she had moved to the westward about a couple of miles until she had got the governmenthouse nearly abeam at the same time she had been obliquely drawing nearer which was the circumstance that produced the alarm with the sun had risen the wind and a few minutes before the colonel interrupted himself in the manner related the topsails of the stranger had swelled and he began to move through the water at the rate of some four or five knots the hour the moment her people felt that they had complete command of their vessel as if waiting only for that assurance they altered her course and made sail putting her helm astarboard the ship came close by the wind with her head looking directly in for the promontory while her tacks were hauled on board and her light canvas aloft was loosened and spread to the breeze almost at the same instant for everything seemed to be done at once and as by instinct the french flag was lowered another went up in its place and a gun was fired to leewarda signal of amity as this second emblem of nationality blew out and opened to the breeze the glasses showed the white field and st georges cross of the noble old ensign of england  an exclamation of surprise and delight escaped the spectators on the promontory as their doubts and apprehensions were thus dramatically relieved no one thought of raoul at that happy moment though to him there was nothing of new interest in the affair with the exception of the apparent intention of the stranger to enter the bay as le feufollet lay in plain view from the offing he had his doubts indeed whether the warlike appearance of that craft was not the true reason of this sudden change in the frigates course still lying as he did in a port hostile to france there was a probability that he might yet escape without a very critical or close examination  signor smees i felicitate you on this visit of a countryman cried andrea barrofaldi a pacific man by nature and certainly no warrior and who felt too happy at the prospects of passing a quiet day to feel distrust at such a moment i shall do you honor in my communications with florence for the spirit and willingness which you have shown in the wish to aid us on this trying occasion  signor vicegovernatore do not trouble yourself to dwell on my poor services answered raoul scarce caring to conceal the smile that struggled about his handsome mouth think rather of those of these gallant signori who greatly regret that an opportunity for gaining distinction has been lost but here are signals that must be meant for usi hope my stupid fellows will be able to answer them in my absence  it was fortunate for le feufollet perhaps that her commander was not on board when the stranger the proserpine the very ship that ithuel so well knew made her number the mystification that was to follow was in much better hands while conducted by the new hampshire man than it could possibly be in his own ithuel answered promptly though what he did not know himself but he took good care that the flags he showed should become so entangled as not to be read by those in the frigate while they had every appearance of being hoisted fearlessly and in good faith    chapter vi                    are all prepared      they arenay moreembarked the latest boat      waits but my chiefmy sword and my capote       the corsair  what success attended the artifice of ithuel it was impossible to tell so far as the frigate was concerned though the appearance of mutual intelligence between the two vessels had a very favorable tendency toward removing suspicion from the lugger among those on shore it seemed so utterly improbable that a french corsair could answer the signals of an english frigate that even vito viti felt compelled to acknowledge to the vicegovernatore in a whisper that so far the circumstance was much in favor of the luggers loyalty then the calm exterior of raoul counted for something more especially as he remained apparently an unconcerned observer of the rapid approach of the ship  we shall not have occasion to use your gallant offer signor smees said andrea kindly as he was about to retire into the house with one or two of his counsellors but we thank you none the less it is a happiness to be honored with the visit of two cruisers of your great nation on the same day and i hope you will so far favor me as to accompany your brother commander when he shall do me the honor to pay the customary visit since it would seem to be his serious intention to pay porto ferrajo the compliment of a call can you not guess at the name of the frigate  now i see she is a countryman i think i can signore answered raoul carelessly i take her to be la proserpine a frenchbuilt ship a circumstance that first deceived me as to her character  and the noble cavaliere her commanderyou doubtless know his name and rank  oh perfectly he is the son of an old admiral under whom i was educated though we happen ourselves never to have met sir brown is the name and title of the gentleman  ah that is a truly english rank and name too as one might say often have i met that honorable appellation in shakespeare and other of your eminent authors miltoni has a sir brown if i am not mistaken signore  several of them signor vicegovernatore answered raoul without a moments hesitation or the smallest remorse though he had no idea whatever who milton was milton shakespeare cicero and all our great writers often mention signori of this family  cicero repeated andrea in astonishmenthe was a roman and an ancient capitano and died before inghilterra was known to the civilized world  raoul perceived that he had reached too far though he was not in absolute danger of losing his balance smiling as in consideration of the others provincial view of things he rejoined with an aplomb that would have done credit to a politician in an explanatory and halfapologetic tone  quite true signor vicegovernatore as respects him you mention he said but not true as respects sir cicero my illustrious compatriot let me seei do not think it is yet a century since our cicero died he was born in devonshirethis was the county in which raoul had been imprisonedand must have died in dublin sinow i remember it was in dublin that this virtuous and distinguished author yielded up his breath  to all this andrea had nothing to say for half a century since so great was the ignorance of civilized nations as related to such things that one might have engrafted a homer on the literature of england in particular without much risk of having the imposition detected signor barrofaldi was not pleased to find that the barbarians were seizing on the italian names it is true but he was fain to set the circumstance down to those very traces of barbarism which were the unavoidable fruits of their origin as for supposing it possible that one who spoke with the ease and innocence of raoul was inventing as he went along it was an idea he was himself much too unpractised to entertain and the very first thing he did on entering the palace was to make a memorandum which might lead him at a leisure moment to inquire into the nature of the writings and the general merits of sir cicero the illustrious namesake of him of rome as soon as this little digression terminated he entered the palace after again expressing the hope that sir smees would not fail to accompany sir brown in the visit which the functionary fully expected to receive from the latter in the course of the next hour of two the company now began to disperse and raoul was soon left to his own meditations which just at that moment were anything but agreeable  the town of porto ferrajo is so shut in from the sea by the rock against which it is built its fortifications and the construction of its own little port as to render the approach of a vessel invisible to its inhabitants unless they choose to ascend to the heights and the narrow promenade already mentioned this circumstance had drawn a large crowd upon the hill again among which raoul yvard now threaded his way wearing his sea cap and his assumed naval uniform in a smart affected manner for he was fully sensible of all the advantages he possessed on the score of personal appearance his unsettled eye however wandered from one pretty face to another in quest of ghita who alone was the object of his search and the true cause of the awkward predicament into which he had brought not only himself but le feufollet in this manner now thinking of her he sought and then reverting to his situation in an enemys port he walked along the whole line of the cliff scarce knowing whether to return or to seek his boat by doubling on the town when he heard his own name pronounced in a sweet voice which went directly to his heart turning on his heel ghita was within a few feet of him  salute me distantly and as a stranger said the girl in almost breathless haste and point to the different streets as if inquiring your way through the town this is the place where we met last evening but remember it is no longer dark  as raoul complied with her desire any distant spectator might well have fancied the meeting accidental though he poured forth a flood of expressions of love and admiration  enough raoul said the girl blushing and dropping her eyes though no displeasure was visible on her serene and placid face another time i might indulge you how much worse is your situation now than it was last night then you had only the port to fear now you have both the people of the port and this strange shipan inglese as they tell me  no doubtla proserpine etooell says and he knows you remember etooell dearest ghita the american who was with me at the towerwell he has served in this very ship and knows her to be la proserpine of fortyfour raoul paused a moment then he added laughing in a way to surprise his companionquila proserpine le capitaine sir brown  what you can find to amuse you in all this raoul is more than i can discover sir brown or sir anybody else will send you again to those evil english prisonships of which you have so often told me and there is surely nothing pleasant in that idea  bah my sweet ghita sir brown or sir white or sir black has not yet got me i am not a child to tumble into the fire because the leadingstrings are off and le feufollet shines or goes out exactly as it suits her purposes the frigate ten to one will just run close in and take a near look and then square away and go to livorno where there is much more to amuse her officers than here in porto ferrajo this sir brown has his ghita as well as raoul yvard  no not a ghita i fear raoul answered the girl smiling in spite of herself while her color almost insensibly deepenedlivorno has few ignorant country girls like me who have been educated in a lone watchtower on the coast  ghita answered raoul with feeling that poor lone watchtower of thine might well be envied by many a noble dame at roma and at napoli it has left thee innocent and purea gem that gay capitals seldom contain or if found there not in its native beauty which they sully by use  what knowst thou raoul of roma and napoli and of noble dames and rich gems asked the girl smiling the tenderness which had filled her heart at that moment betraying itself in her eyes  what do i know of such things truly why i have been at both places and have seen what i describe i went to roma on purpose to see the holy father in order to make certain whether our french opinions of his character and infallibility were true or not before i set up in religion for myself  and thou didst find him holy and venerable raoul interposed the girl with earnestness and energy for this was the great point of separation between themi know thou foundst him thus and worthy to be the head of an ancient and true church my eyes never beheld him but this do i know to be true  raoul was aware that the laxity of his religious opinions opinions that he may be said to have inherited from his country as it then existed morally alone prevented ghita from casting aside all other ties and following his fortunes in weal and in woe still he was too frank and generous to deceive while he had ever been too considerate to strive to unsettle her confiding and consoling faith her infirmity even for so he deemed her notions to be had a charm in his eyes few men however loose or sceptical in their own opinions on such matters finding any pleasure in the contemplation of a female infidel and he had never looked more fondly into her anxious but lovely face than he did at this very instant making his reply with a truth that bordered on magnanimity  thou art my religion ghita he said in thee i worship purity and holiness and  naynay raoul do notrefrainif thou really lovst me utter not this frightful blasphemy tell me rather if thou didst not find the holy father as i describe him  i found him a peaceful venerable and i firmly believe a good old man ghita but only a man no infallibility could i see about him but a set of roguish cardinals and other plotters of mischief who were much better calculated to set christians by the ears than to lead them to heaven surrounded his chair  say no more raouli will listen to no more of this thou knowest not these sainted men and thy tongue is thine own enemy withouthark what means that  it is a gun from the frigate and must be looked to say when and where do we meet again  i know not now we have been too long much too long together as it is and must separate trust to me to provide the means of another meeting at all events we shall shortly be in our tower again  ghita glided away as she ceased speaking and soon disappeared in the town as for raoul he was at a loss for a moment whether to follow or not then he hastened to the terrace in front of the governmenthouse again in order to ascertain the meaning of the gun the report had drawn others to the same place and on reaching it the young man found himself in another crowd  by this time the proserpine for ithuel was right as to the name of the stranger had got within a league of the entrance of the bay and had gone about stretching over to its eastern shore apparently with the intention to fetch fairly into it on the next tack the smoke of her gun was sailing off to leeward in a little cloud and signals were again flying at her mainroyalmasthead all this was very intelligible to raoul it being evident at a glance that the frigate had reached in nearer both to look at the warlike lugger that she saw in the bay and to communicate more clearly with her by signals ithuels expedient had not sufficed the vigilant captain cuffe alias sir brown who commanded the proserpine not being a man likely to be mystified by so stale a trick raoul scarcely breathed as he watched the lugger in anticipation of her course  ithuel certainly seemed in no hurry to commit himself for the signal had now been flying on board the frigate several minutes and yet no symptoms of any preparation for an answer could be discovered at length the halyards moved and then three fair handsome flags rose to the end of le feufollets jigger yard a spar that was always kept aloft in moderate weather what the signal meant raoul did not know for though he was provided with signals by means of which to communicate with the vessels of war of his own nation the directory had not been able to supply him with those necessary to communicate with the enemy ithuels ingenuity however had supplied the deficiency while serving on board the proserpine the very ship that was now menacing the lugger he had seen a meeting between her and a privateer english lugger one of the two or three of that rig which sailed out of england and his observant eye had noted the flags she had shown on the occasion now as privateersmen are not expected to be expert or even very accurate in the use of signals he had ventured to show these very numbers let it prove for better or worse had he been on the quarterdeck of the frigate he would have ascertained through the benedictions bestowed by captain cuffe that his ruse had so far succeeded as to cause that officer to attribute his unintelligible answer to ignorance rather than to design nevertheless the frigate did not seem disposed to alter her course for either influenced by a desire to anchor or by a determination to take a still closer look at the lugger she stood on nearing the eastern side of the bay at the rate of some six miles to the hour  raoul yvard now thought it time to look to the safety of le feufollet in person previously to landing he had given instructions as to what was to be done in the event of the frigates coming close in but matters now seemed so very serious that he hurried down the hill overtaking vito viti in his way who was repairing to the harbor to give instructions to certain boatmen concerning the manner in which the quarantine laws were to be regarded in an intercourse with a british frigate  you ought to be infinitely happy at the prospect of meeting an honorable countryman in this sir brown observed the shortwinded podest√† who usually put himself out of breath both in ascending and descending the steep street for he really seems determined to anchor in our bay signor smees  to tell you the truth signor podest√† i wish i was half as well persuaded that it is sir brown and la proserpine as i was an hour ago i see symptoms of its being a republican after all and must have a care for ze vingandving  the devil carry away all republicans is my humble prayer signor capitano but i can hardly believe that so graceful and graciouslooking a frigate can possibly belong to such wretches  ah signore if that were all i fear we should have to yield the palm to the french answered raoul laughing for the bestlooking craft in his majestys service are republican prizes even should this frigate turn out to be the proserpine herself she can claim no better origin but i think the vicegovernatore has not done well in deserting the batteries since this stranger does not answer our signals as she should the last communication has proved quite unintelligible to him  raoul was nearer to the truth than he imagined perhaps for certainly ithuels numbers had made nonsense according to the signal book of the proserpine but his confident manner had an effect on vito viti who was duped by his seeming earnestness as well as by a circumstance which rightly considered told as much against as it did in favor of his companion  and what is to be done signore demanded the podest√† stopping short in the street  we must do as well as we can under the circumstances my duty is to look out for ze vingandving and yours to look out for the town should the stranger actually enter the bay and bring his broadside to bear on this steep hill there is not a chamber window that will not open on the muzzles of his guns you will grant me permission to haul into the inner harbor where we shall be sheltered by the buildings from his shot and then perhaps it will be well enough to send my people into the nearest battery i look for bloodshed and confusion ere long  all this was said with so much apparent sincerity that it added to the podest√†s mystification calling a neighbor to him he sent the latter up the hill with a message to andrea barrofaldi and then he hurried down toward the port it being much easier for him just at that moment to descend than to ascend raoul kept at his side and together they reached the waters edge  the podest√† was greatly addicted to giving utterance to any predominant opinion of the moment being one of those persons who feel quite as much as they think on the present occasion he did not spare the frigate for having caught at the bait that his companion had so artfully thrown out to him he was loud in the expression of his distrust all the signalling and showing of colors he now believed to be a republican trick and precisely in proportion as he became resentful of the supposed fraud of the ship was he disposed to confide blindly in the honesty of the lugger this was a change of sentiment in the magistrate and as in the case of all sudden but late conversions he was in a humor to compensate for his tardiness by the excess of his zeal in consequence of this disposition and the character and loquacity of the man all aided by a few timely suggestions on the part of raoul in five minutes it came to be generally understood that the frigate was greatly to be distrusted while the lugger rose in public favor exactly in the degree in which the other fell this interposition of vito vitis was exceedingly √†propos so far as le feufollet and her people were concerned inasmuch as the examination of and intercourse with the boats crew had rather left the impression of their want of nationality in a legal sense than otherwise in a word had not the podest√† so loudly and so actively proclaimed the contrary tommaso and his fellows were about to report their convictions that these men were all bon√¢ fide wolves in sheeps clothingalias frenchmen  no noamici miei said vito viti bustling about on the narrow little quay all is not gold that glitters of a certainty and this frigate is probably no ally but an enemy a very different matter is it with ze vingyving and il signor smeeswe may be said to know himhave seen his papers and the vicegovernatore and myself have examined him as it might be on the history and laws of his island for england is an island neighbors as well as elba another reason for respect and amitybut we have gone over much of the literature and history of inghilterra together and find everything satisfactory and right therefore are we bound to show the lugger protection and love  most true signor podest√† answered raoul from his boat and such being the case i hasten to haul my vessel into the mouth of your basin which i will defend against boats or any attempt of these rascally republicans to land  waving his hand the young sailor pulled quickly out of the crowded little port followed by a hundred vivas raoul now saw that his orders had not been neglected a small line had been run out from the lugger and fastened to a ring in the inner end of the eastern side of the narrow haven apparently with the intention of hauling the vessel into the harbor itself he also perceived that the light anchor or large kedge by which le feufollet rode was under foot as seamen term it or that the cable was nearly up and down with a wave of the hand he communicated a new order and then he saw that the men were raising the kedge from the bottom by the time his foot touched the deck indeed the anchor was up and stowed and nothing held the vessel but the line that had been run to the quay fifty pairs of hands were applied to this line and the lugger advanced rapidly toward her place of shelter but an artifice was practised to prevent her heading into the harbors mouth the line having been brought inboard abaft her larboard cathead a circumstance which necessarily gave her a sheer in the contrary direction or to the eastward of the entrance when the reader remembers that the scale on which the port had been constructed was small the entrance scarce exceeding a hundred feet in width he will better understand the situation of things seemingly to aid the movement too the jigger was set and the wind being south or directly aft the luggers motion was soon light and rapid as the vessel drew nearer to the entrance her people made a run with the line and gave her a movement of some three or four knots to the hour actually threatening to dash her bows against the pierhead but raoul yvard contemplated no such blunder at the proper moment the line was cut the helm was put aport the luggers head sheered to starboard and just as vito viti who witnessed all without comprehending more than half that passed was shouting his vivas and animating all near him with his cries the lugger glided past the end of the harbor on its outside however instead of entering it so completely was every one taken by surprise by this evolution that the first impression was of some mistake accident or blunder of the helmsman and cries of regret followed lest the frigate might have it in her power to profit by the mishap the flapping of canvas notwithstanding showed that no time was lost and presently le feufollet shot by an opening between the warehouses under all sail at this critical instant the frigate which saw what passed but which had been deceived like all the rest and supposed the lugger was hauling into the haven tacked and came round with her head to the westward but intending to fetch well into the bay she had stretched so far over toward the eastern shore as by this time to be quite two miles distant and as the lugger rounded the promontory close under its rocks to avoid the shot of the batteries above she left in less than five minutes her enemy that space directly astern nor was this all it would have been dangerous to fire as well as useless on account of the range since the lugger lay nearly in a line between her enemys chase guns and the residence of the vicegovernatore it only remained therefore for the frigate to commence what is proverbially a long chase viz a stern chase  all that has just been related may have occupied ten minutes but the news reached andrea barrofaldi and his counsellors soon enough to allow them to appear on the promontory in time to see the vingyving pass close under the cliffs beneath them still keeping her english colors flying raoul was visible trumpet in hand but as the wind was light his powerful voice sufficed to tell his story  signori he shouted i will lead the rascally republican away from your port in chase that will be the most effectual mode of doing you a service  these words were heard and understood and a murmur of applause followed from some while others thought the whole affair mysterious and questionable there was no time to interpose by acts had such a course been contemplated the lugger keeping too close in to be exposed to shot and there being as yet no new preparations in the batteries to meet an enemy then there were the doubts as to the proper party to assail and all passed too rapidly to admit of consultation or preconcert  the movement of le feufollet was so easy as to partake of the character of instinct her light sails were fully distended though the breeze was far from fresh and as she rose and fell on the long groundswells her wedgelike bows caused the water to ripple before them like a swift current meeting a sharp obstacle in the stream it was only as she sank into the water in stemming a swell that anything like foam could be seen under her forefoot a long line of swiftreceding bubbles however marked her track and she no sooner came abreast of any given group of spectators than she was past itresembling the progress of a porpoise as he sports along a harbor  ten minutes after passing the palace or the pitch of the promontory the lugger opened another bay one wider and almost as deep as that on which porto ferrajo stands and here she took the breeze without the intervention of any neighboring rocks and her speed was essentially increased hitherto her close proximity to the shore had partially becalmed her though the air had drawn round the promontory making nearly a fair wind of it but now the currents came fully on her beam and with much more power she hauled down her tacks flattened in her sheets luffed and was soon out of sight breasting up to windward of a point that formed the eastern extremity of the bay last mentioned  all this time the proserpine had not been idle as soon as she discovered that the lugger was endeavoring to escape her rigging was alive with men sail after sail was set one white cloud succeeding another until she was a sheet of canvas from her trucks to her bulwarks her lofty sails taking the breeze above the adjacent coast her progress was swift for this particular frigate had the reputation of being one of the fastest vessels in the english marine  it was just twenty minutes by andrea barrofaldis watch after le feufollet passed the spot where he stood when the proserpine came abreast of it her greater draught of water induced her to keep half a mile from the promontory but she was so near as to allow a very good opportunity to examine her general construction and appearance as she went by the batteries were now manned and a consultation was held on the propriety of punishing a republican for daring to come so near a tuscan port but there flew the respected and dreaded english ensign and it was still a matter of doubt whether the stranger were friend or enemy nothing about the ship showed apprehension and yet she was clearly chasing a craft which coming from a tuscan harbor an englishman would be bound to consider entitled to his protection rather than to his hostility in a word opinions were divided and when that is the case in matters of this nature decision is obviously difficult then if a frenchman she clearly attempted no injury to any on the island and those who possessed the power to commence a fire were fully aware how much the town lay exposed and how little benefit might be expected from even a single broadside the consequence was that the few who were disposed to open on the frigate like the two or three who had felt the same disposition toward the lugger were restrained in their wishes not only by the voice of superior authority but by that of numbers  in the mean while the proserpine pressed on and in ten minutes more she was not only out of the range but beyond the reach of shot as she opened the bay west of the town le feufollet was seen from her decks fully a league ahead close on a wind the breeze hauling round the western end of the island glancing through the water at a rate that rendered pursuit more than doubtful still the ship persevered and in little more than an hour from the time she had crowded sail she was up with the western extremity of the hills through more than a mile to the leeward here she met the fair southern breeze uninfluenced by the land as it came through the pass between corsica and elba and got a clear view of the work before her the studdingsails and royals had been taken in twenty minutes earlier the bowlines were now all hauled and the frigate was brought close upon the wind still the chase was evidently hopeless the little feufollet having everything as much to her mind as if she had ordered the weather expressly to show her powers with her sheets flattened in until her canvas stood like boards her head looked fully a point to windward of that of the ship and what was of equal importance she even went to windward of the point she looked at while the proserpine if anything fell off a little though but a very little from her own course under all these differences the lugger went through the water six feet to the frigates five beating her in speed almost as much as she did in her weatherly qualities  the vessel to windward was not the first lugger by fifty that captain cuffe had assisted in chasing and he knew the hopelessness of following such a craft under circumstances so directly adapted to its qualities then he was far from certain that he was pursuing an enemy at all whatever distrust the signals may have excited since she had clearly come out of a friendly port bastia too lay within a few hours run and there was the whole of the east coast of corsica abounding with small bays and havens in which a vessel of that size might take refuge if pressed after convincing himself therefore by half an hours further trial in open sailing under the full force of the breeze of the fruitlessness of his effort that experienced officer ordered the proserpines helm put up the yards squared and he stood to the northward apparently shaping his course for leghorn or the gulf of genoa when the frigate made this change in her course the lugger which had tacked some time previously was just becoming shut in by the western end of elba and she was soon lost to view entirely with every prospect of her weathering the island altogether without being obliged to go about again  it was no more than natural that such a chase should occasion some animation in a place as retired and ordinarily as dull as porto ferrajo several of the young idlers of the garrison obtained horses and galloped up among the hills to watch the result the mountains being pretty well intersected by bridlepaths though totally without regular roads they who remained in the town as a matter of course were not disposed to let so favorable a subject for discourse die away immediately for want of a disposition to gossip on it little else was talked of that day than the menaced attack of the republican frigate and the escape of the lugger some indeed still doubted for every question has its two sides and there was just enough of dissent to render the discussions lively and the arguments ingenious among the disputants vito viti acted a prominent part having committed himself so openly by his vivas and his public remarks in the port he felt it due to his own character to justify all he had said and raoul yvard could not have desired a warmer advocate than he had in the podest√† the worthy magistrate exaggerated the vicegovernatores knowledge of english by way of leaving no deficiency in the necessary proofs of the luggers national character nay he even went so far as to affirm that he had comprehended a portion of the documents exhibited by the signor smees himself and as to ze vingyving any one acquainted in the least with the geography of the british channel would understand that she was precisely the sort of craft that the semigallic inhabitants of guernsey and jersey would be apt to send forth to cruise against the outandout gallic inhabitants of the adjacent main  during all these discussions there was one heart in porto ferrajo that was swelling with the conflicting emotions of gratitude disappointment joy and fear though the tongue of its owner was silent of all of her sex in the place ghita alone had nothing to conjecture no speculation to advance no opinion to maintain nor any wish to express still she listened eagerly and it was not the least of her causes of satisfaction to find that her own hurried interviews with the handsome privateersman had apparently escaped observation at length her mind was fully lightened of its apprehensions leaving nothing but tender regrets by the return of the horsemen from the mountains these persons reported that the upper sails of the frigate were just visible in the northern board so far as they could judge even more distant than the island of capraya while the lugger had beaten up almost as far to windward as pianosa and then seemed disposed to stand over toward the coast of corsica doubtless with an intention to molest the commerce of that hostile island    chapter vii  antand indeed sir there are cozeners abroad therefore it behoves men to be wary  clofear not thou man thou shalt lose nothing here  anti hope so sir for i have about me many parcels of change                                        winters tale  such was the state of things at porto ferrajo at noon or about the hour when its inhabitants bethought them of their midday meal with most the siesta followed though the sea air with its invigorating coolness rendered that indulgence less necessary to these islanders than to most of their neighbors on the main then succeeded the reviving animation of the afternoon and the return of the zephyr or the western breeze so regular indeed are these changes in the currents of the air during the summer months that the mariner can rely with safety on meeting a light breeze from the southward throughout the morning a calm at noonthe siesta of the mediterraneanand the delightfully cool wind from the west after three or four oclock this last is again succeeded at night by a breeze directly from the land weeks at a time have we known this order of things to be uninterrupted and when the changes did occasionally occur it was only in the slight episodes of showers and thunderstorms of which however italy has far fewer than our own coast  such then was the state of porto ferrajo toward the evening that succeeded this day of bustle and excitement the zephyr again prevailedthe idle once more issued forth for their sunset walkand the gossips were collecting to renew their conjectures and to start some new point in their already exhausted discussions when a rumor spread through the place like fire communicated to a train that ze vingyving was once more coming down on the weather side of the island precisely as she had approached on the previous evening with the confidence of a friend and the celerity of a bird years had passed since such a tumult was awakened in the capital of elba men women and children poured from the houses and were seen climbing the streets all hastening to the promenade as if to satisfy themselves with their own eyes of the existence of some miracle in vain did the infirm and aged call on the vigorous and more youthful for the customary assistance they were avoided like the cases of plague and were left to hobble up the terraced street as best they might even mothers after dragging them at their own sides till fearful of being too late abandoned their young in the highway certain of finding them rolled to the foot of the declivity should they fail of scrambling to its summit in short it was a scene of confusion in which there was much to laugh at something to awaken wonder and not a little that was natural  ten minutes had not certainly elapsed after the rumor reached the lower part of the town ere two thousand persons were on the hill including nearly all the principal personages of the place maso tonti ghita and the different characters known to the reader so nearly did the scene of this evening resemble that of the past the numbers of the throng on the hill and the greater interest excepted that one who had been present at the former might readily have fancied the latter merely its continuation there indeed was the lugger under her foresail and mainsail with the jigger brailed coming down wingandwing and glancing along the glittering sea like the duck sailing toward her nest this time however the english ensign was flying at the end of the jigger yard as if in triumph and the little craft held her way nearer to the rocks like one acquainted with the coast and fearing no danger there was a manner of established confidence in the way in which she trusted herself under the muzzles of guns that might have destroyed her in a very few minutes and no one who saw her approach could very well believe that she was anything but a known as well as a confirmed friend  would any of the republican rascals think you signor andrea asked vito viti in triumph dare to come into porto ferrajo in this style knowing too as does this sir smees the sort of people he will have to deal with remember vicegovernatore that the man has actually been ashore among us and would not be likely to run his head into the lions mouth  thou hast changed thine opinion greatly neighbor vito answered the vicegovernatore somewhat dryly for he was far from being satisfied on the subject of sir cicero and on those of certain other circumstances in english history and politics it better becomes magistrates to be cautious and wary  well if there be a more cautious and circumspect man in elba than the poor podest√† of the porto ferrajo let him stand forth o gods name and prove his deeds i do not esteem myself signor vicegovernatore as the idlest or as the most ignorant man in the grand dukes territories there may be wiser among whom i place your eccellenza but there is not a more loyal subject or a more zealous friend of truth  i believe it good vito returned andrea smiling kindly on his old associate and have ever so considered thy advice and services still i wish i knew something of this sir cicero for to be frank with thee i have even foregone my siesta in searching the books in quest of such a man  and do they not confirm every syllable the signor smees has said  so far from it that i do not even find the name it is true several distinguished orators of that nation are styled english ciceroes but then all people do this by way of commendation  i do not know that signorei do not know thatit may happen in our italy but would it come to pass think you among remote and so lately barbarous nations as england germany and france  thou forgettest friend vito returned the vicegovernatore smiling now in pity of his companions ignorance and prejudices as just before he had smiled in kindness that we italians took the pains to civilize these people a thousand years ago and that they have not gone backward all this time but there can be no doubt that ze vingyving means to enter our bay again and there stands the signor smees examining us with a glass as if he too contemplated another interview  it strikes me vicegovernatore that it would be a sin next to heresy to doubt the character of those who so loyally put their trust in us no republican would dare to anchor in the bay of porto ferrajo a second time once it might possibly be done but twiceno never never  i do not know but you are right vito and i am sure i hope so will you descend to the port and see that the forms are complied with then glean such useful circumstances as you can  the crowd was now in motion toward the lower part of the town to meet the lugger and at this suggestion the podest√† hurried down in the throng to be in readiness to receive the signor smees as soon as he should land it was thought more dignified and proper for the vicegovernatore to remain and await to hear the report of the supposed english officer where he was ghita was one of the few also who remained on the heights her heart now beating with renewed apprehensions of the dangers that her lover had again braved on her account and now nearly overflowing with tenderness as she admitted the agreeable conviction that had she not been in porto ferrajo raoul yvard would never have incurred such risks  ghita delle torri or ghita of the towers as the girl was ordinarily termed by those who knew her from a circumstance in her situation that will appear as we advance in the tale or ghita caraccioli as was her real name had been an orphan from infancy she had imbibed a strength of character and a selfreliance from her condition that might otherwise have been wanting in one so young and of a native disposition so truly gentle an aunt had impressed on her mind the lessons of female decorum and her uncle who had abandoned the world on account of a strong religious sentiment had aided in making her deeply devout and keenly conscientious the truth of her character rendered her indisposed to the deception which raoul was practising while feminine weakness inclined her to forgive the offence in the motive she had shuddered again and again as she remembered how deeply the young sailor was becoming involved in fraudsand frauds too that might so easily terminate in violence and bloodshed and then she had trembled under the influence of a gentler emotion as she remembered that all these risks were run for her her reason had long since admonished her that raoul yvard and ghita caraccioli ought to be strangers to each other but her heart told a different story the present was an occasion suited to keeping these conflicting feelings keenly alive and as has been said when most of the others hastened down toward the port to be present when the wingandwing came in she remained on the hill brooding over her own thoughts much of the time bathed in tears  but raoul had no intention of trusting his jackolantern where it might so readily be extinguished by the hand of man instead of taking shelter against any new roving republican who might come along behind the buildings of the port as had been expected he shot past the end of the quay and anchored within a few fathoms of the very spot he had quitted that morning merely dropping his kedge under foot as before then he stepped confidently into his boat and pulled for the landing  eh signor capitano cried vito viti as he met his new prot√©g√© with an air of cordiality as soon as the foot of the latter touched the shore we looked for the pleasure of receiving you into our bosom as it were here in the haven how ingeniously you led off that sans culotte this morning ah the inglese are the great nation of the ocean colombo notwithstanding the vicegovernatore told me all about your illustrious female admiral elisabetta and the spanish armada and there was nelsoni and now we have smees  raoul accepted these compliments both national and personal in a very gracious manner squeezing the hand of the podest√† with suitable cordiality and condescension acting the great man as if accustomed to this sort of incense from infancy as became his public situation as well as his character he proposed paying his duty immediately to the superior authorities of the island  king george my master continued raoul as he and vito viti walked from the quay toward the residence of andrea barrofaldi is particularly pointed on this subject with us all in his personal orders never enter a port of one of my allies smeet he said the very last time i took leave of him without immediately hastening with your duty to the commandant of the place you never lose anything by being liberal in politeness and england is too polished a country to be outdone in these things by even the italians the parents of modern civilization  you are happy in having such a sovrano and still more so in being allowed to approach his sacred person  oh as to the last the navy is his pet he considers us captains in particular as his children never enter london my dear smeet he said to me without coming to the palace where you will always find a fatheryou know he has one son among us who was lately a captain as well as myself  san stefano and he the child of a great king i did not know that i confess signore  why it is a law in england that the king shall give at least one son to the marine yes said his majesty always be prompt in calling on the superior authorities and remember me benevolently and affectionately to them one and all even down to the subordinate magistrates who live in their intimacy  raoul delighted in playing the part he was now performing but he was a little addicted to overacting it like all exceedingly bold and decided geniuses he was constantly striding across that step which separates the sublime from the ridiculous and consequently ran no small hazard in the way of discovery but with vito viti he incurred little risk on this score provincial credulity and a love of the marvellous coming in aid of his general ignorance to render him a safe depository of anything of this sort that the other might choose to advance vito viti felt it to be an honor to converse with a man who in his turn had conversed with a king and as he puffed his way up the steep ascent again he did not fail to express some of the feelings which were glowing in his breast  is it not a happiness to serve such a prince he exclaimednay to die for him  the latter is a service i have not yet performed answered raoul innocently but which may one day well happen do you not think podest√† that he who lays down his life for his prince merits canonization  that would fill the calendar too soon in these wars signor smees but i will concede you the generals and admirals and other great personages sia general or an admiral who dies for his sovereign does deserve to be made a saintthis would leave these miserable french republicans signore without hope or honor  they are canaille from the highest to the lowest and can reasonably expect nothing better if they wish to be canonized let them restore the bourbons and put themselves lawfully in the way of such a blessing the chase of this morning signor vito viti must at least have amused the town  the podest√† wanted but this opening to pour out a history of his own emotions sensations and raptures he expatiated in glowing terms on the service the lugger had rendered the place by leading off the rascally republicans showing that he considered the manoeuvre of passing the port instead of entering it as one of the most remarkable of which he had ever heard or even read  i defied the vicegovernatore to produce an example of a finer professional inspiration in the whole range of history beginning with his tacitus and ending with your new english work on roma i doubt if the elder pliny or mark antony or even caesar ever did a finer thing signore and i am not a man addicted to extravagance in compliments had it been a fleet of vessels of three decks instead of a little lugger christendom would have rung with the glory of the achievement  had it been but a frigate my excellent friend the manoeuvre would have been unnecessary peste it is not a single republican ship that can make a stout english frigate skulk along the rocks and fly like a thief at night  ah there is the vicegovernatore walking on his terrace sir smees and dying with impatience to greet you we will drop the subject for another occasion and a bottle of good florence liquor  the reception which andrea barrofaldi gave raoul was far less warm than that he received from the podest√† though it was polite and without any visible signs of distrust  i have come signor vicegovernatore said the privateersman in compliance with positive orders from my master to pay my respects to you again and to report my arrival once more in your bay though the cruise made since my last departure has not been so long as an east india voyage  short as it has been we should have reason to regret your absence signore were it not for the admirable proofs it has afforded us of your resources and seamanship returned andrea with due complaisance to own the truth when i saw you depart it was with the apprehension that we should never enjoy this satisfaction again but like your english sir cicero the second coming may prove even more agreeable than the first  raoul laughed and he even had the grace to blush a little after which he appeared to reflect intensely on some matter of moment smiles struggled round his handsome mouth and then he suddenly assumed an air of sailorlike frankness and disclosed his passing sensations in words  signor vicegovernatore i ask the favor of one moments private conference signor vito viti give us leave a single moment if you please i perceive signore continued raoul as he and andrea walked a little aside that you have not easily forgotten my little fanfaronade about our english cicero but what will you havewe sailors are sent to sea children and we know little of books my excellent father milord smeet had me put in a frigate when i was only twelve an age at which one knows very little of ciceros or dantes or corneilles even as you will confess thus when i found myself in the presence of a gentleman whose reputation for learning has reached far beyond the island he so admirably governs a silly ambition has led me into a folly that he finds it hard to forgive if i have talked of names of which i know nothing it may be a weakness such as young men will fall into but surely it is no heinous crime  you allow signore that there has been no english sir cicero  the truth compels me to say i know nothing about it but it is hard for a very young man and one too that feels his deficiencies of education to admit all this to a philosopher on a first acquaintance it becomes a different thing when natural modesty is encouraged by a familiar goodness of heart and a days acquaintance with the signor barrofaldi is as much as a year with an ordinary man  if this be the case sir smees i can readily understand and as willingly overlook what has passed returned the vicegovernatore with a selfcomplacency that in nothing fell short of that which vito viti had so recently exhibited it must be painful to a sensitive mind to feel the deficiencies which unavoidably accompany the want of opportunities for study and i at least can now say how delightful it is to witness the ingenuousness which admits it then if england has never possessed a cicero in name doubtless she has had many in qualifications after allowing for the halo which time ever throws around a reputation should your duty often call you this way signore during the summer it will add to the pleasure i experience in enjoying the advantage of your acquaintance to be permitted in some slight degree to direct your reading to such works as with a mind like yours will be certain to lead to profit and pleasure  raoul made a suitable acknowledgment for this offer and from that moment the best understanding existed between the parties the privateersman who had received a much better education than he pretended to and who was a consummate actor as well as on certain occasions a practised flatterer determined to be more cautious in future sparing his literary conjectures whatever liberties he might take with other subjects and yet this reckless and daring mariner never flattered nor deceived ghita in anything with her he had been all sincerity the influence he had obtained over the feelings of that pureminded girl being as much the result of the nature and real feeling he had manifested as of his manly appearance and general powers of pleasing it would have been indeed matter of interesting observation for one curious in the study of human nature to note how completely the girls innocence and simplicity of character had extended itself over every act of the young man that was any way connected with her preventing his even feigning that religion which he certainly did not feel and the want of which was the sole obstacle to the union he had now solicited for near a twelvemonth and which of all others was the object by far the closest to his heart with andrea barrofaldi and vito viti and most especially with the hated english it was a very different thing however and seldom was raoul happier than when he was employed in precisely such a scene of mystification as that in which he was at that moment engaged  the vicegovernatore having established relations so completely amicable with the signor smees could do no less than invite his guest to enter the palazzo along with himself and the podest√† as it was yet too light for the sailor to seek an interview with ghita he cheerfully accepted the offer making a careful examination of the whole of the northern margin of the sea from his elevated position however before he crossed the threshold this little delay on raouls part enabled the podest√† to have a passing word with his friend unobserved  you have found sir smees said vito viti with earnestness all that your wisdom and prudence could desire i trust for my part i consider him a most interesting youth one destined at some future time to lead fleets and dispose of the fortunes of nations  he is more amiable and even better informed than i had thought neighbor vito viti he gives up his sir cicero with a grace that causes one regret it was necessary and like yourself i make no doubt of his becoming an illustrious admiral in time it is true his father milordo smees has not done justice to his education but it is not too late yet to repair that evil go desire him to enter for i am impatient to draw his attention to certain works that may be useful to one in his line of life  at this suggestion the podest√† returned to the door in order to usher the imaginary guernseyman into the residence he found raoul still standing on the entrance examining the sea there were two or three coasters feluccas as usual stealing along the coast in the italian fashion equally afraid of the barbarians of the south shore and of the french of the north all these would have been good prizes but to do the privateersman justice he was little in the habit of molesting mariners of so low a class there was one felucca however that was just rounding the promontory coming in from the north and with the people of this craft he determined to have some communication as soon as he returned to the port with a view to ascertain if she had fallen in with the frigate just as he had come to this resolution the podest√† joined him and he was ushered into the house  it is unnecessary to give the discourse which succeeded it related more to literature and matters in general than to anything connected with our tale the worthy vicegovenatore being disposed to reward the ingenuousness of the young sailor by furnishing him as much instruction as the time and circumstances would allow raoul bore this very well waiting patiently for the light to disappear when he felt a perfect confidence of again meeting ghita on the promenade as he had discovered how much more safety there was in diffidence than in pretension he found his task of deception comparatively easy and by letting the vicegovernatore have his own way he not only succeeded in gaining that functionary over to a full belief in his assumed nationality but in persuading him to believe the signor smees a young man of even more erudition than he had at first supposed by means as simple and natural as these raoul made more progress in the good graces of andrea barrofaldi in the next two hours than he could have done in a year by setting up his own knowledge and reading as authority  there is little doubt that the vicegovernatore found this interview agreeable from the time he was disposed to waste on it and it is certain raoul thought it some of the hardest duty in which he had ever been engaged as for vito viti he was edified and he did not care to conceal it giving frequent manifestations of his satisfaction by expressions of delight occasionally venturing a remark as if expressly to betray his own ignorance  i have often known you great vicegovernatore he cried when andrea had closed a dissertation on the earlier history of all the northern nations which lasted fully half an hour but never so great as you are tonight signore you have been most illustrious this evening is it not so signor smees could any professor of pisa or even of papua do more justice to a subject than we have seen done to this to which we have been listening  signor podest√† added raoul but one feeling has prevailed in my mind while attending to what has been said and that has been deep regret that my profession has cut me off from all these rich stores of profound thought but it is permitted us to admire that even which we cannot imitate  quite true signori answered andrea with gentle benevolence but with dispositions like yours sir smees it is not so very difficult to imitate what we admire i will write out a list of works which i would recommend to your perusal and by touching at livorno or napoli you will obtain all the books at reasonable prices you may expect to see the list on your breakfast table tomorrow morning as i shall not sleep until it is completed  raoul gladly seized upon this promise as a hint to depart and he took his leave with suitable acknowledgments of gratitude and delight when he got out of the palazzo however he gave a long low whistle like a man who felt he had escaped from a scene in which persecution had been a little lightened by the ridiculous and uttered a few curses on the nations of the north for being so inconsiderate as to have histories so much longer and more elaborate than he conceived to be at all necessary all this passed as he hastened along the promenade which he found deserted every human being having apparently left it at length he thought he perceived a female form some distance ahead of him and in a part of the walk that was never much frequented hastening toward it his quick eye discerned the person of her he sought evidently waiting for his approach  raoul exclaimed ghita reproachfully in what will these often repeated risks finally end when so fairly and cleverly out of the harbor of porto ferrajo why did you not possess the prudence to remain there  thou knowst the reason ghita and why ask this question san nettuno was it not handsomely done and is not this brave vicegovernatore rarely mystifiedi sometimes think ghita i have mistaken my vocation which should have been that of a diplomate  and why a diplomate in particular raoulthou art too honest to deceive long whatever thou mayst do on an occasion like this and in a pressing emergency  whybut no matter this andrea barrofaldi and this vito viti will one day know why and now to our business ghita since le feufollet cannot always decorate the bay of porto ferrajo  true interrupted the girl and i have come for no other purpose than to say as much myself my dear uncle has arrived and he intends to sail for the torri with the first felucca  therethis has done more to make me believe in a providence than all the preaching of all the padri of italy here is the lugger to take the place of the felucca and we can sail this very night my cabin shall be yours entirely and with your uncle for a protector no one can raise an evil tongue against the step  ghita to own the truth expected this very offer which agreeable as it was her sense of propriety would certainly have prevented her from accepting but for one consideration it might be made the means of getting raoul out of an enemys port and in so much out of harms way this with one of her affectionate heart was an object to which she would have sacrificed appearances of even a graver character we do not wish the reader however to get a false impression of this girls habits and education although the latter in many particulars was superior to that received by most young women of her class in life the former were simple and suited to her station as well as to the usages of her country she had not been brought up with that severe restraint which regulates the deportment of the young italian females of condition perhaps in a degree just as much too severely as it leaves the young american too little restrained but she had been taught all that decorum and delicacy required either for the beautiful or the safe and her notions inculcated the inexpediency if not the impropriety of one in her situation taking a passage in a privateer at all and particularly so one commanded by an avowed lover but on the other hand the distance between porto ferrajo and the towers was only about fifty miles and a few hours would suffice to place her in safety beneath her own roof and what was of more importance in her view just then raoul in safety along with her on all this had she pondered and she was consequently prepared with an answer to the proposal that had just been made  if my uncle and myself could accept this generous offer when would it be convenient for you to sail raoul the girl demanded we have now been absent longer than we intended and longer than we ought  within an hour if there were any wind but you see how it is ghita the zephyr has done blowing and it now seems as if every fan of italy had gone to sleep you can depend on our sailing the instant it shall be in our power at need we will use the sweeps  i will then see my uncle and mention to him that there is a vessel about to sail in which we had better embark is it not odd raoul that he is profoundly ignorant of your being in the bay he gets more and more lost to things around him every day and i do believe he does not recollect that you command an enemys vessel half the time  let him trust to me he shall never have occasion to know it ghita  we are assured of that raoul the generous manner in which you interposed to save us from the corsair of the algerines which began our acquaintance and for which we shall always have occasion to bless you has made peace between you and us for ever but for your timely succor last summer my uncle and myself would now have been slaves with barbarians  that is another thing that inclines me to believe in a providence ghita little did i know when rescuing you and your good kinsman from the boat of the algerine who i was saving and yet you see how all has come to pass and that in serving you i have merely been serving myself  would thou couldst learn to serve that god who disposes of us all at his holy pleasure murmured ghita tears forcing themselves to her eyes and a convulsive effort alone suppressing the deep emotion with which she uttered the words but we thank thee again and again raoul as the instrument of his mercy in the affair of the algerine and are willing to trust to thee now and always it will be easy to induce my uncle to embark but as he knows thy real character when he chooses to recollect it i hardly think it will do to say with whom we must arrange an hour and a place to meet when i will see to his being there and in readiness  raoul and ghita next discussed the little details a place of rendezvous without the town a short distance below the winehouse of benedetta being selected in preference to choosing one that would necessarily subject them to observation this portion of the arrangements was soon settled and then ghita thought it prudent to separate in this proposal her companion acquiesced with a better grace than he might have done had he not the girls assurance of meeting him within an hour in order that everything might be ready for a start with the first appearance of wind  when left alone raoul bethought him that ithuel and filippo were on shore as usual the new hampshire man consenting to serve only on condition of being allowed to land a privilege he always abused by driving a contraband trade on occasions like the present so great was the fellows dexterity in such matters that raoulwho disdained smuggling while he thought himself compelled to wink at it in othershad less apprehensions of his committing the lugger than he might have felt in the case of one less cunning but it was now necessary to get these two men off or abandon them and fortunately remembering the name of the winehouse where they had taken their potations the previous night he repaired to it without delay luckily finding ithuel and his interpreter deep in the discussion of another flask of the favorite tuscan beverage maso and his usual companions were present also and there being nothing unusual in the commander of an english ship of wars liking good liquor raoul to prevent suspicion drew a chair and asked for his glass by the conversation that followed the young privateersman felt satisfied that though he might have succeeded in throwing dust into the eyes of the vicegovernatore and the podest√† these experienced old seamen still distrusted his character it was so unusual a thing for a french frigate while it was so usual for an english frigate to be standing along the coast near in that these mariners who were familiar with all such matters had joined this circumstance to the suspicious signs about the lugger and were strongly disposed to believe the truth concerning both vessels to all this however raoul was more indifferent than he might have been but for the arrangement to sail so soon he took his wine therefore with apparent indifference and in proper season withdrew carrying with him ithuel and the genoese      chapter viii        within our bay one stormy night      the isles men saw boats make for shore      with here and there a dancing light      that flashed on man and oar      when hailed the rowing stopped and all was dark      ha lantern workwell home theyre playing shark       dana  it was dark when raoul quitted the governmenthouse leaving andrea barrofaldi and vito viti in the library of the former no sooner was the young seamans back turned than the vicegovernatore who was in a humor to display his acquirements resumed a discussion that he had found so agreeable to his selfesteem  it is easy to see good vito viti that this young inglese is a gentle of noble birth though not of a liberal education he said doubtless his father milordo smees has a large family and the usages of england are different from those of italy in respect to birthright there the eldest son alone inherits the honors of the family while the cadets are put into the army and navy to earn new distinctions nelsoni is the son of a priest i hear  cospetto of a padre signor vicegovernatore interrupted the podest√†it is most indecent to own it a priest must be possessed of the devil himself to own his issue though issue he may certainly have  there again good vito it is different with the luterani and us catholics the priests of england you will please remember marry while ours do not  i should not like to be shrived by such a padre the man would be certain to tell his wife all i confessed and the saints could only say what would be the end ont porto ferrajo would soon be too hot to hold an honest manaye or even an honest woman in the bargain  but the luterani do not confess and are never shrived at all you will remember  san stefanohow do they expect then ever to get to heaven  i will not answer that they do friend vitoand we are certain that if they have such expectations they must be most treacherous to them but talking of this sir smees you perceive in his air and manner the finesse of the anglosaxon race which is a people altogether distinct from the ancient gauls both in history and character pietro giannone in his storia civile del regno di napoli speaks of the normans who were a branch of these adventurers with great interest and particularity and i think i can trace in this youth some of the very peculiarities that are so admirably delineated in his welltold but too free writings well pietro i was not speaking of thee but of a namesake of thine of the family of giannone an historian of naples of note and meritwhat is thy will  this question was put to a servant who entered at that moment holding in his hand a piece of paper which he desired to lay before his master  a cavaliere is without signor andrea who asks the honor of an audience and who sends in his name as your eccellenza will find it on this paper  the vicegovernatore took the slip of paper and read aloud edward griffin tenente della marina inglesa  ah here is an officer sent from ze vingyving with some communication friend vito it is fortunate you are still here to hear what he has to say show the lieutenant in pietro  one who understood englishmen better than andrea barrofaldi would have been satisfied at a glance that he who now entered was really a native of that country he was a young man of some two or three and twenty of a ruddy round goodnatured face wearing an undress coat of the service to which he professed to belong and whose whole air and manner betrayed his profession quite as much as his country the salutations he uttered were in very respectable italian familiarity with the language being the precise reason why he had been selected for the errand on which he had come after these salutations he put a piece of parchment into andreas hand remarking  if you read english signore you will perceive by that commission i am the person i represent myself to be  doubtless signor tenente you belong to ze vingyving and are a subordinate of sir smees  the young man looked surprised and at the same time half disposed to laugh though a sense of decorum suppressed the latter inclination  i belong to his britannic majestys ship proserpine signore he dryly answered and know not what you mean by the vingyving captain cuffe of that ship the frigate you saw off your harbor this morning has sent me down in the felucca that got in this evening to communicate intelligence concerning the lugger which we chased to the southward about nine oclock but which i see is again snug at her anchor in this bay our ship was lying behind capraya when i left her but will be here to take me off and to hear the news before daylight should the wind ever blow again  andrea barrofaldi and vito viti stared and that too as if a messenger had come from the lower regions to summon them away for their misdeeds lieutenant griffin spoke unusually good italian for a foreigner and his manner of proceeding was so straightforward and direct as to carry with it every appearance of truth  you do not know what i mean by ze vingyving demanded the vicegovernatore with emphasis  to be frank with you i do not signore vingyving is not english nor do i know that it is italian  mr griffin lost a good deal of ground by this assertion which implied a doubt of andreas knowledge of foreign tongues  you say signor tenente if i comprehend your meaning that vingyving is not english  indeed i do sir at least no english that i have ever heard spoken at sea or ashore and we seamen have a language of our own  will you then permit me to ask you what is the translation of ala e ala word for word  the lieutenant paused a moment and pondered then he laughed involuntarily checking himself almost immediately with an air of respect and gravity  i believe i now understand you signor vicegovernatore he said we have a seaphrase something like this to describe a foreandaft vessel with her sails swinging off on both sides but we call it wingandwing  si signorevingyving such is the name of the lugger of your king that now lies in our bay  ah we thought as much signori the scoundrel has deceived you as he has done a hundred before you and will do a hundred again unless we catch him tonight the lugger is a celebrated french privateer that we have six cruisers in chase of at this moment our own ship included she is called le feufollet which is not wingandwing but willothewisp or jackolantern in english and which you in italian would call il fuoco fatuo her commander is raoul yvard than whom there is not a greater desperado sailing out of france thought it is admitted that the fellow has some goodnay some noble qualities  at every word uttered by the lieutenant a page of history was blotted out from the memory of his listener the vicegovernatore had heard the name of raoul yvard and even that of le feufollet which the malignancy of a bitter war had blackened nearly to the hues of piracy the thought that he had been the dupe of this corsairnay that he had actually been entertaining him with honors and hospitality within an hourwas almost too much for his philosophy men do not often submit to such humiliating sensations without a struggle and before he would or could accord full credence to what was now told him it was natural to oppose the objections that first offered  all this must be a mistake observed the vicegovernatore there are english as well as french luggers and this is one of the former her commander is a noble english gentleman a son of milordo smees and though his education has been in a trifling degree neglected he shows his origin and national character in all he says and does ze vingyving is commanded by sir smees a young officer of merit as you must have seen yourself signore by his evolutions this very morning surely you have heard of il capitano sir smees the son of milordo smees  we do not deny that his escape this morning was a clever thing vicegovernatore for the fellow is a seaman every inch of him and he is as brave as a lion but then he is as impudent as a beggars dog there is no sir smees nor sir anybody else in command of any of our luggers anywhere in the mediterranean we have no cruiser of this rig at all and the two or three we have elsewhere are commanded by old seadogs who have been brought up in that sort of craft as for sirs they are scarce out here though the battle of the nile has made a few of them for the navy then youll not meet with a noblemans sort in a clipper like this for that sort of gentry generally go from a frigates quarterdeck into a good sloop as commander and after a twelvemonths work or so in the small one into a fast frigate again as a postcaptain  much of this was gibberish to andrea barrofaldi but griffin being exclusively naval he fancied every one ought to take the same interest as he did himself in all these matters but while the vicegovernatore did not understand more than half of the others meaning that half sufficed to render him exceedingly uneasy the natural manner of the lieutenant too carried conviction with it while all the original impressions against the lugger were revived by his statements  what say you signor vito viti demanded andrea you have been present at the interviews with sir smees  that we have been deceived by one of the most oilytongued rogues that ever took in honest men if we have been deceived at all vicegovernatore last evening i would have believed this but since the escape and return of the lugger i could have sworn that we had an excellent friend and ally in our bay  you had your signals signor tenente and that is proof of amity and understanding  we made our number when we saw the lugger with an english ensign set for we did not suppose a frenchman would be quietly lying in a tuscan port but the answer we got was nonsense and then we remembered to have heard that this raoul yvard was in the habit of playing such tricks all along the italian coast once on the scent we were not the men to be easily thrown off it you saw the chase and know the result  there must be some error in all this would it not be well signore to see the commander of the luggeror to go on board of her and satisfy yourself with your own eyes of the truth or falsehood of your surmises ten minutes might clear up everything  your pardon signor vicegovernatore were i to trust myself on board le feufollet i might remain a prisoner until a peace was made and i have yet two steps to gain before i can afford that risk then as to letting yvard know of my presence here it would just give him the alarm and cause us to lose the bird before we can spring the net my orders are positive not to let any one but the authorities of the island know of my visit or its object all we ask of you is to detain the lugger until morning then we will see to it that she will never trouble the italian coast again  nay signore we have guns of our own and could easily dispose of so small a vessel once assured of her being an enemy returned the vicegovernatore with a little pride and loftiness of manner convince us of that fact and well sink the lugger at her anchors  that is just what we do not wish you to do signore answered the lieutenant with interest from what passed this morning captain cuffe has thought it probable that monsieur yvard for some reason best known to himself would come back here as soon as he was rid of us or that finding himself on the south side of the island he might put into porto longone and had i not met him here i was to get a horse and ride across to the latter place and make my arrangements there we wish by all means to get possession of the lugger which in smooth water is the fastest craft in the mediterranean and would be of infinite service to us we think the proserpine would prove too much for her blowing fresh but in moderate weather she will go six feet to our five now if you open on her she will either escape or be sunk for raoul yvard is not a man to strike to a town all i ask is to be permitted to make nightsignals for which i am prepared as soon as the frigate approaches and that you will throw all the delays by means of forms and permits in the way of the frenchmans sailing until tomorrow morning we will answer for the rest  i should think there would be but little danger of the luggers departing in the night signor tenente her commander rather expressing an intention of passing several days with us and it is this ease and confidence of his which cause me to think that he cannot be the person you take him for why should raoul yvard and le feufollet come into porto ferrajo at all  no one knows it is the mans habit and doubtless he has reasons for it tis said he has even been in at gibraltar and it is certain he has cut several valuable storeships out of our convoys there is an austrian loading with iron i perceive in the harbor probably he is waiting for her to fill up and finds it easier to watch her at an anchor than by lying outside  you naval gentlemen have ways known only to yourselves all this may be so but it seems an enigma to me have you any other proofs of your own character signor tenente than the commission you have shown me for sir smees as i have been taught to call the commander of the lugger has one too that has an air of as much authenticity as this you have shown and he wears quite as englishlooking a uniform how am i to judge between you  that difficulty has been foreseen signor vicegovernatore and i come well provided with the necessary proofs i handed you my commission as that is a document which if wanting might throw a distrust on all other proofs but here is a communication from your superior at florence recommending us to the kindness of the authorities of all the tuscan ports which you will readily understand captain cuffe has furnished me with other proofs which you can look over at your leisure  andrea barrofaldi now set about a cautious and deliberate examination of the papers shown him they proved to be of a nature to remove every doubt and it was not possible to distrust the party that presented them this was a great deal toward convicting the signore smees of imposition though both the vicegovernatore and the podest√† were of opinion that captain cuffe might yet be mistaken as to the identity of the lugger  it is impossible signori answered the lieutenant we know every english cruiser in these seas by name and description at least and most of them by sight this is none and everything about her particularly her sailing betrays her real name we hear there is a man in her who once belonged to our own ship a certain ithuel bolt  cospetto exclaimed the podest√† then we must set down this sir smees after all for an arrant rogue for this is the very man we met at benedettas the past night an americano signor tenente is he not  why the fellow pretends to be some such thing answered the young man coloring for he was loath to confess the wrong that had been done the deserter but half the british seamen one falls in with nowadays call themselves americans in order to escape serving his majesty i rather think this rascal is a cornish or a devonshire man he has the twang and the nasal singsong of that part of the island if an american however we have a better right to him than the french speaking our language and being descended from a common ancestry and having a common character it is quite unnatural for an american to serve any but the english  i did not know that vicegovernatore i thought the americani a very inferior sort of people to us europeans generally and that they could scarcely claim to be our equals in any sense  you are quite right signor podest√† said the lieutenant briskly they are all you think them and any one can see that at a glance degenerate englishmen we call them in the service  and yet you take them occasionally signor tenente and as i understand from this ithuello frequently contrary to their wishes and by force dryly observed andrea barrofaldi  how can we help it signore the king has a right to and he has need of the services of all his own seamen and in the hurry of impressing we sometimes make a mistake then these yankees are so like our own people that i would defy the devil himself to tell them apart  the vicegovernatore thought there was something contradictory in all this and he subsequently said as much to his friend the podest√† but the matter went no further at the moment most probably because he ascertained that the young lieutenant was only using what might be termed a national argument the english government constantly protesting that it was impossible to distinguish one people from the other quoad this particular practice while nothing was more offensive to their eyes in the abstract than to maintain any affinity in appearance or characteristics  the result of the discussion notwithstanding was to make the two italians reluctant converts to the opinion of the englishman that the lugger was the dreaded and obnoxious feufollet once convinced however shame revenge and mortification united with duty to quicken their exertions and to render them willing assistants in executing the schemes of captain cuffe it was perhaps fortunate for raoul and his associates that the english officers had so strong a desire as griffin expressed it to take the lugger alive else might she have been destroyed where she lay by removing a gun or two from its proper embrasure and planting them behind some natural ramparts among the rocks the night was dark it is true but not so much so as to render a vessel indistinct at the short distance at which le feufollet lay and a cannonade would have been abundantly certain  when all parties were of a mind as to the true character of the little craft in the bay a consultation was had on the details of the course proper to be pursued a window of the governmenthouse that looked toward the direction of capraya or that in which the proserpine was expected to arrive was assigned to griffin the young man took his station at it about midnight in readiness to burn the bluelights with which he was provided the instant he should discern the signals of his ship the position of this window was well adapted to the desired object inasmuch as the lights could not be seen from the town while they were plainly open to the sea the same was essentially true as to the signals of the frigate the heights interposing between her and the houses and there being a still greater physical impossibility that anything lying in the bay should discover an object at sea on the northern side of the promontory  in this manner then did hour after hour pass away a light landbreeze blowing but coming so directly into the bay as to induce raoul not to lift his kedge ghita and her uncle carlo giuntotardi had come off about ten but there were still no signs of movement on board the lugger to own the truth raoul was in no hurry to sail for the longer his departure was protracted the longer would he have the happiness of retaining the lovely girl on board and the zephyr of the succeeding day would be almost certain to carry le feufollet up to the islandlike promontory of monte argentaro the point where stood the watchtowers of which carlo was the keeper and in one of which he resided under these circumstances therefore it is not surprising that the rising of the landbreeze was overlooked or at least disregarded and that raoul sat conversing with ghita on deck until long past midnight ere he allowed her to seek her little cabin where everything had been properly arranged for her reception to own the truth raoul was so confident of having completely mystified all on shore that he felt no apprehensions from that quarter and desirous of prolonging his present happiness as much as possible he had very coolly determined not to sail until the southerly air of the morning should come which as usual would just suffice to carry him well into the canal when the zephyr would do the rest little did this hardy adventurer suspect what had occurred on shore since he quitted it nor was he at all aware that tommaso tonti was at watch in the harbor ready to report the slightest indication on the part of the lugger of a wish to quit the bay  but while raoul was so indifferent to the danger he ran the feeling was quite the reverse with ithuel bolt the proserpine was the bane of this mans life and he not only hated every stick and every timber in her but every officer and man who was attached to herthe king whose colors she wore and the nation whose interest she served an active hatred is the most restless of all passions and this feeling made ithuel keenly alive to every chance which might still render the frigate dangerous to the lugger he thought it probable the former would return in quest of her enemy and expressly with a view to this object when he turned in at nine he left orders to be called at two that he might be on the alert in season  ithuel was no sooner awaked when he called two trusty men whom he had prepared for the purpose entered a light boat that was lying in readiness on the off side of the lugger and pulled with muffled oars toward the eastern part of the bay when sufficiently distant from the town to escape observation he changed his course and proceeded directly out to sea half an hour sufficed to carry the boat as far as ithuel deemed necessary leaving him about a mile from the promontory and so far to the westward as to give him a fair view of the window at which griffin had taken post  the first occurrence out of the ordinary course of things that struck the american was the strong light of a lamp shining through an upper window of the governmenthousenot that at which the lieutenant was posted but one above itand which had been placed there expressly as an indication to the frigate that griffin had arrived and was actively on duty it was now two oclock or an hour or two before the appearance of light and the breeze off the adjoining continent was sufficiently strong to force a good sailing vessel whose canvas had been thickened by the damps of night some four knots through the water and as capraya was less than thirty miles from porto ferrajo abundant time had been give to the proserpine to gain her offing that ship having come from behind her cover as soon as the sun had set and the haze of evening settled upon the sea  ithuel usually so loquacious and gossiping in his moments of leisure was silent and observant when he had anything serious on hand his eye was still on the window in which the lamp was visible the pure olive oil that was burning in it throwing out a clear strong flame when suddenly a bluelight flashed beneath the place and he got a momentary glimpse of the body of the man who held it as he leaned forward from another window the motion which now turned his head seaward was instinctive it was just in time to let him detect a light descending apparently into the water like a falling star but which in fact was merely a signal lantern of the proserpine coming rapidly down from the end of her gaff  ah dn you said ithuel grating his teeth and shaking his fist in the direction of the spot where this transient gleam of brightness had disappearedi know you and your old tricks with your lanterns and nightsignals here goes the answer  as he said this he touched a rocket of which he had several in the boat with the lighted end of the cigar he had been smoking and it went hissing up into the air ascending so high as to be plainly visible from the deck of le feufollet before it exploded griffin saw this signal with wonder the frigate noted it with embarrassment for it was far to seaward of the lamp and even maso conceived it necessary to quit his station in order to report the circumstance to the colonel whom he was to call in the event of any unusual occurrence the common impression however among all these parties was that a second cruiser had come through the canal from the southward in the course of the night and that she wished to notify the proserpine of her position probably expecting to meet that ship off the island  on board le feufollet the effect was different the landbreeze of italy is a sidewind to vessels quitting the bay of porto ferrajo and two minutes after the rocket exploded the luggerwas gliding almost imperceptibly and yet at the rate of a knot or two under her jigger and jib toward the outer side of the port or along the very buildings past which she had brushed the previous day this movement was made at the critical instant when maso was off his watch and the ordinary sentinels of the works had other duties to attend to so light was this little vessel that a breath of air set her in motion and nothing was easier than to get three or four knots out of her in smooth water especially when she opened the comparatively vast folds of her two principal lugs this she did when close under the citadel or out of sight of the town the sentinels above hearing the flaps of her canvas without exactly understanding whence they came at this instant ithuel let off a second rocket and the lugger showed a light on her starboard bow so concealed however on all sides but one as to be visible only in the direction of the boat as this was done she put her helm hard down and hauled her foresheet over flat to windward five minutes later ithuel had reached her deck and the boat was hauled in as if it had been inflated silk deceived by the second rocket the proserpine now made her number with regular signal lanterns with the intention of obtaining that of the stranger trusting that the promontory would conceal it from the vessels in the bay this told raoul the precise position of his enemy and he was not sorry to see that he was already to the westward of her a fact that permitted him to slip round the island again so near in as to be complete concealed by the background of cliffs by the aid of an excellent nightglass too he was enabled to see the frigate distant about a league under everything that would draw from her royals down standing toward the mouth of the bay on the larboard tack having made her calculations so accurately as to drop into windward of her port with the customary breeze off the land at this sight raoul laughed and ordered the mainsail taken in half an hour later he directed the foresail to be brailed brought his jiggersheet in flat put his helm hard down and hauled the jibsheet to windward  as this last order was executed day was just breaking over the mountains of radicofani and aquapendente by this time le feufollet lay about a league to the westward of the promontory and abreast of the deep bay that has been already mentioned as being in that direction from the town of course she was far beyond the danger of missiles from the land the night wind however had now failed and there was every appearance that the morning would be calm in this there was nothing extraordinary at that season the winds which prevailed from the south being usually short and light unless accompanied by a gust just as the sun appeared the south air came it is true but so lightly as to render it barely possible to keep the little lugger in command by heavingto with her head to the southwest  the proserpine stood in until the day had advanced far enough to enable her lookouts to detect le feufollet braving her as it might be in the western board at the distance of about a league and a half under her jib and jigger as described this sight produced a great commotion in the ship even the watch below tumbling up to get another sight of a craft so renowned for evading the pursuit of all the english cruisers of those seas a few minutes later griffin came off chopfallen and disappointed his first glance at the countenance of his superior announced a coming storm for the commander of a vessel of war is no more apt to be reasonable under disappointment than any other potentate captain cuffe had not seen fit to wait for his subordinate on deck but as soon as it was ascertained that he was coming off in a shoreboat he retired to his cabin leaving orders with the first lieutenant whose name was winchester to send mr griffin below the instant he reported himself  well sir commenced cuffe as soon as his lieutenant came into the aftercabin without offering him a seathere we are and out yonder two or three leagues at sea is the dd fewfolly for so most of the seamen of the english service pronounced feufollet  i beg your pardon captain cuffe answered griffin who found himself compelled to appear a delinquent whatever might be the injustice of the stiuation it could not be helped we got in in proper time and i went to work with the deputygovernor and an old chap of a magistrate who was with him as soon as i could get up to the house of the first yvard had been beforehand with me and i had to underrun about a hundred of his lying yarns before i could even enter the end of an idea of my own  you speak italian sir like a neapolitan born and i depended on your doing everything as it should have been  not so much like a neapolitan i hope captain cuffe as like a tuscan or a roman returned griffin biting his lip after an hour of pretty hard and lawyerlike work and overhauling all the documents i did succeed in convincing the two elban gentry of my own character and of that of the lugger  and while you were playing advocate master raoul yvard coolly lifted his anchor and walked out of the bay as if he were just stepping into his garden to pick a nosegay for his sweetheart  no sir nothing of the sort happened as soon as i had satisfied the signor barrofaldi the vicegovernatore  veechygovernthetory dn all veechys and dn all the governatorys too do speak english griffin on board an english ship if you please even should your italian happen to be tuscan call the fellow vicegovernor at once if that be his rank  well sir as soon as i had satisfied the vicegovernor that the lugger was an enemy and that we were friends everything went smoothly enough he wanted to sink the lugger as she lay at her anchor  and why the devil didnt he do it two or three heavy shot would have given her a stronger dose than she could bear  you know captain cuffe it has all along been your wish to take her alive i thought it would tell so well for the ship to have it to say she had caught le feufollet that i opposed the project i know mr winchester hopes to get her as a reward for carrying her himself  aye and that would make you first well sir even if you didnt sink her it was no reason for letting her escape  we could not prevent it captain cuffe i had a lookout set upon herone of the very best men in porto ferrajo as everybody will tell you sir and i made the signals of the lamp and the bluelights as agreed upon and the ship answering i naturally thought all was as it should be until  and who burnt the rockets off here where we are at this moment they deceived me for i took them to be signals of their presence from the weasel or the sparrow when i saw those rockets griffin i was just as certain of the fewfolly as i am now of having my own ship  yes sir those rockets did all the mischief for i have since learned that as soon as the first one was thrown master yvard tripped his kedge and went out of the bay as quietly as one goes out of a diningroom when he dont wish to disturb the company  aye he took french leave the by sans culotte returned the captain putting himself in a better humor with his own pun but did you see nothing of all this  the first i knew of the matter sir was seeing the lugger gliding along under the rocks so close in that you might have jumped aboard her and it was too late to stop her before those lazy far nientes could have pricked and primed she was out of gunshot  lazy what demanded the captain  far nientes sir which is a nickname we give these siestagentry you know captain cuffe  i know nothing about it sir and ill thank you always to speak to me in english mr griffin that is a language which i flatter myself i understand and its quite good enough for all my wants  yes sir and for any mans wants im sure i am sorry i can speak italian since it has led to this mistake  pohpohgriffin you mustnt lay everything to heart that comes wrong end foremost dine with me today and well talk the matter over at leisure    chapter ix        now in the fervid noon the smooth bright sea      heaves slowly for the wandering winds are dead      that stirred it into foam the lonely ship      rolls wearily and idly flap the sails      against the creaking masts the lightest sound      is lost not on the ear and things minute      attract the observant eye       richardson  thus terminated the settingdown like many others that captain cuffe had resolved to give but which usually ended in a return to goodnature and reason the steward was told to set a plate for mr griffin among the other guests and then the commander of the frigate followed the lieutenant on deck here he found every officer in the ship all looking at le feufollet with longing eyes and most of them admiring her appearance as she lay on the mirrorlike mediterranean with the two light sails just holding her stationary  a regularbuilt snakeinthegrass growled the boatswain mr strand who was taking a look at the lugger over the hammock cloths of the waist as he stood on the heel of a spare topmast to do so i never fell in with a scamp that had a more dnmyeyes look  this was said in a sort of soliloquy for strand was not exactly privileged to address a quarterdeck officer on such an occasion though several stood within hearing and was far too great a man to enlighten his subordinates with his cogitations it was overheard by cuffe however who just at that instant stepped into the gangway to make an examination for himself  it is a snakeoutof the grass rather strand observed the captain for he could speak to whom he pleased without presumption or degradation had she stayed in port now she would have been in the grass and we might have scotched her  well your honor we can english her as it is and thatll be quite as natral and quite as much to the purpose as scotching her any day answered strand who being a native of london had a magnificent sort of feeling toward all the dependencies of the empire and to whom the word scotch in that sense was greek though he well understood what it meant to clap a scotchman on a rope we are likely to have a flat calm all the morning and our boats are in capital order and then nothing will be more agreeable to our gentlemen than a row  strand was a grayheaded seaman and he had served with captain cuffe when the latter was a midshipman and had even commanded the top of which the present boatswain had been the captain he knew the cut of the captains jib better than any other man in the proserpine and often succeeded with his suggestions when winchester and the other lieutenants failed his superior now turned round and looked him intently in the face as if struck with the notion the other thus indirectly laid before him this movement was noted and at a sign secretly given by winchester the whole crew gave three hearty cheers strand leading off as soon as he caught the idea this was the only manner in which the crew of a manofwar can express their wishes to their commander it being always tolerated in a navy to hurrah by way of showing the courage of a ships company cuffe walked aft in a thoughtful manner and descended to his cabin again but a servant soon came up to say that the captain desired to see the first lieutenant  i do not half like this boatservice in open daylight winchester observed the senior beckoning to the other to take a chair the least bungling may spoil it all and then its ten to one but your ship goes halfmanned for a twelvemonth until you are driven to pressing from colliers and neutrals  but we hope sir therell be no bungling in anything that the proserpine undertakes nine times in ten an english manofwar succeeds when she makes a bold dash in boats against one of these picaroons this lugger is so low in the water too that it will be like stepping from one cutter into another to get upon her decks and then sir i suppose you dont doubt what englishmen will do  aye winchester once on her deck i make no doubt youd carry her but it may not be so easy as you imagine to get on her deck of all duty to a captain this of sending off boats is the most unpleasant he cannot go in person and if anything unfortunate turns up he never forgives himself now its a very different thing with a fight in which all share alike and the good or evil comes equally on all hands  quite true captain cuffe and yet this is the only chance that the lieutenants have for getting ahead a little out of the regular course i have heard sir that you were made commander for cutting out some coasters in the beginning of the war  you have not been misinformed and a devil of a risk we all ran luck saved usand that was all one more fire from a cursed carronade would have given a flemish account of the whole party for once get a little under and you suffer like game in a batteau captain cuffe wished to say battue but despising foreign languages he generally made sad work with them whenever he did condescend to resort to their terms however familiar this raoul yvard is a devil incarnate himself at this boarding work and is said to have taken off the head of a masters mate of the theseus with one clip of his sword when he retook that ships prize in the affair of last winterthat which happened off alicant  ill warrant you sir the masters mate was some slendernecked chap that might better have been at home craning at the girls as they come out of a churchdoor i should like to see raoul yvard or any frenchman who was ever born take off my head at a single clip  well winchester to be frank with you i should not you are a good first and that is an office in which a man usually wants all the head he has and im not at all certain you have any to spare i wonder if one could not hire a felucca or something larger than a boat in this place by means of which we could play a trick upon this fellow and effect our purpose quite as well as by going up to him in our open boats bulldog fashion  no question of it at all sir griffin says there are a dozen feluccas in port here all afraid to budge an inch in consequence of this chaps being in the offing now one of these trying to slip along shore might just serve as a bait for him and then he would be famously hooked  i think i have it winchester you understand we have not yet been seen to communicate with the town and luckily our french colors have been flying all the morning our head too is inshore and we shall drift so far to the eastward in a few minutes as will shut in our hull if not our upper sails from the lugger where she now lies as soon as this is done you shall be off with forty picked men for the shore engage a felucca and come out stealing along the rocks as close as you can as if distrusting us in due time we will chase you in the boats and then you must make for the lugger for protection as fast as you can when betwixt the two ill answer for it you get this master yvard by fair means or foul  winchester was delighted with the scheme and in less than five minutes orders were issued for the men to be detailed and armed then a conference was held as to all the minor arrangements when the ship having become shut in from the lugger by the promontory as expected the boats departed half an hour later or just as the proserpine after wearing had got near the point where the lugger would be again open the boats returned and were run up presently the two vessels were again in sight of each other everything on board of each remaining apparently in statu quo thus far certainly the stratagem had been adroitly managed to add to it the batteries now fired ten or twelve guns at the frigate taking very good care not to hit her which the proserpine returned under the french ensign having used the still greater precaution of drawing the shot all this was done by an arrangement between winchester and andrea barrofaldi and with the sole view to induce raoul yvard to fancy that he was still believed to be an englishman by the worthy vicegovernatore while the ship in the offing was taken for an enemy a light air from the southward which lasted from eight to nine oclock allowed the frigate to get somewhat more of an offing the while placing her seemingly beyond the reach of danger  during the prevalence of the light air mentioned raoul yvard did not see fit to stir tack or sheet as it is termed among seamen le feufollet remained so stationary that had she been by compass from any station on the shore her direction would not have varied a degree the whole time but this hour of comparative breeze sufficed to enable winchester to get out of the harbor with la divina providenza the felucca he had hired and to round the promontory under the seeming protection of the guns by which it was crowned coming in view of the lugger precisely as the latter relieved her man at the helm for ten oclock there were eight or nine men visible on the feluccas deck all dressed in the guise of italians with caps and striped shirts of cotton thirtyfive men were concealed in the hold  thus far everything was favorable to the wishes of captain cuffe and his followers the frigate was about a league from the lugger and half that distance from la divina providenza the latter had got fairly to sea and was slowly coming to a situation from which it might seem reasonable and a matter of course for the proserpine to send boats in chase while the manner in which she gradually drew nearer to the lugger was not such as to excite distrust or to appear in the least designed the wind too had got to be so light as to favor the whole scheme  it is not to be supposed that raoul yvard and his followers were unobservant of what was passing it is true that the latter wilfully protracted his departure under the pretence that it was safer to have his enemy in sight during the day knowing how easy it would be to elude him in the dark but in reality that he might prolong the pleasure of having ghita on board and it is also true that he had passed a delightful hour that morning in the cabin but then his understanding eye noted the minutest fact that occurred and his orders were always ready to meet any emergency that might arise very different was the case with ithuel the proserpine was his bane and even while eating his breakfast which he took on the heel of the bowsprit expressly with that intent his eye was seldom a minute off the frigate unless it was for the short period she was shut in by the land it was impossible for any one in the lugger to say whether her character was or was not known in porto ferrajo but the circumstance of the bluelights burnt in the governmenthouse itself and witnessed by ithuel rendered the latter to say the least probable and induced more caution than might otherwise have been shown still there was no reason to suspect the character of the felucca and the confident manner in which she came down toward the lugger though considerably inshore of her gave reason to believe that she at least was ignorant that le feufollet was an enemy  that felucca is the craft which lay near the landing quietly observed raoul who had now come on the forecastle with a view to converse with ithuel her name is la divina providenza she is given to smuggling between leghorn and corsica and is probably bound to the latter at this moment it is a bold step too to stand directly for her port under such circumstances  leghorn is a free port returned ithuel and smuggling is not needed  aye free as to friends but not free to come and go between enemies no port is free in that sense it being treason for a craft to communicate with the foe unless she happen to be le feufollet observed raoul laughing we are privileged mon brave  corsica or capraya shell reach neither today unless she find more wind i do not understand why the man has sailed with no more air than will serve to blow out a pockethandkerchief  these little feluccas like our little lugger slip along even when there seems to be no wind at all then he may be bound to bastia in which case he is wise in getting an offing before the zephyr sets in for the afternoon let him get a league or two out here more to the northwest and he can make a straight wake to bastia after his siesta is over  aye there go those greedy englishmen ater him said ithuel its as i expected let em see the chance of making a guinea and theyll strive for it though it be agin law or agin natur now what have they to do with a neapolitan felucca england being a sworn friend of naples  raoul made no reply to this but stood watching the movement in silence the reader will readily enough understand that ithuels remark was elicited by the appearance of the boats which five in number at that instant pulled off from the frigates side and proceeded steadily toward the felucca  it may be necessary now to mention the relative positions of the parties the hour and the precise state of the weather with a view to give the reader clear ideas of the events that succeeded le feufollet had not materially changed her place since her jibsheet was first hauled over she still lay about a league a little northofwest from the residence of andrea barrofaldi and in plain view of it a deep bay being south of her and abeam no alterations had been made in her canvas or her helm most of the first being still in the brails and the latter down as the head of the frigate had been kept to the westward for the last hour she had forged some distance in that direction and was now quite as near the lugger as was the promontory though nearly two miles off the land her courses were hauled up on account of the lightness of the air but all her upper sails stood and were carefully watched and trimmed in order to make the most of the catspaws or rather of the breathings of the atmosphere which occasionally caused the royals to swell outward on the whole she might be drawing nearer to the lugger at the rate of about a knot in an hour la divina providenza was just out of gunshot from the frigate and about a mile from the lugger when the boats shoved off from the former though quite near the land just opening the bay so often named the boats of course were pulling in a straight line from the vessel they had just left toward that of which they were in pursuit  as to the time the day had advanced as far as eleven which is a portion of the twentyfour hours when the mediterranean in the summer months is apt to be as smooth as a mirror and as calm as if it never knew a tempest throughout the morning there had been some irregularity in the currents of air the southerly breeze generally light and frequently fickle having been even more light and baffling than common still as has been seen there was sufficient air to force a vessel through the water and had raoul been as diligent as the people of the two other craft he might at that moment have been off the western end of the island and far out of harms way as it was he had continued watching the result but permitting all the other parties gradually to approach him  it must be allowed that the ruse of the felucca was well planned and it now seemed about to be admirably executed had it not been for ithuels very positive knowledge of the shiphis entire certainty of her being his old prison as he bitterly called herit is not improbable that the luggers crew might have been the dupe of so much wellacted ingenuity and as it was opinions were greatly divided raoul himself being more than half disposed to fancy that his american ally for once was wrong and that the ship in sight was actually what she professed to bea cruiser of the republic  both winchester who was in la divina providenza and griffin who commanded the boats played their parts in perfection they understood too well the character of the wily and practised foe with whom they had to deal to neglect the smallest of the details of their wellconcerted plan instead of heading toward the lugger as soon as the chase commenced the felucca appeared disposed to enter the bay and to find an anchorage under the protection of a small battery that had been planted for this express purpose near its head but the distance was so great as obviously to render such an experiment bootless and after looking in that direction a few minutes the head of la divina providenza was laid off shore and she made every possible effort to put herself under the cover of the lugger all this was done in plain view of raoul whose glass was constantly at his eye and who studied the smallest movement with jealous distrust winchester fortunately for his purpose was a darkcomplexioned man of moderate stature and with bushy whiskers such as a manofwarsman is apt to cultivate on a long cruise and in his red phrygian cap striped shirt and white cotton trousers he looked the italian as well as could have been desired the men in sight too had been selected for their appearance several of them being actually foreigners born on the shores of the mediterranean it being seldom indeed that the crew of an english or an american vessel of war does not afford a representation of half the maritime nations of the earth these men exhibited a proper degree of confusion and alarm too running to and fro as soon as the chase became lively exerting themselves but doing it without order and concert at length the wind failing almost entirely they got out two sweeps and began to pull lustily the real as well as the apparent desire being to get as near as possible to the lugger  peste exclaimed raoul all this seems rightwhat if the frigate should be french after all these men in the boats look like my brave compatriotes  they are regular john bulls answered ithuel positively and the ship is the spiteful proserpyne for so the new hampshire man always called his old prison as for them french hats and the way they have of rowing they act it all for a takein just let a sixpound shot in among em and see how theyll throw off their french airs and take to their english schooling  ill not do that for we might injure a friend what are those fellows in the felucca about now  why theyve got a small gunyes its a twelvepound carronade under the tarpaulin forrard of their foremast and theyre clearin it away for sarvice we shall have something doin fore the end of the week  bienit is as you sayand voil√† they train the piece on the boats  as this was said the felucca was half concealed in smoke then came the discharge of the gun the shot was seen skipping along the water at a safe distance from the leading boat certainly and yet sufficiently near to make it pass for indifferent gunnery this leading boat was the proserpines launch which carried a similar carronade on its grating forward and not half a minute was suffered to pass before the fire was returned so steady were the men and so nicely were all parts of this plot calculated that the shot came whistling through the air in a direct line for the felucca striking its mainyard about halfway between the mast and the peak of the sail letting the former down by the run  human natur ejaculated ithuelthis is acting up to the contract dollars and cents captain rule they shoot better in sport than when theyre in downright airnest  this looks like real work answered raoul a man does not often shoot away the mainyard of his friend on purpose  as soon as the crews of the boats saw the end of the yard come down they ceased rowing and gave three hearty cheers taking the signal from griffin who stood erect in the stern of the launch to give it  bah cried raoulthese are english john bulls without a shadow of doubt who ever knew the men of the republic shout like so many italian fantoccini pulled by wires ah messieurs les anglais you have betrayed your secret by your infernal throats now look to hear us tell the remainder of the story  ithuel rubbed his hands with delight perfectly satisfied that raoul could no longer be deceived though the fire between the felucca and the launch was kept up with spirit the shooting being such as might have done credit to a bona fide conflict all this time the sweep of the felucca were plied the boats advancing at least two feet to the chases one la divina providenza might now have been three hundred yards from the lugger and the launch the nearest of the pursuers about the same distance astern of the felucca ten minutes more would certainly bring the seeming combatants alongside of each other  raoul ordered the sweeps of le feufollet to be run out and manned at the same time her guns twelvepound carronades were cast loose and primed of these she had four of a side while the two sixes on her forecastle were prepared for similar service when everything was ready the twelve sweeps dropped into the water as by a common instinct and a powerful effort started the lugger ahead her jib and jigger were both brailed at that instant a single minute sufficed to teach winchester how hopeless pursuit would be in the felucca if not in the boats themselves should the lugger endeavor to escape in this manner it being quite practicable for her strong crew to force her through the water by means of her sweeps alone from three to three and a half knots in the hour but flight did not appear to be her object for her head was laid toward la divina providenza as if deceived by the artifice of the english she intended to prevent the capture of the felucca and to cover a friend  raoul however understood himself far better than this supposition would give reason to suppose he swept the lugger up in a line with la divina providenza and the boats in the first place as the position in which she would be the least likely to suffer from the fire of the latter well knowing that whatever shot were thrown were purposely sent so high as to do no mischief and in the second place that he might bring his enemies in a single range from his own guns in the mean while the felucca and the boats not only continued to use their carronades but they commenced on both sides a brisk fire of musketry the former being now distant only a hundred yards from le feufollet exceedingly hard pressed by her adversaries so far as appearances were concerned there being no wind at all at this juncture the little there had been having been entirely killed by the concussions of the guns the sea was getting to be fast covered with smoke the felucca in particular showing more than common of the wreathy canopy over her decks and about her spars for in truth powder was burnt in considerable quantities in different parts of the vessel with this express object ithuel observed too that in the midst of this confusion and cloud the crew of la divina providenza was increasing in numbers instead of diminishing by the combat four sweeps next being out each manned by three men while near twenty more were shortly visible running to and fro and shouting to each other in a language that was intended to be italian but which sounded much more in his practised ears like bastard english the felucca was not fifty yards distant when this clamor became the loudest and the crisis was near the cheers of the boats on the other side of her proclaimed the quick approach of griffin and his party the bows of la divina providenza having been laid in a species of blind haste directly in a line which would carry her athwarthawse of le feufollet  mes enfans shouted raoulsoyez calmesfire  the whole of the five guns loaded heavily with canister were discharged into the smoke of la divina providenza the shrieks that succeeded sufficiently proclaimed with what effect a pause of solemn wondering silence followed on the part of the english and then arose a manly shout as if prepared for every contingency they were resolved to brave the worst the boats were next seen coming round the bows and stern of the felucca dashing earnestly at their real enemy while their two carronades returned the fire this time loaded and aimed with deadly intent but it was too late for success as griffin in the launch came out of la divina providenza smoke he saw the luggers sails all opened and filled with the dying effort of the southerly air so light however was le feufollet that a duck could hardly have sailed away more readily from the fowler than this little craft shot ahead clearing the smoke and leaving her pursuers an additional hundred yards behind her as the air seemed likely to stand long enough to place his party in extreme jeopardy under the fire of the french winchester promptly ordered the boats to relinquish the pursuit and to rally round the felucca this command was reluctantly obeyed when a moment was given to both sides for deliberation  le feufollet had sustained no injury worth mentioning but the english had not less than a dozen men slain or hurt among the latter was winchester himself and as he saw that any success which followed would fall principally to the share of his subordinate his wound greatly indisposed him to pursue any further a struggle that was nearly hopeless as it was not so with raoul yvard however perceiving that the frigate had taken the breeze as well as himself and that she was stealing along in the direction of the combatants he determined to take an ample revenge for the audacity of the attempt and then proceed on his voyage  the lugger accordingly tacked and passed to windward of the felucca delivering a close and brisk fire as she approached at first this fire was returned but the opposition soon ceased and when le feufollet ranged up past her adversary a few yards to windward it was seen that the english had deserted her to a man carrying off their wounded the boats were pulling through the smoke toward the bay taking a direction opposite to that in which the luggers head was laid it would have been easy for the french to wear and probably to have overtaken the fugitives sinking or capturing them to a man but there was a touch of high chivalry in the character of raoul yvard and he declared that as the artifice had been ingeniously planned and daringly attempted he would follow up his success no further perhaps the appearance of ghita on deck imploring him to be merciful had its influence it is certain that not another shot did he allow to be fired at the enemy instead of pursuing her advantage in this manner the lugger took in her aftersails wore short round on her heel came to the wind to leeward of the felucca shivered all forward set her jigger again and luffed up so near what may be called the prize that the two vessels came together so gently as not to break an egg as it is termed a single rope secured the felucca to the lugger and raoul ithuel and a few more stepped on board the former  the decks of la divina providenza were reeking with blood and grape and canister were sticking in handfuls in different parts of the vessel three dead bodies were found in her hold but nothing having life was met with on board there was a tarbucket filled at hand and this was placed beneath the hatch covered with all the combustible materials that could be laid hold of and set on fire so active were the flames at that dry season that raoul regretted he had not taken the precaution to awaken them after he had removed his own vessel but the southerly air continuing he was enabled to get to a safe distance before they actually ascended the feluccas rigging and seized upon her sails  ten minutes were thus lost and they had sufficed to carry the boats out of gunshot in shore and to bring the frigate very nearly down within gunshot from the southeast but hauling aft all his sheets raoul soon took the lugger clear of her flaming prize and then she stood toward the west end of elba going as usual in so light an air three feet to the frigates two the hour however was not favorable to the continuance of the breeze and in ten more minutes it would have puzzled the keenest senses to have detected the slightest current of air over the surface of the sea such flickerings of the lamp before it burnt entirely out were common and raoul felt certain that there would be no more wind that day until they got the zephyr accordingly he directed all the sails to be hauled up an awning to be spread over the quarterdeck and permission was given to the people to attend to their own affairs the frigate too seemed to be aware that it was the moment for the siesta of vessels as well as of men for she clewed up her royals and topgallantsails brailed her jib and spanker hauled up her courses and lay on the water as motionless as if sticking on a shoal the two vessels were barely long gunshot apart and under ordinary circumstances the larger might have seen fit to attack the smaller in boats but the lesson just given was a sufficient pledge to the french against the renewal of any such attempt and they scarcely paid their neighbors prowess the compliment to watch him half an hour later when winchester got back to the ship limping with a hurt in his leg and with his people exhausted and mortified it was found that the undertaking had cost the lives of seven good men besides the temporary suspension of the services of fifteen more  captain cuffe was aware that his enterprise had failed as soon as he perceived the lugger under her canvas playing around the felucca and the boats held in perfect command but when he discovered the latter pulling for the shore he was certain that they must have suffered and he was prepared to learn a serious loss though not one that bore so large a proportion to the whole numbers of the party sent on the expedition winchester he considerately declined questioning while his wound was being dressed but griffin was summoned to his cabin as soon as the boats were hoisted in and stowed  well mr griffin a dd pretty scrape is this into which you have led me among you with your wish to go boating about after luggers and raoul yvards what will the admiral say when he comes to hear of twentytwo mens being laid on the shelf and a felucca to be paid for as a mornings amusement  really captain cuffe we did our best but a man might as well have attempted to put out vesuvius with snowballs as to stand the canister of that infernal lugger i dont think there was a square yard in the felucca that was not peppered the men never behaved better and down to the moment when we last cheered i was as sure of le feufollet as i ever was of my own promotion  aye they neednt call her le fewfolly any longerthe great folly being a better name what the devil did you cheer for at all sir did you ever know a frenchman cheer in your life that very cheering was the cause of your being found out before you had time to close you should have shouted vive la r√©publique as all their craft do when we engage them a regular english hurrah would split a frenchmans throat  i believe we did make a mistake there sir but i never was in an action in which we did not cheer and when it got to be warmor to seem warmi forgot myself a little but we should have had her sir for all that had it not been for one thing  and what is that pray you know griffin i must have something plausible to tell the admiral it will never do to have it published in the gazette that we were thrashed by our own hallooing  i was about to say captain cuffe that had not the lugger fired her first broadside just as she did and had she given us time to get out of the range of her shot we should have come in upon her before she could have loaded again and carried her in spite of the breeze that so much favored her our having three men hurt in the launch made some difference too and set as many oars catching crabs at a most critical instant everything depends on chance in these matters you know sir and that was our bad luck  umph it will never do to tell nelson that everything was going well my lord until three of the launchs people went to work catching crabs with their oars which threw the boat astern no no that will never do for a gazette let me see griffin after all the lugger made off from you you would have had her had she not made sail and stood to the southward and westward on a bowline  yes sir she certainly did that had she not made sail as you say nothing could have prevented our getting alongside  well then she ran wind sprung up enemy made sailevery attempt to get alongside unsuccessful brave fellows cheering and doing their utmost not so bad an account after all but how about that dd felucca you see she is burned to the waters edge and will go down in a few minutes  very true captain cuffe but not a frenchman entered her while we were there  yes i now see how it wasthrew all hands into the boats in chase the felucca being too unwieldy and every effort to get alongside unsuccessful hes a devil of a fellow that nelson and bronte and i had rather hear the thunder of ten thousand tempests than get one of his tempestuous letters well i think i understand the affair now and shall speak of you all as you deserve twas a gallant thing though it failed you deserved success whatever may have caused you to lose it  in this captain cuffe was nearer right than in anything else he uttered on the occasion    chapter x        oh tis a thought sublime that man can force      a path upon the waste can find a way      where all is trackless and compel the winds      those freest agents of almighty power      to lend them untamed wings and bear him on      to distant climes       ware  the situation of ghita caraccioli on board the lugger was of the most unpleasant nature during the fierce struggle we have related fortunately for her this struggle was very short raoul having kept her in profound ignorance of the approach of any danger until the instant le feufollet commenced her fire it is true she heard the guns between the felucca and the boats but this she had been told was an affair in which the privateer had no participation and the reports sounding distant to one in the cabin she had been easily deceived while the actual conflict was going on she was on her knees at the side of her uncle and the moment it ceased she appeared on deck and interposed to save the fugitives in the manner related  now however the scene was entirely changed the lugger had escaped all damage worthy of notice her decks had not been stained with blood and her success had been as complete as could be desired in addition to these advantages the result removed all apprehension from the only source of danger that raoul thought could exist as between his own vessel and the frigate of a boatattack in a calm for men who had just been so roughly handled in an enterprise so well concealed would not be likely to renew the attempt while they still smarted under the influence of the late repulse affairs of this sort exact all the discipline and resolution that a wellregulated service can afford and are not to be thought of under the temporary demoralization of defeat all in the lugger therefore considered this collision with the proserpine at an end for the moment at least  ghita had dined for the day had now turned some time and the girl had come on deck to escape the confinement of a very small cabin leaving her uncle to enjoy his customary siesta she was seated under the awning of the quarterdeck using her needle as was her wont at that hour on the heights of argentaro raoul had placed himself on a gunslide near her and ithuel was busy within a few feet of them dissecting a spyglass with a view to clean its lenses  i suppose the most excellent andrea barrofaldi will sing a te deum for his escape from our fangs suddenly exclaimed raoul laughing pardie he is a great historian and every way fit to write an account of this glorious victory which monsieur langlais l√† bas is about to send to his government  and you raoul have no occasion for a te deum after your escape demanded ghita gently and yet with emphasis is there no god for you to thank as well as for the vicegovernatore  pesteour french deity is little thought of just now ghita republics as you know have no great faith in religionis it not so mon brave am√©ricain tell us etooel have you any religion in america  as ithuel had often heard raouls opinions on this subject and knew the prevailing state of france in this particular he neither felt nor expressed any surprise at the question still the idea ran counter to all his own notions and prejudices he having been early taught to respect religion even when he was most serving the devil in a word ithuel was one of those descendants of puritanism who godward as it is termed was quite unexceptionable so far as his theory extended but who manward was as the scribes and pharisees nevertheless as he expressed it himself he always stood up for religion a fact that his english companions had commented on in jokes maintaining that he even stood up when the rest of the ships company were on their knees  im a little afraid monsieur rule he answered that in france you have entered the rope of republicanism at the wrong end in ameriky we even put religion before dollars and if that isnt convincing ill give it up now i do wish you could see a sunday once in the granite state signorina ghita that you might get some notion what our western religion raally is  all real religionall real devotion to godis or ought to be the same signor ithuello whether in the east or in the west a christian is a christian let him live or die where he may  thats not exactly platform i fancy why lord bless ye young lady your religion now is no more like mine than my religion is like that of the archbishop of canterburys or monsieur rules here  la mienne exclaimed raouli pretend to none mon brave there can be no likeness to nothing  ghitas glance was kind rather than reproachful but it was profoundly sorrowful  in what can our religion differ she asked if we are both christians americans or italians it is all the same  that comes of knowing nothing about ameriky said ithuel filled with the conceit of his own opinion of himself and of the part of the world from which he came in the first place you have a pope and cardinals and bishops and all such things in your religion while we have none  certainly there is the holy father and there are cardinals but they are not my religion answered ghita looking surprised bishops it is true are appointed of god and form part of his church and the bishop of rome is the head of the church on earth but nothing more  nothing more dont you worship images and take off and put on garments at your prayers and kneel down in a makebelieve profane way and dont you turn everything into vain ceremonies  had ithuel been engaged body and soul in maintaining one of the propositions of the oxford tracts controversy he could not have uttered these words with greater zeal or with a more selfrighteous emotion his mind was stored with the most vulgar accusations of an exceedingly vulgar set of sectarian distinctions and he fancied it a high proof of protestant perfection to hold all the discarded usages in abhorrence on the other hand ghita listened with surprise for to her the estimation in which the rites of the roman church are held by the great bulk of protestants was a profound secret the idea of worshipping an image never crossed her innocent mind and although she often knelt before her own little ivory crucifix she had never supposed any could be so ignorant as to confound the mere material representation of the sacrifice it was meant to portray with the divine expiation itself  it is decent to use proper vestments at the altar she replied and its servants ought not to be clad like other men we know it is the heart the soul that must be touched to find favor with god but this does not make the outward semblance of respect that we show even to each other the less necessary as to worshipping imagesthat would be idolatry and as bad as the poor heathens themselves  ithuel looked mystified for he never doubted in the least that the worshipping of images was a material part of catholic devotion and as for the pope and the cardinals he deemed them all as indispensable to the creed of this church as he fancied it important in his own that the priests should not wear gowns and that the edifices in which they worshipped should have squaretopped windows absurd as all this may seem today and wicked as it will probably appear a century hence it formed and forms no small part of sectarian belief and entered into the animosities and jealousies of those who seem to think it necessary to quarrel for the love of god could we but look back at our own changes of opinion it would render us less confident of the justice of our sentiments and most of all one would think that the american who has lived long enough to witness the somersets that have been thrown in the practices and creeds of most of the more modern sects of his own country within the last quarter of a century would come to have something like a suitable respect for the more stable and venerable divisions of the christian world  proper vestments repeated ithuel with contempt what vestments are wanting in the eyes of the supreme being no if i must have religionand i know its necessary and whullsomlet it be a pure naked religion that will stand to reason is not that your way of thinking monsieur rule  ma foi oui reason before all things ghita and most of all reason in religion  ah raoul this it is which misleads and betrays you returned the girl earnestly faith and a meek dependence is what makes a proper state of feeling and yet you demand a reason of him who created the universe and breathed into you the breath of life  are we not reasoning creatures ghita returned raoul gently and yet with a sincerity and truth for the circumstances that rendered even his scepticism piquant and respectable and is it unreasonable to expect us to act up to our natures can i worship a god i do not understand  couldst thou worship one thou didst he would cease to be a deity and would become one of ourselves were his nature and attributes brought down to the level of our comprehensions did one of thy followers come on this quarterdeck and insist on hearing all thine own motives for the orders given in this little felucca how readily wouldst thou drive him back as mutinous and insolent and yet thou wouldst question the god of the universe and pry into his mysteries  raoul was mute while ithuel stared it was so seldom that ghita lost her exceeding gentleness of manner that the flush of her cheek the severe earnestness of her eyes the impassioned modulations of her voice and the emphasis with which she spoke on this occasion produced a sort of awe that prevented the discourse from proceeding further the girl herself was so much excited that after sitting for a minute with her hands before her face the tears were seen forcing their way through her fingers she then arose and darted into the cabin raoul was too observant of the rules of propriety to think of following but he sat moody and lost in thought until ithuel drew his attention to himself  gals will be gals said that refined and philosophical observer of the human family and nothing touches their naturs sooner than a little religious excitement i dare say if it wasnt for images and cardinals and bishops and such creaturs the italians ithuel always pronounced this word eyetalians would make a very good sort of christians  but raoul was in no humor to converse and as the hour had now arrived when the zephyr was to be expected he rose ordered the awning to be taken in and prepared to make himself master of the state of things around him there lay the frigate taking her siesta like all near her three topsails standing but every other sail that was loose hanging in festoons waiting for the breeze notwithstanding her careless appearance so closely had she been tended for the last few hours however and so sedulously had even the smallest breath of air been improved that raoul started with surprise when he found how much nearer she was than when he had last looked at her the whole trick was apparent to him at a glance and he was compelled to acknowledge his own remissness when he perceived that he lay within the reach of the shot of his powerful foe though still so distant as to render her also a little uncertain more especially should a set get up the felucca had burnt to the waters edge but owing to the smoothness of the water her wreck still floated and was slowly setting into the bay there being a slight current in that direction where she now lay the town was basking in the afternoons sun though hid from view and the whole island of elba had the appearance of being asleep  what a siesta said raoul to ithuel as both stood on the heel of the bowsprit looking curiously at the scene sea land mountains bourgeois and mariners all dozing bien there is life yonder at the west and we must get further from votre proserpine call the hands monsieur lieutenant let us get our sweeps and put the head of le feufollet the other way peste the lugger is so sharp and has such a trick of going exactly where she looks that i am afraid she has been crawling up toward her enemy as the child creeps into the fire that burns its fingers  all hands were soon in motion on board le feufollet the sweeps were on the point of being handled when the jigger fluttered and the first puff of the expected western breeze swept along the surface of the waters to the seamen it was like inhaling oxygen gas every appearance of drowsiness deserted the people of both vessels and every one was instantly busy in making sail raoul had a proof into what dangerous proximity to the frigate he had got by the sound of the calls on board her and the stillness of the sea was yet so great that the creaking of her foreyard was actually audible to him as the english rounded in their braces briskly while laying their foretopsail aback  at that moment a second respiration of the atmosphere gave birth to the breeze raoul whistled for the wind and the lugger moved ahead gliding toward the frigate but in half a minute she had gathered sufficient way her helm was put down and she came round as easily and as gracefully as the bird turns on his wing not so with the heavier frigate she had hauled in her starboard headbraces and had to get the foretopsail aback and to pay well off with her head to leeward in order to swing her yards and fill her sails while le feufollet was slipping through the water going seemingly into the winds eye by this single evolution the lugger gained more than a cables length on her enemy and five minutes more would have put her beyond all immediate danger but captain cuffe knew this as well as his competitor and had made his preparations accordingly keeping his headyards aback he knocked his ship round off until her broadside bore on the lugger when he let fly every gun of his starboard batteries the utmost care having been taken to make the shot tell twentytwo heavy roundshot coming in at once upon a little craft like le feufollet was a fearful visitation and the boldest held their breath for a time as the iron whirlwind whistled past them fortunately the lugger was not hulled but a grave amount of mischief was done aloft the jiggermast was cut in two and flew upward like a pipestem a serious wound was given to the mainmast below the hounds and the yard itself was shivered in the slings no less than six shot plunged through both lugs leaving holes in the canvas that made it resemble a beggars shirt and the jibstay was cut in two halfway between the masthead and the end of the bowsprit no one was hurt and yet for a moment every one looked as if destruction had suddenly lighted on the lugger then it was that raoul came out in his true colors he knew he could not spare a stitch of canvas just at that moment but that on the next ten minutes depended everything nothing was taken in therefore to secure spars and sails but all was left to stand trusting to the lightness of the breeze which usually commenced very moderately hands were immediately set to work to get up a new stay a new mainyard and sail were got along and everything was prepared for hoisting both as soon as it could be ascertained that the mast would bear them nearly similar preparations were made forward as the shortest way of getting rid of the torn foresail for that it was the intention to unbend and bend the yard being sound  luckily captain cuffe determined to lose no more time with his guns but swinging his headyards the frigate came sweeping up to the wind and in three minutes everything was trimmed for the utmost all this time le feufollet had not stood still her canvas fluttered but it held on and even the spars kept their places though so much injured in a word the wind was not yet strong enough to tear the one or to carry away the other it was an advantage too that these casualties particularly the loss of her jigger rendered le feufollet less weatherly than she would otherwise have been since by keeping the frigate directly in her wake she was less exposed to the chaseguns than she would have been a little on either bow of this truth raoul was soon persuaded the proserpine beginning to work both her bowguns as soon as she came to the wind though neither exactly bore the shot of one ranging a little to windward and the other about as much on the other side by these shot too the young frenchman soon had the satisfaction of seeing that notwithstanding her injuries the lugger was drawing aheada fact of which the english became so sensible themselves that they soon ceased firing  so far things went better than raoul had reason at first to hope though he well knew that the crisis was yet to come the westerly wind often blew fresh at that period of the day and should it now increase he would require all his canvas to get clear of a ship with the known qualities of the vessel in chase how much longer his mast or his mainyard would stand he did not know but as he was fast gaining he determined to make hay while the sun shone and get far enough ahead if possible before the breeze grew fresh to enable him to shift his sails and fish his spars without being again brought within the reach of visitors as rude as those who had so lately come hurtling into his thin hamper the proper precautions were not neglected in the mean time men were sent aloft to do what they could under the circumstances with the two spars and the strain was a little relieved by keeping the lugger as much away as might be done without enabling the frigate to set her studdingsails  there is always something so exciting in a chase that seamen never fail to wish for more wind forgetful that the power which increases their own speed may also increase the speed of the other party and that too in an undue proportion it would have been more favorable to le feufollet to have had less wind than even now blew since her relative rate of sailing was greater in light than in strong breezes raoul knew from ithuels statements that the proserpine was an exceedingly fast ship more especially when it blew fresh and yet it did not appear to him that his lugger got along with sufficient speed though his enemy would be certain to follow at a rate of sailing in a just proportion to his own did there come more wind  the wish of the young privateersman however was soon gratified the wind freshened materially and by the time the two vessels opened the canal of corsica as the passage between that island and elba is called the frigate was obliged to take in her royals and two or three of those light and lofty staysails which it was then the custom for ships to carry at first raoul had thought he might fetch into bastia which lies due west of the southern end of elba but though the wind drew a little down through the canal it soon blew too fresh to allow any formation of the land materially to alter its current the zephyr as the afternoons summer breeze of southern italy in particular was termed by the ancients is seldom a due west wind there generally being a little northing in it as seamen say and as one gets further up the coast this same wind ordinarily comes round the head of corsica blowing from nearly westnorthwest this would have enabled the lugger to lay her course for a deep bay on which lies the town of biguglia could she have been jammed up on a wind as might usually have been done but a few minutes of experiment convinced raoul that he must be more tender on his wounded spars and keep off for the mouth of the golo this was a river of some size into which it was possible for a vessel of a light draught to enter and as there stood a small battery near the anchorage he determined to seek shelter in that haven in order to repair his damages his calculations were made accordingly and taking the snowclad peaks in the neighborhood of corte as his landmarks he ordered the lugger to be steered in the proper direction  on board the proserpine there was scarcely less interest felt in the result than on board le feufollet if the people of the frigate had nothing to apprehend they had something to revenge in addition to the anticipated credit of having captured the boldest privateer that sailed out of france for a short time as the ship came up with the west end of elba it was a serious question whether she would be able to weather it the lugger having gone past within a cables length of the cliffs on the very verge of the breakers and much closer in than the frigate would dare to follow but the last had taken the breeze further off the land than the first and might possibly fetch past the promontory on the tack she was then steering to have gone about would have been to have abandoned the chase as it would have carried the ship off due north while le feufollet was gliding down to the southward and westward at the rate of seven knots the distance across the canal is only about thirty miles and there would not have been time to recover the lost ground  this uncertainty made a most feverish moment on board the proserpine as she came up fast toward the headland all depended on getting by without tacking the appearances were favorable for deep water close in but there is always the danger of rocks to be dreaded near mountainous coasts the promontory too was comparatively low and this was rather an indication that it ought not to be approached too closely winchester was in his berth just beginning to feel the smart of his wound but griffin was at the captains elbow both he and the third lieutenant entering keenly into all their commanders wishes and anxieties  there she goes into the very breakers exclaimed cuffe as they watched le feufollet in her attempt to pass the promontory monsieur yvard must be determined to cast away his craft rather than be taken it will be touch and go with him  i think not captain cuffe answered griffin the coast is bold hereabouts and even the proserpine would find sufficient water there where the lugger now is i hope we shall not be obliged to tack sir  aye this is very well for an irresponsiblebut when it got to a court and punishment i fear that all the last would fall on my shoulders should his majestys ship happen to lay her bones alongshore here no no griffin we must go a clear cables length to windward of that or i go about though raoul yvard were never taken  there he fetches up by george cried yelverton the youngest lieutenant and for a moment it was in truth believed in the frigate that le feufollet as a breaker actually curled directly under her lee was aground but this notion lasted a moment only the little lugger continuing her course as swiftly as before and a minute or two later keeping a little away to ease her spars having been jammed up as close as possible previously in order to weather the extreme end of what was thought to be the dangerous point the frigate was fully two miles astern and instead of losing anything of her vantageground she was kept so near the wind as to be occasionally touching this was the more safe inasmuch as the sea was perfectly smooth and the vessel made no leeway still the frigate looked as it is termed barely up to the point it was deemed indispensable to weather and as ships rarely do better than they look it became a question of serious doubt on board the proserpine as she came up with the headland whether she could clear it  i am afraid captain cuffe we shall never clear it with a goodenough berth sir observed the fidgeting griffin it seems to me the ship sets unaccountably to leeward today  she never behaved better griffin i am really in hopes there is a slight current offshore here if anything we actually open the highlands of corsica by this promontory you see that the wreck of la divina providenza is sweeping round the bay and is coming out to windward again  that may serve us indeed all ready in the chains sirshall we make a cast of the lead  cuffe assented and the lead was hove at this moment the ship was going eight knots and the man reported no bottom with fifteen fathoms of line out this was well and two or three subsequent casts confirmed it orders were now given to drag every bowline swigoff on every brace and flattenin all the sheets even the halyards were touched in order that the sails might stand like boards the trying moment was near five minutes must decide the matter  let her shake a little mr yelverton and eat into the wind said cuffe addressing the officer of the watch we must do all we can here for when abreast of the breakers everything must be a rapfull to keep the ship under quick command theremeet her with the helm and give her a good full  this experiment was repeated twice and each time the frigate gained her length to windward though she necessarily lost more than three times that distance in her velocity at length the trial came and a profound silence one in which nervousness and anxiety were blended with hope reigned in the vessel the eyes of all turned from the sails to the breakers from the breakers to the sails and from both to the wake of the ship  at such moments the voice of the leadsman prevails over all other sounds his warning cry is listened to with breathless attention when the songs of a siren would be unheard cast after cast was made as the ship drove on and the answer to cuffes questions was uniformly no bottom sir with fifteen fathoms out but just at this instant arose the regular song from the weather mainchains of by the mark seven this came so suddenly on the captains ear that he sprang upon the taffrail where he could command a full view of all he wanted to see and then he called out in a stentorian voice  heave again sirbe brisk my ladbe brisk  beeetherrrdeeeeeep six followed almost as soon as the captains voice had ceased  readyabout shouted cuffe see all clear gentlemen move lively men more lively  andaaeh halfeffour  stand bywhat the devil are you at sir on that forecastleare you ready forward  all ready sir  down with your helmhard down at once  beeetherrrdeeeep nine  meet herup with your helm haul down your sheets forwardbrail the spankerlet go all the bowlines aft sowell there well she flew round like a top but by jove weve caught her gentlemen drag your bowlines again whats the news from the chains  no bottom sir with fifteen fathoms outand as good a cast too sir as weve had today  soyoure rap fulldont fall offvery well dyce anglice thuskeep her as you are well by the lord griffin that was a shave halffour was getting to be squally in a quarter of the world where a rock makes nothing of pouting its lips fifteen or twenty feet at a time at a mariner we are past it all however and here is the land trending away to the southward like a man in a consumption fairly under our lee a dozen raoul yvards wouldnt lead me into such a dd scrape again  the danger that is over is no longer a danger at all sir answered griffin laughing dont you think captain cuffe we might ease her about half a point that would be just her play and the lugger keeps off a little i rather suspect to ease her mainmast im certain i saw chips fly from it when we dosed her with those twoandtwenty pills  perhaps youre right griffin ease her with the helm a little mr yelverton if master yvard stands on his present course an hour longer biguglia would be too far to windward for him and as for bastia that has been out of the question from the first there is a river called golo into which he might run and that i rather think is his aim four hours however will let us into his secret  and four intensely interesting hours were those which succeeded the wind was a capfull a good fresh westerly breeze which seemed to have started out of the ovenlike heat of a week of intensely hot weather that had preceded it and to have collected the force of two or three zephyrs into one it was not a gale at all nor did it induce either party to think of reefing no trifle would have done that under the circumstances but it caused the proserpine to furl her fore and mizzentopgallantsails and put raoul in better humor with the loss of his jigger when fairly round the headland and at a moment when he fancied the frigate would be compelled to tack the latter had seized an opportunity to get in his foresail to unbend it and to bend and set a new one an operation that took just four minutes by the watch he would have tried the same experiment with the other lug but the mast was scarce worth the risk and he thought the holes might act as reefs and thus diminish the strain in these four hours owing to the disadvantage under which le feufollet labored there was not a difference of half a knot in the distance run by the two vessels though each passed over more than thirty miles of water during this time they had been drawing rapidly nearer to the coast of corsica the mountains of which ragged and crowned with nearly eternal snows had been glittering in the afternoons sun before them though they lay many a long league inland but the formation of the coast itself had now become plain and raoul an hour before the sun disappeared noted his landmarks by which to make for the river he intended to enter the eastern coast of corsica is as deficient in bays and harbors as its western is affluent with them and this golo for which the lugger was shaping her course would never have been thought of as a place of shelter under ordinary circumstances but raoul had once anchored in its mouth and he deemed it the very spot in which to elude his enemy it had shoals off its embouchure and these he rightly enough fancied would induce captain cuffe to be wary  as the evening approached the wind began to decrease in force and then the people of the lugger lost all their apprehensions the spars had all stood and raoul no longer hesitated about trusting his wounded mainmast with a new yard and sail both were got up and the repairs were immediately commenced the superiority of the lugger in sailing was now so great as to put it out of all question that she was not to be overtaken in the chase and raoul at one time actually thought of turning up along the land and going into bastia where he might even provide himself with a new mainmast at need but this idea on reflection he abandoned as too hazardous and he continued on in the direction of the mouth of the golo  throughout the day the proserpine had shown no colors except for the short period when her boats were engaged and while she herself was firing at the lugger the same was the fact with le feufollet though raoul had run up the tricolor as he opened on the felucca and he kept it flying as long as there was any appearance of hostilities as the two vessels drew in near to the land several coasters were seen beating up against the westerly wind or running down before it all of which however seemed so much to distrust the appearance of the lugger as to avoid her as far as was possible this was a matter of indifference to our hero who knew that they were all probably countrymen or at least smugglers who would scarcely reward him for the trouble had he time to bring them to and capture them corsica was then again in the hands of the french the temporary and imperfect possession of the english having terminated three or four years earlier and raoul felt certain of a welcome anywhere in the island and of protection wherever it could be offered such was the state of things when just as the lugger was preparing to enter among the shoals the proserpine unexpectedly tacked and seemed to bestow all her attention on the coasters of which three or four were so near that two fell into her hands almost without an effort to escape  it appeared to raoul and those with him in his little craft that the english seized these insignificant vessels solely with a wish for vengeance since it was not usual for ships of the force of the proserpine to turn aside to molest the poor fishermen and coasters a few execrations followed quite as a matter of course but the intricacy of the channel and the necessity of having all his eyes about him soon drove every other thought from the mind of the dashing privateersman but such as were connected with the care and safety of his own vessel  just as the sun set le feufollet anchored she had chosen a berth sufficiently within the shallow water to be safe from the guns of the frigate though scarcely within the river the latter the depth of the stream hardly permitted though there was all the shelter that the season and weather required the proserpine manifested no intention to give up her pursuit for she too came off the outlet and brought up with one of her bowers about two miles to seaward of the lugger she seemed to have changed her mind as to the coasters having let both proceed after a short detention though it falling calm neither was enabled to get any material distance from her until the landbreeze should rise in these positions the belligerents prepared to pass the night each party taking the customary precautions as to his ground tackle and each clearing up the decks and going through the common routine of duty as regularly as if he lay in a friendly port    chapter xi        the human mind that lofty thing        the palace and the throne      where reason sits a sceptred king        and breathes his judgment tone      oh i who with silent step shall trace      the borders of that haunted place        nor in his weakness own      that mystery and marvel bind      that lofty thingthe human mind       anonymous  it is unnecessary to dwell on the glories of the mediterranean they are familiar to every traveler and books have again and again laid them before the imaginations of readers of all countries and ages still there are lights and shades peculiar to every picture and this of ours has some of its own that merit a passing notice a sunset in midsummer can add to the graces of almost any scene such was the hour when raoul anchored and ghita who had come on deck now that the chase was over and the danger was thought to be past fancied she had never seen her own italy or the blue mediterranean more lovely  the shadows of the mountains were cast far upon the sea long ere the sun had actually gone down throwing the witchery of eventide over the whole of the eastern coast some time before it came to grace its western corsica and sardinia resemble vast fragments of the alps which have fallen into the sea by some accident of nature where they stand in sight of their native beds resembling as it might be outposts to those great walls of europe their mountains have the same formations the same white peaks for no small portion of the year at least and their sides the same mysterious and riven aspect in addition however to their other charms they have one that is wanting in most of switzerland though traces of it are to be found in savoy and on the southern side of the alps they have that strange admixture of the soft and the severe of the sublime and beautiful that so peculiarly characterize the witchery of italian nature such was now the aspect of all visible from the deck of le feufollet the sea with its darkblue tint was losing every trace of the western wind and was becoming glassy and tranquil the mountains on the other side were solemn and grand just showing their ragged outlines along a sky glowing with the pomp that shuts the day while the nearer valleys and narrow plains were mysterious yet soft under the deep shadows they cast pianosa lay nearly opposite distant some twenty miles rising out of the water like a beacon elba was visible to the northeast a gloomy confused pile of mountain at that hour and ghita once or twice thought she could trace on the coast of the main the dim outline of her own hill monte argentaro though the distance some sixty or seventy miles rendered this improbable outside too lay the frigate riding on the glassy surface of the sea her sails furled her yards squared everything about her cared for and in its place until she formed a faultless picture of nautical symmetry and naval propriety there are all sorts of men in a marine as well as in civil life these taking things as they come content to perform their duties in the most quiet manner while others again have some such liking for their vessels as the dandy has for his own person and are never happy unless embellishing them the truth in this as in most other matters lies in a medium the officer who thinks too much of the appearance of his vessel seldom having mind enough to be stow due attention on the great objects for which she was constructed and is sailed while on the other hand he who is altogether indifferent to these appearances is usually thinking of things foreign to his duty and his profession if indeed he thinks at all cuffe was near the just medium inclining a little too much perhaps to the naval dandy the proserpine thanks to the builders of toulon was thought to be the handsomest model then afloat in the mediterranean and like an established beauty all who belonged to her were fond of decorating her and of showing her fine proportions to advantage as she now lay at single anchor just out of gunshot from his own berth raoul could not avoid gazing at her with envy and a bitter feeling passed through his mind when he recalled the chances of fortune and of birth which deprived him of the hope of ever rising to the command of such a frigate but which doomed him seemingly to the fate of a privateersman for life  nature had intended raoul yvard for a much higher destiny than that which apparently awaited his career he had come into active life with none of the advantages that accompany the accidents of birth and at a moment in the history of his great nation when its morals and its religious sentiments had become unsettled by the violent reaction which was throwing off the abuses of centuries they who imagine however that france as a whole was guilty of the gross excesses that disfigured her struggles for liberty know little of the great mass of moral feeling that endured through all the abominations of the times and mistake the crimes of a few desperate leaders and the exaggerations of misguided impulses for a radical and universal depravity the france of the reign of terror even has little more to answer for than the compliance which makes bodies of men the instruments of the enthusiastic the designing and the activeour own country often tolerating error that differs only in the degree under the same blind submission to combinations and impulses this very degree to depending more on the accidents of history and natural causes than any agencies which are to be imputed to the one party as a fault or to the other as a merit it was with raoul as it had been with his countryeach was the creature of circumstances and if the man had some of the faults he had also most of the merits of his nation and his age the looseness on the subject of religion which was his principal defect in the eyes of ghita but which could scarcely fail to be a material one with a girl educated and disposed as was the case with our heroine was the error of the day and with raoul it was at least sincere a circumstance that rendered him with one so truly pious as the gentle being he loved the subject of a holy interest which in itself almost rivalled the natural tenderness of her sex in behalf of the object of her affections  while the short engagement with the boats lasted and during the few minutes he was under the fire of the frigate raoul had been himself the excitement of actual war always nerving him to deeds worthy of his command and the high name he had acquired but throughout the remainder of the day he had felt little disposed to strife the chase once assured that his spars were likely to stand gave him little concern and now that he was at anchor within the shallow water he felt much as the traveler who has found a comfortable inn after the fatigue of a hard days ride when ithuel suggested the possibility of a nightattack in boats he laughingly reminded the american that the burnt child dreads the fire and gave himself no great concern in the matter still no proper precaution was neglected raoul was in the habit of exacting much of his men in moments of necessity but at all other times he was as indulgent as a kind father among obedient and respectful children this quality and the nevervarying constancy and coolness that he displayed in danger was the secret of his great influence with them every seaman under his orders feeling certain that no severe duty was required at his hands without a corresponding necessity for it  on the present occasion when the people of le feufollet had supped they were indulged in their customary dance and the romantic songs of provence were heard on the forecastle a lighthearted gayety prevailed that wanted only the presence of woman to make the scene resemble the evening amusement of some hamlet on the coast nor was the sex absent in the sentiment of the hour or wholly so in person the songs were full of chivalrous gallantry and ghita listened equally touched and amused she sat on the taffrail with her uncle standing at her side while raoul paced the quarterdeck stopping in his turn to utter some thought or wish to ears that were always attentive at length the song and the dance ended and all but the few who were ordered to remain on watch descended to their hammocks the change was as sudden as it was striking the solemn breathing stillness of a starlit night succeeded to the light laugh melodious song and spirited merriment of a set of men whose constitutional gayety seemed to be restrained by a species of native refinement that is unknown to the mariners of other regions and who unnurtured as they might be deemed in some respects seldom or never offended against the proprieties as is so common with the mariners of the boasted anglosaxon race by this time the cool air from the mountains began to descend and floating over the heated sea it formed a light landbreeze that blew in an exactly contrary direction to that which about the same hour came off from the adjacent continent there was no moon but the night could not be called dark myriads of stars gleamed out from the fathomless firmament filling the atmosphere with a light that served to render objects sufficiently distinct while it left them clad in a semiobscurity that suited the witchery of the scene and the hour raoul felt the influence of all these circumstances in an unusual degree it disposed him to more sobriety of thought than always attended his leisure moments and he took a seat on the taffrail near ghita while her uncle went below to his knees and his prayers  every footfall in the lugger had now ceased ithuel was posted on a knighthead where he sat watching his old enemy the proserpine the proximity of that ship not allowing him to sleep two experienced seamen who alone formed the regular anchorwatch as it is termed were stationed apart in order to prevent conversation one on the starboard cathead and the other in the main rigging both keeping vigilant ward over the tranquil sea and the different objects that floated on its placid bosom in that retired spot these objects were necessarily few embracing the frigate the lugger and three coasters the latter of which had all been boarded before the night set in by the proserpine and after short detentions dismissed one of these coasters lay about halfway between the two hostile vessels at anchor having cometo after making some fruitless efforts to get to the northward by means of the expiring west wind although the light landbreeze would now have sufficed to carry her a knot or two through the water she preferred maintaining her position and giving her people a good nights rest to getting under way the situation of this felucca and the circumstance that she had been boarded by the frigate rendered her an object of some distrust with raoul through the early part of the evening and he had ordered a vigilant eye to be kept on her but nothing had been discovered to confirm these suspicions the movements of her peoplethe manner in which she broughtupthe quiet that prevailed on board her and even the lubberly disposition of her spars and rigging went to satisfy raoul that she had no manofwars men on board her still as she lay less than a mile outside of the lugger though now dead to leeward all that distance she was to be watched and one of the seamen he in the rigging rarely had his eyes off her a minute at a time the second coaster was a little to the southward of the frigate under her canvas hauling in for the land doubtless with a view to get as much as possible of the breeze from the mountains and standing slowly to the south she had been set by compass an hour before and all that time had altered her bearings but half a point though not a league offa proof how light she had the wind the third coaster a small felucca too was to the northward but ever since the landbreeze if breeze it could be called had come she had been busy turning slowly up to windward and seemed disposed either to cross the shoals closer in than the spot where the lugger lay or to enter the golo her shadowy outline was visible though drawn against the land moving slowly athwart the luggers hawse perhaps half a mile inshore of her as there was a current setting out of the river and all the vessels rode with their heads to the island ithuel occasionally turned his head to watch her progress which was so slow however as to produce very little change  after looking around him several minutes in silence raoul turned his face upward and gazed at the stars  you probably do not know ghita he said the use those stars may be and are to us mariners by their aid we are enabled to tell where we are in the midst of the broadest oceansto know the points of the compass and to feel at home even when furthest removed from it the seaman must go far south of the equator at least ere he can reach a spot where he does not see the same stars that he beheld from the door of his fathers house  that is a new thought to me answered ghita quickly her tender nature at once struck with the feeling and poetry of such an idea that is a new thought to me raoul and i wonder you never mentioned it before it is a great thing to be able to carry home and familiar objects with you when so distant from those you love  did you never hear that lovers have chosen an hour and a star by gazing at which they might commune together though separated by oceans and countries  that is a question you might put to yourself raoul all i have ever heard of lovers and love having come from your own lips  well then i tell it you and hope that we shall not part again without selecting our star and our hourif indeed we ever part more though i have forgotten to tell you this ghita it is because you are never absent from my thoughtsno star is necessary to recall monte argentaro and the towers  if we should say ghita was not pleased with this it would be to raise her above an amiable and a natural weakness raouls protestations never fell dead on her heart and few things were sweeter to her ear than his words as they declared his devotedness and passion the frankness with which he admitted his delinquencies and most especially the want of that very religious sentiment which was of so much value in the eyes of his mistress gave an additional weight to his language when he affirmed his love notwithstanding ghita blushed as she now listened she did not smile she rather appeared sad for near a minute she made no reply and when she did answer it was in a low voice like one who felt and thought intensely  those stars may well have a higher office she said look at them raoulcount them we cannot for they seem to start out of the depths of heaven one after another as the eye rests upon the space until they mock our efforts at calculation we see they are there in thousands and may well believe they are in myriads now thou hast been taught else couldst thou never be a navigator that those stars are worlds like our own or suns with worlds sailing around them how is it possible to see and know this without believing in a god and feeling the insignificance of our being  i do not deny that there is a power to govern all this ghitabut i maintain that it is a principle not a being in our shape and form and that it is the reason of things rather than a deity  who has said that god is a being in our shape and form raoul none know that none can know it none say it who reverence and worship him as they ought  do not your priests say that man has been created in his image and is not this creating him in his form and likeness  nay not so dear raoul but in the image of his spiritthat man hath a soul which partakes though in a small degree of the imperishable essence of god and thus far doth he exist in his image more than this none have presumed to say but what a being to be the master of all those bright worlds  ghita thou knowst my way of thinking on these matters and thou also knowst that i would not wound thy gentle spirit by a single word that could grieve thee  nay raoul it is not thy way of thinking but thy fashion of talking that makes the difference between us no one who thinks can ever doubt the existence of a being superior to all of earth and of the universe and who is creator and master of all  of a principle if thou wilt ghita but of a being i ask for the proof that a mighty principle exists to set all these planets in motionto create all these stars and to plant all these suns in space i never doubted it would be to question a fact which stands day and night before my eyes but to suppose a being capable of producing all these things is to believe in beings i never saw  and why not as well suppose that it is a being that does all this raoul as suppose it what you call a principle  because i see principles beyond my understanding at work all around me in yonder heavy frigate groaning under her load of artillery which floats on this thin water in the trees of the land that lies so near us in the animals which are born and die the fishes the birds and the human beings but i see no beingknow no being that is able to do all this  that is because thou knowst not god he is the creator of the principles of which thou speakst and is greater than thy principles themselves  it is easy to say this ghitabut hard to prove i take the acorn and put it in the ground in due time it comes up a plant in the course of years it becomes a tree now all this depends on a certain mysterious principle which is unknown to me but which i am sure exists for i can cause it myself to produce its fruits by merely opening the earth and laying the seed in its bosom nay i can do moreso well do i understand this principle to a certain extent at least that by choosing the season and the soil i can hasten or retard the growth of the plant and in a manner fashion the tree  true raoul to a certain extent thou canst and it is precisely because thou hast been created after the image of god the little resemblance thou enjoyest to that mighty being enables thee to do this much more than the beasts of the field wert thou his equal thou couldst create that principle of which thou speakest and which in thy blindness thou mistakest for his master  this was said with more feeling than ghita had ever before manifested in their frequent discourses on this subject and with a solemnity of tone that startled her listener ghita had no philosophy in the common acceptation of the term while raoul fancied he had much under the limitations of a deficient education and yet the strong religious sentiment of the girl so quickened her faculties that he had often been made to wonder why she had seemingly the best of the argument on a subject in which he flattered himself with being so strong  i rather think ghita we scarcely understand each other answered raoul i pretend not to see any more than is permitted to man or rather more than his powers can comprehend but this proves nothing as the elephant understands more than the horse and the horse more than the fish there is a principle which pervades everything which we call nature and this it is which has produced these whirling worlds and all the mysteries of creation one of its laws is that nothing it produces shall comprehend its secrets  you have only to fancy your principle a spirit a being with mind raoul to have the christians god why not believe in him as easily as you believe in your unknown principle as you call it you know that you existthat you can build a luggercan reason on the sun and stars so as to find your way across the widest ocean by means of your mind and why not suppose that some superior being exists who can do even more than this your principles can be thwarted even by yourselfthe seed can be deprived of its power to growthe tree destroyed and if principles can thus be destroyed some accident may one day destroy creation by destroying its principle i fear to speak to you of revelation raoul for i know you mock it  not when it comes from thy lips dearest i may not believe but i never mock at what thou utterest and reverencest  i could thank thee for this raoul but i feel it would be taking to myself a homage that ought to be paid elsewhere but here is my guitar and i am sorry to say that the hymn to the virgin has not been sung on board this lugger tonight thou canst not think how sweet is a hymn sung upon the waters i heard the crew that is anchored toward the frigate singing that hymn while thy men were at their light provencal songs in praise of womans beauty instead of joining in praise of their creator  thou meanst to sing thy hymn ghita else the guitar would not have been mentioned  raoul i do i have ever found thy soul the softest after holy music who knows but the mercy of god may one day touch it through the notes of this very hymn  ghita paused a moment and then her light fingers passed over the strings of her guitar in a solemn symphony after which came the sweet strains of ave maria in a voice and melody that might in sooth have touched a heart of stone ghita a neapolitan by birth had all her countrys love for music and she had caught some of the science that seems to pervade nations in that part of the world nature had endowed her with one of the most touching voices of her sex one less powerful than mellow and sweet and she never used it in a religious office without its becoming tremulous and eloquent with feeling while she was now singing this wellknown hymn a holy hope pervaded her moral system that in some miraculous manner she might become the agent of turning raoul to the love and worship of god and the feeling communicated itself to her execution never before had she sung so well as a proof of which ithuel left his knighthead and came aft to listen while the two french mariners on watch temporarily forgot their duty in entranced attention  if anything could make me a believer ghita murmured raoul when the last strain had died on the lips of his beloved it would be to listen to thy melody what now monsieur etooell are you too a lover of holy music  this is rare singing captain rule but we have different business on hand if you will step to the other end of the lugger you can take a look at the craft that has been crawling along inshore of us for the last three hoursthere is something about her that is unnatral she seems to be dropping down nearer to us while she has no motion through the water the last circumstance i hold to be unnatral with a vessel that has all sail set and in this breeze  raoul pressed the hand of ghita and whispered her to go below as he was fearful the air of the night might injure her he then went forward where he could command as good a view of the felucca inshore as the obscurity of the hour permitted and he felt a little uneasiness when he found how near she had got to the lugger when he last noted her position this vessel was quite half a mile distant and appeared to be crossing the bows of le feufollet with sufficient wind to have carried her a mile ahead in the interval yet could he not perceive that she had advanced as far in that direction as she had drifted down upon the lugger the while  have you been examining her long he demanded of the new hampshire man  ever since she has seemed to stand still which is now some twenty minutes she is dull i suppose for she has been several hours getting along a league and there is now air enough for such a craft to go three knots to the hour her coming down upon us is easily accounted for there being a considerable current out of this river as you may see by the ripple at our own cutwater but i find nothing to keep her from going ahead at the same time i set her by the light you see here in the wake of the nearest mountain at least a quarter of an hour since and she has not advanced five times her own length since  tis nothing but a corsican coaster after all etooell i hardly think the english would risk our canister again for the pleasure of being beaten off in another attempt to board  theyre a spiteful set aboard the frigate and the lord only knows see here is a good heavy night air and that felucca is not a cables length from us set her by the jibstay and judge for yourself how slowly she goes ahead that it is which nonplusses me  raoul did as the other desired and after a short trial he found that the coaster had no perceptible motion ahead while it was certain she was drifting down with the current directly athwart the luggers hawse this satisfied him that she must have drags astern a circumstance that at once denoted a hostile intention the enemy was probably on board the felucca in force and it was incumbent on him to make immediate preparations for defence  still raoul was reluctant to disturb his people like all firm and cool men he was averse to the parade of a false alarm and it seemed so improbable that the lesson of the morning was so soon forgotten that he could hardly persuade himself to believe his senses then the men had been very hard at work throughout the day and most of them were sleeping the sleep of the weary on the other hand every minute brought the coaster nearer and increased the danger should the enemy be really in possession of her under all the circumstances he determined first to hail knowing that his crew could be got up in a minute and that they slept with arms at their sides under an apprehension that a boat attack might possibly be attempted in the course of the night  felucca ahoy called out the captain of le feufollet the other craft being too near to render any great effort of the voice necessary what felucca is that and why have you so great a drift  la bella corsienne was the answer in a patois half french half italian as raoul expected if all were right we are bound into la padulella and wish to keep in with the land to hold the breeze the longer we are no great sailer at the best and have a drift because we are just now in the strength of the current  at this rate you will come athwart my hawse you know i am armed and cannot suffer that  ah signore we are friends of the republic and would not harm you if we could we hope you will not injure poor mariners like us we will keep away if you please and pass under your stern  this proposition was made so suddenly and so unexpectedly that raoul had not time to object and had he been disposed to do so the execution was too prompt to allow him the means the felucca fell broad off and came down almost in a direct line for the luggers bows before the wind and current moving fast enough now to satisfy all ithuels scruples  call all hands to repel boarders cried raoul springing aft to the capstan and seizing his own armscome up lively mes enfanshere is treachery  these words were hardly uttered before raoul was back on the heel of the bowsprit and the most active of his mensome five or six at mostbegan to show themselves on deck in that brief space the felucca had got within eighty yards when to the surprise of all in the lugger she luffed into the wind again and drifted down until it was apparent that she was foul of the luggers cable her stern swinging round directly on the latters starboard bow at that instant or just as the two vessels came in actual contact and raouls men were thronging around him to meet the expected attack the sound of oars pulled for life or death were heard and flames burst upward from the open hatch of the coaster then a boat was dimly seen gliding away in a line with the hull by the glowing light  un br√ªlotun br√ªlota fireship exclaimed twenty voices together the horror that mingled in the cries proclaiming the extent of a danger which is perhaps the most terrific that seamen can encounter  but the voice of raoul yvard was not among them the moment his eye caught the first glimpse of the flames he disappeared from the bowsprit he might have been absent about twenty seconds then he was seen on the taffrail of the felucca with a spare shankpainter which had been lying on the forecastle on his shoulder  antoinefrancoisgr√©goirehe called out in a voice of thunderfollow methe rest clear away the cable and bend a hawser to the better end  the people of le feufollet were trained to order and implicit obedience by this time too the lieutenants were among them and the men set about doing as they had been directed raoul himself passed into the felucca followed by the three men he had selected by name the adventurers had no difficulty as yet in escaping the flames though by this time they were pouring upward from the hatch in a torrent as raoul suspected his cable had been grappled and seizing the rope he tightened it to a severe strain securing the inboard part then he passed down to the cable himself directing his companions to hand him the ropeend of the shankpainter which he fastened to the cable by a jamming hitch this took half a minute in half a minute more he was on the feluccas forecastle again here the chain was easily passed through a hawsehole and a knot tied with a marlinspike passed through its centre to pass the fire on the return was now a serious matter but it was done without injury raoul driving his companions before him no sooner did his foot reach the bows of le feufollet again than he shouted  veer awaypay out cable men if you would save our beautiful lugger from destruction  nor was there a moment to spare the lugger took the cable that was given her fast enough under the pressure of the current and helped by the breeze but at first the firevessel already a sheet of flame her decks having been saturated with tar seemed disposed to accompany her to the delight of all in the lugger however the stern of the felucca was presently seen to separate from their own bows and a sheer having been given to le feufollet by means of the helm in a few seconds even her bowsprit and jib had cleared the danger the felucca rode stationary while the lugger dropped astern fathom after fathom until she lay more than a hundred yards distant from the fiery mass as a matter of course while the cable was paid out the portion to which the lanyard or rope part of the shankpainter was fastened dropped into the water while the felucca rode by the chain  these events occupied less than five minutes and all had been done with a steadiness and promptitude that seemed more like instinct than reason raouls voice was not heard except in the few orders mentioned and when by the glaring light which illuminated all in the lugger and the adjacent water to some distance nearly to the brightness of noonday he saw ghita gazing at the spectacle in awed admiration and terror he went to her and spoke as if the whole were merely a brilliant spectacle devised for their amusement  our girandola is second only to that of st peter he said smiling twas a narrow escape love but thanks to thy god if thou wilt it shall be so we have received no harm  and you have been the agent of his goodness raoul i have witnessed all from this spot the call to the men brought me on deck and oh how i trembled as i saw you on the flaming mass  it has been cunningly planned on the part of messieurs les anglais but it has signally failed that coaster has a cargo of tar and naval stores on board and capturing her this evening they have thought to extinguish our lantern by the brighter and fiercer flame of their own but le feufollet will shine again when their fire is dead  is there then no danger that the br√ªlot will yet come down upon usshe is fearfully near  not sufficiently so to do us harm more especially as our sails are damp with dew here she cannot come so long as our cable stands and as that is under water where she lies it cannot burn in half an hour there will be little of her left and we will enjoy the bonfire while it lasts  and now the fear of danger was past it was a sight truly to be enjoyed every anxious and curious face in the lugger was to be seen under that brilliant light turned toward the glowing mass as the sunflower follows the great source of heat in his track athwart the heavens while the spars sails guns and even the smallest object on board the lugger started out of the obscurity of night into the brightness of such an illumination as if composing parts of some brilliant scenic display but so fierce a flame soon exhausted itself ere long the feluccas masts fell and with them a pyramid of fire then the glowing deck tumbled in and finally timber after timber and plank after plank fell until the conflagration in a great measure extinguished itself in the water on which it floated an hour after the flames appeared little remained but the embers which were glowing in the hold of the wreck    chapter xii        a justice of the peace for the time being      they bow to but may turn him out next year      they reverence their priest but disagreeing      in price or creed dismiss him without fear      they have a natural talent for foreseeing      and knowing all thingsand should park appear      from his long tour in africa to show      the nigers source theyd meet him withwe know       halleck  raoul was not mistaken as to the manner in which they were obtained and the means employed by his enemies the frigate had found one of the feluccas loaded with naval stores including some ten or fifteen barrels of tar and it instantly struck griffin who was burning to revenge the defeat of the morning that the prize might be converted into a firevessel as the second lieutenant volunteered to carry her in always a desperate service cuffe gave his consent nothing could have been better managed than the whole duty connected with this exploit including the manner in which our hero saved his vessel from destruction the frigate kept between her prize and the lugger to conceal the fact that a boat remained on board the former and when all was ready the felucca was apparently permitted to proceed on her voyage the other two prizes were allowed to go free also as cloaks to the whole affair griffin as has been seen kept standing in for the land his object being to get up stream from the lugger and as near her as possible when he found himself almost as far ahead as was desirable drags were used to keep the craft stationary and in this manner she drifted down on her intended victim as has been already described but for the sagacity and uneasiness of ithuel the plan would altogether have escaped detection and but for the coolness courage and resources of raoul it would infallibly have succeeded notwithstanding the suspicions that had been excited  cuffe and the people on deck watched the whole affair with the deepest interest they were barely able to see the sails of the felucca by means of a nightglass as she was dropping down on the lugger and yelverton had just exclaimed that the two vessels were foul of each other when the flames broke out as a matter of course at that distance both craft seemed on fire and when le feufollet had dropped a hundred yards nearer to the frigate leaving the felucca blazing the two were so exactly in a line as to bring them together as seen from the formers decks the english expected every moment to hear the explosion of the luggers magazine but as it did not happen they came to the conclusion it had been drowned as for griffin he pulled inshore both to avoid the fire of le feufollet in passing her broadside and in the hope of intercepting raoul while endeavoring to escape in a boat he even went to a landing in the river quite a league from the anchorage and waited there until long past midnight when finding the night beginning to cloud over and the obscurity to increase he returned to the frigate giving the smouldering wreck a wide berth for fear of accidents  such then was the state of things when captain cuffe appeared on deck just as the day began to dawn on the following morning he had given orders to be called at that hour and was now all impatience to get a view of the sea more particularly inshore at length the curtain began slowly to rise and his view extended further and further toward the river until all was visible even to the very land not a craft of any sort was in sight even the wreck had disappeared though this was subsequently discovered in the surf having drifted out with the current until it struck an eddy which carried it in again when it was finally stranded no vestige of le feufollet however was to be seen not even a tent on the shore a wandering boat a drifting spar or a rag of a sail all had disappeared no doubt in the conflagration as cuffe went below he walked with a more erect mien than he had done since the affair of the previous morning and as he opened his writingdesk it was with the manner of one entirely satisfied with himself and his own exertions still a generous regret mingled with his triumph it was a great thing to have destroyed the most pernicious privateer that sailed out of france and yet it was a melancholy fate to befall seventy or eighty human beingsto perish like so many curling caterpillars destroyed by fire nevertheless the thing was done and it must be reported to the authorities above him the following letter was consequently written to the commanding officer in that sea viz       his majestys ship proserpine off the mouth of the golo      island of corsica july 23 1799  my lordi have the satisfaction of reporting for the information of my lords commissioners of the admiralty the destruction of the republican privateer the le fewfolly commanded by the notorious raoul yvard on the night of the 22d inst the circumstances attending this important success are as follows understanding that the celebrated picaroon had been on the neapolitan and roman coasts doing much mischief i took his majestys ship close in following up the peninsula with the land in sight until we got through the canal of elba early on the morning of the 21st on opening porto ferrajo bay we saw a lugger lying at anchor off the town with english colors flying as this was a friendly port we could not suppose the craft to be the le fewfolly but determined to make sure we beat in signalling the stranger until he took advantage of our stretching well over to the eastward to slip round the rocks and get off to windward we followed for a short distance and then ran over under the lee of capraya where we remained until the morning of the 22d when we again went off the town we found the lugger in the offing and being now well satisfied of her character and it falling calm i sent the boats after her under messrs winchester and griffin the first and second of this ship after a sharp skirmish in which we sustained some loss though that of the republicans was evidently much greater monsieur yvard succeeded in effecting his escape in consequence of a breezes suddenly springing up sail was now made on the ship and we chased the lugger into the mouth of the golo having fortunately captured a felucca with a quantity of tar and other combustible materials on board as we drew in with the land i determined to make a fireship of her and to destroy the enemy by that mode he having anchored within the shoals beyond the reach of shot mr winchester the first having been wounded in the boataffair i intrusted the execution of this duty to mr griffin who handsomely volunteered and by whom it was effectually discharged about ten last evening in the coolest and most officerlike manner i inclose this gentlemans report of the affair and beg leave to recommend him to the favor of my lords commissioners with mr winchesters good conduct under a sharp fire in the morning the service has also every reason to be satisfied i hope this valuable officer will soon be able to return to duty  permit me to congratulate you my lord on the complete destruction of this most pernicious cruiser of the enemy so effectual has it been that not a spar or a fragment of wreck remains we have reason to think every soul on board perished and though this fearful loss of human life is to be deeply deplored it has been made in the service of good government and religion the lugger was filled with loose women our people hearing them singing their philosophical and irreligious songs as they approached with the firevessel i shall search the coast for any rafts that may be drifting about and then proceed to leghorn for fresh provisions  i have the honor to be my lord  your lordships most obedient servant richard cuffe  to rear admiral the right hon lord nelson duke of bronte c c c  cuffe read this report over twice then he sent for griffin to whom he read it aloud glancing his eye meaningly at his subordinate when he came to the part where he spoke of the young mans good conduct  so much for that dd jackolantern griffin i fancy it will lead no one else on a wildgoose chase  i trust not sir will you allow me to suggest a slight alteration in the spelling of the luggers name captain cuffe the clerk can make it when he writes out the letter fairly  ayei dare say it is different from what we would have it french spelling being no great matter in general put it as you please though nelson has as great a contempt for their boasted philosophy and learning as i have myself i fancy you will find all the english spelt right how do you write their confounded gibberish  feufollet sir pronouncing the last part of it follay not folly i was thinking of asking leave captain cuffe to take one of the cutters and pull up to the luggers anchorage and see if anything can be found of her wreck the ship will hardly get under way until the westerly wind comes  no probably not i will order my gig manned and well go together poor winchester must keep house awhile so there is no use in asking him i saw no necessity for putting nelson into a passion by saying anything about the exact amount of our loss in that boat scrape griffin  i agree with you sir that it is best as it is some loss covers everythingit means more or less  that was just my notion i dare say there may have been twenty women in the lugger  i cant answer for the number sir but i heard female singing as we got near in the fireship and think it likely there may have been that number the lugger was fullmanned for they were like bees swarming on her forecastle when we were dropping foul i saw raoul yvard by the light of the fire as plainly as i now see you and might have picked him off with a musket but that would hardly have been honorable  to this cuffe assented and then he led the way on deck having previously ordered the boats manned the two officers proceeded to the spot where they supposed the feufollet had been anchored and rowed round for near an hour endeavoring to find some traces of her wreck on the bottom griffin suggested that when the magazine was drowned in the hurry and confusion of the moment the cock may have been left opena circumstance that might very well have carried down the bottom of so small a vessel in two or three hours more especially after her hull had burnt to the waters edge the next thing was to find this bottom by no means a hopeless task as the waters of the mediterranean are usually so clear that the eye can penetrate several fathoms even off the mouth of the goloa stream that brought more or less debris from the mountains it is scarcely necessary to say that the search was not rewarded with success the feufollet being just at that time snug at anchor at bastia where her people had already taken out her wounded mainmast with a view to step a new one in its place at that very moment carlo giuntotardi his niece and raoul yvard were walking up the principal street of the town the place standing on a hill like porto ferrajo perfectly at their ease as regards fireships english frigates and the dangers of the seas but all this was a profound mystery to cuffe and his companions who had long been in the habit of putting the most favorable constructions on the results of their professional undertakings and certainly not altogether without reason and who nothing doubted that le feufollet had to use their own language laid her bones somewhere alongshore here  after two or three hours passed in fruitless search cuffe determined to return to his ship he was a keen sportsman and had brought a fowlingpiece with him in his gig with a halfformed design of landing and whiling away the time until the westerly wind came among some marshes that he saw near the shore but had been persuaded by griffin not to venture  there must be woodcock in that wet ground griffin he said as he reluctantly yielded a little in his intention and winchester would fancy a bird exceedingly in a day or two i never was hit in my life that i did not feel a desire for game after the fever was gone snipe too must live on the banks of that stream snipe are coming in season now griffin  its more likely sir that some of the privateersmen have got ashore on planks and empty casks and are prowling about in the weeds watching our boats three or four of them would be too much for you captain cuffe as the scoundrels all carry knives as long as ships cutlasses  i suppose your notion may be true and i shall have to give it up pull back to the frigate davy and well be off after some more of these french ragamuffins  this settled the matter in half an hour the boats were swinging at the proserpines quarters and three hours later the ship was under her canvas standing slowly off the land that day however the zephyr was exceedingly light and the sun set just as the ship got the small island of pianosa abeam when the air came from the northward and the ships head was laid in to the eastward the course lying between the land just mentioned and that of elba all night the proserpine was slowly fanning her way along the south side of the latter island when getting the southerly air again in the morning she reappeared in the canal of piombino as the day advanced precisely as she had done before when first introduced to the acquaintance of the reader cuffe had given orders to be called as usual when the light was about to return it being a practice with him in that active and pregnant war to be on deck at such moments in order to ascertain with his own eyes what the fortunes of the night had brought within his reach  well mr griffin he said as soon as he had received the salutation of the officer of the watch you have had a still night of it yonder is the point of piombino i see and here we have got elba and this little rocky island again on our larboard hand one day is surprisingly like another about these times for us mariners in particular  do you really think so captain cuffenow to my notion this day hasnt had its equal on the proserpines log since we got hold of lepervier and her convoy you forget sir that we destroyed le feufollet last night  ayethat is somethingespecially for you griffin well nelson will hear of it by mail as soon as we can get into leghorn which will be immediately after i have had an opportunity of communicating with these people in porto ferrajo after all that has passed the least we can do is to let your veechygovernthetories know of our success  sail ho shouted the lookout on the foretopsailyard  the two officers turned and gazed round them in every direction when the captain made the customary demand of whereaway  here sir close aboard of us on our larboard hand and on our weather quarter  on our weather quarter dn me if that can be true griffin there is nothing but the island there the fellow cannot have mistaken this little island for the hull of a ship  if he has sir answered griffin laughing it must be for a twentydecker that is ben brown aloft and he is as good a lookout as we have in the ship  do you see her sir demanded ben brown looking over his shoulder to put the question  not a bit of her cried cuffe you must be dreaming fellow what does she look like  there this small island shuts her in from the deck sir she is a lugger and looks as much like the one we burnt last night sir as one of our catheads is like tother  a lugger exclaimed cuffe what another of the blackguards by jove ill go aloft and take a look for myself its ten to one that i see her from the maintop  in three minutes more captain cuffe was in the top in question having passed through the lubberhole as every sensible man does in a frigate more especially when she stands up for want of wind that was an age in which promotion was rapid there being few graybearded lieutenants then in the english marine and even admirals were not wanting who had not cut all their wisdomteeth cuffe consequently was still a young man and it cost him no great effort to get up his ships ratlins in the manner named once in the top he had all his eyes about him for quite a minute he stood motionless gazing in the direction that had been pointed out by ben brown all this time griffin stood on the quarterdeck looking quite as intently at his superior as the latter gazed at the strange sail then cuffe deigned to cast a glance literally beneath him in order to appease the curiosity which he well understood it was so natural for the officer of the watch to feel griffin did not dare to ask his captain what he saw but he looked a volume of questions on the interesting subject  a sister corsair by jupiter ammon cried cuffe a twin sister too for they are as much alike as one cathead is like another more too by jove if i am any judge  what will you have us do captain cuffe inquired the lieutenant we are now going to leeward all the while i dont know sir that there is positively a current here but  very well sirvery wellhaul up on the larboard tack as soon as possible and get the larboard batteries clear we may have to cripple the chap in order to get hold of him  as this was said cuffe descended through the same lubberhole and soon appeared on deck the ship now became a scene of activity and bustle all hands were called and the guns were cleared away by some while others braced the yards according to the new line of sailing  the reader would be greatly aided in understanding what is to follow could he perchance cast a look at a map of the coast of italy he will there see that the eastern side of the island of elba runs in a nearly north and south direction piombino lying off about northnortheast from its northern extremity near this northern extremity lies the little rocky islet so often mentioned or the spot which napoleon fifteen years later selected as the advanced redoubt of his insular empire of course the proserpine was on one side of this islet and the strange lugger on the other the first had got so far through the canal as to be able to haul close upon the wind on the larboard tack and yet to clear the islet while the last was just far enough to windward or sufficiently to the southward to be shut out from view from the frigates decks by the intervening rocks as the distance from the islet to the island did not much exceed a hundred or two yards captain cuffe hoped to inclose his chase between himself and the land never dreaming that the stranger would think of standing through so narrow and rocky a pass he did not know his man however who was raoul yvard and who had come this way from bastia in the hope of escaping any further collision with his formidable foe he had seen the frigates lofty sails above the rock as soon as it was light and being under no hallucination on the subject of her existence he knew her at a glance his first order was to haul everything as flat as possible and his great desire was to get from under the lee of the mountains of elba into this very pass through which the wind drew with more force than it blew anywhere near by  as the proserpine was quite a league off in the canal le feufollet which sailed so much the fastest in light winds had abundance of time to effect her object instead of avoiding the narrow pass between the two islands raoul glided boldly into it and by keeping vigilant eyes on his foreyard to apprise him of danger he succeeded in making two stretches in the strait itself coming out to the southward on the starboard tack handsomely clearing the end of the islet at the very instant the frigate appeared on the other side of the pass the lugger had now an easy task of it for she had only to watch her enemy and tack in season to keep the islet between them since the english did not dare to carry so large a ship through so narrow an opening this advantage raoul did not overlook and cuffe had gone about twice closing each time nearer and nearer to the islet before he was satisfied that his guns would be of no service until he could at least weather the intervening object after which they would most probably be useless in so light a wind by the distance between them and their enemy  never mind mr griffin let this scamp go said the captain when he made this material discovery it is pretty well to have cleared the seas of one of them besides we do not know that this is an enemy at all he showed no colors and seems to have just come out of porto ferrajo a friendly haven  raoul yvard did that sir not once but twice muttered yelverton who from the circumstance that he had not been employed in the different attempts on le feufollet was one of the very few dissentients in the ship touching her fate these twins are exceedingly alike especially pomp as the american negro said of his twin children  this remark passed unheeded for so deep was the delusion in the ship touching the destruction of the privateer it would have been as hopeless an attempt to try to persuade her officers and people generally that le feufollet was not burned as it would be to induce a great nation to believe that it had any of the weaknesses and foibles that confessedly beset smaller communities the proserpine was put about again and setting her ensign she stood into the bay of porto ferrajo anchoring quite near the place that raoul had selected for the same purpose on two previous occasions the gig was lowered and cuffe accompanied by griffin as an interpreter landed to pay the usual visit of ceremony to the authorities  the wind being so light several hours were necessary to effect all these changes and by the time the two officers were ascending the terraced street the day had advanced sufficiently to render the visit suitable as to time cuffe appearing in full uniform with epaulettes and sword his approach attracted notice and vito viti hurried off to apprise his friend of the honor he was about to receive the vicegovernatore was not taken by surprise therefore but had some little time to prepare his excuses for being the dupe of a fraud as impudent as that which raoul yvard had so successfully practised on him the reception was dignified though courteous and it had none the less of ceremony from the circumstance that all which was said by the respective colloquists had to be translated before it could be understood this circumstance rendered the few first minutes of the interview a little constrained but each party having something on his mind of which it was his desire to be relieved natural feeling soon got the better of forms  i ought to explain to you sir cuffe the manner in which a recent event occurred in our bay here observed the vicegovernatore since without such explanation you might be apt to consider us neglectful of our duties and unworthy of the trust which the grand duke reposes in us i allude as you will at once understand to the circumstance that le feufollet has twice been lying peaceably under the guns of our batteries while her commander and indeed some of her crew have been hospitably entertained on shore  such things must occur in times like these mr veechygovernatory and we seamen set them down to the luck of war cuffe answered graciously being much too magnanimous under his own success to think of judging others too harshly it might not be so easy to deceive a manofwarsman like myself but i dare say veechygovernatory had it been anything relating to the administration of your little island here even monsieur yvard would have found you too much for him  the reader will perceive that cuffe had got a new way of pronouncing the appellation of the elban functionary a circumstance that was owing to the desire we all have when addressing foreigners to speak in their own language rather than in our own the worthy captain had no more precise ideas of what a vicegovernor means than the american people just now seem to possess of the signification of vicepresident but as he had discovered that the word was pronounced veechy in italian he was quite willing to give it its true sound albeit a smile struggled round the mouth of griffin while he listened  you do me no more than justice signor kooffe or sir kooffe as i presume i ought to address you answered the functionary for in matters touching our duties on shore here we are by no means as ignorant as on matters touching your honorable calling this raoul yvard presented himself to me in the character of a british officer one i esteem and respect having audaciously assumed the name of a family of high condition and of great power i believe among your people  ahthe barone exclaimed cuffe who having discovered by his intercourse with the southern italians that this word meant a rascal as well as a baron was fond of using it on suitable occasions pray veechygovernatory what name did he assume caendish or howard or seymour or some of those great nobs griffin ill engage i wonder that he spared nelson  no signore he took the family appellation of another illustrious race the republican corsair presented himself before me as a sir smeesthe son of a certain milordo smees  smeessmeessmeesive no recollection of any such name in the peerage it cant be seymour that the veechy meansthat is a great name certainly and some of them have been in the service it is possible this barone may have had the impudence to hail for a seymour  i rather think not captain cuffe smees is very much as an italian would pronounce smith as you know the french call it smeet it will turn out that this mr raoul has seized upon the first english name he fell in with as a man overboard clutches at a spar adrift or a lifebuoy and that happened to be smith  who the devil ever heard of a my lord smith a pretty sort of aristocracy we should have griffin if it were made up of such fellows  why sir the name can make no great difference the deeds and the antiquity forming the essentials  and he assumed a title toosir smeesi dare say he was ready to swear his majesty made him a knight banneret under the royal ensign and on the deck of his own ship as was done with some of the old admirals the veechy however has forgotten a part of the story as it must have been sir john or sir thomas smees at least  no sir that is the way with the french and the italians who do not understand our manner of using christian names with titles as in our sir edwards and lord harries and lady betties  blast the french i can believe anything of them though i should have thought that these italians knew better however it may be well to give the veechy a hint of what we have been saying or it may seem rudeand harkye griffin while you are about it rub him down a little touching books and that sort of thing for the surgeon tells me he has heard of him in leghorn as a regular leafcutter  the lieutenant did as ordered throwing in an allusion to andreas reputation for learning that under the circumstances was not illtimed and which as it was well enough expressed was exceedingly grateful to his listener just at that awkward moment  my claims to literature are but small signore answered andrea with humility as i beg you will inform sir kooffe but they were sufficient to detect certain assumptions of this corsair a circumstance that came very near bringing about an exposure at a most critical moment he had the audacity signore to wish to persuade me that there was a certain english orator of the same name and of equal merit of him of roma and pompeiione sir cicero  the barone again exclaimed cuffe when this new offence of raouls was explained to him i believe the rascal was up to anything but there is an end of him now with all his sir smees and sir ciceros into the bargain just let the veechy into the secret of the fellows fate griffin  griffin then related to the vicegovernatore the manner in which it was supposed that le feufollet raoul yvard and all his associates had been consumed like caterpillars on a tree andrea barrofaldi listened with a proper degree of horror expressed in his countenance but vito viti heard the tale with signs of indifference and incredulity that he did not care to conceal nevertheless griffin persevered until he had even given an account of the manner in which he and cuffe examined the luggers anchorage in the bootless attempt to discover the wreck  to all this the two functionaries listened with profound attention and a lively surprise after looking at each other several times and exchanging significant gestures andrea assumed the office of explaining  there is some extraordinary mistake in this signor tenente he said for raoul yvard still lives he passed this promontory just as day dawned in his lugger this very morning  aye he has got that notion from having seen the fellow we fell in with off the harbor here answered cuffe when this speech was translated to him and i dont wonder at it for the two vessels were surprisingly alike but the barone that we saw burned with our own eyes griffin can never float again i say barone for in my opinion the fewfolly was just as much of a rascal as her commander and all who sailed in her  griffin explained this but it met with no favor from the two italians  not so signor tenentenot so returned the vicegovernatore the lugger that passed this morning we know to be le feufollet inasmuch as she took one of our own feluccas in the course of the night coming from livorno and raoul yvard permitted her to come in as he said to her padrone on account of the civil treatment he had received while lying in our port nay he even carried his presumption so far as to send me by means of the same man the compliments of sir smees and his hopes of being able some day to make his acknowledgments in person  the english captain received this intelligence as might be expected and unpleasant as it was after putting various questions to the vicegovernatore and receiving the answers he was obliged unwillingly enough to believe it all he had brought his official report in his pocket and as the conversation proceeded he covertly tore it into fragments so small that even a mahommedan would reject them as not large enough to write the word allah on  its dd lucky griffin that letter didnt get to leghorn this morning he said after a long pause nelson would have bronted me famously had he got it yet i never believed half as devoutly in the twentynine articles as  i believe there are thirtynine of them captain cuffe modestly put in griffin  well thirtynine if you willwhat signifies ten more or less in such matters a man is ordered to believe them all if there were a hundred but i never believed in them as devoutly as i believed in the destruction of that infernal picaroon my faith is unsettled for life  griffin offered a few words of condolence but he was also too much mortified to be very able to administer consolation andrea barrofaldi understanding the state of the case now interposed with his courtesies and the two officers were invited to share his bachelors breakfast what followed in consequence of this visit and the communications to which it gave rise will appear in the course of the narrative    chapter xiii        if ever you have looked on better days      if ever been where bells have knolled to church      if ever sat at any good mans feast      if ever from your eyelids wiped a tear      and know what tis to pity and be pitied      let gentleness my strong enforcement be       shakespeare  it is now necessary to advance the time and to transfer the scene of our tale to another but not a distant part of the same sea let the reader fancy himself standing at the mouth of a large bay of some sixteen or eighteen miles in diameter in nearly every direction though the shores must be indented with advancing promontories and receding curvatures while the depth of the whole might possibly a little exceed the greatest width he will then occupy the spot of which we wish to present to him one of the fairest panoramas of earth on his right stands a high rocky island of dark tufa rendered gay amid all its magnificent formations by smiling vineyards and teeming villages and interesting by ruins that commemorate events as remote as the caesars a narrow passage of the blue mediterranean separates this island from a bold cape on the main whence follows a succession of picturesque villageclad heights and valleys relieved by scenery equally bold and soft and adorned by the monkish habitations called in the language of the country camaldolis until we reach a small city which stands on a plain that rises above the water between one and two hundred feet on a base of tufa and the houses of which extend to the very verge of the dizzy cliffs that limit its extent on the north the plain itself is like a hive with its dwellings and scenes of life while the heights behind it teem with cottages and the signs of human labor quitting this smiling part of the coast we reach a point always following the circuit of the bay where the hills or heights tower into ragged mountains which stretch their pointed peaks upward to some six or seven thousand feet toward the clouds having sides now wild with precipices and ravines now picturesque with shootingtowers hamlets monasteries and bridlepaths and bases dotted or rather lined with towns and villages here the mountain formation quits the margin of the bay following the coast southward or running into the interior of the country and the shore sweeping round to the north and west offers a glimpse into a background of broad plain ere it meets a high insulated conical mountain which properly forms the head of the coast indentation the human eye never beheld a more affluent scene of houses cities villages vineyards and country residences than was presented by the broad breast of this isolated mountain passing which a wider view is obtained of the rich plain that seems to lie behind it bounded as it is by a wall of a distant and mysteriouslooking yet bold range of the apennines returning to the shore which now begins to incline more westwardly we come to another swell of tufa which has all the characteristic fertility and abruptness of that peculiar formation a vast and populous town of near half a million of souls being seated in nearly equal parts on the limits of the plain and along the margin of the water or on the hillsides climbing to their summits from this point the northern side of the bay is a confused mass of villages villas ruins palaces and vines until we reach its extremity a low promontory like its opposite neighbor a small island comes next a sort of natural sentinel then the coast sweeps northward into another and a smaller bay rich to satiety with relics of the past terminating at a point some miles further seaward with a high reddish sandy bluff which almost claims to be a mountain after this we see two more islands lying westward one of which is flat fertile and more populous as is said than any other part of europe of the same extent while the other is a glorious combination of pointed mountains thronged towns fertile valleys castles country houses and the wrecks of longdormant volcanoes thrown together in a grand yet winning confusion if the reader will to this description add a shore that has scarce a foot that is not interesting with some lore of the past extending from yesterday into the darkest recesses of history give life to the waterview with a fleet of little latinerigged craft rendered more picturesque by an occasional ship dot the bay with countless boats of fishermen and send up a wreath of smoke from the summit of the conelike mountain that forms the head of the bay he will get an outline of all that strikes the eye as the stranger approaches naples from the sea  the zephyr was again blowing and the daily fleet of sparanaras or undecked feluccas that passes every morning at this season from the south shore to the capital and returns at this hour was stretching out from under vesuvius some looking up as high as massa others heading toward sorrento or vico or persano and many keeping more before the wind toward castel√†mare or the landings in that neighborhood the breeze was getting to be so fresh that the fishermen were beginning to pull in toward the land breaking up their lines which in some places had extended nearly a league and this too with the boats lying within speaking distance of each other the head of the bay indeed was alive with craft moving in different directions while a large fleet of english russians neapolitans and turks composed of twodeckers frigates and sloops lay at their anchors in front of the town on board of one of the largest of the former was flying the flag of a rearadmiral at the mizzen the symbol of the commanders rank a corvette alone was underway she had left the anchorage an hour before and with studdingsails on her starboard side was stretching diagonally across the glorious bay apparently heading toward the passage between capri and the point of campanella bound to sicily this ship might easily have weathered the island but her commander an easy sort of person chose to make a fair wind of it from the start and he thought by hugging the coast he might possibly benefit by the landbreeze during the night trusting to the zephyr that was then blowing to carry him across the gulf of salerno a frigate too shot out of the fleet under her staysails as soon as the westerly wind made but she had dropped an anchor underfoot and seemed to wait some preparation or orders before taking her departure her captain being at that moment on board the flagship on duty with the rearadmiral this was the proserpine thirtysix captain cuffe a vessel and an officer that are already both acquaintances of the reader about an hour before the present scene opens captain cuffe in fact had been called on board the foudroyant by signal where he had found a small sallowlooking slightlybuilt man with his right arm wanting pacing the deck of the forecabin impatient for his appearance  well cuffe said this uninvitinglooking personage twitching the stump of the maimed arm i see you are out of the flock are you all ready for sailing  we have one boat ashore after letters my lord as soon as she comes off we shall lift our anchor which is only underfoot  very welli have sent the ringdove to the southward on the same errand and i see she is half a league from the anchorage on her way already this mr griffin appears to be a fine young mani like his account of the way he handled his fireship though the french scoundrel did contrive to escape after all this rowl eehow do you pronounce the fellows name cuffe i never can make anything out of their gibberish  why to own the truth sir horatioi beg pardonmy lordthere is something in the english grain of my feelings that would prevent my ever learning french had i been born and brought up in paris there is too much saxon in me to swallow words that half the time have no meaning  i like you all the better for that cuffe answered the admiral smiling a change that converted a countenance that was almost ugly when in a state of rest into one that was almost handsomea peculiarity that is by no means of rare occurrence when a strong will gives expression to the features and the heart at bottom is really sound an englishman has no business with any gallic tendencies this young mr griffin seems to have spirit and i look upon it always as a good sign when a young man volunteers for a desperate thing of this sortbut he tells me he is only second where was your first all the while  why my lord he got a little hurt in the brush of the morning and i would not let him go as a matter of course his name is winchester i think you must remember him as junior of the captain at the affair off st vincent miller4 had a good opinion of him and when i went from the arrow to the proserpine he got him sent as my second the death of poor drury made him first in the natural way  4 ralph willet miller the officer who commanded the ship to which nelson shifted his pennant at the battle of cape st vincent this gentleman was an american and a native manhattanese his near relatives of the same name still residing in new york it is believed that he got the name of willet from the first english mayor a gentleman from whom are descended many of the old families of the lower part of the state more particularly those on long island  i have some recollection of him cuffe that was a brilliant day and all its events should be impressed on my mind you tell me mr griffin fairly grappled the luggers cable  of that there can be no manner of doubt i saw the two vessels foul of each other with my nightglassand seemingly both were on fireas plainly as i ever saw vesuvius in a dark night  and yet this fewfolly has escaped poor griffin has run a desperate risk for little purpose  he has indeed my lord  here nelson who had been pacing the cabin with quick steps while cuffe stood respectfully declining the gesture to be seated at the table in its centre suddenly stopped and looked the captain steadily in the face the expression of his countenance was now mild and earnest and the pause which preceded his words gave the latter solemnity and weight  the day will come cuffe he said when this young man will rejoice that his design on these picaroons frenchmen as they are failed yes from the bottom of his heart will he be glad  my lord  i know you think this strange captain cuffe but no man sleeps the sounder for having burnt or blown up a hundred of his fellowcreatures like so many widows at a suttee but we are not the less to commend those who did what was certainly their duty  am i to understand lord nelson that the proserpine is not to destroy the fewfolly at every hazard should we again have the luck to fall in with her  by no means sir our orders are to burn sink and destroy such is englands policy in this desperate war and it must be carried out you know what we are contending for as well as i do and it is a struggle that is not to be carried on with courtesies still one would not wish to see a glorious and sacred cause tarnished by inhumanity men that fall in fair manly combat are to be envied rather than pitied since it is only paying the great debt of nature a little sooner than might otherwise have happened but there is something revolting to humanity in burning up our fellowcreatures as one would burn rags after the plague nevertheless this lugger must be had at any price for english commerce and english power are not to be cut up and braved in this audacious manner with impunity the career of these french tigers must be stopped at every sacrifice captain cuffe  i know that my lord and i like a republican as little as you can do or his majesty himself for that matter and i take it he has as little relish for the animal as flesh and blood can give  i know you do cuffeim sure you do and i esteem you all the more for it it is a part of an englishmans religion in times like these to hate a frenchman i went across the channel after the peace of 83 to learn their language but had so little sympathy with them even in peaceable times as never to be able to make out to write a letter in it or even to ask intelligibly for the necessaries of life  if you can ask for anything it far surpasses my efforts i never can tell head from stern in their dialect  it is an infernal jargon cuffe and has got to be so confused by their academies and false philosophy and infidelity that they will shortly be at a loss to understand it themselves what sort of names they give their ships for instance now they have beheaded their king and denounced their god who ever heard of christening a craft as you tell me this lugger is named the fewfolly i believe ive got the picaroons title right  quite rightgriffin pronounces it so though he has got to be a little queerish in his own english by using so much french and italian the young mans father was a consul and he has half a dozen foreign lingoes stowed away in his brain he pronounces folly something broadishlike follay i believe but it means all the same thing folly is folly pronounce it as you will  nelson continued to pace his cabin working the stump of his arm and smiling halfbitterly half in a sort of irony that inclined him to be in a goodhumor with himself  do you remember the ship cuffe we had that sharp brush with off toulon in old agamemnon he said after making a turn or two in silence i mean the dismasted eightyfour that was in tow of the frigate and which we peppered until their gallic soup had some taste to it now do you happen to know her real name in good honest english  i do not my lord i remember they said she was called the ca ira and i always supposed that it was the name of some old greek or romanor perhaps of one of their newfangled republican saints  theydn em theyve got no saints to name my good fellow since they cashiered all the old ones there is something respectable in the names of a spanish fleet and one feels that he is flogging gentlemen at least while he is at work on them no sir ca ira means neither more nor less than thatll do and i fancy cuffe they thought of their own name more than once while the old greek was hanging on their quarter smashing their cabin windows for them a pretty sound it would have been had we got her and put her into our own servicehis majestys ship thatll do 84 captain cuffe  i certainly should have petitioned my lords commissioners to change her name  you would have done quite right a man might as well sail in a manofwar called the enough then there was the threedecker that helped her out of the scrape the sansculottes as the french call her i suppose you know what that means  not i my lord to own the truth im no scholar and am entirely without ambition in that way sans i suppose is the french for saint but who culottes was ive not the least notion  nelson smiled and the turn the conversation had taken appeared to give him secret satisfaction if the truth were known something lay heavily on his mind and with one of his strong impulses his feelings disposed him to rush from one extreme to the other as is often the case with men who are controlled by such masters more especially if their general disposition is to the right  youre wrong this time my dear cuffe he said for sans means without in french and culottes means breeches think of naming a threedecker the without breeches i do not see how any respectable flagofficer can mention such names in his despatches without a feeling of awkwardness that must come near to capsizing all his philosophy the line was formed by the republics ship the thatll do leading supported by the without breeches as her second asternha cuffede sir if id serve in a marine that had such names to the ships its a thousand times worse than all those saints the spaniards tack on to their vesselslike a line of boats towing a ship up to her moorings  here the conversation was interrupted by the appearance of a midshipman who came down to say that a man and a woman from the shore wished to see the rearadmiral on pressing business  let them come down sir answered nelson ive a hard life of it cuffe there is not a washerwoman or a shopkeeper in naples who does not treat me exactly as if i were a podest√† and it were my duty to hear all the contentions about lost clothes and mislaid goods his majesty must appoint a lord chief justice of the steerage to administer the law for the benefit of the young gentlemen or hell soon get no officer to serve with a flag at his masthead  surely my lord the captains can take this weight off your shoulders  aye there are men in the fleet that can and there are men who do but there are men who do not but here comes the plaintiff i supposeyou shall hear the case and act as a puisne judge in the matter  this was said as the cabindoor opened and the expected guests entered they were a man turned of fifty and a girl of nineteen the former was a person of plain exterior abstracted air and downcast look but the latter had all the expression beauty nature and grace of mien that so singularly marked the deportment and countenance of ghita caraccioli5 in a word the two visitors were carlo giuntotardi and his gentle niece nelson was struck with the modesty of mien and loveliness of the latter and he courteously invited her to be seated though he and cuffe both continued standing a few efforts at making himself understood however soon satisfied this renowned admiral that he had need of an interpreter his guests speaking no english and his own italian being too imperfect to carry on anything like a connected conversation he hesitated an instant and then went to the door of the inner cabin an apartment in which voices had occasionally been heard the whole time one of the speakers being a female here he stood leaning against the bulkhead as if in doubt and then he uttered his wishes  5 it may aid the reader who is ignorant of italian to tell him that this name is pronounced carachcholi the same is true of gweecholior guicciolibyrons mistress  i must ask a service of you which i would not think of doing in any ordinary case he said with a gentleness of voice and manner that showed he addressed one who had habitual influence over him i want an interpreter between myself and the second handsomest woman in the kingdom of naples i know no one so fit for the office as the first  with all my heart dear nelson answered a full rich female voice from within sir william is busied in his antiquities and i was really getting to be ennui√©d for want of an occupation i suppose you have the wrongs of some injured lady to redress in your capacity of lord high chancellor of the fleet  i am yet ignorant of the nature of the complaint but it is not unlikely it will turn out to be something like that which you suspect even in such a case no better intercessor can be required than one who is so much superior to the frailties and weaknesses of her sex in general  the lady who now made her appearance from the inner cabin though strikingly handsome had not that in her appearance which would justify the implied eulogium of the british admirals last speech there was an appearance of art and worldliness in the expression of her countenance that was only so much the more striking when placed in obvious contrast to the ingenuous nature and calm purity that shone in every lineament of the face of ghita one might very well have passed for an image of the goddess circe while the other would have made no bad model for a vestal could the latter have borne the moral impression of the sublime and heartsearching truths that are inculcated by the real oracles of god then the lady was a woman in the meridian of her charms aided by all the cunning of the toilet and a taste that was piquant and peculiar if not pure while the other stood in her simple dark neapolitan bodice and a head that had no other ornament than its own silken tresses a style of dress however that set off her faultless form and winning countenance more than could have been done by any of the devices of the mantuamaker or the milliner the lady betrayed a little surprise and perhaps a shade of uneasiness as her glance first fell on ghita but much too good an actress to be disconcerted easily she smiled and immediately recovered her ease  is this the being nelson who comes with such a petition she demanded with a touch of natural womanly sensibility in her voice and that poor old man i dare say is the heartstricken father  as to the errand you will remember i know nothing as yet and pledge myself to nothing  captain cuffe i hope i have the pleasure to see you well sir william joins the admiral in hoping you will make one of our little family party today at dinner and  and what says the mistressnot of the house but of the ship put in nelson whose eyes had scarce turned an instant from the face of the siren since she entered the forecabin  that shealways disclaiming the title honorable though it bethat she unites with all the rest in inviting captain cuffe to honor us with his company nelson tells me you were one of his old agamemnons as he calls you all aged and young men and boys little and big and i love even the sound of the name what a glorious title for a ship agamemnona greek led on by a true english heart  aye it is somewhat better than thatll do and the other affair ha cuffe returned the admiral smiling and glancing at his subordinate but all this time we are ignorant of the errand of this honestlooking italian and his exceedingly innocentlooking companion  well then in this matter gentlemen i am only to be regarded as a mere mouthpiece put in the ladyan echo to repeat what reaches mine ear though it be an irish echo which repeats in a different tongue from that in which the sounds first reach it put your questions my lord they shall be faithfully rendered with all the answers that may be given i only hope captain cuffe will come out of this affair as innocent as he now looks  the two gentlemen smiled but the trifling could not disturb its subject as he was profoundly ignorant of the existence of the two strangers five minutes before while the boldness of the allusion rather suited the freedom of a ship and the habits of the part of the world in which they happened to be  we will first inquire the name of this worthy man if you will condescend to ask it observed nelson to his fair friend  carlo giuntotardi noble ladyonce a poor scholar in napoli here and now a keeper of the princes watchtowers on the heights of argentaro was the quiet but respectful answer of the man who like his niece had declined taking a seat a circumstance that left the whole party standing carlo giuntotardi illustrious lady  a very good name signore and one of which you have no need to be ashamed and thine turning to the girl  ghita caraccioli eccellenza the sisters daughter of this honest towerkeeper of the prince  had a bomb exploded over the foudroyant nelson certainly would not have been as much startled while the ladys beautiful face assumed a look of dark resentment not unmingled with fear even cuffe understood enough of the sounds to catch the name and he advanced a step with lively curiosity and an anxious concern expressed on his ruddy face but these emotions soon subsided the lady first regaining her selfpossession though nelson paced the cabin five or six times working the stump of his arm before he even looked up again  i was about to ask if there never is to be an end to these annoyances observed the lady in english but there must be some mistake in this the house of caraccioli is one of the most illustrious of italy and can scarcely have any of this class who feel an interest in him of whom we are thinking i will therefore inquire further into this matter signorinachanging the language to italian and speaking with severity like one who questioned what she heardcaraccioli is a noble name and is not often borne by the daughter of any princes towerkeepers  ghita trembled and she looked abashed but she was sustained by too high a principle and was too innocent herself to stand long rebuked in the presence of guilt and as the flush which resembled that which so often passes over her native skies at even left her countenance she raised her eyes to the darklooking face of the lady and gave her answer  i know what your eccellenza means she said and feel its justice still it is cruel to the child not to bear the name of her parent my father was called caraccioli and he left me his name as my sole inheritance what may have been his right to it let my uncle say  speak then signor giuntotardi first give us the history of this name then tell us what has brought you here  noble lady my sister as pious and innocent a woman as ever lived in italy and now blessed in heaven married don francesco caraccioli the son of don francesco of that illustrious family who now stands condemned to death for having led the fleet against the king and ghita here is the only fruit of the union it is true that the church did not authorize the connection which brought my nieces father into being but the noble admiral never hesitated to acknowledge his son and he gave him his name until love bound him in wedlock with a poor scholars sister then indeed his father turned his face from him and death soon removed both husband and wife from the reach of all earthly displeasure this is our simple story noble and illustrious signora and the reason why my poor niece here bears the name as great as that of caraccioli  you mean us to understand signor giuntotardi that your niece is the granddaughter of don francesco caraccioli through a natural son of that unfortunate admiral  such is the fact signora as my sister was honestly married i could do no less than bring up her daughter to bear a name that her father was permitted to bear before her  such things are common and require no apology one question more before i explain to the english admiral what you have said does prince caraccioli know of the existence of this granddaughter  eccellenza i fear not her parents died so sooni loved the child so welland there was so little hope that one illustrious as he would wish to acknowledge a connection through the holy church with persons humble as we that i have never done more to make my niece known than to let her bear the same name as her father  the lady seemed relieved by this and she now briefly explained to nelson the substance of what the other had said  it may be she added they are here on that errand concerning which we have already heard so much and so uselessly but i rather think not from this account for what interest can they feel in one who is absolutely a stranger to them it may be some idle conceit however connected with this same affair what is your wish ghita this is don horatio nelsoni the illustrious english admiral of whom you have heard so much  eccellenza i am sure of it answered ghita earnestly my good uncle here has told you who we are and you may well guess our business we came from st agata on the other side of the bay only this morning and heard from a relation in the town that don francesco had been seized that very hour since we are told that he has been condemned to die for treason against the king and that by officers who met in this very ship some even say signora that he is to meet his fate ere the sun set  if this should be so what reason is it that thou shouldst give thyself concern  eccellenza he was my fathers father and though i never saw him i know that the same blood runs in our veins when this is so there should be the same feelings in our hearts  this is well ghita in appearance at least but thou canst hardly feel much for one thou never sawst and who has even refused to own thee for a child thou art young too and of a sex that should ever be cautious it is unwise for men even to meddle with politics in these troubled times  signora it is not politics that brings me here but nature and duty and pious love for my fathers father  what wouldst thou say then answered the lady impatiently remember thou occupiest one whose time is precious and of high importance to entire nations  eccellenza i believe it and will try to be brief i wish to beg my grandfathers life of this illustrious stranger they tell me the king will refuse him nothing and he has only to ask it of don ferdinando to obtain it  many would have thought the matured charms of the lady superior to the innocentlooking beauty of the girl but no one could have come to such an opinion who saw them both at that moment while ghitas face was radiant with a holy hope and the pious earnestness which urged her on a dark expression lowered about the countenance of the english beauty that deprived it of one of its greatest attractions by depriving it of the softness and gentleness of her sex had there not been observers of what passed it is probable the girl would have been abruptly repulsed but management formed no small part of the character of this woman and she controlled her feelings in order to effect her purposes  this admiral is not a neapolitan but an englishman she answered and can have no concern with the justice of your king he would scarcely think it decent to interfere with the execution of the laws of naples  signora it is always decent to interfere to save life nay it is moreit is merciful in the eyes of god  what canst thou know of this a conceit that thou hast the blood of the caraccioli has made thee forget thy sex and condition and placed a romantic notion of duty before thine eyes  no signora it is not so for eighteen years have i been taught that the unfortunate admiral was my grandfather but as it has been his pleasure to wish not to see me never have i felt the desire to intrude on his time before this morning never has the thought that i have the blood of the caraccioli crossed my mind unless it was to mourn for the sin of my grandmother and even now it has come to cause me to mourn for the cruel fate that threatens the days of her partner in guilt  thou art bold to speak thus of thy parents girl and they too of the noble and great  this was said with a flushed brow and still more lowering look for haply there were incidents in the past life of that lady which made the simple language of a severe morality alike offensive to her ears and her recollections  it is not i eccellenza but god that speaketh thus the crime too is another reason why this great admiral should use his influence to save a sinner from so hurried an end death is terrible to all but to those who trust with heart and soul to the mediation of the son of god but it is doubly so when it comes suddenly and unlooked for it is true don francesco is aged but have you not remarked signora that it is these very aged who become hardened to their state and live on as if never to diei mean those aged who suffer youth to pass as if the pleasures of life are never to have an end  thou art too young to set up for a reformer of the world girl and forgettest that this is the ship of one of the greatest officers of europe and that he has many demands on his time thou canst now go i will repeat what thou hast said  i have another request to ask eccellenzapermission to see don francesco that i may at least receive his blessing  he is not in this ship thou wilt find him on board the minerva frigate no doubt he will not be denied stopthese few lines will aid thy request addio signorina  and may i carry hope with me eccellenza think how sweet life is to those who have passed their days so long in affluence and honor it would be like a messenger from heaven for a grandchild to bring but a ray of hope  i authorize none the matter is in the hands of the neapolitan authorities and we english cannot meddle go now both of youthe illustrious admiral has business of importance that presses  ghita turned and slowly and sorrowfully she left the cabin at the very door she met the english lieutenant who was in charge of the unhappy prisoner coming with a last request that he might not be suspended like a thief but might at least die the death of a soldier it would exceed the limits set to our tale were we to dwell on the conversation which ensued but every intelligent reader knows that the application failed    chapter xiv        like other tyrants death delights to smite      what smitten most proclaims the pride of power      and arbitrary nod       young  it is probable that nelson never knew precisely what passed between ghita and the lady mentioned in the last chapter at all events like every other application that was made to the english admiral in connection with this sad affair that of ghita produced no results even the mode of execution was unchanged an indecent haste accompanying the whole transaction as in the equally celebrated trial and death of the unfortunate duc denghien cuffe remained to dine with the commanderinchief while carlo giuntotardi and his niece got into their boat and took their way through the crowded roadstead toward the neapolitan frigate that now formed the prison of the unfortunate caraccioli  a request at the gangway was all that was necessary to procure an admission on board the ship as soon as the signor giuntotardi reached the quarterdeck he let his errand be known and a messenger was sent below to ascertain if the prisoner would see two visitors the name of the uncle being alone given francesco caraccioli of the princes caraccioli or as he was more commonly called in english prince caraccioli was now a man approaching seventy and being a member of one of the most illustrious houses of lower italy he had long been trusted in employments of high dignity and command on his offenceits apologythe indecent haste of his trial and execution and the irregularity of the whole proceedings it is now unnecessary to dwell they have all passed into history and are familiarly known to the world that very morning had he been seized and sent on board the foudroyant in the cabin of that vessel had a court of his own countrymen convened and there had he been hastily condemned to death the hour of doom was near and he was already in the ship where the execution was to take place  the messenger of carlo giuntotardi found this unfortunate man with his confessor by whom he had just been shrived he heard the request with cold indifference but granted it on the instant under the impression that it came from some dependent of his family or estates who had a last favor to ask or an act of justice to see performed  remain here father i beseech you said the prisoner perceiving that the priest was about to retire it is some contadino or some tradesman whose claims have been overlooked i am happy that he has come one would wish to stand acquitted of injustice before he dies let them come in my friend  a sign was given with these words the door of the cabin was opened and ghita with her uncle entered a pause of quite a minute followed during which the parties regarded each other in silence the prisoner endeavoring in vain to recall the countenances of his guests and the girl trembling equally with grief and apprehension then the last advanced to the feet of the condemned man knelt bowed her head and said  grandfather your blessing on the child of your only son  grandfathersonand his child repeated don francesco i had a son to my shame and contrition be it now confessed but he has long been dead i never knew that he left a child  this is his daughter signore replied carlo giuntotardi her mother was my sister you thought us then too humble to be received into so illustrious a connection and we have never wished to bring ourselves before your eyes until we thought our presence might be welcome  and thou comest now good man to claim affinity with a condemned criminal  not so grandfather answered a meek voice at his feet it is your sons daughter that craves a blessing from her dying parent the boon shall be well requited in prayers for your soul  holy father i deserve not this here has this tender plant lived neglected in the shade until it raises its timid head to offer its fragrance in the hour of death i deserve not this  son if heaven offered no mercies until they are merited hopeless truly would be the lot of man but we must not admit illusions at such a moment thou art not a husband don francesco hadst thou ever a son  that among other sins have i long since confessed and as it has been deeply repented of i trust it is forgiven i had a sona youth who bore my name even though he never dwelt in my palace until a hasty and indiscreet marriage banished him from my presence i ever intended to pardon him and to make provision for his wants but death came too soon to both husband and wife to grant the time this much i did know and it grieved me that it was so but of his child never before this instant have i heard tis a sweet countenance father it seems the very abode of truth  why should we deceive you grandfather rejoined ghita stretching her arms upward as if yearning for an embrace most of all at a time like this we come not for honors or riches or your great name we come simply to crave a blessing and to let you know that a child of your own blood will be left on earth to say aves in behalf of your soul  holy priest there can be no deception here this dear child even looks like her wronged grandmother and my heart tells me she is mine i know not whether to consider this discovery a good or an evil at this late hour coming as it does to a dying man  grandfather your blessing bless ghita once that i may hear the sound of a parents benediction  bless theebless thee daughter exclaimed the admiral bending over the weeping girl to do the act she solicited and then raising her to his arms and embracing her tenderly this must be my childi feel that she is no other  eccellenza said carlo she is the daughter of your son don francesco and of my sister ghita giuntotardi born in lawful wedlock i would not deceive anyleast of all a dying man  i have no estate to bequeatheno honors to transmitno name to boast of better the offspring of the lazzaroni than a child of francesco caraccioli at this moment  grandfather we think not of thiscare not for this i have come only to ask the blessing you have bestowed and to offer the prayers of believers though we are so lowly more than this we ask notwish notseek not our poverty is familiar to us and we heed it not riches would but distress us and we care not for them  i remember holy father that one great reason of displeasure at my sons marriage was distrust of the motive of the family which received him yet here have these honest people suffered me to live on unmolested in prosperity while they now first claim the affinity in my disgrace and ignominy i have not been accustomed to meet with wishes and hearts like these  you did not know us grandfather said ghita simply her face nearly buried in the old mans bosom we have long prayed for you and reverenced you and thought of you as a parent whose face was turned from us in anger but we never sought your gold and honors  gold and honors repeated the admiral gently placing his granddaughter in a chair these are things of the past for me my estates are sequesteredmy name disgraced and an hour hence i shall have suffered an ignominious death no selfish views can have brought these good people father to claim affinity with me at a moment like this  it comes from the goodness of god son by letting you feel the consolation of this filial love and by awakening in your own bosom the spark of parental affection he foreshadows the fruits of his own mercy and tenderness to the erring but penitent acknowledge his bounty in your soul it may bring a blessing on your last moment  holy priest i hope i do but what says this  don francesco took a note from the hand of a servant and read its contents eagerly the world and its feelings having too much hold on his heart to be plucked out in an instant indeed so sudden had been his arrest trial and conviction that it is not surprising the priest found in him a divided spirit even at an instant like that his countenance fell and he passed a hand before his eyes as if to conceal a weakness that was unbecoming  they have denied my request father he said and i must die like a felon  the son of god suffered on the cross suspended between thieves  i believe there is far less in these opinions than we are accustomed to thinkyet it is cruel for one who has filled so high employmentsa princea caraccioli to die like a lazzarone  grandfather  did you speak child i wonder not that this indignity should fill thee with horror  it is not that grandfather resumed ghita shaking off her doubts and looking up with flushed cheeks and a face radiant with holy feelingsoh it is not that if my life could save thine gladly would i give it up for such a purpose but do notdo notat this awful moment mistake the shadow for the substance what matters it how death is met when it opens the gates of heaven pain i am sure you cannot feareven i weak and feeble girl that i am can despise thatwhat other honor can there be in the hour of death than to be thought worthy of the mercy and care of god caraccioli or lazzaroneprince or beggarit will matter not two hours hence and let me reverently beg of you to humble your thoughts to the level which becomes all sinners  thou sayst thou art my grandchild ghitathe daughter of my son francesco  signore i am as all tell meas my heart tells meand as i believe  and thou lookst upon these opinions as unworthyunsuited if thou likst that betterto this solemn moment and considerest the manner of a death a matter of indifference even to a soldier  when placed in comparison with his hopes of heavenwhen viewed through his own demerits and the merits of his saviour grandfather  and wilt thou then just entering on the stage of life with the world before thee and all that its future can offer accompany me to the scaffold let it be known to the mocking crowd that thou derivest thy being through the felon and art not ashamed to own him for a parent  i will grandfatherthis have i come to do answered ghita steadily but do not ask me to look upon thy sufferings all that can be done to lessen by sharing thy disgrace if disgrace it be will i most gladly do though i dread to see thy aged form in pain  and this wilt thou do for one thou never beheldst until this hourone thou canst hardly have been taught to consider just to thyself  if i have never seen thee before this visit grandfather i have loved thee and prayed for thee from infancy my excellent uncle early taught me this duty but he never taught me to hate thee or any one my own father is taken away and that which he would have been to thee this day will i endeavor to be for him the world is naught to me and it will console thee to think that one is near whose heart weeps for thee and whose soul is lost in prayers for thy eternal pardon  and this being father is made known to me an hour before i die god punishes me sufficiently for the wrong ive done her in letting me thus know her worth when it is too late to profit by it no ghitablessed child such a sacrifice shall not be asked of thee take this crossit was my mothers worn on her bosom and has long been worn on minekeep it as a memorial of thy unhappy parent and pray for me but quit this terrible ship and do not grieve thy gentle spirit with a scene that is so unfit for thy sex and years bless theebless thee my child would to heaven i had earlier known theebut even this glimpse of thy worth has lightened my heart thou findst me here a poor condemned criminal unable to provide for thy future wantsnay i can yet do a little for thee too this bag contains gold it has been sent to me by a relative thinking it might be of service in averting the punishment that awaits me for that purpose it is now useless with thy simple habits however it will render thy life easy and above care  ghita with streaming eyes steadily put aside the gold though she pressed the cross to her bosom kissing it fervently again and again  not thatnot that grandfather she said i want it notwish it not this is enough and this will i keep to my own last moment i will quit the ship too but not the place i see many boats collecting and mine shall be among them my prayers shall go up to god for thee now thou art living and daily after thou art dead there needs no gold grandfather to purchase a daughters prayers  don francesco regarded the zealous and lovely girl with intense feeling then he folded her to his heart once more blessing her audibly again and again while thus employed the foudroyants bell struck once and then those of all the surrounding ships english and neapolitan repeated the stroke this caraccioli a seaman himself well knew denoted that the time was halfpast four five being the hour named for his execution he felt it necessary therefore to dismiss his newfound relative that he might pass a few more minutes alone with his confessor the parting was solemn but tender and as ghita left the cabin her condemned grandfather felt as he would had he taken leave for ever of one whom he had long loved and whose virtues had been a solace to him from the hour of his birth  the deck of the minerva presented a sorrowful scene although the prisoner had been condemned by a court of neapolitan officers the trial was had under the british ensign and the feeling of the public was with the prisoner there existed no necessity for the hurry in which everything had been done no immediate danger pressed and an example would have been more impressive had there been less of the appearance of a desire for personal vengeance and more of the calm deliberation of justice in the affair ghitas connection with the prisoner could not be even suspected but as it was known that she had been in the cabin and believed that she felt an interest in the condemned the officers manifested an interest in her wishes and too evident emotions an immense throng of boats had assembled around the ship for hasty as had been the proceedings the tidings that francesco caraccioli was to be hanged for treason spread like wildfire and scarce a craft of proper size was left within the mole so eager was the desire to witness that which was to occur either in the confusion or bribed by money the man who had brought off carlo giuntotardi and his niece was no longer to be found and the means of quitting the ship seemed momentarily to be lost  here is a boat close to our gangway said the officer of the deck who had kindly interested himself in behalf of so interesting a girl with a single man in it a few grani would induce him to put you ashore  the fellow in the boat was of the class of the lazzaroni wearing a clean cotton shirt a phrygian cap and cotton trousers that terminated at the knees leaving his muscular arms and legs entirely bare models for the statuary in their neatness vigor and proportions the feet alone formed an exception to the ordinary attire for they were cased in a pair of quaint canvas shoes that were ornamented a little like the moccasins of the american indian carlo caught the eye of this man who appeared to be eagerly watching the frigates gangway for a fare and holding up a small piece of silver in a moment the light boat was at the foot of the accommodationladder ghita now descended and as soon as her uncle and she were seated the skiff for it was little more whirled away from the ships side though two or three more who had also been left by recreant boatmen for better fares called out to him to receive them also  we had best go alone even though it cost us a heavier price quietly observed carlo to his niece as he noted this occurrence pull us a short distance from the ship friendhere where there are fewer boats and thou shalt meet with a fair reward we have an interest in this solemn scene and could wish not to be observed  i know that well signor carlo answered the boatman and will see that you are not molested  ghita uttered a faint exclamation and looking up first saw that the feigned lazzarone was no other than raoul yvard as her uncle was too unobservant in general to detect his disguise he made a sign for her to command herself and continued rowing as if nothing had occurred  be at ease ghita said carlo it is not yet the time and we have twenty good minutes for our aves  ghita however was far from being at ease she felt all the risks that the young man now ran and she felt that it was on her account solely that he incurred them even the solemn feeling of the hour and the occasion was disturbed by his presence and she wished he were away on more accounts than one here he was nevertheless and in the midst of enemies and it would not have been in nature for one of her tender years and sex and most of all of her feelings not to indulge in a sentiment of tender gratitude toward him who had as it were thrust his head into the very lions mouth to do her a service between raoul and ghita there had been no reserves on the subject of parentage and the former understood why his mistress was here as well as the motive that brought her as for the last she glanced timidly around her fearful that the lugger too had been brought into the throng of ships that crowded the anchorage for this however raoul was much too wary nothing resembling his little craft being visible  the reader will have understood that many vessels of war english russian turkish and neapolitan were now anchored in the bay as the french still held the castle of st elmo or the citadel that crowns the heights that in their turn crown the town the shipping did not lie quite as close to the mole as usual lest a shot from the enemy above might do them injury but they were sufficiently near to permit all the idle and curious of naples who had the hearts and the means to pull off and become spectators of the sad scene that was about to occur as the hour drew near boat after boat arrived until the minerva was surrounded with spectators many of whom belonged even to the higher classes of society  the distance between the neapolitan frigate and the ship of the english rearadmiral was not great and everything that occurred on board the former and which was not actually hidden by the sides and bulwarks of the vessel itself was easily to be seen from the decks of the latter still the foudroyant lay a little without the circle of boats and in that direction raoul had pulled to avoid the throng resting on his oars when about a third of a cables length from the british admirals stern here it was determined to wait for the awful signal and its fatal consequences the brief interval was passed by ghita in telling her beads while carlo joined in the prayers with the devotion of a zealot it is scarcely necessary to say that all this raoul witnessed without faith though it would be doing injustice to his nature as well as to his love for ghita to say he did so without sympathy  a solemn and expecting silence reigned in all the neighboring ships the afternoon was calm and sultry the zephyr ceasing to blow earlier than common as if unwilling to disturb the melancholy scene with its murmurs on board the minerva no sign of lifescarcely of death was seen though a single whip was visible rigged to the foreyard arm one end being led inboard while the other ran along the yard passed through a leading block in its quarter and descended to the deck there was a platform fitted on two of the guns beneath this expressive but simple arrangement but as it was inboard it was necessarily concealed from all but those who were on the minervas decks with these preparations raoul was familiar and his understanding eye saw the particular rope that was so soon to deprive ghita of her grandfather though it was lost to her and her uncle among the maze of rigging by which it was surrounded  there might have been ten minutes passed in this solemn stillness during which the crowd of boats continued to collect and the crews of the different ships were permitted to take such positions as enabled them to become spectators of a scene that it was hoped might prove admonitory it is part of the etiquette of a vessel of war to make her people keep close it being deemed one sign of a wellordered ship to let as few men be seen as possible except on those occasions when duty requires them to show themselves this rigid rule however was momentarily lost sight of and the teeming masses that floated around la minerva gave up their thousands like bees clustering about their hives it was in the midst of such signs of expectation that the call of the boatswain was heard piping the side on board the foudroyant and four sideboys lay over on the accommodationladder a mark of honor never paid to one of a rank less than that of a captain raouls boat was within fifty yards of that very gangway and he turned his head in idle curiosity to see who might descend into the gig that was lying at the foot of the long flight of steps an officer with one epaulette came first showing the way to two civilians and a captain followed all descended in a line and entered the boat the next instant the oars fell and the gig whirled round under the foudroyants stern and came glancing up toward his own skiff four or five of the strong manofwar jerks sufficed to send the long narrow boat as far as was desired when the men ceased rowing their little craft losing her way within ten feet of the skiff occupied by our party then it was that raoul to his surprise discovered that the two civilians were no other than andrea barrofaldi and vito viti who had accompanied cuffe and griffin their companions in the gig on a cruise of which the express object was to capture himself and his vessel  another man would have been alarmed at finding himself in such close vicinity to his enemies but raoul yvard was amused rather than rendered uneasy by the circumstance he had faith in his disguise and he was much too familiar with incidents of this sort not to retain his selfcommand and composure of course he knew nothing of the persons of the two englishmen but perfectly aware of the presence of the proserpine he guessed at their identity and very correctly imagined the circumstances that brought companions so illassorted together he had taken no precautions to disguise his face and the red phrygian cap which he wore in common with thousands on that bay left every feature and lineament fully expressed with ghita however the case was different she was far better known to the two elbans as indeed was the person of her uncle than he was himself but both had veiled their faces in prayer  i do not half like this business griffin observed the captain as his gig entirely lost its way and wish with all my heart we had nothing to do with it i knew this old caraccioli and a very good sort of man he was and as to treason it is not easy to say who is and who is not a traitor in times like these in such a nation as this ha i believe my soul this is the same old man and the same pretty girl that came to see nelson half an hour ago about this very execution  what could they have to do with prince caraccioli or his treason sir the old chap looks bookish but he is not a priest and as to the girl she is trimbuilt enough i fancy the face is no great matter however or she would not take so much pains to hide it  raoul muttered a sacrrre between his teeth but he succeeded in suppressing all outward expression of feeling cuffe on the contrary saw no other motive for unusual discretion beyond the presence of his boats crew before whom however he was accustomed to less reserve than with his people in general  if she be the same as the one we had in the cabin he answered there is no necessity for a veil for a prettier or a more modestlooking girl is not often fallen in with what she wanted exactly is more than i can tell you as she spoke italian altogether and miladi had the interview pretty much to herself but her good looks seem to have taken with this old bachelor the justice of the peace who eyes her as if he had an inclination to open his mind to the beauty ask him in italian griffin what mares nest he has run foul of now  you seem to have found something to look at besides the minerva signor podest√† observed griffin in an undertone i hope it is not venus  cospetto grunted vito viti nudging his neighbor the vicegovernatore and nodding toward the other boat if that be not little ghita who came into our island like a comet and went out of itto what shall i liken her sudden and extraordinary disappearance signor andrea  to that of le feufollet or ze vingyving put in griffin who now he had got the two functionaries fairly afloat spared none of the jokes that come so easy and natural to a manofwars man she went out too in an extraordinary disappearance and perhaps the lady and the lugger went out together  vito viti muttered an answer for by this time he had discovered that he was a very different personage on board the proserpine from what the other had appeared to consider him while in his native island he might have expressed himself aloud indeed but at that instant a column of smoke glanced out of the bow port of the minervaa yellow flag was shown aloftand then came the report of the signal gun  it has been said that vessels of war of four different nations were at that time lying in the bay of naples nelson had come in but a short time previously with seventeen ships of the line and he found several more of his countrymen lying there this large force had been assembled to repel an expected attack on the island of minorca and it was still kept together in an uncertainty of the future movements of the enemy a russian force had come out of the black sea to act against the french bringing with it a squadron of the grand signor thus presenting to the world the singular spectacle of the followers of luther devotees of the greek church and disciples of mahomet uniting in defence of our rights our firesides and our altars to these vessels must be added a small squadron of ships of the country making a mixed force of four different ensigns that was to witness the melancholy scene we are about to relate  the yellow flag and the signal gun brought everything in the shape of duty to a standstill in all the fleets the hoarse commands ceasedthe boatswains and their mates laid aside their calls and the echoing midshipmen no longer found orders to repeat the seamen gathered to the sides of their respective vesselsevery part glistened with expectant eyesthe booms resembled clusters of bees suspended from the boughs of a forest and the knightheads taffrails gangways and stretchers of the rigging were garnished with those whose bright buttons glazed hats epaulets and darkblue dresses denoted to belong to the privileged classes of a ship notwithstanding all this curiosity nothing like the feeling which is apt to be manifested at an exhibition of merited punishment was visible in a single countenance an expression resembling a sombre gloom appeared to have settled on all those grim warriors of the deep english russian neapolitan or turk apparently reserving all his sympathies for the sufferer rather than for the majesty of justice still no murmur aroseno sign of resistance was madeno look of remonstrance given the unseen mantle of authority covered all and these masses of discontented men submitted as we bow to what is believed to be the fiat of fate the deepseated and unresisting habit of discipline suppressed complaint but there was a general conviction that some act was about to be committed that it were better for humanity and justice should not be done or if done at all that it needed more of form greater deliberation and a fairer trial to be so done as to obtain the commendation of men the turks alone showed apathy though all showed submission these subjects of destiny looked on coldly though even among them a low rumor had passed that a malign influence prevailed in the fleet and that a great and proud spirit had got to be mastered by the passion that so often deprives heroes of their selfcommand and independence  ghita ceased her prayers as the report of the gun broke rudely on her ears and with streaming eyes she even dared to look toward the frigate raoul and all the rest bent their gaze in the same direction the sailors among them saw the rope at the foreyardarm move and then heads rose slowly above the hammockcloths when the prisoner and his attendant priest were visible even to their feet the unfortunate caraccioli as has been said had nearly numbered his threescore and ten years in the regular course of nature and his bare head now showed the traces of time he wore no coat and his arms were bound behind his back at the elbows leaving just motion enough to the hands to aid him in the slighter offices about his own person his neck was bare and the fatal cord was tightened sufficiently around it to prevent accidents constantly admonishing its victim of its revolting office  a low murmur arose among the people in the boats as this spectacle presented itself to their eyes and many bowed their faces in prayer the condemned man caught a ray of consolation from this expression of sympathy and he looked around him an instant with something like a return of those feelings of the world which it had been his effort and his desire totally to eradicate since he had taken leave of ghita and learned that his last requestthat of changing his mode of punishmenthad been denied that was a fearful moment for one like don francesco caraccioli who had passed a long life in the midst of the scene that surrounded himillustrious by birth affluent honored for his services and accustomed to respect and deference never had the glorious panorama of the bay appeared more lovely than it did at that instant when he was about to quit it for ever by a violent and disgraceful death from the purple mountainsthe cerulean void above himthe blue waters over which he seemed already to be suspendedand the basking shores rich in their towns villas and vines his eye turned toward the world of ships each alive with its masses of living men a glance of melancholy reproach was cast upon the little flag that was just waving at the mizzenmasthead of the foudroyant and then it fell on the carpet of faces beneath that seemed fairly to change the surface of the smooth sea into an arena of human countenances his look was steady though his soul was in a tumult ghita was recognized by her companion and by her dress he moved toward the edge of his narrow scaffolding endeavored to stretch forth his arms and blessed her again aloud the poor girl dropped on her knees in the bottom of the boat bowed her head and in that humble attitude did she remain until all was over not daring once to look upward again  son said the priest this is a moment when the earth and its feelings must be forgotten  i know it father answered the old man his voice trembling with emotion for his sensations were too powerful too sublime even for the degrading passion of fearbut never before did this fair piece of the creation seem so lovely in my eyes as now when i am about to quit it for the last time  look beyond this scene into the long vista of eternity son there thou wilt behold that which mocks at all human all earthly means i fear that our time is but shorthast thou aught yet to say in the flesh  let it be known holy priest that in my dying moment i prayed for nelson and for all who have been active in bringing me to this end it is easy for the fortunate and the untempted to condemn but he is wiser as he is safer who puts more reliance on the goodness of god than on his own merits  a ray of satisfaction gleamed athwart the pale countenance of the priesta sincerely pious man or fear of personal consequences might have kept him aloof from such a sceneand he closed his eyes while he expressed his gratitude to god in the secret recesses of his own spirit then he turned to the prince and spoke cheeringly  son he said if thou quittest life with a due dependence on the son of god and in this temper toward thy fellowcreatures of all this living throng thou art he who is most to be envied address thy soul in prayer once more to him who thou feelest can alone serve thee  caraccioli aided by the priest knelt on the scaffold for the rope hung loose enough to permit that act of humiliation and the other bent at his side  i wish to god nelson had nothing to do with this muttered cuffe as he turned away his face inadvertently bending his eyes on the foudroyant nearly under the stern of which ship his gig lay there in the sternwalk stood the lady already mentioned in this chapter a keen spectator of the awful scene no one but a maid was near her however the men of her companionship not being of moods stern enough to be at her side cuffe turned away from this sight in still stronger disgust and just at that moment a common cry arose from the boats looking round he was just in time to see the unfortunate caraccioli dragged from his knees by the neck until he rose by a steady manofwar pull to the end of the yard leaving his companion alone on the scaffold lost in prayer there was a horrible minute of the struggles between life and death when the body so late the tenement of an immortal spirit hung like one of the jewelblocks of the ship dangling passively at the end of the spar as insensible as the wood which sustained it    chapter xv            sleep sleep thou sad one on the sea          the wash of waters lulls thee now          his arm no more will pillow thee          thy hand upon his brow      he is not near to hurt thee or to save      the ground is histhe sea must be thy grave       dana  a long summers evening did the body of francesco caraccioli hang suspended at the yardarm of the minerva a revolting spectacle to his countrymen and to most of the strangers who had been the witnesses of his end then was it lowered into a boat its feet loaded with a doubleheaded shot and it was carried out a league or more into the bay and cast into the sea the revolting manner in which it rose to the surface and confronted its destroyers a fortnight later has passed into history and to this day forms one of the marvels related by the ignorant and wonderloving of that region6 as for ghita she disappeared no one knew how vito viti and his companions being too much absorbed with the scene to note the tender and considerate manner in which raoul rowed her off from a spectacle that could but be replete with horrors to one so situated cuffe himself stood but a few minutes longer but he directed his boats crew to pull alongside of the proserpine in half an hour after the execution took place this frigate was aweigh and then she was seen standing out of the bay before a light air covered with canvas from her truck to her hammockcloths leaving her for the moment we will return to the party in the skiff  6 singular as was this occurrence and painful as it must have proved to the parties to the execution it is one of the simplest consequences of natural causes all animal matter swells in water previously to turning corrupt a body that has became of twice its natural size in this manner as a matter of course displaces twice the usual quantity of water the weight of the mass remaining the same most human frames floating in their natural state so long as the lungs are inflated with air it follows that one in this condition would bring up with it as much weight in iron as made the difference between its own gravity and that of the water it displaced the upright attitude of caraccioli was owing to the shot attached to the feet of which it is also probable one or two had become loosened  neither carlo giuntotardi nor ghita caracciolifor so we must continue to call the girl albeit the name is much too illustrious to be borne by one of her humble condition in lifebut neither of these two had any other design in thus seeking out the unfortunate admiral than to perform what each believed to be a duty as soon as the fate of caraccioli was decided both were willing to return to their old position in life not that they felt ashamed to avow their connection with the dead but because they were quite devoid of any of that worldly ambition which renders rank and fortune necessary to happiness  when he left the crowd of boats raoul pulled toward the rocks which bound the shores of the bay near the gardens of portici this was a point sufficiently removed from the common anchorage to be safe from observation and yet so near as to be reached in considerably less than an hour as the light boat proceeded ghita gradually regained her composure she dried her eyes and looked around her inquiringly as if wondering whither their companion was taking them  i will not ask you raoul why you are here at a moment like this and whence you have come she said but i may ask whither you are now carrying us our home is at st agata on the heights above sorrento and on the other side of the bay we come there annually to pass a month with my mothers sister who asks this much of our love  if i did not know all this ghita i would not and could not be here i have visited the cottage of your aunt this day followed you to naples heard of the admirals trial and sentence understood how it would affect your feelings traced you on board the english admirals ship and was in waiting as you found me having first contrived to send away the man who took you off all this has come about as naturally as the feeling which has induced me to venture again into the lions mouth  the pitcher that goes often to the well raoul gets broken at last said ghita a little reproachfully though it surpassed her power to prevent the tones of tenderness from mingling with her words  you know all ghita after months of perseverance and a love such as man seldom felt before you deliberately and coldly refused to be my wifenay you have deserted monte argentaro purposely to get rid of my importunities for there i could go with the lugger at any moment and have come here upon this bay crowded with the english and other enemies of france fancying that i would not dare to venture hither well you see with what success for neither nelson nor his twodeckers can keep raoul yvard from the woman he loves let him be as victorious and skilful as he may  the sailor had ceased rowing to give vent to his feelings in this speech neither of the two colloquists regarding the presence of giuntotardi any more than if he had been a part of themselves this indifference to the fact that a third person was a listener proceeded from habit the worthy scholar and religionist being usually too abstracted to attend to concerns as light as love and the youthful affections ghita was not surprised either at the reproaches of her suitor or at his perseverance and her conscience told her he uttered but the truth in attributing to her the motives he had in urging her uncle to make their recent change of residence for while a sense of duty had induced her to quit the towers her art was not sufficient to suggest the expediency of going to any other abode than that which she was accustomed to inhabit periodically and about which raoul knew from her own innocent narrations nearly as much as she knew herself  i can say no more than i have said already the thoughtful girl answered after raoul had begun again to row it is better on every account that we should part i cannot change my country nor can you desert that glorious republic of which you feel so proud i am an italian and you are french while more than all i worship my god while you believe in the new opinions of your own nation here are causes enough for separation surely however favorably and kindly we may happen to think of each other in general  tell me not any more of the heart of an italian girl and of her readiness to fly to the worlds end with the man of her choice exclaimed raoul bitterly i can find a thousand girls in languedoc who would make the circuit of the earth yearly rather than be separated a day from the seamen they have chosen for their husbands  then look among the girls of languedoc for a wife answered ghita with a smile so melancholy that it contradicted her words better to take one of your own nation and opinions raoul than risk your happiness with a stranger who might not answer all your hopes when you came to know her better  we will not talk further of this now dearest ghita my first care must be to carry you back to the cottage of your auntunless indeed you will at once embark in le feufollet and return to the towers  le feufolletshe is hardly here in the midst of a fleet of her enemiesremember raoul your men will begin to complain if you place them too often in such risks to gratify your own wishes  pestei keep them in good humor by rich prizes they have been successful and that which makes yonder nelson popular and a great man makes raoul yvard popular and a great man also in his little way my crew is like its captainit loves adventures and it loves success  i do not see the luggeramong a hundred ships there is no sign of yours  the bay of napoli is large ghita returned raoul laughing and le feufollet takes but little room seeyonder vaisseauxdeligne appear trifling among these noble mountains and on this wide gulf you cannot expect my little lugger to make much show we are small ghita mia if not insignificant  still where there are so many vigilant eyes there is always danger raoul besides a lugger is an unusual rig as you have owned to me yourself  not here among all these eastern craft i have always found if i wished to be unnoticed it was best to get into a crowd whereas he who lives in a village lives in open daylight but we will talk of these things when alone ghitayonder fisherman is getting ready to receive us  by this time the skiff was near the shore where a little yawl was anchored containing a solitary fisherman this man was examining them as they approached and recognizing raoul he was gathering in his lines and preparing to raise his grapnel in a few minutes the two craft lay side by side and then though not without difficulty owing to a very elaborate disguise ghita recognized ithuel bolt a very few words sufficed to let the american into all that it was necessary he should know when the whole party made its arrangements to depart the skiff which raoul having found it lying on the beach had made free with without leave he anchored in the full expectation that its right owner might find it some day or other while its cargo was transferred to the yawl which was one of the luggers own attendants the latter was a light swiftpulling little boat admirably constructed and fit to live in a seaway requiring moreover but two good oars one of which raoul undertook to pull himself while ithuel managed the other in five minutes after the junction was made the party was moving again from the land in a straight line across the bay steering in the direction of its southern cape and proceeding with the steady swift movement of men accustomed to the toil  there are few portions of the sea in which a single ship or boat is an object of so little notice as the bay of naples this is true of all times and seasons the magnificent scale on which nature has created her panorama rendering ordinary objects of comparative insignificance while the constant movement the fruit of a million of souls thronging around its teeming shores covers it in all directions with boats almost as the streets of a town are crowded with pedestrians the present occasion too was one likely to set everything in motion and raoul judged rightly when he thought himself less likely to be observed in such a scene than on a smaller and less frequented water as a matter of course while near the mole or the common anchorage it was necessary to pass amid a floating throng but once beyond the limits of this crowd the size of the bay rendered it quite easy to avoid unpleasant collisions without any apparent effort while the passage of a boat in any direction was an occurrence too common to awaken distrust one would think no more of questioning a craft that was encountered even in the centre of that spacious bay than he would think of inquiring about the stranger met in the marketplace all this both raoul and ithuel knew and felt and once in motion in their yawl they experienced a sense of security that for the four or five previous hours had not always existed  by this time the sun was low though it was possible as raoul perceived to detect the speck that was still swinging at the minervas foreyardarm a circumstance to which the young man with considerate feeling refrained from adverting the proserpine had been some time in motion standing out of the fleet under a cloud of canvas but with an air so light as to permit the yawl to gain on her though the heads of both were turned in the same direction in this manner mile after mile was passed until darkness came then the moon arose rendering the bay less distinct it is true but scarcely more mysterious or more lovely than in the hours of stronger light the gulf indeed forms an exception in this particular to the general rule by the extent of its shores the elevation of its mountains the beauty of its waterwhich has the deep tint of the ocean off soundingsand the softness of the atmosphere lending to it by day all the mellowed and dreamy charms that other scenes borrow from the illusions of night and the milder brilliance of the secondary planets raoul did not exert himself at the oar and as he sat aft his companion was obliged to take the stroke from his movement it was so pleasant to have ghita with him on his own element that he never hurried himself while in the enjoyment of her society the conversation it will readily be imagined was not lively but the saddened melancholy of ghitas voice as she occasionally hazarded a remark of her own or answered one of his questions sounded sweeter in his ears than the music of the ships bands that was now wafted to them across the water  as the evening advanced the landbreeze increased and the proserpine gradually gained upon the boat when the latter was about twothirds of the distance across the bay the frigate caught the stronger current that came down athwart the campagna between vesuvius and the mountains behind castel√†mare when she drove ahead fast her sails as seamen express it were all asleep or swelled outward without collapsing and her rate of sailing was between five and six miles in the hour this brought them up with the boat handoverhand as it is called and ghita at raouls request put the helm aside in order that they might get out of the way of the huge body that was approaching it would seem that there was some design on the part of the ship in coming so near for she made a sheer toward the yawl in a way to frighten the timid helmswoman and to induce her to relinquish her hold of the tiller  fear nothing called out griffin in italianwe intend to offer you a tow stand by and catch the lineheave  a small rope was thrown and falling directly across ithuels head that person could do no less than seize it with all his detestation of the english in general and of this vessel in particular the manofallwork had the laborsaving propensity of his countrymen and it struck him as a good thing to make a kings ship aid an enemys privateer by accepting the offer as he used the line with proper dexterity the yawl was soon towing on the quarter of the frigate raoul taking the helm and giving the boat the sheer necessary to prevent her dragging in alongside this was a change so sudden and so totally unexpected that ghita murmured her disapprobation lest it should lead to a discovery of the true character of her companions  fear nothing dearest answered raoul they cannot suspect us and we may learn something useful by being here at all events le feufollet is safe from their designs just at this moment  are you boatmen of capri called out griffin who stood on the taffrail of the ship with cuffe and the two italians near by the first dictating the questions his lieutenant put  snore si answered raoul adopting the patois of the country as well as he could and disguising his deep mellow voice by speaking on a high shrill key boatmen of capri that have been to napoli with wine and have been kept out later than we intended by the spectacle at the yardarm of the minerva cospetto them signori make no more of a prince than we do of a quail in the season on our little island pardon me dearest ghita but we must throw dust into their eyes  has any strange sail been seen about your island within the last twentyfour hours  the bay is full of strange sail snore even the turks coming to see us since the last trouble with the french  ayebut the turks are now your allies like us english have you seen any other strangers  they tell me there are ships from the far north too snore off the town russians i believe they call them  they too are allies but i mean enemies has there not been a lugger seen off your island within the last day or twoa lugger of the french  sisii know what you mean now snore there has been a vessel like that you mention off the island for i saw her with my own eyessisi it was about the twentythird hour last eveninga lugger and we all said she must be french by her wicked looks  raoul said ghita as if reproaching him for an indiscretion  this is the true way to befog them answered the young man they have certainly heard of us and by seeming to tell a little truth frankly it will give me an opportunity of telling more untruth  ah raoul it is a sad life that renders untruths necessary  it is the art of war dearest without it we should soon be outwitted by these knaves of english sisi snori we all said just that concerning her looks and rig  will you sheer your boat alongside friend inquired griffin and come on board of us we have a ducat here that wants an owner i fancy it will fit your pocket as well as anothers we will haul you ahead abreast of the gangway  oh raoul do not think of this rash act whispered ghita the vicegovernatore or the podest√† will recollect you and then all will be lost  fear nothing ghitaa good cause and a keen wit will carry me through while the least hesitation might indeed ruin us these english first ask and then take without asking if you tell them no corpo di bacco who ever heard either of a lazzarones refusing a ducat  raoul then whispered a few words to ithuel when the boat being by this time far enough ahead he gave it a sheer alongside of the ship seized a manrope and went up the cleets as actively as a cat it is certain not a soul on board that fine frigate had the least suspicion of the true character of the individual who now confidently trod her quarterdeck the young man himself loved the excitement of such an adventure and he felt the greater confidence in his impunity from the circumstance that there was no other light than that of the moon the sails too cast their shadows upon deck and then neither of the two italians was a wizard at detecting impostors as he knew by experience  the watch was set for the night and winchester who had returned to duty held the trumpet while griffin had no other immediate office but to interpret two or three midshipmen were lounging about the quarterdeck here and there a seaman was on the lookout at the halyards or on a cathead some twenty or thirty old seadogs were pacing the gangways or the forecastle with their arms crossed and hands stuck in their jackets and a quickeyed active quartermaster stood near the man at the wheel conning the ship the remainder of the watch had stowed themselves between the guns or among the booms in readiness to act but in truth dozing cuffe griffin and the two italians descended from the taffrail and awaited the approach of the supposed lazzarone or boatman of capri as he was now believed to be near the stern of the vessel by an arrangement among themselves vito viti became the spokesman griffin translating to the captain all that passed in an undertone as soon as it was uttered  come hither friend commenced the podest√† in a patronizing but somewhat lofty manner this generous and noble english captain sir kooffe desires me to present you with a ducat by way of showing that he asks no more of you than he is willing to pay for a ducat7 is a great deal of money as you know and good pay merits good services  7 the silver ducat of naples is worth 80 grani or rather less than 80 cents the golden ducat or sequin of italy holland turkey etc is worth a trifle more than two american dollars raoul was offered the former  snore si your eccellenza says the truth a good ducat certainly deserves good services  bene now tell these signori all you know about that said lugger where you saw her when you saw her and what she was about keep your mind clear and tell us one thing at a time  snore si i will keep my mind clear and tell you no more than one thing at a time i believe eccellenza i am to begin with where i saw her then im to tell you when i saw her after which you wish to know what she was about i believe this is the way you put it snore  excellently well answer in that order and you will make yourself understood but first tell medo all the natives of capri speak the same sort of italian as you do yourself friend  snore sithough my mother having been a french woman they tell me that i have caught a little from her we all get something from our mothers eccellenza and its a pity we could not keep more of it  true friend but now for the lugger remember that honorable signori will hear what you say therefore for your own credit speak to the point and speak nothing but truth for the love of god  then snore first as to where i saw herdoes your eccellenza mean where i was at the time or where the lugger was  where the lugger was fellow dost think sir kooffe cares where thou spent thy day  well then eccellenza the lugger was near the island of capri on the side next the mediterranean which you know snore is on the side opposite to the bay and near as might be abreast of the house of giacomo albertidoes your eccellenza know anything of the house i mean  not i but tell your story as if i knew all about it it is these particulars which give value to a tale how far from the nearest land mention that fact by all means if you happen to remember  well eccellenza could the distance be measured now i would think it would prove to be about as farnot quite snore but i say aboutabout as far as from the said giacomos largest figtree to the vines of giovanni his wifes cousin sii think just about that distance  and how far may that be friend be precise as much may depend on your answers  snore that may be a trifle further than it is from the church to the top of the stairs that lead to ana capri  cospettothou wilt earn thy ducat speedily at this rate tell us at once in miles was the lugger one two six or twenty miles from your island at the time thou speakst of  eccellenza you bid me speak of the time in the second place after i had told you of the where in the first place i wish to do whatever will give you pleasure snore  neighbor vito viti put in the vicegovernatore it may be well to remember that this matter is not to be recorded as you would put on file the confessions of a thief it may be better to let the honest boatman tell his story in his own way  aye now the vecchy has set to work i hope we shall get the worth of our ducat observed cuffe in english  snori rejoined raoul it shall be just as your eccellenzi say the lugger you speak of was off the island last evening steering toward ischia which place she must have reached in the course of the night as there was a good landwind from the twentythird to the fifth hour  this agrees with our account as to the time and place said griffin but not at all as to the direction the corsair was steering we hear she was rather rounding the southern cape for the gulf of salerno  raoul started and gave thanks mentally that he had come on board as this statement showed that his enemies had received only too accurate information of his recent movements he had hopes however of being able yet to change their intentions and of putting them on a wrong scent  snori he said i should like to know who it is that mistakes southeast for northwest none of our pilots or boatmen i should think could ever make so great a blunder snore you are an officer and understand such things and i will just ask you if ischia does not lie northwest of capri  of that fact there can be no manner of doubt returned griffin it is equally true that the gulf of salerno lies southeast of both  there now interrupted raoul with a wellacted assumption of vulgar triumph i knew your eccellenza when you came to look into it would see the folly of saying that a vessel which was standing from capri toward ischia was going on any other course than northwest  but this is not the question amico we all understand the bearings of these islands which are the bearings of the whole coast down hereaway but the question is which way the lugger was steering  i thought i had said eccellenza that she was heading across toward ischia answered raoul with an air of obtuse innocence  if you do you give an account exactly different from that which has been sent to the admiral by the good bishop of your own island may i never eat another of his own quails if i think he would deceive us and it is not easy to suppose a man like him does not know north from south  raoul inwardly muttered a malediction on all priests a class of men which rightly enough he believed to be united in their hostility to france but it would not do to express this in his assumed character and he affected to listen as one of his class ought to give ear to a fact that came from his spiritual father  north from south eccellenza monsignore knows a great deal more than that if the truth were said though i suppose these noble signori are acquainted with the right reverend fathers great infirmity  not wenone of us i fancy ever had the honor to be in his company surely fellow your bishop is a man of truth  truthyes eccellenza so true is he that if he were to tell me that the thing i saw myself had not and could not happen i should rather believe monsignore than believe my own eyes still signori eyes are something and as the right reverend father has none or what are as bad as none for any use they can be in looking at a vessel half a mile off he may not always see what he thinks he sees when monsignore tells us that so and so is gospel we all believe it for we know the time has been when he could read but we never think of going to his door to ask which way a ship is steering having the use of our own senses  can this fellow tell us the truth griffin asked cuffe a good deal mystified by raouls artifice and his assumed simplicity if so we shall be going exactly on the wrong scent by hauling round campanella and running into the gulf of salerno the french hold gaeta yet and it is quite likely that master yvard may wish to keep a friendly port open under his lee  you forget captain cuffe that his lordship has sent a light cruiser already up that way and le feufollet would hardly dare to show herself near one of our regular fellows  umphi dont know that mr griffin i dont exactly know that the proserpine is a regular fellow after a fashion at least and the fewfolly has dared to show herself to her jackolanterndn me griffin but i think she is well named now id rather chase a jackolantern in the island of sicily than be hunting after such a chapfirst hes here then hes there and presently hes nowhere as for the sloop shes gone south at my suggestion to look into the bays along the calabrian coast i told nelson i wanted another ship for just so certain as this rulerawowl what the d l do you call the pirate griffin  raoul captain cuffe raoul yvard is his name tis thoroughly french raoul means rodolph  well i told nelson if this lad should get to dodging round one of the islands we might as well set about playing puss in the corner by the week as to think of driving him off the land for a fair chase he works his boat like a stagecoach turning into an innyard  i wonder my lord did not think of this and give us a sloop or two to help us  catch nel at thathe might send one englishman to look after two frenchmen but hed never dream of sending two englishmen to look after one frenchman  but this is not a fighting matter sir only a chaseand one frenchman will run faster than two englishmen any day of the week  sacrrre muttered raoul in a tone that he endeavored to suppress and which was inaudible to all ears but those of andrea barrofaldi the vicegovernatore happening to stand nearer his person just at that moment than any other of the party  very true answered cuffe but so it is we are sent alone and if this fewfolly get in between ischia and procida it will be easier to unearth the fox than to drive her out singlehanded as for any more boat service against her i suppose youve all had enough of that  why sir i rather think the people would be shy answered griffin with a little hesitation of manner and yet with the directness and simplicity of a truly brave man we must let them get over the last brush before they are depended on much for any new setto of that sort  bon muttered raoul quite unconscious he was overheard  nevertheless we must catch this fellow if we wear out our shoes in the chase  all this time andrea barrofaldi and vito viti were profoundly ignorant of what was passing between the two officers though raoul listened eagerly and so well understood every syllable they uttered until this moment the vice governatore had been rather indifferent and inattentive as to what occurred but the two exclamations of raoul awakened a vague distrust in his mind which while it had no direct object was certainly pregnant with serious consequences to the frenchman himself deep mortification at the manner in which they had been duped by this celebrated privateersman with a desire to absent themselves from the island until the edge was a little taken off the ridicule they both felt they merited blended with certain longings to redeem their characters by assisting in capturing the corsair were the reasons why these two worthies the deputygovernor and the podest√† were now on board the proserpine cuffe had offered them cots in his cabin and seats at his table in a moment of confidence and the offer was gladly accepted andrea had not been on board the ship a day however before he became thoroughly convinced of his utter uselessness a circumstance that added materially to the awkwardness of his situation like all wellmeaning and simpleminded men he had a strong wish to be doing and day and night he ruminated on the means by himself or discussed them in private dialogues with his friend the podest√† vito viti frankly admonished him to put his faith in heaven affirming that something worth while would yet turn up in the cruise to render the enterprise memorable it being a habit with the magistrate to say an ave or two on all trying occasions and then trust to god  you never knew a miracle vicegovernatore said vito viti one day when they were discussing the matter by themselves you never knew a miracle come to pass that another was not close on its heels the first being a mere preparation for the last and the last always proving to be the most remarkable now when anina gotti fell off the cliffs it was a miracle she didnt break her neck but when she rolled over into the sea it was a much greater she wasnt drowned  it is better to leave these things to the church neighbor vito was the vicegovernatores answer nor do i see that there has been any miracle in the affair to start with  howdo you not call it a miracle signor andrea that two such men as you and i should be deceived as we were beyond all doubt by this knave of a french corsair i look upon it as so great a miracle myself that it ought to follow instead of going before its companion  to this andrea made an answer suitable to his greater information and the discourse took its usual direction toward the means of doing something to relieve the two functionaries from the stigma that they mutually felt now rested on their sagacity and that too as this sagacity might be considered conjointly or individually  it was probably owing to this fever of the mind that the vicegovernatore a man usually so simple and confiding was now so suspicious and keensighted the presence of carlo giuntotardi and ghita had at first struck him as a little out of the common way and though he could not distinguish their faces by the light of the moon and at the distance at which they were placed in the yawl he fancied from the first that his old acquaintances were in the boat the ship was towing now andrea barrofaldi certainly had never before that day connected ghita or her uncle in any manner with raoul yvard but it was beyond dispute that the mysterious manner in which they disappeared from the island had excited some remarks and in his present state of mind it was not an extraordinary circumstance that he had some distant and vague glimmerings of the truth but for raouls indiscreet exclamations however nothing probably would have come of these indistinct fancies and we are to refer all that followed to those unguarded outbreakings of the frenchmans humor rather than to any very clear process of ratiocination on the part of the vicegovernatore  just as cuffe made the declaration last recorded andrea stepped up to the spot where he and griffin were conversing apart and whispered a few words in the ear of the latter  the dl exclaimed the lieutenant in english if what the vicegovernatore tells me be true captain cuffe the work is half done to our hands  aye the veechy is a good fellow at the bottom griffin though hell never burn the bay of naples what has he to say now  griffin led his captain a little aside and conferred a moment with him alone orders were then passed to the officer of the watch when cuffe and his companions went below like men in a hurry    chapter xvi       what countryman i pray      of mantua      of mantua sirmarry god forbid      and come to papua careless of your life       taming of the shrew  during the momentous five minutes occupied in these private movements raoul affected to be gaping about in vulgar astonishment examining the guns rigging ornaments of the quarterdeck etc though in truth nothing that passed among those near him escaped his vigilant attention he was uneasy at the signs of the times and now regretted his own temerity but still he thought his incognito must be impenetrable like most persons who fancy they speak a foreign language well he was ignorant too in how many little things he betrayed himself the englishman cateris paribus usually pronouncing the italian better than the frenchman on account of the greater affinity between his native language and that of italy in what relates to emphasis and sounds such was the state of mind of our hero then as he got an intimation that the captain of the ship wished to see him below raoul observed as he descended the ladder to comply with what sounded very much like an order that he was followed by the two elban functionaries  the cabinlamp was trimmed and the privateersman found himself under a strong light as soon as he had crossed the threshold of the apartment cuffe and griffin were standing near the table where the vicegovernatore and the podest√† took their stations also giving the whole arrangement a most uncomfortable air of investigation and justice for an instant raoul wished that it was a portion of the holy inquisition rather than the tribunal before which he now found himself so unexpectedly arraigned  you must be cool said griffin as the other moved slowly up to the table maintaining the outward signs of steadiness but cursing in his heart the severe ordeal which he felt he was undergoing do me the favor to put this silk handkerchief about your neck  snore your eccellenza is pleased to joke we men of capri think little of the nights at this season of the yearstill as it seems to be your wish i will honor myself so much  in that age a black silk kerchief was the certain mark of a military man the oldfashioned stock had gone out with all but oldfashioned people and the newfashioned substitute did not make its appearance until many years later the present usage indeed having come in from an imitation of the military mania which pervaded christendom at the close of the last general war black around the neck properly relieved by the white of the linen was then deemed particularly military and even in the ordinary dress such a peculiarity was as certain a sign as the cockade that the wearer bore arms raoul knew this and he felt he was aiding in unmasking himself by complying but he thought there might be greater danger should he refuse to assume the kerchief  your eccellenza is making a prince of a very humble boatman he said when his neck was fairly enveloped and my wife will think some great general is coming when i enter the door  to help the delusion friend wear this also continued griffin throwing the other one of his own undress uniform coats his stature and that of raoul being very nearly the same  the true state of the case was now getting to be somewhat unequivocal nevertheless as steadiness and compliance were his only hopes raoul did as desired and stood with all his upper man decorated in an english naval undress uniform while the nether remained √† la lazzarone  what say you now vicegovernatore resumed griffin here are lights and the dress  i say that this gentleman has done me the honor of several visits in my poor residence at porto ferrajo returned andrea and that never has he been more welcome than he is at this moment signor smees you are a great lover of masquerades and make a carnival of the whole year i trust your distinguished countryman sir cicero will have it in his power to convince these brave inglese that all is done in pure pleasantry and without a crime  messieurs said raoul stripping himself of his borrowed plumes it is too late to feign any longer if i am raoul yvard as you say i am certainly not le feufollet  of course you are aware monsieur observed griffin in french that you are a prisoner to his britannic majesty  sa majest√© britannique has not made a conquest equal to his success at the nile returned raoul ironically but he has me in his hands it is not the first time that i have had the honor to be a prisoner of war and that too in one of his own ships  you are not to suppose that such will be your situation now monsieur yvard we arrest you in a totally different character  not as a friend i trust monsieur for i protest i have not the smallest claim to the character as witness a short interview off porto ferrajo and an interesting incident at the mouth of the golo  your taunts maybe spared sir fortune favored you then we allow but now we arrest you as a spy  espion repeated raoul starting that is an office i never contemplated monsieur on coming on board your ship you will do me the justice to acknowledge that it was only at your own invitation that i came on deck twould be an infamy to pretend differently  we will endure the infamy of our acts monsieur yvard no one accuses you of having come on board the proserpine as a spy but when an enemy is found rowing about our fleet which is anchored in a hostile bay and this in a disguise like yours it most be a very scrupulous conscience that hesitates to pronounce him a spy and liable to the punishment of one  this was so true that the unfortunate young man now felt the exceeding delicacy of his situation in coming into the bay he had certainly been led by no other intention than to find ghita and yet he could not but confess to himself that he should not have hesitated about profiting in his public character by any information incidentally obtained he had subjected himself to the severest penalties of military law by yielding to his passion for ghita and he could not discover a single available excuse to plead in mitigation  what does the poor devil say griffin asked cuffe who felt regret that so brave an enemy should be reduced to so desperate a strait notwithstanding his determined hostility to all frenchmen do not bear too hard upon him at the first go off has he any excuse for his disguise  the usual apology no doubt sira desire to serve his one and undivided republic if we should believe all such chaps tell us captain cuffe we might go home and send deputies to the national convention if indeed they would do us the favor to admit them to seats  gentlemen said raoul in english there is no longer any occasion for an interpreter between us i speak your language sufficiently well to make myself understood  i am sorry for your situation mr yvard said cuffe and wish with all my heart you had fallen into our hands in open battle instead of in this irregular way  in which case monsieur le capitaine le feufollet would have been in your power also returned raoul smiling ironically but messieurs words are idle now i am your prisoner and must take my chance with you there is no necessity however for causing others to suffer for my indiscretion i shall esteem it a favor messieurs if you will let the good people in the boat alongside pull ashore without molestation it is getting late and we must now be nearly or quite abeam of the place where they wish to land which is the marina grande of sorrento  do you wish us to understand that your companions are not french monsieur yvard  oui monsieur le captaine there is not a frenchman among them i give you my parole dhonneur  of that fact it may be well to satisfy ourselves by an examination captain cuffe put in griffin dryly  i have sent up to beg mr winchester would get these people on board  there is a young woman in the boat who is unaccustomed to entering ships interrupted raoul hastily and i implore your tenderness in her behalf let the men come on board if you think it necessary but the signorina can never climb this frigates sides  we will see to that more especially monsieur yvard as you appear to be so much interested in the ladys comfort at present it will be my duty to put you under a sentrys charge and that it may be done in a way the least offensive to yourself your prison for the night at least shall be this cabin mr griffin give orders to the marine officer accordingly  in a few minutes a soldier was introduced into the forward cabin and raoul was regularly placed under his charge not till then did the officers return to the quarterdeck all this time ithuel and his companions in the yawl were left to their own reflections which were anything but agreeable matters had been conducted so quietly inboard however that they possessed no clew to what had actually occurred though ghita in particular was full of forebodings and apprehensions the frigate towed them along at a rate which as raoul said had brought them quite abreast of their landing and within a league of it and yet she showed no signs of an intention to abate her speed nor did any one appear at the gangway to speak to them at length a hoarse call was heard on deck and the ship began to shorten sail her forecourse was hauled up and the spanker was brailed then the royals were clewed up and furled the topgallantsails followed and presently the proserpine was reduced to her three topsails and jib all this finished just as cuffe reappeared on deck was done by the watch and in about five minutes as soon as sail was thus taken in the helm was put to port the ship came up to the wind on the starboard tack and the maintopsail was laid to the mast bringing the yawl under her lee and close alongside of the ship this manoeuvre was no sooner executed than a seaman ran lightly down the vessels side and entered the yawl after examining forward and aft he called out all right sir and shoved the boat off to a little distance from the frigate the yard and staytackles fell at the next instant were overhauled down and hooked by the man in the boat the boatswains mate in the gangway piped haultaut and the slack of the tackle was pulled in then followed a long steady blow of the call piping swayaway and the boat with all in her rose from the water and ascended as high as the hammockcloths in the waist when the staytackles took the strain the yardtackles easedoff and the boat was landed in the waist of the ship as gingerly as if it were made of glass and as steadily as if it had no more weight than a seamans hammock ghita uttered a faint scream when she found herself rising into the air and then she hid her face awaiting the result with dread as for carlo giuntotardi the movement aroused him a little from his customary apathy and that was all whereas ithuel bethought him seriously of leaping into the water and striking out for the land he could swim a league he thought but there was the certainty of being followed by boats and overtaken a consideration that effectually curbed his impatience it is not easy to describe the sensation with which this man found himself once more standing on the deck of his old prison with the additional danger of being detected and treated as a deserter it may sound revolting at the present day to suppose a case in which a foreigner was thrown by violence into the military service of a nation and then was put in jeopardy of his life because he used a privilege of nature to fly from such persecution as soon as circumstances placed the means in his power the last age however witnessed many scenes of similar wrongs and it is to be feared in despite of all the mawkish philanthropy and unmeaning professions of eternal peace that it is now the fashion to array against the experience of mankind that the next age will present their parallels unless the good sense of this nation infuse into the federal legislative bodies juster notions of policy more extended views of their own duties and more accurate opinions of the conditions of the several communities of christendom than has marked their laws and reasoning for the few past months8 in a word the subject of all these tribulations felt an intimate conviction that his rights legal and moral would avail him but little on the present occasion then a man never does wrong even in defence of that which is inherently his due without the secret consciousness that evil may not be done that good may come of it and ithuel had a certain inward monitor to remind him that much as he had in the way of justifiable complaint he had carried the war into the enemys country  8 the question of impressment is now settled forever the united states have now a mortgage on the canadas to secure the good behavior of great britain  the boat had no sooner touched the deck than its cargo was handed out by the boatswain who keeping no watch had not yet turned in and who was almost as important a functionary on board the proserpine as was vito viti in the town of porto ferrajo he examined each individual as he or she landed as he called it ghita attracting so much of his attention as completely to eclipse her companions the soft air and manner of the girl appeared so winning indeed by the light of the moon which now fell clear upon the decks that all near her including the officers submitted to very much the same influence  so so master yvard said cuffe in english if you do come into an enemys camp incog it is in reasonably good company that girl is italian winchester and she even seems modest  little ghita exclaimed vito viti as i hope one day to lie in the bosom of father abraham bellissima ghita what has brought thee here and in such evil company  ghita was in tears but uncertain how far raoul was committed she struggled for selfcommand and did succeed in suppressing emotions that might otherwise have rendered his situation more dangerous drying her eyes she curtsied to the vicegovernatore and the podest√† and then answered the question  signori she said it is a relief to meet countrymen and old acquaintances on board this strange ship and i look to you for protection i do not call it strange or evil company for an orphan niece to be on the water with her uncle and one that has ever been a father to her  ahsure enough vicegovernatore this is carlo giuntotardi the uncle and the man who dwells so much with the saints even on earth that he seldom speaks to a sinner but thou knowest little ghita that one of thy watermen is no less a person that raoul yvard the wickedest corsair that sails out of france and the pest and persecution of the whole italian coast did the church condescend to notice such an unbelieving republican it would be to command all its faithful to unite in their prayers for his destruction  raoul yvard repeated ghita with sufficient astonishment in her manner to satisfy any reasonable amount of wonder on the part of the other are you certain signor podest√† of the truth of what you say  as certain as the confession of the party himself can make us  confession signore  si bella ghita confessionyour boatmanyour man of capriyour lazzarone confesses himself to be neither more nor less than the commander of that worker of iniquity le feufollet  does le feufollet do more than other cruisers of the enemybut ghita felt she was getting to be indiscreet and she ceased  i do believe winchester said cuffe that this is the very girl and yonder is the very old man who came into nelsons cabin today with something to say about the poor prince who was executed this afternoon  what could such people have in common with the unfortunate caraccioli  sure enoughyet these are the people the queen of the fleetour lady admiralesshad it all to herself and what passed between them in italian i know no more than if it had been in greek she never told me you may rest assured and from the look of her eye i question a good deal if she ever told nelson  i wish to heaven his lordship would cut adrift from his moorings alongside that craft captain cuffe i do assure you sir the fleet begins to talk loudly on the subjectwas it any other man thered be the devil to pay about itbut we can all stand a good deal from nelson and bront√©  wellwelllet every man father his own children you ought to be quiet winchester for he asked very kindly about your hurt today and would have sent you aboard some knickknack or other for the stomach but i told him you were all atanto again and at duty what between his head and his arm and his eye hes got to be such a hulk himself that he thinks every wounded man a sort of a relation i should not complain however if the smallpox could lay hold of that beauty  this has been a bad days work for england depend on it captain cuffe  well if it has st vincent and the nile were good days works and well let one balance the other inquire of this young woman mr griffin if i had not the pleasure of seeing her today on board the foudroyant  the question was put as desired and ghita quietly but unhesitatingly answered in the affirmative  then ask her to explain how she happened to fall into the company of raoul yvard  signori said ghita naturally for she had nothing to conceal on this point we live on monte argentaro where my uncle is the keeper of the princes towers you know we have much to fear from the barbarians along all that coast and last season when the peace with france kept the inglesi at a distancei know not how it is signore but they say the barbarians are always hardest on the enemies of inghilterrabut the past season a boat from a rover had seized upon my uncle and myself and were carrying us off into captivity when a frenchman and his lugger rescued us from that time we became friends and our friend has often stopped near our towers to visit us today we found him in a boat by the side of the english admirals ship and as an old acquaintance he undertook to bring us to the sorrentine shore where we are at present staying with my mothers sister  this was told so naturally as to carry with it the conviction of its truth and when griffin had translated it he did not fail to assure his superior that he would pledge himself for the accuracy of the statement  aye you young luffs griffin are never backward with your vows for or to pretty girls answered cuffe the girl does seem honest however and what is more extraordinary for the company she is in she seems modest too tell her she shall not be harmed though we cannot deprive ourselves of the pleasure of her company immediately she shall have the larboard stateroom in my cabin until morning where she and her uncle may live a great deal more comfortably than in one of their outofdoor neapolitan rookeries monte argentaro hathats a bluff just beyond the roman coast and it is famously besprinkled with towershalf a dozen of them at least within as many miles and who knows but this jackolantern may be extinguished some fine morning should we fail of laying our hands on it now  we can hardly fail of the last captain cuffe having her commander in our possession  orders were then given to dispose of the prisoners leaving the boat on deck raoul was sent below and put in a canvas stateroom the arms having been removed even to the razors and a sentinel placed at the door escape from such a situation was impossible and as for selfviolence when that point was considered cuffe had coolly remarked poor devil hanged he must be and if he should be his own executioner it will save us the discomfort of having a scene on board i suppose nelson will order him to our foreyardarm as a jewelblock i dont see why he cannot use a neapolitan frigate for this job too they are good for nothing else  i rather think captain cuffe he will swing on board his own lugger should we succeed in catching her answered the lieutenant  by george youre right griffin and thats another inducement for looking out sharp for the fewfolly how much better it would have been had we burnt them all in a bunch off the golo  then followed the arrangement by which the prisoner was put into the gunroom as mentioned ghita and her uncle were shown into the empty cabin stateroom and mattresses were provided on which they might repose then the captain and his two guests retired to the aftercabin whither griffin was invited to accompany them here the captain recollected that there had been a fourth individual in the boat and he sent an order on deck for him to come down for examination ithuel observing the attention of the officers occupied by ghita and her uncle had stolen back toward his own yawl of which he had taken possession stretching himself out at length with the apparent design to sleep but in reality to keep himself out of mind by remaining out of sight reserving in petto an intention to jump overboard should the ship go near enough to the land to give him a chance for his life after the moon set in this situation he was found aroused from his lair and led into the cabin  it has been mentioned that ithuel would not consent to trust himself near the proserpine without disguising his person raoul being well provided with all the materials for a masquerade this had been effected by putting a black curling wig over his own lank sandy hair coloring his whiskers and eyebrows and trusting the remainder to the transformation which might be produced by the dress or rather undress of a neapolitan waterman the greatest obstacle to this arrangement had been a certain queue which ithuel habitually wore in a cured eelskin that he had brought with him from america eight years before and both of which queue and eelskin he cherished as relics of better days once a week this queue was unbound and combed but all the remainder of the time it continued in a solid mass quite a foot in length being as hard and about as thick as a rope an inch in diameter now the queue had undergone its hebdomadal combing just an hour before raoul announced his intention to proceed to naples in the yawl and it would have been innovating on the only thing that ithuel treated with reverence to undo the work until another week had completed its round the queue therefore was disposed of under the wig in the best manner that its shape and solidity would allow  ithuel was left in the forecabin and his presence was announced to cuffe  its no doubt some poor devil belonging to the fewfollys crew observed the english captain in a rather compassionate manner and we can hardly think of stringing him up most probably for obeying an order that would never do griffin so well just step out and overhaul his log in french and send him off to england to a prisonship by the first return vessel  as this was said the four in the aftercabin left it together and stood before this new prisoner of course ithuel understood all that was said in english while the very idea of being catechized in french threw him into a cold sweat in this strait the idea suddenly crossed his mind that his greatest security would be in feigning dumbness  √âcoutez mon ami commenced griffin in very respectable englishfrench you are to tell me nothing but the truth and it may be all the better for you you belong to the feufollet of course  ithuel shook his head in strong disgust and endeavored to make a sound that he intended to represent a dumb man struggling to utter the word napoli  what is the fellow after griffin said cuffe can it be he doesnt understand french try him a touch in italian and let us see what he will say to that  griffin repeated very much what he had said before merely changing the language and received the same gagging sounds for an answer the gentlemen looked at each other as much as to express their surprise but unluckily for ithuels plan he had brought with him from the granite state a certain propensity to pass all the modulations of his voice through his nose and the effort to make a suppressed sound brought that member more than usually into requisition thereby producing a certain disagreeable combination that destroyed everything like music that commonly characterizes the italian words now andrea had been struck with this peculiarity about the tones of the americans voice in the interview at benedettas winehouse and the whole connection between raoul and this singular person being associated in his mind the truth flashed on him as it might be at a glance his previous success that night emboldened the worthy vicegovernatore and without any remark he walked steadily up to ithuel removed the wig and permitted the eelskin queue to resume its natural position on the back of its owner  hawhat veechy exclaimed cuffe laughingyou unearth them like so many foxes tonight now griffin hang me if i do not think ive seen that chap before isnt he the very man we found at the wheel of la voltigeuse when we boarded her  lord bless me captain cuffeno sir this fellow is as long as two of that chapand yet i know the face too i wish youd let me send for one of the young gentlemen sir theyre worth all the rest of the ship at remembering faces  the permission was given and the cabinsteward was sent on deck to desire mr roller one of the oldest midshipmen and who was known to have the watch to come below  look at this fellow mr roller said griffin as soon as the youngster had taken his place in the group and tell us if you can make anything of him  its the lazyrony sir we hoisted in a bit ago when we struck the boat on deck  aye no doubt of thatbut we think we have seen his face beforecan you make that out  roller now walked round the immovable subject of all these remarks and he too began to think the singularlooking object was no stranger to him as soon however as he got a sight of the queue he struck ithuel a smart slap on the shoulder and exclaimed  youre welcome back my lad i hope youll find your berth aloft as much to your mind as it used to be this is bolt captain cuffe the foretopman who ran from us when last in england was caught and put in a guardship from which they sent us word he stole a boat and got off with two or three french prisoners who happened to be there at the moment on some inquiry or other dont you remember it all mr griffinyou may remember the fellow pretended to be an american  ithuel was now completely exposed and he at once perceived that his wisest way was to submit cuffes countenance darkened for he regarded a deserter with a species of professional horror and the impressed deserter to whose services england had no other right than that of might with an additional degree of resentment that was very fairly proportioned to the inward consciousness he felt that a great wrong was done in detaining the man at all there is nothing extraordinary in these feelings a very common resource under such circumstances being to imagine delinquencies that justify us to ourselves by endeavoring to believe that the subject of any act of our oppression at least merits the infliction  do you dare to deny what this young gentleman has just said sirrah demanded the captain i now remember you myself you are bolt the foretopman that ran at plymouth  youd arun too captain cuffe had you been in my place had the ship been at jericho  enoughno impudence sir send for the masteratarms mr griffin and have the fellow ironed tomorrow well look into the affair  these orders were obeyed and ithuel was removed to the place where the masteratarms usually reigns on board ship cuffe now gave the lieutenant his cong√© and then withdrew to the innercabin to prepare a despatch for the rearadmiral he was near an hour writing a letter to his mind but finally succeeded its purport was as follows he reported the capture of raoul explaining the mode and the circumstances under which that celebrated privateersman had fallen into his hands he then asked for instructions as to the manner in which he was to dispose of his prisoner having communicated this important fact he ventured some suggestions as to the probable vicinity of the lugger and the hopes he entertained of being able to find out her precise situation through the agency of bolt whose condition he also explained hinting at the same time the expediency of bringing both delinquents to as speedy trials as possible as the most certain manner of using their apprehensions in seizing le feufollet the letter concluded with an earnest request that another frigate which was mentioned her captain being junior to cuffe and a fastsailing sloop that was lying off naples might be sent down to assist him in heading off the lugger as he feared the latter was too swift to be overtaken by the proserpine alone more especially in the light winds which prevailed  when this letter was written addressed and sealed cuffe went on deck again it was now nine oclock or two bells and winchester had the quarterdeck nearly to himself all was as tranquil and calm on the deck of that fine frigate as a moonlight night a drowsy watch a light wind and smooth water could render things in a bay like that of naples gleamings of fire were occasionally seen over vesuvius but things in that direction looked misty and mysterious though capri loomed up dark and grand a few miles to leeward and ischia was visible a confused but distant pile on the leebow an order from cuffe however set everybody in motion yard and staytackles were overhauled and hooked on the boatswainsmate piped the orders and the first cutter was hoisted over the waist cloths and lowered into the water away there you first cutters had been hoarsely called on the berthdeck and the crew were ready to enter the boat by the time the latter was lowered the masts were stepped roller appeared in a peajacket to guard against the night air and cuffe gave him his instructions  set your sails and stretch over under the north shore mr roller said the captain who stood in the leegangway to give a last word you will fetch in about queen joans palace there you had better take to your oars and pull up along the land remember sir to join us by the first ship that comes out and if none is sent to come down with the morning breeze in the boat  roller gave the customary aye aye sir the boat shoved off as soon as from under the lee of the ship the lugs were set and half an hour later the night had swallowed up her form cuffe remained an hour longer walking the deck with his firstlieutenant and then satisfied that the night would prove propitious he went below leaving orders to keep the ship lyingto until morning  as for roller he pulled alongside of the foudroyant just as the bells of the fleet were striking eight or midnight nelson was still up writing in his cabin the despatch was delivered and then the secretary of the admiral and a clerk or two were called from their berths for nothing lagged that this activeminded man had in charge orders were written copied signed and sent to different ships by two oclock that the morning breeze might not be lost and not till then did the employ√©s think of rest  roller left the flagship at two having eaten a hearty supper in nelsons own cabin and repaired on board the terpsichore a smart little frigate of thirtytwo guns twelve pounders with instructions to her captain to receive him two hours later this ship in company with another still smaller the ringdove 18 left her anchorage under a cloud of canvas and stood down the bay carrying studdingsails on both sides with a light wind at northwest heading toward capri    chapter xvii       speak to the business master secretary      why are we met in council       king henry viii  when the idlers of the proserpine appeared on deck the following morning the ship was about a league to windward of capri having forged well over toward the north side of the bay during the night wore round and got thus far back on the other tack from the moment light returned lookouts had been aloft with glasses examining every nook and corner of the bay in order to ascertain whether any signs of the lugger were to be seen under its bold and picturesque shore so great is the extent of this beautiful basin so grand the natural objects which surround it and so clear the atmosphere that even the largest ships loom less than usual on its waters and it would have been a very possible thing for le feufollet to anchor near some of the landings and lie there unnoticed for a week by the fleet above unless tidings were carried to the latter by observers on the shore  cuffe was the last to come on deck six bells or seven oclock striking as the group on the quarterdeck first lifted their hats to him he glanced around him and then turned toward griffin who was now officer of the watch  i see two ships coming down the bay mr griffin he saidno signals yet i suppose sir  certainly not sir or they would have been reported we make out the frigate to be the terpsichore and the sloop i know by her new royals is the ringdove the first ship captain cuffe brags of being able to travel faster than anything within the straits  ill bet a months pay the fewfolly walks away from her on a bowline ten knots to her nine if she can do that with the proserpine shell at least do that with mistress terpsichore there goes a signal from the frigate now mr griffin though a conjuror could hardly read it tailing directly on as it does well quartermaster what do you make it out to be  its the terpsichores number sir and the other ship has just made the ringdoves  show ours and keep a sharp lookout therell be something else to tell us presently  in a few minutes the terpsichore expressed a wish to speak the proserpine when cuffe filled his maintopsail and hauled close upon a wind an hour later the three ships passed within hail of each other when both the junior commanders lowered their gigs and came on board the proserpine to report  roller followed in the first cutter which had been towed down by the terpsichore  the terpsichore was commanded by captain sir frederick dashwood a lively young baronet who preferred the active life of a sailor to indolence and six thousand a year on shore and who had been rewarded for his enterprise by promotion and a fast frigate at the early age of two and twenty the ringdove was under a mastercommandant of the name of lyon who was just sixty years old having worked his way up to his present rank by dint of long and arduous services owing his last commission and his command to the accident of having been a first lieutenant at the battle of cape st vincent both these gentlemen appeared simultaneously on the quarterdeck of the proserpine where they were duly received by the captain and all the assembled officers  good morrow to you cuffe said dashwood giving the other the tip of his fingers as soon as the ceremonious part of the reception was over and casting a glance half admiring half critical at the appearance of things on deckwhat has nelson sent us down here about this fine morning andhahow long have you had those brass ornaments on your capstan  they were only put there yesterday sir frederick a little slush money did it all  has nelson seen them i rather fancy notthey tell me hes as savage as an arab about knickknackery nowadays what an awkward job that was yesterday afternoon by the way cuffe  it has been a bad business and as an old agamemnon i would give a years rank that it never had taken place  a years rankthats a great deal a year would set me back hard aground alongside of old lyon here i was a lieutenant less than three years since and couldnt afford half a year but all you old agamemnons think as much of your little nel as if he were a pretty girl isnt it true lyon  i dare say it may be sir frederick answered lyon and if you had been the first lieutenant of a twodecker off cape st vincent on the 14th february 1797 you would have thought as much of him too here we were only fifteen sail in allthat is of vessels of the linewith the wind at  oh hang your battle lyon ive heard all that at least seventeen times  well if ye haave sir frederick returned lyon who was a scotchman itll be just once a year since ye war born leaving out the time ye war in the nursery but weve not come here to enlighten captain cuffe in these particulars so much as in obedience to an order of the rearadmiralslittle nel as yell be calling him i suppose sir frederick dashwood  nay its you old agamemnons or old fellows who gave him that name  yell please to excuse me sir interrupted lyon a little dogmaticallyyeve never heard me call him anything but my lord since his majesty god bless him was graciously pleased to elevate him to the peeragenothing but my lord and the rearadmiral naval rank being entitled to its privileges even on the throne many a king has been a colonel and i see no disparagement in ones being an admiral wont ye be thinking captain cuffe that since my lord is made duke of bront√© he is entitled to be called your graceall the scottish dukes are so designated and i see no reason why the rearadmiral should not have his just dues as well as the best of them  let him alone for that said cuffe laughing nel will look out for himself as well as for the king but gentlemen i suppose you have not come down here merely for a morning walkhave i any reports to hear  i beg your pardon captain cuffe but i was really forgetting my errand answered dashwood here are your orders and we are both directed to report to you the lieutenant who brought the package aboard me said there would be a spy to try and a lugger to catch did they tell you anything of this matter lyon  no sir frederick not being inquisitive i hear but little of what is going on in the fleet my orders are to report myself and ship to captain cuffe for service which i have the honor now to do  well gentlemen here are further instructions for you this is an order to hold a court composed of captain richard cuffe of the proserpine president captain sir frederick dashwood bart of the terpsichore etc etc and lyon winchester and spriggs your firstlieutenant sir frederick for the trials of raoul yvard a french citizen on the charge of being a spy and ithuel bolt seaman etc on the charge of being a deserter here is everything in rule and there are your respective orders gentlemen  bless me id no notion of this exclaimed lyon who was greatly averse to this part of an officers duty id thought it altogether a trial of speed after a frenchman for which purpose the rearadmiral or my lord or his grace whichever it may be right to call him had seen fit to bring three of his fastest ships together  i wish it was nothing but the last captain lyon but we have the disagreeable duty of trying a spy and a deserter before us you will return to your ships gentlemen and follow us in to an anchorage i intend to bring up at a single anchor under the shore at capri where we can lie during the calm and get through with our courts the cases will be clear and not detain us long and we can send lookouts up on the heights to examine the sea and the coast outside in the mean time we must be busy lest we lose the breeze you will attend to the signal for the court  at this order the two visitors got into their boats and the proserpine again filled the three vessels now made the best of their way toward the point of destination anchoring off the town or village in the island of capri just as two bells struck ten minutes later the proserpine fired a gun and ran up the flag which denotes the sitting of a courtmartial  although it has not been deemed necessary to relate them the reader will understand that all the details required by the law had been observed as regards these trials the promptitude of the proceedings being partly characteristic of the decision of the admiral but more in consequence of a wish to use the charges against the delinquents as a means of seizing the true hero of our tale the little feufollet while a mistaken not to say a mawkish philanthropy is unsettling so many of the ancient landmarks of society and among other heresies is preaching the doctrine that the object of punishment is the reformation of the criminal it is a truth which all experience confirms that nothing renders justice so terrible and consequently so efficient as its promptitude and certainty when all its requirements are observed the speediest exercise of its functions is the most conducive to the protection of society the real motive for the existence of all human regulations of this nature and it is a great merit of the muchabused english ordinances that the laws are rarely made stalkinghorses for the benefit of the murderer or the forger but that once fairly tried and convicted the expiation of their crimes awaits the offenders with a certainty and energy that leave the impression on the community that punishments were intended to produce that this people has done well in liberating itself from many of their inherited usages and laws is as certain as that one age has interests different from another one set of circumstances governing principles at variance with those which preceded them but it would be well also to remember that while moral changes are as necessary as physical exercise there are truths that are eternal and rules of right and prudence which can never be departed from with impunity  when the members of the court mentioned assembled in the cabin of the proserpine it was with all the forms and exterior observances that were necessary to command respect the officers were in full dress the oaths were administered with solemnity the table was arranged with taste and an air of decent gravity reigned over all little time however was lost unnecessarily and the officer to whom had been assigned the duty of pr√©v√¥tmarshal was directed to produce his prisoners  raoul yvard and ithuel bolt were brought into the cabin at the same moment though they came from different parts of the ship and were allowed to hold no communication with each other when both were present they were arraigned and the accusations were read to them raoul having admitted his knowledge of english no interpreter was sworn but the proceedings were had in the usual manner as it was intended to try the frenchman first and ithuel might be wanted as a witness the latter was taken out of the cabin again courtsmartial never permitting one witness to hear what another has testified although an ingenious substitute for ears has been adopted of late by publishing in the journals from day to day whatever passes when the length of the proceedings will admit of such a device  we will now swear the signor andrea barrofaldi commenced the judge advocate as soon as the preliminaries were observed this is a catholic bible sir and i will put the oaths in italian if you will have the goodness first to swear me in as an interpreter  this was done when the oath was duly administered to the vicegovernatore then came a few questions as to the station country etc of the witness after which more material matter was inquired into  signor vicegovernatore do you know the prisoner by sight demanded the judge advocate  sir i have had the honor to receive him in my residence in the island of elba  under what name and circumstances was he known to you signore  ehhe called himself sir smees a capitano in the service of the english king  what vessel did he pretend to command  ze vingyvinga lugger which i have since had reason to think is le feufollet a corsair under the french flag monsieur did me the favor to make two visits to porto ferrajo in the character of sir smees  and you know now that this is raoul yvard the french privateersman you have mentioned  ehknowi know they say this is the signor yvard and that ze vingyving is le feufollet  they say will not do signor barrofaldi can you not say this much of your own knowledge  non signore  the court was now cleared when it reopened vito viti was sent for and properly sworn his attention being particularly directed to the cross on the back of the book  did you ever see the prisoner before this occasion signor viti demanded the judge advocate after the preliminary questions had been put  signore oftener than it is agreeable to remember i do not think that two grave magistrates were ever more mystified than were the vicegovernatore and myself ehhhsignori the wisest sometimes become like sucking children when there passes a mist before the understanding  relate the circumstances under which this occurred to the court signor podest√†  why signori the facts were just these andrea barrofaldi as you know is the vicegovernatore of porto ferrajo and i am its unworthy podest√† of course it is our duty to look into all matters affecting the public weal and more especially into the business and occupations of strangers who come into our island well it is now three weeks or more since the lugger or felucca was seen  which was it a felucca or a lugger demanded the judge advocate holding his pen ready to write the answer  both signore a felucca and a lugger  ahthere were two a felucca and a lugger  no signore but this felucca was a lugger tommaso tonti wished to mystify me about that too but i have not been podest√† in a seaport so many years for nothing no signori there are all sorts of feluccasshipfeluccas brigfeluccas and luggerfeluccas  when this answer was translated the members of the court smiled while raoul yvard laughed out honestly  well signor podest√† resumed the judge advocatethe prisoner came into porto ferrajo in a lugger  so it was said signore i did not see him actually on board of her but he professed to be the commander of a certain vessel in the service of the king of inghilterra called ze vingyving and said that his own name was smeessiil capitano or sir smees  professed do you not know that this lugger was the notorious french privateer le feufollet  i know they say so now signori but the vicegovernatore and i supposed her to be ze vingyving  and do you not know that the prisoner is actually raoul yvard of your own knowledge i mean  corpo di baccohow should i know any such thing signor guidecaavvocato exclaimed vito viti who literally translated what he understood to be the title of his interrogator thereby converting him into a sort of shipfeluccahow should i know any such thing i do not keep company with corsairs except when they come upon our island and call themselves sir smees  the judge advocate and the members of the court looked gravely at each other no one in the least doubted that the prisoner was raoul yvard but it was necessary legally to prove it before he could be condemned cuffe was now asked if the prisoner had not confessed his own identity but no one could say he had done so in terms although his conversation would seem to imply as much in a word justice was like to be in what is by no means an unusual dilemma for that upright functionary viz unable to show a fact that no one doubted at length cuffe recollected ghita and ithuel and he wrote their names on a piece of paper and passed them down the table to the judge advocate the latter nodded his head as much as to say he understood the presidents meaning and then he told the prisoner he might crossexamine the witness if he saw fit  raoul fully understood his situation although he certainly had not entered the bay of naples with any of the ordinary views of a spy he was aware how far he had committed himself and foresaw the readiness with which his enemies would destroy him could they find the legal means of so doing he also comprehended the dilemma in which his accusers were placed for the want of testimony and at once resolved to turn the circumstance as much as possible to his advantage until that moment the idea of denying his own identity had never crossed his mind but perceiving what he fancied an opening for escape it was but natural to avail himself of its protection turning then to the podest√† he put his questions in english that they might go fairly through the same process of interpretation as the rest of the examination  you say signor podest√† he commenced that you saw me in the town of porto ferrajo and in the island of elba  siin which town i have the honor to be one of the authorities  you say i professed to command a vessel in the service of the king of england a felucca called ze vingandving  size vingyvingthe commander of that felucca  i understood you to say mr podest√† put in lyon that the craft was a lugger  a feluccalugger signor capitanonothing more nor less than that on my honor  and all these honorable officers well know observed raoul ironically that a feluccalugger and a lugger such as le feufollet is understood to be are very different things now signore you have never heard me say that i am a frenchman  nonyou have not been so weak as to confess that to one who hates the name of the fran√ßese cospetto if all the grand dukes subjects detested his enemies as i do he would be the most powerful prince in italy  no doubt signore and now suffer me to inquire if you heard any other name for that felucca than ze vingandving did i ever call her le feufollet  nonalways ze vingyving never anything else but  your pardon signore have the goodness to answer my questions i called the felucca ze vingandving and i called myself le capitaine smeet is it not true  sivingyving and il capitano smeessir smees a signore of an illustrious english family of that name if i remember right  raoul smiled for he was confident this notion proceeded principally from the selfillusion of the two italians themselves the little he had said on the subject having been drawn out more by their suggestions than by any design on his part still he did not deem it prudent to contradict the podest√† who as yet had testified to nothing that could possibly criminate him  if a young man has the vanity to wish to be thought noble answered raoul calmly it may prove his folly but it does not prove him a spy you did not hear me confess myself a frenchman you say now did you not hear me say i was born in guernsey  sithe signore did say that the family of smees came from that islandas the vicegovernatore calls it though i acknowledge i never heard of such an island there are sicilia sardegna elba caprea ischia irlanda inghilterra scozia malta capraya pianosa gorgona and america with several more in the east but i never heard of such an island as guernsey si signore we are humble people and i hope modest people in the island of elba but we do know something of the rest of the world notwithstanding if you wish to hear these matters touched on ingeniously however you will do well to call in the vicegovernatore for half an hour and invite him to open his stores of knowledge san antonioi doubt if italy has his equalat islands in particular  good continued raoul and now tell these officers signore podest√† if you can say on your oath that i had anything to do with that felucca ze vingandving at all  i cannot signore except from your own words you were dressed like one of these officers here in an english uniform and said you commanded ze vingyving while speaking of islands signori i forgot palmavola and ponza both of which we passed in this ship on our voyage from elba  goodit is always well to be particular under oath now signor podest√† the result of all your evidence is that you do not know that the felucca you mention was le feufollet that i am a frenchman even much less that i am raoul yvard and that i told you that i was from guernsey and that my name was jacques smeetis it not so  siyou did say your name was giac smees and you did not say you were raoul yvard but signore i saw you firing your cannon at the boats of this frigate with french colors flying and that is some signs of an enemy as we understand these matters in porto ferrajo  raoul felt that this was a direct blow still it wanted the connecting link to make it testimony  but you did not see me doing thisyou mean you saw ze vingandving in a combat with the frigates boats  sithat was itbut you told me you were commander of ze vingyving  let us understand you put in the judge advocateis it the intention of the prisoner to deny his being a frenchman and an enemy  it is my intention sir to deny everything that is not proved  but your accentyour englishnay your appearance show that you are a frenchman  your pardon sir there are many nations that speak french which are not french today all along the north frontier of france is french spoken by foreignerssavoy and geneva and vaudalso the english have french subjects in the canadas besides guernsey and jersey you will not hang a man because his accent is not from london  we shall do you justice prisoner observed cuffe and you shall have the benefit of every doubt that makes in your favor still it may be well to inform you that the impression of your being a frenchman and raoul yvard is very strong and if you can show to the contrary you would do well to prove it by direct testimony  how will this honorable court expect that to be done i was taken in a boat last night and am tried this morning at a notice as short as that which was given to caraccioli give me time to send for witnesses and i will prove who and what i am  this was said coolly and with the air of a man assured of his own innocence and it produced a slight effect on his judges for an appeal to the unvarying principles of right seldom falls unheeded on the ear nevertheless there could be no doubt in the minds of the officers of the proserpine in particular either as to the character of the lugger or as to that of the prisoner and men under such circumstances were not likely to allow an enemy who had done them so much injury to escape the appeal only rendered them more cautious and more determined to protect themselves against charges of unfair proceedings  have you any further questions to put to the witness prisoner inquired the president of the court  none at present sirwe will go on if you please gentlemen  call ithuel bolt said the judge advocate reading the new witnesss name from a list before him  raoul started for the idea of the americans being brought forward in this capacity had never occurred to him in a minute ithuel appeared was sworn and took his place at the foot of the table  your name is ithuel bolt observed the judge advocate holding his pen in readiness to record the answer  so they say aboard here answered the witness coollythough for my part ive no answer to give to such a question  do you deny your name sir  i deny nothingwant to say nothing or to have anything to do with this trial or this ship  raoul breathed easier for to own the truth he had not much confidence in ithuels constancy or disinterestedness and he apprehended that he had been purchased with the promise of a pardon for himself  you will remember that you are under oath and may be punished for contumacy on refusing to answer  ive some gineral idees of law answered ithuel passing his hand over his queue to make sure it was right for we all do a little at that in ameriky i practised some myself when a young man though it was only afore a justicepeace we used to hold that a witness neednt answer agin himself  is it then on account of criminating yourself that you answer thus vaguely  i decline answering that question answered ithuel with an air of dignity  witness have you any personal knowledge of the prisoner  i decline answering that question too  do you know anything of such a person as raoul yvard  what if i doim a native american and have a right to form acquaintances in foreign lands if i see its to my interest or its agreeable to my feelins  have you never served on board his majestys ships  what majestytheres no majesty in ameriky as i know but the majesty of heaven  remember that your answers are all recorded and may tell against you on some other occasion  not lawfully a witness cant be made to give answers that tell agin himself  certainly not made to do it still he may do it of his own accord  then its the duty of the court to put him on his guard ive heerd that agin and agin in ameriky  did you ever see a vessel called le feufollet  how in natur is a mariner to tell all the vessels he may happen to see on the wide ocean  did you ever serve under the french flag  i decline entering at all into my private affairs being free im free to sarve where i please  it is useless to ask this witness any further questions cuffe quietly observed the man is well known in this ship and his own trial will most probably take place as soon as this is ended  the judge advocate assented and ithuel was permitted to withdraw his contumacy being treated with the indifference that power is apt to exhibit toward weakness still there was no legal proof on which to convict the prisoner no one doubted his guilt and there were the strongest reasons short of a downright certainty for supposing that he commanded the lugger which had so recently fought the boats of the very ship in which the court was sitting but notwithstanding supposition was not the evidence the laws required and the recent execution of caraccioli had made so much conversation that few would condemn without seeing their justification before them things were really getting to be seriously awkward and the court was again cleared for the purpose of consultation in the private discourse that followed cuffe stated all that had occurred the manner in which raoul had been identified and the probabilitiesnay moral certaintiesof the case at the same time he was forced to allow that he possessed no direct evidence that the lugger he had chased was a frenchman at all and least of all le feufollet it is true she had worn the french flag but she had also worn the english and the proserpine had done the same thing to be sure the lugger had fought under the drapeau tricolor which might be taken as a strong circumstance against her but it was not absolutely conclusive for the circumstances might possibly justify deception to the last moment and he admitted that the frigate herself had appeared to fire at the batteries under the same ensign the case was allowed to be embarrassing and while no one really doubted the identity of raoul those who were behind the curtains greatly feared they might be compelled to adjourn the trial for want of evidence instead of making an immediate sentence the means of getting possession of the lugger as had been hoped when all these points had been sufficiently discussed and cuffe had let his brethren into his view of the real state of the case he pointed out a course that he still trusted would prove effectual after a few minutes of further deliberation on this information the doors were opened and the court resumed its public sitting as before  let a young woman who is known by the name of ghita be brought in next said the judge advocate consulting his notes  raoul started and a shade of manly concern passed over his face but he soon recovered and seemed unmoved ghita and her uncle had been taken from the cabin stateroom and placed below in order that the private consultation might be perfectly secret and it was necessary to wait a few minutes until she could be summoned these past the door opened and the girl entered the room she cast a glance of tender concern at raoul but the novelty of her situation and the awful character of an oath to one of her sensitive conscience and utter inexperience soon drew her attention entirely to the scene more immediately before her the judge advocate explained the nature of the oath she was required to take and then he administered it had ghita been taken less by surprise or had she in the least foreseen the consequences no human power could have induced her to submit to be sworn but ignorant of all this she submitted passively kissing the cross with reverence and even offering to kneel as she made the solemn protestation all this was painful to the prisoner who distinctly foresaw the consequences still so profound was his reverence for ghitas singleness of heart and mind that he would not by look or gesture in any manner endeavor to undermine that sacred love of truth which he knew formed the very foundations of her character she was accordingly sworn without anything occurring to alarm her affectations or to apprise her of what might be the sad result of the act      chapter xviii       hic et ubique then well shift our ground      come hither gentlemen      and lay your hands upon my sword      swear by my sword       hamlet  your name is ghita commenced the judge advocate examining his memorandaghita what  ghita caraccioli signore answered the girl in a voice so gentle and sweet as to make a friend of every listener  the name however was not heard without producing a general start and looks of surprise were exchanged among all in the room most of the officers of the ship who were not on duty being present as spectators  caraccioli repeated the judge advocate with emphasis that is a great name in italy do you assume to belong to the illustrious house which bears this appellation  signore i assume to own nothing that is illustrious being merely an humble girl who lives with her uncle in the princes towers on monte argentaro  how happens it then that you bear the distinguished name of caraccioli signorina  i dare say mr medford observed cuffe in english of course that the young woman doesnt know herself whence she got the name these matters are managed very loosely in italy  signore resumed ghita earnestly after waiting respectfully for the captain to get through i bear the name of my father as is usual with children but it is a name on which a heavy disgrace has fallen so lately as yesterday his father having been a sight for the thousands of naples to gaze on as his aged body hung at the yard of one of your ships  and do you claim to be the granddaughter of that unfortunate admiral  so i have been taught to consider myself may his soul rest in a peace that his foes would not grant to his body that criminal as you doubtless believe him was my fathers father though few knew it when he was honored as a prince and a high officer of the kings  a deep silence followed the singularity of the circumstance and the air of truth which pervaded the manner of the girl uniting to produce a profound sensation  the admiral had the reputation of being childless observed cuffe in an undertone doubtless this girls father has been the consequence of some irregular connection  if there has been a promise or any words of recognition uttered before witnesses muttered lyon accordin to the laws of scotland issue and a few pairtenant expressions will splice a couple as strongly as yell be doing it in england before either of the archbishops  as this is italy it is not probable that the same law rules here proceed mr judge advocate  well ghita caraccioliif that be your namei wish to know if you have any acquaintance with a certain raoul yvard a frenchman and the commander of a private luggerofwar called le feufollet remember you are sworn to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth  ghitas heart beat violently and the color came into her face with the impetuosity of sensitive alarm she had no knowledge of courts and the object of the inquiry was unknown to her then followed the triumph of innocence the purity of her mind and the quiet of her conscience reassuring her by bringing the strong conviction that she had no reason to blush for any sentiment she might happen to entertain  signore she said dropping her eyes to the floor for the gaze of all the court was fastened on her facei am aquainted with raoul yvard the person you mention this is he who sits between those two cannon he is a frenchman and he does command the lugger called the feufollet  i knew we should get it all by this witness exclaimed cuffe unable to suppress the relief he felt at obtaining the required testimony  you say that you know this of your own knowledge resumed the judge advocate  messieurs said raoul rising will you grant me leave to speak this is a cruel scene and rather than endure itrather than give this dear girl the cause for future pain that i know her answers will bringi ask that you permit her to retire when i promise to admit all that you can possibly prove by her means  a short consultation followed when ghita was told to withdraw but the girl had taken the alarm from the countenance of raoul although she did not understand what passed in english and she was reluctant to quit the place in ignorance  have i said aught to injure thee raoul she anxiously askedi was sworn on the word of god and by the sacred crosshad i foreseen any harm to thee the power of england would not have made me take so solemn an oath and then i might have been silent  it matters not dearestthe fact must come out in some way or other and in due time you shall know all and now messieursthe door closing on ghitathere need be no further concealment between us i am raoul yvardthe person you take me for and the person that some of you must well know me to be i fought your boats monsieur cuffeavoided your brul√¥t and led you a merry chase round elba i deceived the signor barrofaldi and his friend the podest√† and all for the love of this beautiful and modest girl who has just left the cabin no other motive having carried me into porto ferrajo or into this bay of naples on the honor of a frenchman  umph muttered lyon it must be admitted sir frederick that the prisoner appeals to a most eligible standard  on another occasion national antipathy and national prejudice might have caused the rest of the court to smile at this sally but there was an earnestness and sincerity in the manner and countenance of raoul which if they did not command entire belief at least commanded respect it was impossible to deride such a man and longcherished antipathies were rebuked by his spirited and manly declarations  there will be no further occasion for witnesses mr judge advocate if the prisoner be disposed to acknowledge the whole truth observed cuffe it is proper however monsieur yvard to apprise you of the possible consequences you are on trial for your life the charge being that of coming on board an english ship in disguise or rather into the centre of an english fleet you being an alien enemy engaged in carrying on open warfare against his majesty  i am a frenchman monsieur and i serve my country answered raoul with dignity  your right to serve your country no one will dispute but you must know it is against the laws of civilized warfare to act the part of a spy you are now on your guard and will decide for yourself if you have anything to say we will hear it  messieurs there is little more to be said answered raoul that i am your enemy as i am of all those who seek the downfall of france i do not deny you know who i am and what i am and i have no excuses to make for being either as brave englishmen you will know how to allow for the love a frenchman bears his country as for coming on board this ship you cannot bring that as a charge against me since it was at your own invitation i did it the rites of hospitality are as sacred as they are general  the members of the court exchanged significant glances with each other and there was a pause of more than a minute then the judge advocate resumed his duties saying  i wish you to understand prisoner the precise legal effect of your admissions then i wish them to be made formally and deliberately else we must proceed to the examination of other witnesses you are said to be raoul yvard an alien enemy in arms against the king  monsieur this i have already admitted it cannot honorably be denied  you are accused of coming on board his majestys ship proserpine disguised and of calling yourself a boatman of capri when you were raoul yvard an alien enemy bearing arms against the king  this is all true but i was invited on board the ship as i have just stated  you are furthermore accused of rowing in among the ships of his majesty now lying in the bay of naples and which ships are under the orders of rearadmiral lord nelson duke of bront√© in sicily you being in the same disguise though an alien enemy with the intent to make your observations as a spy and doubtless to avail yourself of information thus obtained to the injury of his majestys subjects and to your own advantage and that of the nation you serve  monsieur this is not soparole dhonneur i went into the bay in search of ghita caraccioli who has my whole heart and whom i would persuade to become my wife nothing else carried me into the bay and i wore this dress because i might otherwise have been known and arrested  this is an important fact if you can prove it for though it might not technically acquit you it would have its effect on the commanderinchief when he comes to decide on the sentence of this court  raoul hesitated he did not doubt that ghita she whose testimony had just proved so serious a matter against him would testify that she believed such was alone his motive and this too in a way and with corroborative circumstances that would carry weight with the more particularly as she could testify that he had done the same thing before in the island of elba and was even in the practice of paying her flying visits at monte argentaro nevertheless raoul felt a strong reluctance to have ghita again brought before the court with the jealous sensitiveness of true love he was averse to subjecting its object to the gaze and comments of the rude of his own sex then he knew his power over the feelings of the girl and had too much sensibility not to enter into all the considerations that might influence a man on a point so delicate and he could not relish the idea of publicly laying bare feelings that he wished to be as sacred to others as they were to himself  can you prove what you have just averred raoul yvard demanded the judge advocate  monsieuri fear it will not be in my power there is onebuti much fear it will not be in my powerunless indeed i am permitted to examine my companion he who has already been before you  you mean ithuel bolt i presume he has not yet been regularly before us but you can produce him or any other witness the court reserving to itself the right to decide afterward on the merits of the testimony  then monsieur i could wish to have etooell here  the necessary directions were given and ithuel soon stood in the presence of his judges the oath was tendered and ithuel took it like a man who had done such things before  your name is ithuel bolt commenced the judge advocate  so they call me on board this shipbut if i am to be a witness let me swear freely i dont wish to have words put into my mouth or idees chained to me with iron  as this was said ithuel raised his arms and exhibited his handcuffs which the masteratarms had refused to remove and the officers of the court had overlooked a reproachful glance from cuffe and a whisper from yelverton disposed of the difficultyithuel was released  now i can answer more conscientiously continued the witness grinning sardonically when iron is eating into the flesh a man is apt to swear to what he thinks will be most agreeable to his masters go on squire if you have anything to say  you appear to be an englishman  do i then i appear to be what i am not im a native of the granite state in north america my fathers went to that region in times long gone by to uphold their religious idees the whole country thereabouts sets onaccountable store by their religious privileges  do you know the prisoner ithuel boltthe person who is called raoul yvard  ithuel was a little at a loss exactly how to answer this question notwithstanding the high motive which had led his fathers into the wilderness and his own peculiar estimate of his religious advantages an oath had got to be a sort of convertible obligation with him ever since the day he had his first connection with a customhouse a man who had sworn to so many false invoices was not likely to stick at a trifle in order to serve a friend still by denying the acquaintance he might bring discredit on himself and thus put it out of his power to be of use to raoul on some more material point as between himself and the frenchman there existed a remarkable moral discrepancy for while he who prided himself on his religious ancestry and pious education had a singularly pliable conscience raoul almost an atheist in opinion would have scorned a simple lie when placed in a situation that touched his honor in the way of warlike artifices few men were more subtle or loved to practise them oftener than raoul yvard but the mask aside or when he fell back on his own native dignity of mind death itself could not have extorted an equivocation from him on the other hand ithuel had an affection for a liemore especially if it served himself or injured his enemy finding a mode of reconciling all this to his spirituality that is somewhat peculiar to fanaticism as it begins to grow threadbare on the present occasion he was ready to say whatever he thought would most conform to his shipmates wishes and luckily he construed the expression of the others countenance aright  i do know the prisoner as you call him squire ithuel answered after the pause that was necessary to come to his conclusioni do know him well and a master crittur he is when he fairly gets into a current of your english trade had there been a rule yvard on board each of the frenchmen at the nile over here in egypt nelson would have found that his letter stood in need of some postscripts i guess  confine your answers witness to the purport of the question put in cuffe with dignity  ithuel stood too much in habitual awe of the captain of his old ship to venture on an answer but if looks could have done harm that important functionary would not have escaped altogether uninjured as he said nothing the examination proceeded  you know him to be raoul yvard the commander of the french privateer lugger le feufollet continued the judge advocate deeming it prurient to fortify his record of the prisoners confession of identity with a little collateral evidence  whyi some thinkanswered ithuel with a peculiar provincialism that had a good deal of granite in itthat is i kind o concludecatching an assent from raouls eyeoh yesof that there isnt the smallest mite of doubt in the world hes the captain of the lugger and a right down good one he is  you were with him in disguise when he came into the bay of naples yesterday  i in disguise squirewhat have i got to disguise i am an american of different callings all of which i practyse as convenience demands being a neutral ive no need of disguises to go anywhere i am never disguised except when my jib is a little bowsed out and that you know is a comeover that befals most seafaring men at times  you need answer nothing concerning yourself that will tend to criminate you do you know with what inducement or on what business raoul yvard came into the bay of naples yesterday  to own to you the candid truth squire i do not answered ithuel simply for the nature of the tie which bound the young frenchman so closely to ghita was a profound mystery in all that related to its more sacred feelings to a being generally so obtuse on matters of pure sentiment  captain rule is a good deal given to prying about on the coast and what particular eend he had in view in this expedition i cannot tell you his arnds in shore i must own be sometimes onaccountablewitness the island of elby gentlemen  ithuel indulged in a small laugh as he made this allusion for in his own way he had a humor in which he occasionally indulged after a manner that belonged to the class of which he was a conspicuous member  never mind what occurred at elba prisoner do you wish to question the witness  etuelle asked raoul do you not know that i love ghita caraccioli  why captain rule i know you think so and say sobut i set down all these matters as somewhat various and onaccountable  have i not often landed on the enemys coast solely to see her and to be near her  by this time ithuel who was a little puzzled at first to understand what it all meant had got his cue and no witness could have acquitted himself better than he did from that moment  that you have he answered a hundred times at least and right in the teeth of my advice  was not my sole object in coming into the bay yesterday to find ghita and ghita only  just so of that gentlemen there can be no more question than there is about vesuvius standing up at the head of the bay smoking like a brickkiln that was captain rules sole arnd  i just understood ye to say witness put in lyon and that only a bit since that ye did not know the prisoners motive in coming into the bay of naples ye called his behavior unaccountable  very true sir and so it is to me i knowd all along that love was at the bottom of it but i dont call love a motive while i do call it unaccountable loves a feelin and not a nature thats the explanation ont yes i knowd it was love for miss gyty but then thats not a motive in law  answer to the facts the court will judge of the motive for itself how do you know that love for the young woman you mention was raoul yvards only object in coming into the bay  one finds out such things by keeping company with a man captain rule went first to look for the young woman up on the mountain yonder where her aunt lives and i went with him to talk english if it got to be necessary and not finding gyty at home we got a boat and followed her over to naples thus you see sir that i have reason to know what craft he was in chase of the whole time  as all this was strictly true ithuel related it naturally and in a way to gain some credit  you say you accompanied raoul yvard witness in a visit to the aunt of the young woman called ghita caraccioli observed cuffe in a careless way that was intended to entrap ithuel into an unwary answerwhere did you go from when you set out on your journey  that would depend on the place one kept his reckoning from and the time of starting now i might say i started from ameriky which part of the world i left some years since or i might say from nantes the port in which we fitted for sea as for captain rule he would probably say nantes  in what manner did you come from nantes continued cuffe without betraying resentment at an answer that might be deemed impertinent or surprise as if he found it difficult to comprehend you did not make the journey on horseback i should think  oh i begin to understand you captain cuffe why if the truth must be said we came in the lugger the fewfolly  i supposed as much and when you went to visit this aunt where did you leave the lugger  we didnt leave her at all sir being under her canvas our feet were no sooner in the boat and the line cast off than she left us as if we had been stuck up like a tree on dry ground  where did this happen  afloat of course captain cuffe such a thing would hardly come to pass ashore  all that i understand but you say the prisoner left his vessel in order to visit an aunt of the young womans thence he went into the bay for the sole purpose of finding the young woman herself now this is an important fact as it concerns the prisoners motives and may affect his life the court must act with all the facts before it as a commencement tell us where raoul yvard left his lugger to go on yonder headland  i do not think captain cuffe youve got the story exactly right captain rule didnt go on the mountain ater all so much to see the aunt as to see the niece at the aunts dwelling if one would eend right in a story he must begin right  i left le feufollet monsieur le capitaine raoul calmly observed not two cables length from the very spot where your own ship is now lying but it was at an hour of the night when the good people of capri were asleep and they knew nothing of our visit you see the lugger is no longer here  and do you confirm this story under the solemnity of your oath demanded cuffe of ithuel little imagining how easy it was to the witness to confirm anything he saw fit in the way he mentioned  sartain every word is true gentlemen answered ithuel it was not more than a cables length from this very spot according to my judgment  and where is the lugger now asked cuffe betraying the drift of all his questions in his eagerness to learn more  ithuel was not to be led on so hurriedly or so blindly affecting a girlish sort of coyness he answered simpering  why captain cuffe i cannot think of answering a question like that under the solemnity of an oath as you call it no one can know where the little folly is but them thats in her  cuffe was a little disconcerted at the answer while lyon smiled ironically the latter then took upon himself the office of crossexamining with an opinion of his own penetration and shrewdness that at least ought to have made him quite equal to encountering one of ithuels readiness in subterfuges  we do not expect you to tell us of your own knowledge witness he said precisely the position by latitude and longitude or by the points of the compass at this identical instant of the craft called by some the le fewfolly by others the fewfollay and as it would now seem by yourself the little folly for that as yeve well obsairved can be known only to those who are actually on board her but yell be remembering perhaps the place it was agreed on between you where ye were to find the lugger at your return from this hazardous expedition that yeve been making amang ye into the bay of naples  i object to that question as contrary to law put in ithuel with a spirit and promptitude that caused the judge advocate to start and the members of the court to look at each other in surprise  nay if ye object to the question on the ground that a true ainswer will be criminating yoursel yell be justified in so doing by reason and propriety but then yell consider well the consequences it may have on your own case when that comes to be investigated  i object on ginral principles said ithuel whatever captain rule may have said on the subject admitting that he said anything just to bear out the argument by the way ithuel called this word argooment a pronunciation against which we enter our solemn protest admitting i say that he said anything on the subject it cannot be testimony as hearsay evidence is agin law all the world over  the members of the court looked at the judge advocate who returned the glance with an air of suitable gravity then on a motion of sir fredericks the court was cleared to discuss the point in private  hows this mr judge advocate demanded cuffe as soon as the coast was clear it is of the last importance to find where that lugger isdo you hold that the question is contrary to law  its importance makes it pertinent i think sir as for the legality i do not see how it can be affected by the circumstance that the fact came up in discourse  dye think so observed sir frederick looking much more profound than was his wont legality is the boast of english law and i should dislike excessively to fail in that great essential what is said must be heard to be repeated and this seems very like hearsay testimony i believe its admitted all round we must reject that  what is your opinion captain lyon demanded the president  the case is somewhat knotty but it may be untied returned the scot with a sneer on his hard features no need of alexander and his sword to cut the rope im thinking when we bring common sense to bear on the point what is the matter to be ascertained why the place which was agreed on as the point of rendezvous between this rawl eevart and his people now this arrangement must have been made orally or in writing if orally testimony to the words uttered will not be hearsay further than testimony to what a man has seen will be eyesight  quite true mr president and gentlemen exclaimed the judge advocate who was not a little relieved at finding a clue to lead him out of the difficulty if the agreement had been made in writing then that writing would have to be produced if possible as the best evidence the case affords but being made in words those words can be sworn to  cuffe was much relieved by this opinion and as sir frederick did not seem disposed to push his dissent very far the matter would have been determined on the spot but for a love of disputation that formed part and parcel to speak legally on a legal subject of lyons moral temperament  im agreeing with the judge advocate as to his distinction about the admissibility of the testimony on the ground of its not being technically what is called hearsay evidence he observed but a difficulty suggests itself to my mind touching the pairtenency a witness is sworn to speak to the point before the court but he is not sworn to discuss all things in heaven and airth now is it pairtenent to the fact of rawl eevarts being a spy that he made sairtain agreements to met this or that fellowcreature in this or that place now as i comprehend the law it divides all questions into two great classes the pairtenent and the impairtenent of which the first are legal and the second illegal  i think it would be a great piece of audacity said sir frederick disdainfully for such a fellow as this bolt to pretend to call any question we can put him impertinent  thats no just the pint sir frederick this being altogether a matter of law while yell be thinking of station and etiquette then theres two classes of the pairtenent and two of the impairtenent one being legal and logical as it might be and the other conventional and civil as one may say theres a nice distinction latent between the two  i believe the court is of opinion that the question may be put observed cuffe who was impatient of the scotchmans subtleties bowing to sir frederick to ask an acquiescence which he immediately received we will reopen the doors and proceed in the examination  the court is of opinion witness resumed the judge advocate when every one was in his place again that you must answer the question in order that you may understand it i will now repeat it where was it agreed between raoul yvard and his people that they should meet again  i do not think the people of the lugger had anything to say in the matter answered ithuel in the most unmoved manner if they had i knew nothing ont  the court felt embarrassed but as it would never do to be thwarted in this manner a look of determination was exchanged between the members and the examination proceeded  if not the people the officers then where was it agreed between the prisoner and his officers that the former should find the lugger when he returned from his expedition into the bay  well now gentlemen answered ithuel turning his quid from one cheek into the other i some conclude youve no great acquaintance with captain rule ater all he is not apt to enter into any agreements at all what he wants done he orders and what he orders must be done  what did he order then as respects the place where the lugger was to wait for his return  i am sorry to be troublesome please the court returned the witness with admirable selfpossession but law is law all over the world and i rather guess this question is agin it in the granite state it is always held when a thing can be proved by the person who said any particular words that the question must be put to him and not to a bystander  not if that person is a prisoner and on his trial answered the judge advocate staring to hear such a distinction from such a source though the remark is a good one in the cases of witnesses purely you must answer therefore  it is unnecessary again interposed raoul i left my vessel here where i have told you and had i made a certain signal the last night from the heights of st agata le feufollet would have stood in near to the rocks of the sirens and taken me off again as the hour is passed and the signal is not likely to be made it is probable my lieutenant has gone to another rendezvous of which the witness knows nothing and which certainly i shall never betray  there was so much manliness and quiet dignity in raouls deportment that whatever he said made an impression his answer disposed of the matter for the moment at least the judge advocate accordingly turned to other inquiries little remained however to be done the prisoner had admitted his identity his capture with all the attendant circumstances was in proof and his defence came next  when raoul rose to speak he felt a choking emotion but it soon left him and he commenced in a steady calm tone his accent giving point and interest to many of his expressions  messieurs said he i will not deny my name my character or my manner of life i am a frenchman and the enemy of your country i am also the enemy of the king of naples in whose territories you found me i have destroyed his and your ships put me on board my lugger and i should do both again whoever is the enemy of la france is the enemy of raoul yvard honorable seamen like yourselves messieurs can understand this i am young my heart is not made of rock evil as it may be it can love beauty and modesty and virtue in the other sex such has been my fatei love ghita caraccioli have endeavored to make her my wife for more than a year she has not authorized me to say that my suit was favoredthis i must acknowledge but she is not the less admirable for that we differ in our opinions of religion and i fear she left monte argentaro because refusing my hand she thought it better perhaps that we should not meet again it is so with maidens as you must know messieurs but it is not usual for us who are less refined to submit to such selfdenial i learned whither ghita had come and followed my heart was a magnet that her beauty drew after it as our needles are drawn toward the pole it was necessary to go into the bay of naples among the vessels of enemies to find her i loved and this is a very different thing from engaging in the pitiful attempts of a spy which of you would not have done the same messieurs you are braves anglais and i know you would not hesitate two of you are still youthful like myself and must still feel the power of beauty even the monsieur that is no longer a young man has had his moments of passion like all that are born of woman messieurs i have no more to say you know the rest if you condemn me let it be as an unfortunate frenchman whose heart had its weaknessesnot as an ignominious and treacherous spy  the earnestness and nature with which raoul spoke were not without effect could sir frederick have had his way the prisoner would have been acquitted on the spot but lyon was skeptical as to the story of love a sentiment about which he knew very little and there was a spirit of opposition in him too that generally induced him to take the converse of most propositions that were started the prisoner was dismissed and the court closed its doors to make up its decision by itself in the usual form  we should do injustice to cuffe if we did not say that he had some feeling in favor of the gallant foe who had so often foiled him could he have had his will at that moment he would have given raoul his lugger allowed the latter a sufficient start and then gladly have commenced a chase round the mediterranean to settle all questions between them but it was too much to give up the lugger as well as the prisoner then his oath as a judge had its obligations also and he felt himself bound to yield to the arguments of the judge advocate who was a man of technicalities and thought no more of sentiment than lyon himself  the result of the deliberation which lasted an hour was a finding against the prisoner the court was opened the record made up and read the offender introduced and the judgment delivered the finding was that raoul yvard had been caught in disguise in the midst of the allied fleets and that he was guilty as a spy the sentence was to suffer death the succeeding day by hanging at the yardarm of such ship as the commanderinchief might select on approving of the sentence  as raoul expected little else he heard his doom with steadiness bowing with dignity and courtesy to the court as he was led away to be placed in irons as befitted one condemned    chapter xix       the worlds all titlepage theres no contents      the worlds all face the man who shows his heart      is hooted for his nudities and scorned       night thoughts  bolt had not been tried his case had several serious difficulties and the orders allowed of a discretion the punishment could scarcely be less than death and in addition to the loss of a stout sinewy man it involved questions of natural right that were not always pleasant to be considered although the impressment of american seamen into the british ships of war was probably one of the most serious moral as well as political wrongs that one independent nation ever received at the hands of another viewed as a practice of a generations continuance it was not wholly without some relieving points there was a portion of the british marine that disdained to practise it at all leaving it to the coarser spirits of the profession to discharge a duty that they themselves found repugnant to their feelings and their habits thus we remember to have heard an american seaman say one who had been present on many occasions when his countrymen were torn from under their flag that in no instance he ever witnessed was the officer who committed the wrong of an air and manner that he should describe as belonging to the class of gentlemen on shore whenever one of the latter boarded his vessel the crew was permitted to pass unquestioned  let this be as it might there is no question that a strong and generous feeling existed in the breasts of hundreds in the british navy concerning the nature of the wrong that was done a foreign people by the practice of impressing men from under their flag although cuffe was too much of a martinet to carry his notions on the subject to a very refined point he was too much of a man not to be reluctant to punish another for doing what he felt he would have done himself under similar circumstances and what he could not but know he would have had a perfect right to do it was impossible to mistake one like ithuel who had so many of the granite peculiarities about him for anything but what he was and so well was his national character established in the ship that the sobriquet of the yankee had been applied to him by his shipmates from the very first the fact therefore stood him so far in hand that cuffe after a consultation with winchester determined not to put the alleged deserter on trial but after letting him remain a short time in irons to turn him to duty again under a pretence that was often used on such occasions viz to give the man an opportunity of proving his american birth if he were really what he so strenuously professed to be poor ithuel was not the only one who was condemned to this equivocal servitude hundreds passing weary years of probation with the same dim ray of hope for ever deferred gleaming in the distance it was determined however not to put ithuel on his trial until the captain had conversed with the admiral on the subject at least and nelson removed from the influence of the siren by whom he was enthralled was a man inclined to leniency and of even chivalrous notions of justice to such contradictions is even a great mind subject when it loses sight of the polar star of its duties  when the sentence on raoul was pronounced therefore and the prisoner was removed the court adjourned a boat being immediately despatched to the foudroyant with a copy of the proceedings for the rearadmirals approbation then followed a discussion on much the most interesting topic for them all the probable position of and the means of capturing the lugger that le feufollet was near all were convinced but where she was to be found it was hard to tell officers had been sent on the heights of capri one of which towers more than a thousand feet above the sea but they returned from a bootless errand nothing resembling the lugger was visible in the offing among the islands or in the bays a cutter had been sent to look round campanella and another crossed the mouth of the bay to take a look to the northward of ischia in order to make certain that the treacherous craft had not gone behind the mountains of that island for a refuge in short no expedient likely to discover the fugitive was neglected all failed however boat after boat came back without success and officer after officer returned wearied and disappointed  much of the day was passed in this manner for it was a calm and moving either of the ships was out of the question in the full expectation of discovering the lugger somewhere in striking distance cuffe had even gone so far as to detail a party from each vessel with a view to attack her in boats again feeling no doubt of success now that he had the disposable force of three vessels to send against his enemy winchester was to have commanded as a right purchased by his blood nor was the hope of succeeding in this way abandoned until the last boat that which had been sent round ischia returned reporting its total want of success  i have heard it said observed cuffe as he and his brother captains stood conversing together on the quarterdeck of the proserpine just after this last report had been madei have heard it said that this raoul yvard has actually gone boldly into several of our ports under english or neutral colors and lain there a day or two at a time unsuspected until it has suited him to go out again can it be possible he is up off the town there is such a fleet of craft in and about the mole that a little lugger with her paint and marks altered might be among them what think you lyon  it is sartainly a law of nature captain cuffe that smaller objects should be overlooked in the presence of greater and such a thing might happen therefore though i should place it among the improbables if not absolutely among the impossibles twould be far safer nevertheless to run in in the manner you designate among the hundred or two of ships than to venture alone into a haven or a roadstead if you wish for retirement sir frederick plunge at once into the strand or take lodgings on ludgate hill but if you wish to be noticed and chased go into a highland village and just conceal your name for a bit ahhe knows the difference well who has tried both modes of life  this is true cuffe observed the baronet yet i hardly think a frenchman big or little would be apt to come and anchor under nelsons nose  twould be something like the lions lying down with the lamb certainly and ought not to be counted on as very likely mr winchester is not that our boat coming round the sloops quarter  yes sirshe has got back from naplesquartermaster  aye quartermaster interrupted cuffe sternly a pretty lookout is this here is our own boat close in upon us and not a word from your lips on the interesting subject sir  this word sir is much used on board a manofwar and in all its convertible significations from the inferior to the superior it comes as natural as if it were a gift from above from equal to equal it has a ceremonious and beonyourguard air that sometimes means respect sometimes disrespect while from a captain to a quartermaster it always means reproof if it do not mean menace in discussions of this sort it is wisest for the weaker party to be silent and nowhere is this truth sooner learned than on shipboard the quartermaster consequently made no answer and the gig came alongside bringing back the officer who had carried the proceedings of the court up to naples  here we have it said cuffe opening the important document as soon has he and his brother captains were again in the cabin approvedordered that the sentence be carried into execution on board his majestys ship the proserpine captain cuffe tomorrow between the hours of sunrise and sunset  then followed the date and the wellknown signature of nelson and bront√© all this was what cuffe both wished and expected though he would have preferred a little more grace in carrying out the orders the reader is not to suppose from this that our captain was either vengeful or bloodyminded or that he really desired to inflict on raoul any penalty for the manner in which he had baffled his own designs and caused his crew to suffer so far from this his intention was to use the sentence to extort from the prisoner a confession of the orders he had given to those left in the lugger and then to use this confession as a means of obtaining his pardon with a transfer to a prisonship cuffe had no great veneration for privateersmen nor was his estimate of their morality at all unreasonable when he inferred that one who served with gain for his principal object would not long hesitate about purchasing his own life by the betrayal of a secret like that he now asked had raoul belonged even to a republican navy the english manofwarsman might have hesitated about carrying out his plan but with the master of a corsair it appeared to be the most natural thing imaginable to attempt its execution both sir frederick and lyon viewed the matter in the same light and now that everything was legally done that was necessary to the design the capture of the lugger was deemed more than half accomplished  it is somewhat afflicting too cuffe observed sir frederick in his drawling indolent way it is somewhat afflicting too cuffe to be compelled to betray ones friends or to be hanged in parliament now we say well be hanged if we do and here you say youll be hanged if you dont  poh poh dashwood no one expects this raoul yvard will come to that fate for no one thinks he will hold out we shall get the lugger and that will be the end of it id give a thousand pounds to see that dd fewfolly at anchor within pistolshot of my stern at this blessed moment my feelings are in the matter  five hundred would be a high price observed lyon dryly i much doubt if the shares of us three come to as much as a hundred apiece even should the craft fall into our hands  by the way gents put in sir frederick gapingsuppose we toss up or throw the dice to see which shall have all on supposition we get her within the next twentyfour hours timing the affair by this ships chronometers youve dice on board i dare say cuffe and we can make a regular time of it here for half an hour and no one the wiser  your pardon captain dashwood i can suffer no such amusement it is unmilitary and contrary to regulations and then hundreds are not as plenty with lyon and myself as they are with you i like to pocket my prizemoney first and sport on it afterward  youre right captain cuffe said lyon though there can be no great innovation in sporting on sir fredericks portion if he see fit to indulge us money is an agreeable acquisition beyond a doubt and life is sweet to saint and sinner alike but i much question your facility in persuading this monshure rawl to tell you his secret consairning the lugger in the manner ye anticipate  this opinion met with no favor and after discussing the point among themselves a little longer the three captains were on the point of separating when griffin burst into the cabin without even knocking and altogether regardless of the usual observances  one would think it blew a typhoon mr griffin said cuffe coldly by the rate at which you run before it  its an ill wind that blows no luck sir answered the lieutenant actually panting for breath so great had been his haste to communicate what he had to say our lookout on the heights above campanella has just signalled us that he sees the lugger to the southward and eastwardsomewhere near the point of piane i suppose sir and what is better the wind is coming off shore earlier than common this evening  that is news exclaimed cuffe rubbing his hands with delight go on deck griffin and tell winchester to unmoor then make a signal to the other ships to do the same now gentlemen we have the game in our own hands and let us see and play it skilfully in a couple of hours it will be dark and our movements can all be made without being seen as the proserpine is perhaps the fastest shipat this remark sir frederick smiled ironically while lyon raised his eyebrows like one who saw a marvelas the proserpine is perhaps the fastest ship she ought to go the furthest to leeward and i will get under way and stand off to sea keeping well to the northward and eastward as if i were running for the straits of bonifacio for instance until it gets to be dark when i will haul up south for a couple of hours or so then come up as high as southeast until we are to the southward of the gulf of salerno this will be before daylight if the wind stand at daylight then you may look out for me off piane say two leagues and to seaward i hope of the lugger you shall follow sir frederick just as the sun sets and keep in my wake as near as possible heaving to however at midnight this will bring you fairly abreast of the gulf and about midway between the two capes a little west of south from campanella lyon you can lie here until the night has fairly set in when you can pass between capri and the cape and run down south two hours and heave to this will place you in a position to watch the passage to and from the gulf under the northern shore  and this arrangement completed to your satisfaction captain cuffe asked lyon deliberately helping himself to an enormous pinch of snuff what will be your pleasure in the posterior evolutions  each ship must keep her station until the day has fairly dawned should it turn out as i trust it may that weve got le fewfolly inshore of us all well have to do will be to close in upon her and drive her up higher and higher into the bay she will naturally run into shallow water when we must anchor off man the boats send them north and south of her and let them board her under cover of our fire if we find the lugger embayed well have her as sure as fate  very prettily conceived captain cuffe and in a way to be handsomely executed but if we should happen to find the heathen outside of us  then make sail in chase to seaward each ship acting for the best come gentlemen i do not wish to be inhospitable but the proserpine must be off she has a long road before her and the winds of this season of the year can barely be counted on for an hour at a time  cuffe being in such a hurry his guests departed without further ceremony as for sir frederick the first thing he did was to order dinner an hour earlier than he had intended and then to invite his surgeon and marineofficer two capital pairs of knives and forks to come and share it with him after which he sat down to play somewhat villanously on a flute two hours later he gave the necessary orders to his first lieutenant after which he troubled himself very little about the frigate he commanded lyon on the other hand sat down to a very frugal meal alone as soon as he found himself again in his sloop first ordering certain old sails to be got on deck and to be mended for the eighth or ninth time  with the proserpine it was different her capstanbars flew round and one anchor was actually catted by the time her captain appeared on deck the other soon followed the three topsails fell were sheeted home and hoisted and sail was set after sail until the ship went steadily past the low promontory of ana capri a cloud of canvas her head was to the westward inclining a little north and had there been any one to the southward to watch her movements as there was not so far as the eye could see it would have been supposed that she was standing over toward the coast of sardinia most probably with an intention of passing by the straits of bonifacio between that island and corsica the wind being nearly east and it blowing a good breeze the progress of the ship was such as promised to fulfil all the expectations of her commander  as the sun set and darkness diffused itself over the mediterranean the lighter steeringsails were taken in and the proserpine brought the wind abeam standing south one of the last things visible from the decks besides the mountains of the islands and of the main the curling smoke of vesuvius the blue void above and the bluer sea below was the speck of the terpsichore as that ship followed as near as might be in her wake sir frederick and his friends still at table but with a vigilant and industrious first lieutenant on deck who was sufficient in himself for all that was required of the vessel in any emergency the latter had his orders and he executed them with a precision and attention that promised to leave nothing to be wished for on the other hand the people of the ringdove were kept at work mending old sails until the hour to knock off work arrived then the ship unmoored at the proper time the remaining anchor was lifted and the sloop went through the pass between capri and campanella as directed when lyon sent for the first lieutenant to join him in his cabin  look you here mcbean said lyon pointing to the chart which lay on the table captain cuffe has just run down off piane and will find himself well to leeward when the west wind comes tomorrow sir frederick has followed famously clear of the land and wont be in a much better box now this lugger must be pretty picking if all they say of her be true ten to one but she has gold in her these corsairs are desperate rogues after the siller and taking hull sails armament headmoney and the scrapings of the lockers together i shouldnt marvel if she come to something as good as ¬£8000 or ¬£10000 this would be fair dividing for a sloop but would amount to a painfully small trifle as between the officers of three ships after deducting the admirals share what are you thinking of airchy  of just that captain lyon it would be dividing every lieutenants share by three as well as every captains  thats it airchy and so yell have a shairp lookout on deck therell be no occasion to run down quite as far as captain cuffe suggested yell obsairve for if in the bay the lugger will work her way up toward this headland and well be all the more likely to fall in with her by keeping near it ourselves yell take the idea  its plain enou captain lyon and ill be obsairving it how is the law understood as respects dairkness i understand that none share but such as are in sight but is dairkness deemed a legal impediment  to be sure it is the idea being that all who can see may act now if we catch the lugger before captain cuffe and sir frederick even know where she is on what principle can they aid and sustain us in the capture  and you wish a shairp lookout the night captain lyon  thats just it airchy yell all be doing your best in the way of eyes and we may get the lugger alone twould be such a pity mr mcbean to divide by three when the sums might be kept entire  such was the state of feeling with which each of these three officers entered on his present duty cuffe was earnest in the wish to catch his enemy and this principally for the credit of the thing though a little out of a desire to revenge his own losses sir frederick dashwood indifferent to all but his own pleasures and lyon closely attentive to the main chance an hour or two later or just before cuffe turned in he sent a message to request the presence of his first lieutenant if the latter were still up winchester was writing up his private journal closing the book he obeyed the order in that quiet submissive manner which a first lieutenant is more apt to use toward his captain than toward any one else  good evening winchester said cuffe in a familiar friendly way which satisfied the subordinate that he was not sent for to be rattled down draw a chair and try a glass of this capri wine with some water its not carrying sail hard to drink a gallon of it yet i rather think it fills up the chinks better than nothing  thankee captain cuffe we like it in the gunroom and got off a fresh cask or two this morning while the court was sitting so they tell me sir his lordship has put his name to it and that this frenchman is to swing from our foreyardarm some time tomorrow  it stands so on paper winchester but if he confess where his lugger lies all will go smoothly enough with him however as things look now well have her and thanks only to ourselves  well sir that will be best on the whole i do not like to see a man selling his own people  there you are right enough winchester and i trust we shall get along without it though the lugger must be ours i sent for you by the way about this boltsomething must be done with that fellow  its a clear case of desertion captain cuffe and as it would now seem of treason in the bargain i would rather hang ten such chaps than one man like the frenchman  well its clear mr winchester you do not bear malice have you forgotten porto ferrajo and the boats already or do you love them that despitefully use you  twas all fair service sir and one never thinks anything of that i owe this monsieur yvard no grudge for what he did but now its all fairly over i rather like him the better for it but its a very different matter as to this bolt a skulking scoundrel who would let other men fight his countrys battles while he goes aprivateering against british commerce  aye theres the rub winchester are they his countrys battles  why we took him for an englishman sir and we must act up to our own professions in order to be consistent  and so hang an innocent man for a treason that he could not commit  why captain cuffe do you believe the fellows whining story about his being a yankee if that be true we have done him so much injustice already as to make his case a very hard one for my part i look upon all these fellows as only so many disaffected englishmen and treat them accordingly  that is a sure way to quiet ones feelings winchester but its most too serious when it comes to hanging if bolt deserve any punishment he deserves death and that is a matter about which one ought to be tolerably certain before he pushes things too far ive sometimes had my doubts about three or four of our peoples being englishmen after all  there can be no certainty in these matters unless one could carry a parish register for the whole kingdom in his ship captain cuffe if they are not englishmen why do they not produce satisfactory proofs to show it that is but reasonable you must allow sir  i dont know winchester there are two sides to that question too suppose the king of naples should seize you here ashore and call on you to prove that you are not one of his subjects how would you go to work to make it outno parish register being at hand  well then captain cuffe if we are so very wrong we had better give all these men up at oncethough one of them is the very best hand in the ship i think it right to tell you that sir  there is a wide difference sir between giving a man up and hanging him we are shorthanded as it is and cannot spare a single man ive been looking over your station bills and they never appeared so feeble before we want eighteen or nineteen good seamen to make them respectable again and though this bolt is no great matter as a seaman he can turn his hand to so many things that he was as useful as the boatswain in a word we cannot spare himeither to let him go or to hang him even were the latter just  im sure sir i desire to do nothing that is unjust or inconvenient and so act your pleasure in the affair  my pleasure is just this then winchester we must turn bolt to duty if the fellow is really an american it would be a wretched business even to flog him for desertion and as to treason you know there can be none without allegiance nelson gives me a discretion and so well act on the safe side and just turn him over to duty again when there comes an opportunity ill inquire into the facts of his case and if he can make out that he is not an englishman why he must be discharged the ship will be going home in a year or two when everything can be settled fairly and deliberately i dare say bolt will not object to the terms  perhaps not sir then theres the crew captain cuffe they may think it strange treason and desertion go unpunished these fellows talk and reason more than is always known aft  ive thought of all that winchester i dare say you have heard of such a thing as a kings evidence well here has raoul yvard been tried and found guilty as a spy bolt having been a witness a few remarks judiciously made may throw everything off on that tack and appearances will be preserved so far as discipline is concerned  yes sir that might be done its true but an uneasy berth will the poor devil have of it if the people fancy he has been a kings evidence men of that class hate a traitor worse than they do crime captain cuffe and theyll ride bolt down like the main tack  perhaps not and if they do twill not be as bad as hanging the fellow must think himself luckily out of a bad scrape and thank god for all his mercies you can see that he suffers nothing unreasonable or greatly out of the way so send an order to the masteratarms to knock the irons off the chap and send him to duty before you turn in winchester  this settled the matter as to ithuel for the moment at least cuffe was one of those men who was indisposed to push things too far while he found it difficult to do his whole duty there was not an officer in the proserpine who had any serious doubts about the true country of bolt though there was not one officer among them all who would openly avow it there was too much granite about ithuel to permit englishmen long to be deceived and that very language on which the impressed man so much prided himself would have betrayed his origin had other evidence been wanting still there was a tenacity about an english ship of war in that day that did not easily permit an athletic hand to escape its grasp when it had once closed upon him in a great and enterprising service like that of great britain an esprit de corps existed in the respective ships which made them the rivals of each other and men being the great essentials of efficiency a single seaman was relinquished with a reluctance that must have been witnessed fully to be understood cuffe consequently could not make up his mind to do full justice to ithuel while he could not make up his mind to push injustice so far as trial and punishment nelson had left him a discretion as has been said and this he chose to use in the manner just mentioned  had the case of the new hampshire man been fairly brought before the british admiral his discharge would have been ordered without hesitation nelson was too far removed from the competition of the separate ships and ordinarily under the control of too high motives to be accessory to the injustice of forcibly detaining a foreigner in his countrys service for it was only while under the malign influence to which there has already been allusion that he ceased to be highminded and just prejudiced he was and in some cases exceedingly so america standing but little better in his eyes than france herself for the first of these antipathies he had some apology since in addition to the aversion that was naturally produced by the history of the cisatlantic republic accident had thrown him in the way in the west indies of ascertaining the frauds deceptions and cupidities of a class of men that never exhibit national character in its brightest and most alluring colors still he was too upright of mind willingly to countenance injustice and too chivalrous to oppress but ithuel had fallen into the hands of one who fell far short of the high qualities of the admiral while at the same time he kept clear of his more prominent weaknesses and who was brought within the sphere of the competition between the respective ships and their crews  winchester of course obeyed his orders he roused the masteratarms from his hammock and directed him to bring ithuel bolt to the quarterdeck  in consequence of what took place this morning said the first lieutenant in a voice loud enough to be heard by all near him captain cuffe has seen fit to order you to be released bolt and turned to duty again you will know how to appreciate this leniency and will serve with greater zeal than ever i make no doubt never forget that you have been with a yardrope as it might be round your neck in the morning you will be stationed and berthed anew  ithuel was too shrewd to answer he fully understood the reason why he escaped punishment and it increased his hopes of eventually escaping from the service itself still he gagged a little at the idea of passing for one who peachedor for a statesevidence as he called it that character involving more of sin in vulgar eyes than the commission of a thousand legal crimes this gave winchester no concern after dismissing his man he gossiped a minute or two with yelverton who had the watch gaped once or twice somewhat provokingly and going below was in a deep sleep in ten minutes    chapter xx       white as a white sail on a dusky sea      when half the horizons clouded and half free      fluttering between the dim wave and the sky      is hopes last gleam in mans extremity       the island  the dawning of day on the morning which succeeded was a moment of great interest on board the different english ships which then lay off the gulf of salerno cuffe and lyon were called according to especial orders left by themselves while even sir frederick dashwood allowed himself to be awakened to hear the report of the officer of the watch the first was up quite half an hour before the light appeared he even went into the maintop again in order to get as early and as wide a survey of the horizon as he wished griffin went aloft with him and together they stood leaning against the topmast rigging watching the slow approach of those rays which gradually diffused themselves over the whole of a panorama that was as bewitching as the hour and the lovely accessories of an italian landscape could render it  i see nothing inshore exclaimed cuffe in a tone of disappointment when the light permitted a tolerable view of the coast if she should be outside of us our work will be only half done  there is a white speck close in with the land sir returned griffin here in the direction of those ruins of which our gentlemen that have been round in the boats to look at tell such marvels i believe however it is only a felucca or a sparanara there is a peak to the sail that does not look luggerfashion  what is this off here at the northwest griffinis it too large for the le fewfolly  that must be the terpsichore sir its just where she ought to be as i understand the orders and i suppose sir frederick has carried her there but yonders a sail in the northern board which may turn out to be the lugger she is fairly within campanella and is not far from the north shore of the bay  by georgethat must be she monsieur yvard has kept her skulking round and about amalfi all this time let us go down and set everything that will draw at once sir  in two minutes griffin was on deck hauling the yards and clearing away to make sail as usual the wind was light at the southward again and the course would be nearly before it studdingsail booms were to be run out the sails set and the ships head laid to the northward keeping a little to seaward of the chase at this moment the proserpine had the point of piane and the little village of abate nearly abeam the ship might have been going four knots through the water and the distance across the mouth of the bay was something like thirty miles of course eight hours would be necessary to carry the frigate over the intervening space should the wind stand as it probably would not at that season of the year a week later and strong southerly winds might be expected but that week was as interminable as an age for any present purpose  halfanhours trial satisfied all on the deck of the proserpine that the chase was keeping off like themselves and that she was standing toward the mountains of amalfi her progress too was about equal to that of the frigate for dead before the wind the latter ship was merely a good sailer her great superiority commencing only when she brought the breeze forward of the beam it has been supposed that the stranger when first seen was about fifteen miles distant his canvas appearing both small and shapeless but some doubts now began to be entertained equally as to his rig his size and his distance if a large or a lofty vessel of course he must be materially further off and if a large or lofty vessel it could not be le feufollet  the other frigate took her cue from the proserpine and stood across for the northern side of the gulf a certain proof that nothing was visible from her mastheads to lead her in any other direction two hours however satisfied all on board the latter ship that they were on a wrong scent and that the vessel to leeward was their own consort the sloop lyon having in his eagerness to get the prize before she could be seen from the other ships carried the ringdove quite within the bay and thus misled cuffe and sir frederick  there can no longer be any doubt exclaimed the captain of the proserpine dropping his glass with vexation too strongly painted in his manner to be mistaken that is a ship and as you say winchester it must be the ringdove though what the devil lyon is doing away in there with her unless he sees something close under the land is more than i can tell as there is clearly nothing in this quarter we will stand on and take a look for ourselves  this nearly destroyed the hope of success the officers began to suspect that their lookout on campanella had been deceived and that what he had supposed to be a lugger was in truth a felucca or perhaps a xebeca craft which might well be mistaken for a lugger at the distance of a few leagues the error however was with those in the ship the officer sent upon the heights was a shrewd practised mastersmate who knew everything about his profession that properly came within his line and knew little else but for a habit of drinking he would long since have been a lieutenant being in truth an older sailor than westchester but satisfied of his own infirmity and coming from a class in life in which preferment was viewed as a godsend rather than as a right he had long settled down into the belief that he was to live and die in his present station thereby losing most of the desire to rise the name of this man was clinch in consequence of his long experience within the circle of his duties his opinion was greatly respected by his superiors when he was sober and as he had the precaution not to be otherwise when engaged on service his weakness seldom brought him into any serious difficulties cuffe as a last hope had sent him up on the heights of campanella with a perfect conviction that if anything were really in sight he would not fail to see it all this confidence however had now ended in disappointment and halfanhour later when it was announced to cuffe that the cutter with mr clinch was coming down the bay toward them the former even heard the name of his drunken favorite with disgust as was usual with him when out of humor he went below as the boat drew near leaving orders for her officer to be sent down to him the instant the latter got on board five minutes later clinch thrust his hardlooking weatherbeaten but handsome red countenance in at the cabindoor  well sir commenced the captain on a tolerably high key a dd pretty wildgoose chase youve sent us all on down here into this bay the southerly wind is failing already and in half an hour the ships will be frying the pitch off their decks without a breath of air when the wind does come it will come out at west and bring us all four or five leagues dead to leeward  clinchs experience had taught him the useful manofwar lesson to bow to the tempest and not to attempt to brave it whenever he was rattleddown as he called it he had the habit of throwing an expression of surprise comically blended with contrition into his countenance that seemed to say what have i done nowor if i have done anything amiss you see how sorry i an for it he met his irritated commander on the present occasion with this expression and it produced the usual effect of mollifying him a little  well sirexplain this matter if you please continued cuffe after a moments hesitation  will you please to tell me sir what you wish explained inquired clinch throwing more surprise than common even into his countenance  that is an extraordinary question mr clinch i wish the signal you made from yonder headland explained sir did you not signal the ship to say that you saw the le fewfolly down here at the southward  well sir im glad there was no mistake in the matter answered clinch in a confident and a relieved manner i was afraid at first captain cuffe my signal had not been understood  understood how could it be mistaken you showed a black ball for the luggers in sight youll not deny that i trust  no sir one black ball for the luggers in sight thats just what i did show captain cuffe  and three black balls together for she bears due south from capri what do you say to that  all right sir three black balls together for she bears due south from capri i didnt tell the distance captain cuffe because mr winchester gave me no signals for that  and these signals you kept showing every halfhour as long as it was light even until the proserpine was off  all according to orders captain cuffe as mr winchester will tell you i was to repeat every halfhour as long as the lugger was in sight and the day lasted  aye sir but you were not ordered to send as after a jackolantern or to mistake some xebec or other from one of the greek islands for a light handy french lugger  nor did i captain cuffe begging your pardon sir i signalled the fewfolly and nothing else i give you my word for it  cuffe looked hard at the mastersmate for a half a minute and his ire insensibly lessened as he gazed  you are too old a seaman clinch not to know what you were about if you saw the privateer be good enough to tell us what has become of her  that is more than i can say captain cuffe though see her i did and that so plainly as to be able to make out her jigger even you know sir we shot away her jiggermast in the chase off elba and she got a new one that steves forrard uncommonly i noticed that when we fell in with her in the canal of piombino and seeing it again could not but know it but theres no mistaking the saucy folly for them that has once seen her and i am certain we made her out about four leagues to the southward of the cape at the time i first signalled  four leaguesi had though she must be at least eight or ten and kept off that distance to get her in the net why did you not let us know her distance  had no signals for that captain cuffe  well then why not send a boat to tell us the fact  had no orders sir was told by mr winchester just to signal the lugger and her bearings and this you must own captain cuffe we did plain enough besides sir  well besides what demanded the captain observing that the mastersmate hesitated  why sir how was i to know that any one in the ship would think a lugger could be seen eight or ten leagues thats a long bit of water sir and it would take a heavy ships spars to rise high enough for such a sight  the land you were on clinch was much loftier than any vessels spars  quite true sir but not lofty enough for that captain cuffe that i saw the folly im as certain as i as being in this cabin  what has become of her then you perceive she is not in the bay now  i suppose captain cuffe that she stood in until near enough for her purpose and that she must have hauled off the land after the night set in there was plenty of room for her to pass out to sea again between the two frigates and not be seen in the dark  this conjecture was so plausible as to satisfy cuffe yet it was not the fact clinch had made le feufollet from his elevated post to the southward as his signal had said and he was right in all his statements about her until darkness concealed her movements instead of passing out of the bay as he imagined however she had hauled up within a quarter of a league of campanella doubled that point brushed along the coast to the northward of it fairly within the bay of naples and pushed out to sea between capri and ischia going directly athwart the anchorage the menofwar had so recently quitted in order to do so  when raoul quitted his vessel he order her to stand directly off the land just keeping ischia and capri in view lyingto under her jigger as this was low sail and a lugger shows so little aloft it was a common expedient of cruisers of that rig when they wished to escape observation monsieur pintard raouls first lieutenant had expected a signal from his commander at the very spot where clinch had taken his station but seeing none he had swept along the coast after dark in the hope of discovering his position by the burning of a blue light failing of this however he went off the land again in time to get an offing before the return of day and to save the wind it was the boldness of the manoeuvre that saved the lugger lyon going out through the pass between capri and campanella about twenty minutes before pintard brushed close round the rocks under his jigger and jib only anxiously looking out for a signal from his captain the frenchmen saw the sloopofwar quite plainly and by the aid of their nightglasses ascertained her character mistaking her however for another ship bound to sicily or maltawhile their own vessel escaped observation owing to the little sail she carried the want of hamper and her situation so near the land which gave her a background of rocks clinch had not seen the movements of the lugger after dark in consequence of his retiring to the village of st agata to seek lodgings as soon as he perceived that his own ship had gone to sea and left him and his boats crew behind the following morning when he made the ship to the southward he pushed off and pulled toward his proper vessel as related  where did you pass the night clinch demanded the captain after they had discussed the probability of the luggers escape not on the heights under the canopy of heaven  on the heights and under the great canopy that has covered us both so often captain cuffe but with a good neapolitan mudroof between it and my head as soon as it was dark and i saw that the ship was off i found a village named st agata that stands on the heights just abeam of those rocks they call the sirens and there we were well berthed until morning  you are lucky in bringing back all the boats crew clinch you know its low water with us as to men just now and our fellows are not all to be trusted ashore in a country that is full of stone walls good wine and pretty girls  i always take a set of regular steady ones with me captain cuffe i havent lost a man from a boat these five years  you must have some secret then worth knowing for even the admirals sometimes lose their bargemen i dare say now yours are all married chaps that hold on to their wives as so many sheetanchors they say that is often a good expedient  not at all sir i did try that till i found that half the fellows would run to get rid of their wives the portsmouth and plymouth marriages dont always bring large estates with them sir and the bridegrooms like to cut adrift at the end of the honeymoon dont you remember when we were in the blenheim together sir we lost eleven of the launchs crew at one time and nine of them turned out to be vagabonds sir that deserted their weeping wives and suffering families at home  now you mention it i do remember something of the sort draw a chair clinch and take a glass of grog tim put a bottle of jamaica before mr clinch i have heard it said that you are married yourself my gallant masters mate  lord captain cuffe thats one of the young gentlemens stories if a body believed all they say the christian religion would soon get athwarthawse and mankind be all adrift in their morals answered clinch smacking his lips after a very grateful draught weve a regular set of highflyers aboard this ship at this blessed minute captain cuffe sir and mr winchester has his hands full of them i often wonder at his patience sir  we were young once ourselves clinch and ought to be indulgent to the follies of youth but what sort of a berth did you find last night upon the rocks yonder  why sir as good as one can expect out of old england i fell in with an elderly woman calling herself giuntotardiwhich is regular built italian isnt it sir  that it isbut you speak the language i believe clinch  why sir ive been drifting about the world so long that i speak a little of everything finding it convenient when i stand in need of victuals and drink the old lady on the hill and i overhauled a famous yarn between us sir it seems she has a niece and a brother at naples who ought to have been back night before last and she was in lots of tribulation about them wanting to know if our ship had seen anything of the rovers  by george clinch you were on the soundings there had you but known it our prisoner has been in that part of the world and we might get some clue to his manoeuvres by questioning the old woman closely i hope you parted good friends  the best in the world captain cuffe no one that feeds and lodges me well need dread me as an enemy  ill warrant it thats the reason you are so loyal clinch  the hard red face of the masters mate worked a little and though he could not well look all sorts of colors he looked all ways but in his captains eye it was now ten years since he ought to have been a lieutenant having once actually outranked cuffe in the way of date of service at least and his conscience told him two things quite distinctly first the fact of his long and weary probation second that it was in a great degree his own fault  i love his majesty sir clinch observed after giving a gulp and i never lay anything that goes hard with myself to his account still memory will be memory and spite of all i can do sir i sometimes remember what i might have been as well as what i am if his majesty does feed me it is with the spoon of a masters mate and if he does lodge me it is in the cockpit  i have been your shipmate often and for years at a time answered cuffe goodnaturedly though a little in the manner of a superior and no one knows your history better it is not your friends who have failed you at need so much as a certain enemy with whom you will insist on associating though he harms them most who love him best  aye aye sirthat cant be denied captain cuffe yet its a hard life that passes altogether without hope  this was uttered with an expression of melancholy that said more for clinchs character than cuffe had witnessed in the man for years and it revived many early impressions in his favor clinch and he had once been messmates even and though years of a decided disparity in rank had since interposed their barrier of etiquette and feeling cuffe never could entirely forget the circumstance  it is hard indeed to live as you say without hope returned the captain but hope ought to be the last thing to die you should make one more rally clinch before you throw up in despair  it is not so much for myself captain cuffe that i mind it as for some that live ashore my father was as reputable a tradesman as there was in plymouth and when he got me on the quarterdeck he thought he was about to make a gentleman of me instead of leaving me to pass a life in a situation that may be said to be even beneath what his own was  now you undervalue your station clinch the berth of a mastersmate in one of his majestys finest frigates is something to be proud of i was once a mastersmatenay nelson has doubtless filled the same station for that matter one of his majestys own sons may have gone through the rank  aye gone through it as you say sir returned clinch with a husky voice it does well enough for them that go through it but its death to them that stick its a feather in a midshipmans cap to be rated a mate but its no honor to be a mate at my time of life captain cuffe  whats your age clinch you are not much my senior  your senior sir the difference in our years is not as great as in our rank certainly though i never shall see thirtytwo again but its not so much that after all as the thoughts of my poor mother who set her heart on seeing me with his majestys commission in my pocket and of another who set her heart on one that im afraid was never worthy her affection  this is new to me clinch returned the captain with interest one so seldom thinks of a mastersmate marrying that the idea of your being in that way has never crossed my mind except in the manner of a joke  mastersmates have married captain cuffe and they have ended in being very miserable but jane as well as myself has made up her mind to live single unless we can see brighter prospects before us than what my present hopes afford  is it quite right jack to keep a poor young woman towing along in this uncertainty during the period of life when her chances for making a good connection are the best  clinch stared at his commander until his eyes filled with tears the glass had not touched his lips since the conversation took its present direction and the usual hard settled character of his face was becoming expressive once more with human emotions  its not my fault captain cuffe he answered in a low voice its now quite six years since i insisted on her giving me up but she wouldnt hear of the thing a very respectable attorney wished to have her and i even prayed her to accept his offer and the only unkind glance i ever got from her eye was when she heard me make a request that she told me sounded impiously almost to her ears she would be a sailors wife or die a maid  the girl has unfortunately got some romantic notions concerning the profession clinch and they are ever the hardest to be convinced of what is for their own good  jane weston not she sir there is not as much romance about her as in the flyleaves of a prayerbook she is all heart poor jane and how i came to get such a hold of it captain cuffe is a great mystery to myself i certainly do not deserve half her affection and i now begin to despair of ever being able to repay her for it  clinch was still a handsome man though exposure and his habits had made some inroads on a countenance that by nature was frank open and prepossessing it now expressed the anguish that occasionally came over his heart as the helplessness of his situation presented itself fully to his mind cuffes feelings were touched for he remembered the time when they were messmates with a future before them that promised no more to the one than to the other the difference in the chances which birth afforded the captain alone excepted clinch was a prime seaman and as brave as a lion too qualities that secured to him a degree of respect that his occasional selfforgetfulness had never entirely forfeited some persons thought him the most skilful mariner the proserpine contained and perhaps this was true if the professional skill were confined strictly to the handling of a ship or to taking care of her on critical occasions all these circumstances induced cuffe to enter more closely into the mastersmates present distress than he might otherwise have done instead of shoving the bottle to him however as if conscious how much disappointed hope had already driven the other to its indiscreet use he pushed it gently aside and taking his old messmates hand with a momentary forgetfulness of the difference in rank he said in a tone of kindness and confidence that had long been strangers to clinchs ears  jack my honest fellow there is good stuff in you yet if you will only give it fair play make a manly rally respect yourself for a few months and something will turn up that will yet give you your jane and gladden your old mothers heart  there are periods in the lives of men when a few kind words backed by a friendly act or two might save thousands of human beings from destruction such was the crisis in the fate of clinch he had almost given up hope though it did occasionally revive in him whenever he got a cheering letter from the constant jane who pertinaciously refused to believe anything to his prejudice and religiously abstained from all reproaches but it is necessary to understand the influence of rank on board a manofwar fully to comprehend the effect which was now produced on the mastersmate by the captains language and manner tears streamed out of the eyes of clinch and he grasped the hand of his commander almost convulsively  what can i do sir captain cuffe what can i do he exclaimed my duty is never neglected but there are moments of despair when i find the burden too hard to be borne without calling upon the bottle for support  whenever a man drinks with such a motive clinch i would advise him to abstain altogether he cannot trust himself and that which he terms his friend is in truth his direst enemy refuse your rations even determine to be free one week nay one day may give a strength that will enable you to conquer by leaving your reason unimpaired absence from the ship has accidentally befriended youfor the little you have taken here has not been sufficient to do any harm we are now engaged on a most interesting duty and i will throw service into your way that may be of importance to you get your name once fairly in a despatch and your commission is safe nelson loves to prefer old tars and nothing would make him happier than to be able to serve you put it in my power to ask it of him and ill answer for the result something may yet come out of your visit to the cottage of this woman and do you be mindful to keep yourself in fortunes way  god bless you captain cuffegod bless you sir answered clinch nearly choked ill endeavor to do as you wish  remember jane and your mother with such a woman dependent for her happiness on his existence a man must be a brute not to struggle hard  clinch groanedfor cuffe probed his wound deep though it was done with an honest desire to cure after wiping the perspiration from his face and writhing on his chair however he recovered a little of his selfcommand and became comparatively composed  if a friend could only point out the way by which i might recover some of the lost ground he said my gratitude to him would last as long as life captain cuffe  here is an opening then clinch nelson attaches as much importance to our catching this lugger as he ever did to falling in with a fleet the officer who is serviceable on this occasion may be sure of being remembered and i will give you every chance in my power go dress yourself in your best make yourself look as you know you can then be ready for boat service i have some duty for you now which will be but the beginning of good luck if you only remain true to your mother to jane and to yourself  a new life was infused into clinch for years he had been overlookedapparently forgotten except when thorough seamanship was required and even his experiment of getting transferred to a vessel commanded by an old messmate had seemingly failed here was a change however and a ray brighter than common shone athwart the darkness of his future even cuffe was struck with the cheerfulness of his countenance and the alacrity of the mastersmates movements and he reproached himself with having so long been indifferent to the best interests of one who certainly had some claims on his friendship still there was nothing unusual in the present relations between these old messmates favored by family and friends cuffe had never been permitted to fall into despondency and had pursued his career successfully and with spirit while the other unsupported and failing of any immediate opportunity for getting ahead had fallen into evil ways and come to be by slow degrees the man he was such instances as the latter are of not unfrequent occurrence even in a marine in which promotion is as regular as our own though it is rare indeed that a man recovers his lost ground when placed in circumstances so trying  in half an hour clinch was ready dressed in his best the gentlemen of the quarterdeck saw all these preparations with surprise for of late the mastersmate had seldom been seen in that part of the ship at all but in a manofwar discipline is a matter of faith and no one presumed to ask questions clinch was closeted with the captain for a few minutes received his orders and went over the ships side with a cheerful countenance actually entering the captains gig the fastestrowing boat of the ship as soon as seated he shoved off and held his way toward the point of campanella then distant about three leagues no one knew whither he was bound though all believed it was on duty that related to the lugger and duty that required a seamans judgment as for cuffe his manner whichhad begun to be uneasy and wandering became more composed when he saw his old messmate fairly off and that too at a rate which would carry him even to naples in the course of a few hours should his voyage happen to be so long    chapter xxi                       his honors linked      unto his life he that will seek the one      must venture for the other or lose both       tatham  it was now certain that le feufollet was not in the bay of salerno by means of the lofty spars of the ship and the aid of glasses the whole coast had been effectually surveyed and no signs of such a craft were visible even lyon had given it up had wore round and was standing along the land again toward campanella a disappointed man as cuffe expected the next wind from the westward he continued on to the northward however intending to go off amalfi and question any fisherman he might fall in with leaving the ship slowly pursuing her course in that direction then we will turn our attention to the state of the prisoners  ghita and her uncle had been properly cared for all this time the gunners wife lived on board and being a respectable woman cuffe had the delicacy to send the poor girl forward to the stateroom and mess of this woman her uncle was provided for near by and as neither was considered in any degree criminal it was the intention to put them ashore as soon as it was certain that no information concerning the lugger was to be obtained from them ithuel was at duty again having passed half the morning in the foretop the shoreboat which was in the way on deck was now struck into the water and was towing astern in waiting for the moment when carlo giuntotardi and his niece were to be put in possession of it again and permitted to depart this moment was delayed however until the ship should again double campanella and be once more in the bay of naples as it would have been cruel to send two such persons as the uncle and niece adrift at any material distance from their proper place of landing  it was very different with raoul yvard however he was under the charge of a sentry on the berthdeck in waiting for the fearful moment when he should be brought forth for execution his sentence was generally known in the ship and with a few he was an object of interest though punishment deaths in battle and all the other casualties of nautical life were much too familiar in such a war to awaken anything like a sensation in an active cruising frigate still some had a thought for the prisoners situation winchester was a humane man and to his credit he bore no malice for his own defeat and sufferings while in his capacity of first lieutenant it was in his power to do much toward adding to the comfort of the condemned he had placed the prisoner between two open ports where the air circulated freely no trifling consideration in so warm a climate and had ordered a canvas bulkhead to be placed around him giving raoul the benefit of a stateroom for his meditations at so awful a moment his irons too had been removed as useless though care had been had to take away from the prisoner everything by which he might attempt his own life the probability of his jumping through a port had been discussed between the first and second lieutenants but the sentry was admonished to be on his guard against any such attempt and little apprehension was felt raoul being so composed and so unlikely to do anything precipitately then it would be easy to pick him up while the vessel moved so slowly to own the truth too many would prefer his drowning himself to seeing him swinging at a yardarm  in this narrow prison then raoul passed the night and morning it would be representing him as more stoical than the truth if we said he was unmoved so far from this his moments were bitter and his anguish would have been extreme were it not for a high resolution which prompted him to die as he fancied it like un fran√ßais the numerous executions by the guillotine had brought fortitude under such circumstances into a sort of fashion and there were few who did not meet death with decorum with our prisoner however it was still different for sustained by a dauntless spirit he would have faced the great tyrant of the race even in his most ruthless mood with firmness if not with disdain but to a young man and a lover the last great change could not well approach without bringing with it a feeling of hopelessness that in the case of raoul was unrelieved by any cheering expectations of the future he fully believed his doom to be sealed and that less on account of his imaginary offence as a spy than on account of the known and extensive injuries he had done to the english commerce raoul was a good hater and according to the fashion of past times which we apprehend in spite of a vast deal of equivocal philanthropy that now circulates freely from mouth to mouth and from pen to pen will continue to be the fashion of times to come he heartily disliked the people with whom he was at war and consequently was ready to believe anything to their prejudice that political rivalry might invent a frame of mind that led him to think his life would be viewed as a trifle when put in the scales against english ascendency or english profit he was accustomed to think of the people of great britain as a nation of shopkeepers and while engaged himself in a calling that bears the brand of rapacity on its very brow he looked upon his own pursuit as comparatively martial and honorable qualities in sooth it was far from being without as he himself had exercised its functions in a word raoul understood cuffe as little as cuffe understood him facts that will sufficiently appear in the interview which it has now become our office to relate  the prisoner received one or two friendly visits in the course of the morning griffin in particular conceiving it to be his duty to try to cheer the condemned man on account of his own knowledge of foreign tongues on these occasions the conversation was prevented from falling into anything like the sombre by the firmness of the prisoners manner with a view to do the thing handsomely winchester had caused the canvas bulkhead to include the guns on each side which of course gave more air and light within the narrow apartment as it brought both ports into the little room raoul adverted to this circumstance as seated on one stool he invited griffin in the last of his visits to take another  you find me here supported by a piece of eighteen on each side observed the prisoner smiling as becomes a seaman who is about to die were my death to come from the mouths of your cannon monsieur lieutenant it would only meet me a few months or perhaps a few days sooner than it might happen by the same mode in the ordinary course of events  we know how to feel for a brave man in your situation answered griffin with emotion and nothing would make us all happier than to have it as you say you in a good warm frigate on our broadside and we in this of our own contending fairly for the honor of our respective countries  monsieur the fortune of war has ordered it otherwisebut you are not seated monsieur lieutenant  mon pardoncaptain cuffe has sent me to request you will favor him with your company in his cabin as soon as it may be agreeable to yourself monsieur yvard  there is something in the polished expressions of the french language that would have rendered it difficult for griffin to have been other than delicate in his communications with the prisoner had he been so disposed but such was not his inclination for now that their gallant adversary was at their mercy all the brave men in the proserpine felt a disposition to deal tenderly with him raoul was touched with these indications of generosity and as he had witnessed griffins spirit in the different attempts made on his lugger it inclined him to think better of his foes rising he professed his readiness to attend the captain at that very moment  cuffe was waiting in the aftercabin when griffin and the prisoner entered he courteously requested both to be seated the former being invited to remain not only as a witness of what might occur but to act as an interpreter in case of need a short pause succeeded and then the captain opened the dialogue which was carried on in english with occasional assistance from griffin whenever it became necessary  i greatly regret monsieur yvard to see a brave man in your situation commenced cuffe who sooth to say apart from the particular object he had in view uttered no more than the truth we have done full justice to your spirit and judgment while we have tried the hardest to get you into our power but the laws of war are severe necessarily and we english have a commanderinchief who is not disposed to trifle in matters of duty  this was said partly in policy and partly from a habit of standing in awe of the character of nelson raoul received it however in the most favorable light though the politic portion of the motive was altogether thrown away as will be seen in the sequel  monsieur un fran√ßais knows how to die in the cause of liberty and his country answered raoul courteously yet with emphasis  i do not doubt it monsieur still i see no necessity of pushing things to that extremity england is as liberal of her rewards as she is powerful to resent injuries perhaps some plan may be adopted which will avert the necessity of sacrificing the life of a brave roan in so cruel a mode  i shall not affect to play the hero monsieur le capitaine if any proper mode of relieving me in my present crisis can be discovered my gratitude will be in proportion to the service rendered  this is talking sensibly and to the purpose i make no doubt when we come to right understanding everything will be amicably arranged between us griffin do me the favor to help yourself to a glass of wine and water which you will find refreshing this warm day monsieur yvard will join us the wine coming from capri and being far from bad though some do prefer the lachrymae christi that grows about the foot of vesuvius i believe  griffin did as desired though his own countenance was far from expressing all the satisfaction that was obvious in the face of cuffe raoul declined the offer waiting for the forthcoming explanation with an interest he did not affect to conceal cuffe seemed disappointed and reluctant to proceed but finding his two companions silent he was obliged to make his proposal  qui monsieur he added england is powerful to resent but ready to forgive your are very fortunate in having it in your power at so serious a moment to secure her pardon for an offence that is always visited in war with a punishment graver than any other  in what way can this be done monsieur le capitaine i am not one who despises life more especially when it is in danger of being lost by a disgraceful death  i am rejoiced monsieur yvard to find you in this frame of mind it will relieve me from the discharge of a most painful duty and be the means of smoothing over many difficulties without doubt you have heard of the character of our celebrated admiral nelson  his name is known to every seaman monsieur answered raoul stiffly his natural antipathies being far from cured by the extremity of his situation he has written it on the waters of the nile in letters of blood  aye his deeds there or elsewhere will not soon be forgotten he is a man of an iron will when his heart is set on a thing he sticks at no risk to obtain it especially if the means be lawful and the end is glory to be frank monsieur he wishes much for your lugger the le few folly  ah exclaimed raoul smiling ironicallynelson is not the only english admiral who has had the same desire le feufollet monsieur le capitaine is so charming that she has many admirers  among whom nelson is one of the warmest now this makes your case so much the easier to be disposed of you have nothing to do but put the lugger into our hands when you will be pardoned and be treated as a prisoner of war  does monsieur nelson authorize you to make this proposal to me asked raoul gravely  he does intrusted with the care of his countrys interests he is willing to overlook the offence against her under the law of nations to deprive the enemy of doing so much harm put the lugger into our hands and you shall be sent to an ordinary prisonship nay merely let us into the secret of her position and we will see to her capture  monsieur nelson doubtless does no more than his duty answered raoul quietly but with an air of severe selfrespect it is his business to have a care for english commerce and he has every right to make this bargain but the treaty will not be conducted on equal terms while he is doing no more than his duty i have no powers  how you have the power of speech that will suffice to let us into the secret of the orders you have given the lugger and where she is probably to be found at this moment  non monsieur i have not even that in my power i can do nothing that must cover me with so much infamy my tongue is under laws that i never made when treachery is in question  had raoul assumed a theatrical tone and manner as might have been expected probably it would have made very little impression on cuffe but his quiet simplicity and steadiness carried conviction with them to say the truth the captain was disappointed he would have hesitated about making his proposition to an officer of the regular french marine low as even these stood at that day in the estimation of nelsons fleet in particular but from a privateersman he expected a greedy acquiescence in a plan that offered life as a reward in exchange for a treachery like that he proposed at first he felt disposed to taunt raoul with the contradiction between what he cuffe conceived to be his general pursuits and his present assumption of principles but the unpretending calmness of the others manner and the truth of his feelings prevented it then to do cuffe himself justice he was too generous to abuse the power be had over his prisoner  you may do well to think of this monsieur yvard observed the captain after a pause of quite a minute the interest at stake is so heavy that reflection may yet induce you to change your mind  monsieur cuffe i pardon you if you can pardon yourself answered raoul with severe dignity in his manner rising as he spoke as if disdaining civilities which came from his tempter i know what you think of us corsairsbut an officer in an honorable service should hesitate long before he tempts a man to do an act like this the fact that the life of your prisoner is at stake ought to make a brave seaman still more delicate how he tries to work on his terrors or his principles but i repeat i forgive you monsieur if you can forgive yourself  cuffe stood confounded the blood rushed to his heart after which it appeared as if about to gush through the pores of his face a feeling of fierce resentment almost consumed him then he became himself again and began to see things as was his wont in cooler moments still he could not speak pacing the cabin to recover his selfcommand  monsieur yvard he at length said i ask your forgiveness sincerely and from the bottom of my heart i did not know you or such a proposal would never have insulted you or disgraced a british officer in my person nelson too is the last man living to wound the feelings of an honorable enemy but we did not know you all privateersmen are not of your way of thinking and it was there we fell into our mistake  touchezla said raoul frankly extending his hand monsieur le capitaine you and i ought to meet in two fine frigates each for his countrys honor let what would be the result it would lay the foundations of an eternal friendship i have lived long enough in votre angleterre to understand how little you know notre france mais nimporte brave men can understand one another all over the world for the little time which is left me we shall be friends  cuffe seized raouls hand and even a tear escaped him as he squeezed it warmly  this has been a dd miserable business griffin said the captain as soon as he could speak without betraying weakness and one no man will ever find me employed in again though a fleet as large as that up in the bay yonder were the price  i never thought it would succeed sir and to say the truth i never hoped it would youll excuse me captain cuffe but we english dont give the continentals exactly the credit they deserve and particularly the french i thought it wouldnt do from the first  cuffe now repeated his apologies and after a few expressions of friendly esteem on both sides raoul returned to his little room declining the captains offer to occupy one of the cabin staterooms griffin was soon back again then the conversation was resumed between the two officers  this is altogether a most painful business griffin observed cuffe there is no doubt that monsieur yvard is technically a spy and guilty according to the forms of law but i entertain not the smallest doubt of the truth of his whole story this ghita caraccioli as the girl calls herself is the very picture of truth and was actually in nelsons cabin the day before yesterday under circumstances that leave no doubt of the simplicity and truth of her character while every part of the tale corresponds with the other even the veechy and this pursy old podest√† confirm the account for they have seen ghita in porto ferrajo and begin to think the frenchman came in there solely on her account  i make no doubt captain cuffe that lord nelson will give a respite or even a pardon were the facts fairly laid before him observed griffin who felt a generous interest in preserving the life of raoul the very man he had endeavored to destroy by fire only a few weeks before but such is the waywardness of man and such are the mixed feelings generated by war  this is the most serious part of the affair griffin the sentence is approved with an order that it shall be carried into effect this very day between the hours of sunrise and sunset while here it is already noon and we are to the southward of campanella and so distant from the flagship as to put signals out of the question  griffin started all the grave difficulties of the case glancing upon his mind in a moment an order according to the habits of the service and more especially an order of this serious character was not to be questioned yet here was a dilemma in which there appeared no means of relief  good god captain cuffe how unlucky cannot an express be sent across by land so as yet to reach the flagship in time  i have thought of that griffin and clinch has gone precisely on that errand  clinch pardon me sir but such a duty requires a very active and sober officer  clinch is active enough and i know his besetting weakness will have no power over him today i have opened the way for a commission to him and no one in the ship can go to naples in a boat sooner than clinch if he really try he will make the most of the afternoons breeze should there be any and i have arranged a signal with him by which he may let us know the result even at the distance of eight or ten miles  has lord nelson left no discretion in the orders sir  none unless raoul yvard distinctly consent to give up the lugger in that case i have a letter which authorizes me to delay the execution until i can communicate directly with the commanderinchief  how very unlucky it has been all round is there no possibility sir of making up a case that might render this discretion available  that might do among you irresponsibles mr griffin answered cuffe a little sharply but i would rather hang forty frenchmen than be bront√©d by nelson for neglect of duty  cuffe spoke more strongly than he intended perhaps but the commander of a shipofwar does not always stop to weigh his words when he condescends to discuss a point with an inferior the reply put a check upon griffins zeal however though the discourse did not the less proceed  well sir the lieutenant answered im sure we are all as anxious as you can be to avert this affair from our ship twas but the other day we were boasting in the gunroom to some of the lapwings officers that were on a visit here that the proserpine never had an execution or a courtmartial flogging on board her though she had now been under the british ensign near four years and had been seven times under fire  god send griffin that clinch find the admiral and get back in time  how would it do sir to send the vicegovernatore to try the prisoner perhaps he might persuade him to seem to consentor some such thing you know sir as might justify a delay they say the corsicans are the keenestwitted fellows in all these seas and elba is so near to corsica that one cannot fancy there is much difference between their people  aye your veechy is a regular witch he made out so well in his first interview with yvard that no one can doubt his ability to overlay him in another  one never knows captain cuffe the italian has more resources than most men and the signor barrofaldi is a discreet sensible man when he acts with his eyes open le feufollet has cheated others besides the vicegovernatore and the podest√†  aye these dd jackolanterns are never to be trusted it would hardly surprise me to see the folly coming down wingandwing from under the land and passing out to sea with a sixknot breeze while we lay as still as a cathedral with not enough to turn the smoke of the galleyfire from the perpendicular  shes not inside of us captain cuffe of that we may be certain i have been on the maintopgallant yard with the best glass in the ship and have swept the whole coast from the ruins over against us here to the eastward up to the town of salerno there is nothing to be seen as large as a sparanara  one would think too this monsieur yvard might give up to save his own life after all  we should hardly do it i hope captain cuffe  i believe you are right griffin one feels forced to respect the privateersman in spite of his trade who knows but something might be got out of that bolt he must know as much about the lugger as yvard himself  quite true sir i was thinking of proposing something of the sort not a minute since now thats a fellow one may take pleasure in riding down as one would ride down the main tack shall i have him sent for captain cuffe  the captain hesitated for the previous experiments on ithuels selfishness had failed still the preservation of raouls life and the capture of the lugger were now objects of nearly equal interest with cuffe and he felt disposed to neglect no plausible means of effecting either a sign of approbation was all the lieutenant needed and in a few minutes ithuel stood again in the presence of his captain  here is an opportunity for you to fetch up a good deal of leeway master bolt commenced the captain and i am willing to give you a chance to help yourself you know where you last left the fewfolly i suppose  i dont know but i might sir answered ithuel rolling his eyes around him curious to ascertain what the other would be at i dont know but i might remember on a pinch sir though to own the truth my memory is none of the most desperate best  well then where was it recollect that the life of your late friend raoul yvard may depend on your answer  i want to know well this europe is a curious part of the world as all must admit that come from ameriky what has captain rule done now sir that he stands in such jeopardy  you know that he is convicted as a spy and my orders are to have him executed unless we can get his lugger then indeed we may possibly show him a little favor as we do not make war so much on individuals as on nations  cuffe would probably have been puzzled to explain the application of his own sentiment to the case before him but presuming on his having to deal with one who was neither very philosophical nor logical himself he was somewhat indifferent to his own mode of proceeding so that it effected the object ithuel however was not understood love for raoul or the lugger or indeed for anything else himself excepted formed no part of his character while hatred of england had got to be incorporated with the whole of his moral system if such a man could be said to have a moral system at all he saw nothing to be gained by serving raoul in particular though this he might have done did nothing interfere to prevent it while he had so strong an aversion to suffering the english to get le feufollet as to be willing even to risk his own life to prevent it his care therefore was to accomplish his purpose with the least hazard to himself  and if the lugger can be had sir you intend to let captain rule go he asked with an air of interest  aye we may do that though it will depend on the admiral can you tell us where you left her and where she probably now is  captain rule has said the first already sir he told the truth about that before the court but as to telling where the lugger is now ill defy any man to do it why sir ive turned in at eight bells and left her say ten or fifteen leagues dead to leeward of an island or a lighthouse perhaps and on turning out at eight bells in the morning found her just as far to windward of the same object shes as oncalculating a craft as i ever put foot aboard of  indeed said cuffe ironically i do not wonder that her captains in a scrape  scrape sir the folly is nothing but a scrape ive tried my hand at keeping her recknin  you  yes sir i ithuel bolt thats my name at hum or abroad and ive tried to keep the follys recknin with all the advantage of thermometer and leadlines and logarithms and such necessaries you know captain cuffe and i never yet could place her within a hundred miles of the spot where she was actually seen to be  i am not at all surprised to hear this bolt but what i want at present is to know what you think may be the precise position of the lugger without the aid of the thermometer and of logarithms ive a notion you would make out better by letting such things alone  well who knows but i might sir my idee of the folly just now sir is that she is somewhere off capri under short canvas waiting for captain rule and i to join her and keeping a sharp lookout after the inimies cruisers  now this was not only precisely the position of the lugger at that very moment but it was what ithuel actually believed to be her position still nothing was further from this mans intention than to betray his former messmates he was so very cunning as to have detected how little cuffe was disposed to believe him and he told the truth as the most certain means of averting mischief from the lugger nor did his ruse fail of its object his whole manner had so much deceit and low cunning about it that neither cuffe nor griffin believed a word he said and after a little more pumping the fellow was dismissed in disgust with a sharp intimation that it would be singularly for his interest to look out how he discharged his general duties in the ship  this will never do griffin exclaimed the captain vexed and disappointed should anything occur to clinch or should the admiral happen to be off with the king on one of his shooting excursions we shall be in a most serious dilemma would to god we had not left the anchorage at capri then might communicate with the flag with some certainty i shall never forgive myself if anything fatal actually take place  when one does all for the best captain cuffe his mind ought to be at ease and you could not possibly foresee what has happened might notone wouldnt like eitherbutnecessity is a hard master  out with it griffinanything is better than suspense  well sir i was just thinking that possibly this young italian girl might know something about the lugger and as she clearly loves the frenchman we should get a strong purchase on her tongue by means of her heart  cuffe looked intently at his lieutenant for half a minute then he shook his head in disapprobation  no griffin no he said to this i never can consent as for this quibbling equivocating yankee if yankee he be one wouldnt feel many scruples of delicacy but to probe the affections of a poor innocent girl in this way would be going too far the heart of a young girl should be sacred under every circumstance  griffin colored and he bit his lip no one likes to be outdone in the appearance of generosity at least and he felt vexed that he should have ventured on a proposition that his superior treated as unbecoming  nevertheless sir she might think the lugger cheaply sold he said with emphasis provided her lovers life was what she got in exchange it would be a very different thing were we to ask her to sell her admirer instead of a mere privateer  no matter griffin we will not meddle with the private feelings of a young female that chance has thrown into our hands as soon as we get near enough in with the land i intend to let the old man take his boat and carry his niece ashore that will be getting rid of them at least honorably and fairly god knows what is to become of the frenchman  this terminated the conference griffin went on deck where duty now called him and cuffe sat down to reperuse for the ninth or tenth time the instructions of the admiral    chapter xxii                                i have no dread      and feel the curse to have no natural fear      nor fluttering throb that beats with hopes or wishes      or lurking love of something on the earth       manfred  by this time the day had materially advanced and there were grave grounds for the uneasiness which cuffe began so seriously to feel all three of the ships were still in the bay of salerno gathering in toward its northern shore however the proserpine the deepest embayed the terpsichore and the ringdove having hauled out toward campanella as soon as satisfied nothing was to be seen inshore of them the heights which line the coast from the immediate vicinity of the town of salerno to the headland that ends near capri have long been celebrated not only for their beauty and grandeur but in connection with the lore of the middle ages as the proserpine had never been in this bay before or never so near its head her officers found some temporary relief from the very general uneasiness that was felt on account of their prisoner in viewing scenery that is remarkable even in that remarkable section of the globe the ship had gone up abreast of amalfi and so close in as to be less than a mile from the shore this object was to communicate with some fishermen which had been done the information received going to establish the fact that no craft resembling the lugger had been in that part of the bay the vessels head was now laid to the southward and westward in waiting for the zephyr which might soon be expected the gallant frigate seen from the impending rocks looked like a light merchantman in all but her symmetry and warlike guise nature being moulded on so grand a scale all along that coast as to render objects of human art unusually diminutive to the eye on the other hand the countryhouses churches hermitages convents and villages clustered all along the mountainsides presented equally delusive forms though they gave an affluence to the views that left the spectator in a strange doubt which most to admire their wildness or their picturesque beauty the little air that remained was still at the southward and as the ship moved slowly along this scene of singular attraction each ravine seemed to give up a town each shelf of rock a human habitation and each natural terrace a villa and a garden  of all men sailors get to be the most blas√©s in the way of the sensations produced by novelties and fine scenery it appears to be a part of their calling to suppress the emotions of a greenhorn and generally they look upon anything that is a little out of the ordinary track with the coolness of those who feel it is an admission of inferiority to betray surprise it seldom happens with them that anything occurs or anything is seen to which the last cruise or if the vessel be engaged in trade the last voyage did not at least furnish a parallel usually the past event or the more distant object has the advantage he who has a sufficient store of this reserved knowledge and experience it will at once be seen enjoys a great superiority over him who has not and is placed above the necessity of avowing a sensation as humiliating as wonder on the present occasion however bur few held out against the novelty of the actual situation of the ship most on board being willing enough to allow that they had never before been beneath cliffs that had such a union of the magnificent the picturesque and the soft though a few continued firm acting up to the old characters with the consistency of settled obstinacy  strand the boatswain was one of those who on all such occasions died hard he was the last man in the ship who ever gave up a prejudice and this for three several reasons he was a cockney and believed himself born in the centre of human knowledge he was a seaman and understood the world he was a boatswain and stood upon his dignity  as the proserpine fanned slowly along the land this personage took a position between the knightheads on the bowsprit where he could overlook the scene and at the same time hear the dialogue of the forecastle and both with suitable decorum strand was as much of a monarch forward as cuffe was aft though the appearance of a lieutenant or of the master now and then a little dimmed the lustre of his reign still strand succumbed completely to only two of the officersthe captain and the first lieutenant and not always to these in what he conceived to be purely matters of sentiment in the way of duty he understood himself too well ever to hesitate about obeying an order but when it came to opinions he was a man who could maintain his own even in the presence of nelson  the first captain of the forecastle was an old seaman of the name of catfall at the precise moment when strand occupied the position named between the knightheads this personage was holding a discourse with three or four of the forecastlemen who stood on the heel of the bowsprit inboardthe etiquette of the ship not permitting these worthies to show their heads above the nettings each of the party had his arms folded each chewed tobacco each had his hair in a queue and each occasionally hitched up his trousers in a way to prove that he did not require the aid of suspenders in keeping his nether garments in their proper place it may be mentioned indeed that the point of division between the jacket and the trousers was marked in each by a bellying line of a clean white shirt that served to relieve the blue of the dress as a species of marine facing as was due to his greater experience and his rank catfall was the principal speaker among those who lined the heel of the bowsprit  this here coast is mountainious as one may own observed the captain of the forecastle but what i say is that its not as mountainious as some ive seen now when i went round the arth with captain cook we fell in with islands that were so topped off with rocks and the like o that that these here affairs alongside on em wouldnt pass for anything more than a sort of jury mountains  there youre right catfall said strand in a patronizing way as anybody knows as has been round the horn i didnt sail with captain cook seeing that i was then the boatswain of the hussar and she couldnt have made one of cooks squadron being a postship and commanded by a fullbuilt captain but i was in them seas when a younker and can back catfalls account of the matter by my largest anchor in the way of history de if i think these hillocks would be called even jury mountains in that quarter of the world they tell me theres several noblemens and gentlemens parks near lunnun where they make mountains just to look at that must be much of a muchness with these here chaps i never drift far from wappin when im at home and so i cant say ive seen these artifice hills as they calls them myself but theres one joseph shirk that lives near st katharines lane that makes trips regularly into the neighborhood who gives quite a particular account of the matter  i dare to say its all true mr strand answered the captain of the forcastle for ive knowd some of them travelling chaps who have seen stranger sights than that no sir i calls these mountains no great matter and as to the houses and villages on em where you see one here you might say you could see two on some of the desert islands  a very marvellous account of cooks discoveries was suddenly checked by the appearance of cuffe on the forecastle it was not often the captain visited that part of the ship but he was considered a privileged person let him go where he would at his appearance all the old salts quitted the heel of the spar tarpaulins came fairly down to a level with the bagreefs of the shirts and even strand stepped into the nettings leaving the place between the knightheads clear to this spot cuffe ascended with a light steady step for he was but sixandtwenty just touching his hat in return to the boatswains bow  a boatswain on board an english shipofwar is a more important personage than he is apt to be on board an american neither the captain nor the first lieutenant disdains conversing with him on occasions and he is sometimes seen promenading the starboard side of the quarterdeck in deep discourse with one or the other of those high functionaries it has been said that cuffe and strand were old shipmates the latter having actually been boatswain of the ship in which the former first sailed this circumstance was constantly borne in mind by both parties the captain seldom coming near his inferior in moments of relaxation without having something to say to him  rather a remarkable coast this strand he commenced on the present occasion as soon as fairly placed between the knightheads something one might look for a week in england without finding it  i beg your pardon sir but im not of the same way of thinking i was just telling the forecastle lads down there that theres many a nobleman and gentleman at home as has finder hills than these made by hand in his parks and gardens just to look at  the dl you have and what did the forecastle lads down there say to that  what could they sir it just showed the superiority of an englishman to an italian and that ended the matter dont you remember the injees sir  the indies why the coast between bombay and calcutta is as flat as a pancake most of the distance  not them injees sir but totherthe west i mean the islands and mountains we passed and went into in the rattler your honor was only a young gentleman then but was too much aloft to miss the sight of anythingand all along america too  as strand was speaking he glanced complacently round as if to intimate to the listeners what an old friend of the captains they enjoyed in the person of their boatswain  oh the west indiesyoure nearer right there strand and yet they have nothing to compare to this why here are mountains alive with habitations that fairly come up to the sea  well sir as to habitations whats these to a street in lunnun begin on the starboard hand for instance as you walk down cheapside and count as you go my life for it youll reel off more houses in half an hours walk than are to be found in all that there village yonder then youll remember sir that the starboard hand only has half every jack having his jenny i look upon lunnun as the finest sight in nature captain cuffe after all i have seen in many cruises  i dont know mr strand in the way of coast one may very well be satisfied with this yonder town now is called amalfi it was once a place of great commerce they say  of commerce sirwhy its nothing but a bit of a village or at most of a borough built in a hollow no haven no docks no comfortable place even for setting up the frame of a ship on the beach the commerce of such a town must have been mainly carried on by means of mules and jackasses as one reads of in the trade of the bible  carried on as it might be trade it once had there does not seem to be any hidingplace along this shore for a lugger like the folly after all strand  the boatswain smiled with a knowing look while at the same time the expression of his countenance was like that of a man who did not choose to let others into all his secrets  the folly is a craft we are not likely to see again captain cuffe he then answered if it were only out of respect to his superior  why so the proserpine generally takes a good look at everything she chases  aye aye sir that may be true as a rule but i never knew a craft found after a third look for her everything seems to go by thirds in this world sir and i always look upon a third chase as final now sir there are three classes of admirals and three sets of flags a ship has three masts the biggest ships are threedeckers then there are three planets  the dl there are how do you make that out strand  why sir theres the sun moon and stars that makes just three by my count  aye but what do you say to jupiter saturn venus and all the rest of them the earth included  why sir theyre all the rest of the stars and not planets at all then sir look around you and youll find everything going by threes there are three topsails three jibs and three topgallant sails  and two courses said the captain gravely to whom this theory of the threes was new  quite true sir in name but your honor will recollect the spanker is nothing but a foreandaft course rigged to a mast instead of to a jackyard as it used to be  there are neither three captains nor three boatswains to a ship master strand  certainly not sir that would be oppressive and they would stand in each others way still captain cuffe the thirds hold out wonderfully even in all these little matters theres the three lieutenants and theres the boatswain gunner and carpenterand  sailmaker armorer and captain of the mast interrupted cuffe laughing  well sir you may make anything seem doubtful by bringing forward a plenty of reasons but all my experience says a third chase never comes to anything unless it turns out successful but that after a third chase all may as well be given up  i fancy lord nelson holds a different doctrine strand he tells us to follow a frenchman round the earth rather than let him escape  no doubt sir follow him round three earths if you can keep him in sight but not round four that is all i contend for captain cuffe even women they tell me take what is called their thirds in a fellows fortin  well well strand i suppose there must be some truth in your doctrine or you wouldnt hold out for it so strenuously and as for this coast i must give it up for i never expect to see another like it much less a third  its my duty to give up to your honor but i ask permission to think a third chase should always be the last one thats a melancholy sight to a man of feelin captain cuffe the object between the two midshipguns on the starboard side of the maindeck sir  you mean the prisoner i wish with all my heart he was not there strand i think i would rather he were in his lugger again to run the chances of that fourth chase of which you seem to think so lightly  your hanging ships are not often lucky ships captain cuffe in my judgment asking your pardon sir there ought to be a floating jail in every fleet where all the courts and all the executions should be held  it would be robbing the boatswains of no small part of their duty were the punishments to be sent out of the different vessels answered cuffe smiling  aye aye sirthe punishments i grant your honor but hanging is an execution and not a punishment god forbid that at my time of life i should be ordered to sail in a ship that has no punishment on board but i am really getting to be too old to look at executions with any sort of pleasure duty that isnt done with pleasure is but poor duty at the best sir  there are many disagreeable and some painful duties to be performed strand this of executing a man let the offence be what it may is among the most painful  for my part captain cuffe i do not mind hanging a mutineer so very much for he is a being that the world ought not to harbor but it is a different thing with an enemy and a spy its our duty to spy as much as we can for our king and country and one ought never to bear too hard on such as does their duty with a fellow that cant obey orders and who puts his own will above the pleasure of his superiors i have no patience but i do not so much understand why the gentlemen of the courts are so hard on such as do a little more reconnitrin than common  that is because ships are less exposed to the attempts of spies than armies strand a soldier hates a spy as much as you do a mutineer the reason is that he may be surprised by an enemy through his means and butchered in his sleep nothing is so unpleasant to a soldier as a surprise and the law against spies though a general law of war originated with soldiers rather than with us sailors i should think  yes sir i dare say your honor is right hes a rum un a soldier at the best and this opinion proves it now sir captain cuffe just suppose a frenchman of about our own metal took it into his head to surprise the proserpine some dark night what would come of it after all theres the guns and its only to turn the hands up to set em at work just the same as if there wasnt a spy in the world and should they prefer to come on board us and to try their luck at close quarters i rather think sir the surprise would meet em face to face no no sir spies is nothing to usthough it might teach em manners to keelhaul one onceandawhile  cuffe now became thoughtful and silent and even strand did not presume to speak when the captain was in this humor the latter descended to the forecastle and walked aft his hands behind his back and his head inclining downward every one he met made way for him as a matter of course in that mood he moved among the throng of a ship of war as a man tabooed even winchester respected his commanders abstraction although he had a serious request to make which it is time to explain  andrea barrofaldi and vito viti remained on board the frigate inmates of the cabin and gradually becoming more accustomed to their novel situation they did not escape the jokes of a manofwar but on the whole they were well treated and were tolerably satisfied more especially as the hope of capturing le feufollet began to revive as a matter of course they were apprised of the condition of raoul and both kind and benevolent men in the main they were desirous of conversing with the prisoner and of proving to him that they bore no malice winchester was spoken to on the subject but before he granted the permission he thought it safest to consult the captain in the matter at length an opportunity offered cuffe suddenly rousing himself and giving an order in relation to the canvas the ship was under  here are the two italian gentlemen captain cuffe observed winchester desirous of speaking to the prisoner i did not think it right sir to let him have communication with any one without first ascertaining your pleasure  poor fellow his time is getting very short unless we hear from clinch and there can be no harm in granting him every indulgence i have been thinking of this matter and do not possibly see how i can escape ordering the execution unless it be countermanded from nelson himself  certainly not sir but mr clinch is an active and experienced seaman when he is in earnest we may still hope something from him what is to be done with the italians sir  let them or any one else that poor yvard is willing to see go below  do you mean to include old giuntotardi and his niece captain cuffeand this deserter of our own bolthe too has had something to say of a wish to take leave of his late shipmate  we might be justified in denying the request of the last mr winchester but hardly of the others still if raoul yvard wishes to see even him his desire may as well be granted  thus authorized winchester no longer hesitated about granting the several permissions an order was sent to the sentinel through the corporal of the guard to allow any one to enter the prisoners room whom the latter might wish to receive a ship was not like a prison on shore escape being next to impossible more especially from a vessel at sea the parties accordingly received intimation that they might visit the condemned man should the latter be disposed to receive them  by this time something like a general gloom had settled on the ship the actual state of things was known to all on board and few believed it possible that clinch could reach the foudroyant receive his orders and be back in time to prevent the execution it wanted now but three hours of sunset and the minutes appeared to fly instead of dragging the human mind is so constituted that uncertainty increases most of its sensationsthe apprehension of death even very usually exciting a livelier emotion than its positive approach thus it was with the officers and people of the proserpine had there been no hope of escaping the execution they would have made up their minds to submit to the evil as unavoidable but the slight chance which did actually exist created a feverish excitement that soon extended to all hands and this as completely as if a chase were in sight and each individual was bent on overtaking her as minute after minute flew by the feeling increased until it would not much exceed the bounds of truth to say that under none of the vicissitudes of war did there ever exist so feverish an hour on board his britannic majestys ship the proserpine as the very period of which we are now writing eyes were constantly turned toward the sun and several of the young gentlemen collected on the forecastle with no other view than to be as near as possible to the headland around which the boat of clinch was expected to make her reappearance as behind it she had last been seen  the zephyr had come at the usual hour but it was light and the ship was so close to the mountains as to feel very little of its force it was different with the two other vessels lyon had gone about in time to get clear of the highest mountains and his lofty sails took enough of the breeze to carry him out to sea three or four hours before while the terpsichore under sir frederick dashwood had never got near enough in with the land to be becalmed at all her head had been laid to the southwest at the first appearance of the afternoon wind and that frigate was now hulldown to seawardactually making a free wind of it as she shaped her course up between ischia and capri as for the proserpine when the bell struck three in the first dogwatch she was just abeam of the celebrated little islets of the sirens the western breeze now beginning to die away though getting more of it the ship was drawing ahead faster than she had been since the turn of the day  three bells in the first dogwatch indicate the hour of halfpast five at that season of the year the sun sets a few minutes past six of course there remained but little more than half an hour in which to execute the sentence of the law cuffe had never quitted the deck and he actually started when he heard the first sound of the clapper winchester turned toward him with an inquiring look for everything had been previously arranged between them he received merely a significant gesture in return this however was sufficient certain orders were privately issued then there appeared a stir among the foretopmen and on the forecastle where a rope was rove at the foreyardarm and a grating was rigged for a platformunerring signs of the approaching execution  accustomed as these hardy mariners were to brave dangers of all sorts and to witness human suffering of nearly every degree a feeling of singular humanity had come over the whole crew raoul was their enemy it is true and he had been sincerely detested by all hands eightandforty hours before but circumstances had entirely changed the ancient animosity into a more generous and manly sentiment in the first place a successful and a triumphant enemy was an object very different from a man in their own power and who lay entirely at their mercy then the personal appearance of the young privateersman was unusually attractive and altogether different from what it had been previously represented and that too by an active rivalry that was not altogether free from bitterness but chiefly was the generous sentiment awakened by the conviction that the masterpassion and none of the usual inducements of a spy had brought their enemy into this strait and though clearly guilty in a technical point of view that be was influenced by no pitiful wages even allowing that he blended with the pursuit of his love some of the motives of his ordinary warfare all these considerations coupled with the reluctance that seamen ever feel to having an execution in their ship had entirely turned the tables and there where raoul would have found so lately between two and three hundred active and formidable enemies he might almost be said now to have as many sympathizing friends  no wonder then that the preparations of the foretopmen were regarded with unfavorable eyes the unseen hand of authority nevertheless held all in restraint cuffe himself did not dare to hesitate any longer the necessary orders were given though with deep reluctance and then the captain went below as if to hide himself from human eyes  the ten minutes that succeeded were minutes of intense concern all hands were called the preparations had been completed and winchester waited only for the reappearance of cuffe to issue the order to have the prisoner placed on the grating a midshipman was sent into the cabin after which the commanding officer came slowly and with a lingering step upon the quarterdeck the crew was assembled on the forecastle and in the waists the marine guard was under arms the officers clustered around the capstan and a solemn uneasy expectation pervaded the whole ship the lightest footfall was audible andrea and his friend stood apart near the taffrail but no one saw carlo giuntotardi or his niece  there is yet some fiveandtwenty minutes of sun i should think mr winchester observed cuffe feverishly glancing his eye at the western margin of the sea toward which the orb of day was slowly settling gilding all that side of the vault of heaven with the mellow lustre of the hour and latitude  not more than twenty i fear sir was the reluctant answer  i should think five might suffice at the worst especially if the men make a swift run this was said in a half whisper and thick husky tones the captain looking anxiously at the lieutenant the while  winchester shrugged his shoulders and turned away unwilling to reply  cuffe now had a short consultation with the surgeon the object of which was to ascertain the minimum of time a man might live suspended by the neck at the yardarm of a frigate the result was not favorable for a sign followed to bring forth the prisoner  raoul came on deck in charge of the masteratarms and the officer who had acted as provostmarshal he was clad in his clean white lazzarone garb wearing the red phrygian cap already mentioned though his face was pale no man could detect any tremor in the wellturned muscles that his loose attire exposed to view he raised his cap courteously to the group of officers and threw an understanding glance forward at the fearful arrangement on the foreyard that he was shocked when the grating and rope met his eye is unquestionable but rallying in an instant he smiled bowed to cuffe and moved toward the scene of his contemplate execution firmly but without the smallest signs of bravado in his manner  a deathlike stillness prevailed while the subordinates adjusted the rope and placed the condemned man on the grating then the slack of the rope was drawn in by hand and the men were ordered to lay hold of the instrument of death and to stretch it along the deck  stand by my lads to make a swift run and a strong jerk at your first pull said winchester in a low voice as he passed down the line rapidity is mercy at such a moment  good god muttered cuffe can the man die in this manner without a prayer without even a glance toward heaven as if asking for mercy  he is an unbeliever i hear sir returned griffin we have offered him all the religious consolation we could but he seems to wish for none  hail the topgallant yards once more mr winchester said cuffe huskily  foretopgallant yard there  sir  any signs of the boatlook well into the bay of napleswe are opening campanella now sufficiently to give you a good look up toward the head  a pause of a minute succeeded then the lookout aloft shook his head in the negative as if unwilling to speak winchester glanced at cuffe who turned anxiously mounted a gun and strained his eyes in a gaze to the northward  all ready sir said the first lieutenant when another minute elapsed  cuffe was in the act of raising his hand which would have been the signal of death when the dull heavy report of a distant gun came booming down from the direction of the town of naples  stand fast shouted cuffe fearful the men might get the start ofhim make your mates take their calls from their mouths sir two more guns winchester and i am the happiest man in nelsons fleet  a second gun did come just as these words were uttered then followed a breathless pause of half a minute when a third smothered but unequivocal report succeeded  it must be a salute sir griffin uttered inquiringly  the interval is too long listen i hope to god we have had the last  every ear in the ship listened intently cuffe holding his watch in his hand two entire minutes passed and no fourth gun was heard as second after second went by the expression of the captains countenance changed and then he waved his hand in triumph  its as it should be gentlemen he said take the prisoner below mr winchester unreeve the rope and send that dd grating off the gun mr strand pipe down  raoul was immediately led below as he passed through the afterhatch all the officers on the quarterdeck bowed to him and not a man was there in the ship who did not feel the happier for the reprieve    chapter xxiii       he saw with his own eyes the moon was round      was also certain that the earth was square      because hed journeyed fifty miles and found      no sign that it was circular anywhere       don juan  raoul yvard was indebted to a piece of forethought in clinch for his life but for the three guns fired so opportunely from the foudroyant the execution could not have been stayed and but for a prudent care on the part of the mastersmate the guns would never have been fired the explanation is this when cuffe was giving his subordinate instructions how to proceed the possibility of detention struck the latter and he bethought him of some expedient by which such an evil might be remedied at his suggestion then the signal of the guns was mentioned by the captain in his letter to the commanderinchief and its importance pointed out when clinch reached the fleet nelson was at castel √† mare and it became necessary to follow him to that place by land here clinch found him in the palace of quisisane in attendance on the court and delivered his despatches nothing gave the british admiral greater pleasure than to be able to show mercy the instance to the contrary already introduced existing as an exception in his private character and his public career and it is possible that an occurrence so recent and so opposed to his habits may have induced him the more willingly now to submit to his ordinary impulses and to grant the respite asked with the greater promptitude  your captain tells me here sir observed nelson after he had read cuffes letter a second time little doubt exists that yvard was in the bay on a love affair and that his purposes were not those of a spy after all  such is the opinion aboard us my lord answered the mastersmate there are an old man and a very charming young woman in his company who captain cuffe says were in the cabin of this ship on a visit to your lordship only a few days since  nelson started and his face flushed then he seized a pen and with the only hand he had scratched a letter directing a reprieve until further orders this he signed and handed to clinch saying as he did so  get into your boat sir and pull back to the frigate as fast as possible god forbid that any man suffer wrongfully  i beg your pardon my lordbut there is not time now for me to reach the ship before the sun set i have a signal prepared in the boat it is true but the frigate may not come round campanella before the last moment and then all these pains will be lost does not captain cuffe speak of some guns to be fired from the flagship my lord  he does sir and this may be the safest mode of communicating after all with this light westerly air a gun will be heard a long distance at sea take the pen and write as i dictate sir  clinch seized the pen which the admiral who had lost his right arm only a few years before really felt unable to use and wrote as follows  sirimmediately on the receipt of this you will fire three heavy guns at intervals of half a minute as a signal to the proserpine to suspend an execution  to the commanding officer of his majestys ship foudroyant  as soon as the magical words of nelson and bront√© were affixed to this order with a date clinch rose to depart after he had made his bows he stood with his hand on the lock of the door as if uncertain whether to prefer a request or not  this is a matter of moment sir and no time is to be lost added nelson i feel great anxiety about it and wish you to desire captain cuffe to send you back with a report of all that has passed as soon as convenient  i will report your wishes my lord answered clinch brightening up for he only wanted an opportunity to speak of his own promotion and this was now offered in perspective may i tell the commanding officer of the flagship to use the lowerdeck guns my lord  he will do that of his own accord after reading those orders heavy guns mean the heaviest good afternoon sir for gods sake lose no time  clinch obeyed this injunction to the letter he reached the foudroyant some time before sunset and immediately placed the order in her captains hands a few words of explanation set everything in motion and the three guns were fired on the side of the ship toward capri most opportunely for our hero  the half hour that succeeded on board the proserpine was one of gayety and merriment every person was glad that the ship had escaped an execution and then it was the hour for piping down the hammocks and for shifting the dogwatches cuffe recovered all his animation and conversed cheerfully having griffin for an interpreter with his two italian guests these last had been prevented from paying their visit to the prisoner on account of the latters wish to be alone but the intention was now renewed and sending below to ascertain if it would be agreeable they proceeded together on their friendly mission as the two worthies who had not altogether got their sealegs slowly descended the ladder and threaded their way among the throng of a ship the discourse did not flag between them  cospetto exclaimed the podest√† signor andrea we live in a world of wonders a man can hardly say whether he is actually alive or not to think how near this false sir smees was to death half an hour since and now doubtless he is as much alive and as merry as any of us  it would be more useful friend vito viti answered the philosophical vicegovernatore to remember how near those who live are always to death who has only to open his gates to cause the strongest and fairest to pass at once into the tomb  by san stefano but you have a way with you vicegovernatore that would become a cardinal its a thousand pities the church was robbed of such a support though i do think signor andrea if your mind would dwell less on another state of being it would be more cheerful and i may say more cheering to those with whom you discourse there are evils enough in this life without thinking so much of death  there are philosophers who pretend good vito that nothing that we see around us actually has an existence that we fancy everything fancy that this is a sea called the mediterranean fancy this is a shipyonder is the land fancy that we live and even fancy death  corpo di bacco signor andrea exclaimed the other stopping short at the foot of the ladder and seizing his companion by a button afraid he would desert him in the midst of a strange delusion you would not trifle in such a matter with an old friend one who has known you from childhood fancy that i am alive  sii have told you only the truth the imagination is very strong and may easily give the semblance of reality to unreal things  and that i am not a podest√† in fact but one only in fancy  just so friend vito and that i am only a vicegovernatore too in the imagination  and that elba is not a real island or porto ferrajo a real town and that even all our iron of which we seem to send so much about the world in good wholesome ships is only a sort of ghost of solid substantial metal  st sithat everything which appears to be material is in fact imaginary iron gold or flesh  and then i am not vito viti but an impostor what a rascally philosophy is this why both of us are as bad as this sir smees if what you say be true vicegovernatoreor makebelieve vicegovernatore  not an impostor friend vito for there is no real being of thy name if thou art not he  diavolo a pretty theory this which would teach the young people of elba that there is no actual podest√† in the island but only a poor miserable sham one no vito viti on earth if they get to think this god help the place as to order and sobriety  i do not think neighbor that you fully understand the matter which may be owing to a want of clearness on my part but as we are now on our way to visit an unfortunate prisoner we may as well postpone the discussion to another time there are many leisure moments on board a ship to the language of which one is a stranger that might be usefully and agreeably relieved by going into the subject more at large  your pardon signor andrea but there is no time like the present then if the theory be true there is no prisoner at allor at the most an imaginary oneand it can do sir smees no harm to wait while on the other hand i shall not have a moments peace until i learn whether there is such a man as vito viti or not and whether i am he  brother vito thou art impatient these things are not learned in a moment moreover every system has a beginning and an end like a book and who would ever become learned that should attempt to read a treatise backward  i know what is due to you signor andrea both on ac count of your higher rank and on account of your greater wisdom and will say no more at present though to keep from thinking on a philosophy that teaches i am not a podest√† or you a vicegovernatore is more than flesh and blood can bear  andrea barrofaldi glad that his companion was momentarily appeased now proceeded toward raouls little prison and was immediately admitted by the sentry who had his orders to that effect the prisoner received his guests courteously and cheerfully for we are far from wishing to represent him as so heroic as not to rejoice exceedingly at having escaped death by hanging even though it might prove to be a respite rather than a pardon at such a moment the young man could have excused a much more offensive intrusion and the sudden change in his prospects disposed him a little to be jocular for truth compels us to add that gratitude to god entered but little into his emotions the escape from death like his capture and the other incidents of his cruise was viewed simply as the result of the fortune of war  winchester had directed that raouls stateroom should be supplied with every little convenience that his situation required and among other things it had two common ships stools one of these was given to each of the italians while the prisoner took a seat on the guntackle of one of the two guns that formed the sides of his apartment it was now night and a mist had gathered over the arch above winch hid the stars and rendered it quite dark still raoul had neither lamp nor candles and though they had been offered him he declined their use as he had found stranger eyes occasionally peeping through the openings in the canvas with the idle curiosity of the vulgar to ascertain the appearance and employments of one condemned to die he had experienced a good deal of annoyance from this feeling the previous night and the same desire existing to see how a criminal could bear a respite he determined to pass his evening in obscurity there was a lantern or two however on the gundeck which threw a dim light even beyond the limits of the canvas bulkheads as has been said already these bulkheads extended from gun to gun so as to admit light and air from the ports this brought the tackles on one side into the room and on one of these raoul now took his seat  andrea barrofaldi from his superior condition in life as well as from his better education and nicer natural tact far surpassed his companion in courtesy of demeanor the latter would have plunged in medias res at once but the vicegovernatore commenced a conversation on general matters intending to offer his congratulations for the recent respite when he conceived that a suitable occasion should arise this was an unfortunate delay in one respect for vito viti no sooner found that the main object of the visit was to be postponed than he turned with eagerness to the subject in discussion which had been interrupted in order to enter the stateroom  here has the vicegovernatore come forward with a theory sir smees he commenced the moment a pause in the discourse left him an openinghere has the vicegovernatore come forward with a theory that i insist the church would call damnable and at which human nature revolts  nay good vito thou dost not state the case fairly interrupted andrea whose spirit was a little aroused at so abrupt an assault the theory is not mine it is that of a certain english philosopher in particular who let it be said too was a bishop  a lutheranwas it not so honorable signor andreaa bishop so called  why to confess the truth he was a heretic and not to be considered as an apostle of the true church  ayei would have sworn to that no true son of the church would ever broach such a doctrine only fancy signori the number of imaginary fires tongues and other instruments of torture that would become necessary to carry on punishment under such a system to be consistent even the devils ought to be imaginary  comment signori exclaimed raoul smiling and arousing to a sudden interest in the discourse did any english bishop ever broach such a doctrine imaginary devils and imaginary places of punishment are coming near to our revolutionary france after this i hope our muchabused philosophy will meet with more respect  my neighbor has not understood the theory of which he speaks answered andrea too good a churchman not to feel uneasiness at the direction things were taking and so worthy vito viti i feel the necessity of explaining the whole matter at some length sir smees so the italians called raoul out of courtesy still it being awkward for them after all that had passed to address him by his real namesir smees will excuse us for a few minutes perhaps it may serve to amuse him to hear to what a flight the imagination of a subtleminded man can soar  raoul civilly expressed the satisfaction it would give him to listen and stretching himself on the guntackle in order to be more at ease he leaned back with his head fairly within the port while his feet were braced against the inner truck of the guncarriage this threw him into a somewhat recumbent attitude but it being understood as intended to render what was but an inconvenient seat at the best tolerably comfortable no one thought it improper  it is unnecessary for us to repeat here all that andrea barrofaldi thought proper to say in his own justification and in explanation of the celebrated theory of bishop berkeley such a task was not performed in a minute and in truth prolixity whenever he got upon a favorite theme was apt to be one of the vicegovernatores weaknesses he was far from acquiescing in the doctrine though he annoyed his old neighbor exceedingly by presenting the subject in such a way as to render it respectable in appearance if not conclusive in argument to the latter it was peculiarly unpleasant to imagine even for the sake of argument that there was no such island as elba and that he was not its podest√† and all his personal and egotistical propensities came in aid of his official reluctance to disgust him thoroughly with a theory that he did not hesitate to say was an outrage on every honest mans nature  there are fellows in the world signor andrea the straightforward podest√† urged in continuation of his objections who might be glad enough to find everything imaginary as you saychaps that cannot sleep of nights for bad consciences and to whom it would be a great blessing if the earth would throw them overboard as they say in this ship and let them fall into the great ocean of oblivion but they are baroni in grain and ought not to pass for anything material among honest people ive known several of those rogues at livorno and i dare say napoli is not altogether without them but that is a very different matter from telling a handsome and virtuous young maiden that her beauty and modesty are both seeming and respectable magistrates that they are as great impostors as the very rogues they send to the prisons or perhaps to the galleys  to speeches like these andrea opposed his explanations and his philosophy until the discussion became animated and the dialogue loud it is rather a peculiarity of italy that one of the softest languages of christendom is frequently rendered harsh and unpleasant by the mode of using it on this occasion certainly the animation of the disputants did not mitigate the evil griffin happened to pass the spot on the outside of the canvas just at this moment and catching some of the words he stopped to listen his smiles and translations soon collected a group of officers and the sentry respectfully dropping a little on one side the deck around the stateroom of the prisoner became a sort of parquet to a very amusing representation several of the young gentlemen understood a little italian and griffin translating rapidly though in an undertone the whole affair was deemed to be particularly diverting  this is a rum way of consoling a man who is condemned to die muttered the master i wonder the frenchman stands all their nonsense  oh rejoined the marine officer drill will do anything these revolutionists are so drilled into hypocrisy that i dare say the fellow is grinning the whole time as if perfectly delighted  raoul in fact listened with no little amusement at first his voice was occasionally heard in the discussion evidently aiming at exciting the disputants but the warmth of the latter soon silenced him and he was fain to do nothing but listen shortly after the discussion got to be warm and just as griffin was collecting his group the prisoner stretched himself still further into the port to enjoy the coolness of the evening breeze when to his surprise a hand was laid gently on his forehead  hush whispered a voice close to his ear it is the americanithuelbe coolnow is the moment to pull for life  raoul had too much selfcommand to betray his astonishment but in an instant every faculty he possessed was on the alert ithuel he knew was a man for exigencies experience had taught him a profound respect for his enterprise and daring when it became necessary to act something must certainly be in the wind worthy of his attention or this cautious person would not have exposed himself in a situation which would be sure to lead to punishment if detected ithuel was seated astride of one of the chains beneath the mainchannel of the ship a position which might be maintained without detection possibly so long as it continued dark but which in itself if seen would have been taken as a proof of an evil intention  what would you have etooelle whispered raoul who perceived that his companions were too much occupied to observe his movements or to hear his words  the eyetalian and his niece are about to go ashore everything is ready and understood ive consaited you might pass out of the port in the dark and escape in the boat keep quietwe shall see  raoul understood his respite to be a thing of doubtful termination under the most favorable results an english prison remained in perspective and then the other side of the picture offered the image of ghita to his eye he was in a tumult of feeling but accustomed to selfcommand no exclamation escaped him  when cher etooelle when he asked his whisper being tremulous in spite of every effort to command himself  nowtoodersweettoutdesuitethe boat is at the gangway and old giuntotardi is in herthey are rigging a chair for the gal ayethere she swings offdont you hear the call  raoul did hear the whistle of the boatswain which was piping lower away at that very moment he listened intently as he lay stretched upon the guntackles and then he heard the splash in the water as the boat was hauled closer to in order to be brought beneath the chair the rattling of oars too was audible as ghita left the seat and moved aft round in called out the officer of the deck after which carlo giuntotardi was left in quiet possession of his own boat  the moment was exceedingly critical some one in all probability was watching the boat from the deck and though the night was dark it required the utmost caution to proceed with any hopes of success at this instant ithuel again whispered  the times near old carlo has his orders and little ghita is alive to see them obeyed all now depends on silence and activity in less than five minutes the boat will be under the port  raul understood the plain but it struck him as hopeless it seemed impossible that ghita could be permitted to quit the ship without a hundred eyes watching her movements and though it was dark it was far from being sufficiently so to suppose it practicable for any one to join her and not be seen yet this risk must be taken or escape was out of the question an order given through the trumpet was encouraging it announced that the officer of the watch was employed at some duty that must draw his attention another way this was a great deal few presuming to look aside while this functionary was inviting their attention in another direction raouls brain was in a whirl the two italians were at the height of their discussion and fortunately the clamor they made was at the loudest even the suppressed laughter of the officers on the outside of the canvas was audible to him though the disputants could hear nothing but their own voices every knock of the boat against the ships side every sound of the oars as carlos foot rattled them about and the wash of the water was audible it seemed as if all the interests of lifethe future the past and the present together with the emotions of his whole heart were compressed into that single instant ignorant of what was expected he asked ithuel in french the course he ought to take  am i to fall i headforemost into the water what would you have of me he whispered  lie quiet till i tell you to move ill make the signal captain rule let the eyetalians blaze away  raoul could not see the water as he lay with his head fairly in the port and he had to trust entirely to the single sense of hearing knock knock knock the boat dropped slowly along the ships side as if preparing to shove off all this carlo giuntotardi managed exceedingly well when he lay immediately beneath the mainchannels it would not have been an easy thing to see his boat even had there been any one on the lookout here he held on for he was not so lost to external things as not fully to understand what was expected of him perhaps he was less attended to by those on deck from the circumstance that no one believed him capable of so much worldly care  is everything safe for a movement inboard whispered ithuel  raoul raised his head and looked about him that a group was collected around the stateroom he understood by the movements the low conversation and the suppressed laughter still no one seemed to be paying any attention to himself as he had not spoken for some time however he thought it might be well to let his voice be heard and taking care that it should sound well within the port he made one of the light objections to the vicegovernatores theory that he had urged at the commencement of the controversy this was little heeded as he expected but it served to make those without know that he was in his prison and might prevent an untimely discovery everything else seemed propitious and lying down again at his length his face came within a few inches of ithuels  all safe he whispered what would you have me do  nothing but shove yourself ahead carefully by means of your feet  this raoul did at first as it might be inch by inch until ithuel put the end of a rope into his hands telling him it was well fast to the channel above the rope rendered the rest easy the only danger now being of too much precipitation nothing would have been easier than for raoul to drag his body out at the port and to drop into the boat but to escape it was still necessary to avoid observation the ship was quite half a league from the point of campanella and directly abreast of it and there was no security to the fugitives unless they got some distance the start of any pursuers this consideration induced the utmost caution on the part of ithuel nor was it entirely lost on his friend by this time however raoul found he was so completely master of his movements as to be able to swing his legs out of the port by a very trifling effort then the descent into the boat would be the easiest thing imaginable but a pressure from the hand of ithuel checked him  wait a little whispered the latter till the eyetalians are at it cat and dog fashion  the discussion was now so loud and warm that it was not necessary to lose much time ithuel gave the signal and raoul dragged his head and shoulders up by his arms while he placed his feet against the gun the next moment he was hanging perpendicularly beneath the mainchains to drop lightly and noiselessly into the boat took but a second when his feet touched a thwart he found that the american was there before him the latter dragged him down to his side and the two lay concealed in the bottom of the yawl with a cloak of ghitas thrown over their persons carlo giuntotardi was accustomed to the management of a craft like that in which he now found himself and simply releasing his boathook from one of the chains the ship passed slowly ahead leaving him in about a minute fairly in her wake a hundred feet astern  so far everything had succeeded surprisingly the night was so dark as to embolden the two fugitives now to rise and take their seats on the thwarts though all this was done with exceeding caution and without the least noise the oars were soon out carlo took the tiller and a feeling of exultation glowed at the heart of raoul as he bent to his ashen implement and felt the boat quiver with the impulse  take it coolly captain rule said ithuel in a low voice its a long pull and we are still within earshot of the frigate in five minutes more we shall be dropped so far as to be beyond sight then we may pull directly out to sea if we wish  just then the bell of the proserpine struck four the signal it was eight oclock immediately after the watch was called and a stir succeeded in the ship  they only turn the hands up said raoul who perceived that his companion paused like one uneasy  that is an uncommon movement for shifting the watch what is that  it was clearly the overhauling of tackles the plash of a boat as it struck the water followed    chapter xxiv        our dangers and delights are near allies      from the same stem the rose and prickle rise       alleyn  it has been seen that a generous sympathy had taken place of hostile feeling as respects raoul in the minds of most on board the proserpine under the influence of this sentiment an order had been passed through the sentries not to molest their prisoner by too frequent or unnecessary an examination of the stateroom with a view to a proper regard to both delicacy and watchfulness however winchester had directed that the angle of the canvas nearest the cabindoor lantern should be opened a few inches and that the sentinel should look in every halfhour or as often as the ships bell told the progress of time the object was simply to be certain that the prisoner was in his room and that he was making no attempt on his own life a step that had been particularly apprehended previously to the respite now the whole of the dispute between the two italians and that which had passed beneath the ships channels did not occupy more than six or seven minutes and the little cluster of officers was still gaining recruits when raoul was fairly in the yawl of his own lugger at this moment the ships bell struck the hour of eight the marine advanced with the respect of a subordinate but with the steadiness of a man on post to examine the state of the room although the gentlemen believed this caution unnecessary the loud voices of andrea and vito viti being of themselves a sort of guarantee that the prisoner was in his cage they gave way to a man fully understanding that a sentinel was never to be resisted the canvas was opened a few inches the light of the lantern at the cabindoor shot in and there sat the vicegovernatore and the podest√† gesticulating and staring into each others faces still in hot dispute but the place of raoul yvard was empty  yelverton happened to look into the room with the sentinel he was a young man of strong powers of perception with all the phrenological bumps that are necessary to the character and he saw at a glance that the bird had flown the first impression was that the prisoner had thrown himself into the sea and he rushed on deck without speaking to those around him made a hurried statement to the officer of the watch and had a quarterboat in the water in a surprisingly short time his astonished companions below were less precipitate though the material fact was soon known to them griffin gave a hasty order and the canvas bulkhead came down as it might be at a single jerk leaving the two disputants in full view utterly unconscious of the escape of their late companion sputtering and gesticulating furiously  halloo vicegovenatore cried griffin abruptly for he saw that the moment was not one for ceremony what have you done with the frenchmanwhere is raoul yvard  il signor sir smees monsieur yvard if you will neighbor vito what indeed has become of the man who so lately sat there  cospettoaccording to your doctrine signor andrea there never was a man there at allonly the imagination of one it is not surprising that such a being should be missed but i protest against any inferences being drawn from this accident all frenchmen are flighty and easily carried away and now that they are no longer ballasted by religion they are so many moral feathers no nolet a man of respectable information of sound principles and a love for the saints with a good substantial body like myself vanish only once and then i may confess it will tell in favor of your logic vicegovernatore  an obstinate man neighbor vito is a type of the imperfections that a  your pardon signor barrofaldi interrupted griffin this is not a moment for philosophical theories but for us seamen to do our duty what has become of raoul yvardyour sir smees  signor tenente as i hoped to be saved i have not the smallest idea there he was a minute or two since seated by that cannon apparently an attentive and much edified auditor of a discussion we were holding on the celebrated theory of a certain bishop of your own country which theory rightly consideredmind i say rightly consideredneighbor vito for the view you have taken of this matter is  enough of this for the present signoriadded griffin the frenchman was in this place when you came here  he was signor tenente and seemed greatly to enjoy the discussion in which  and you have not seen him quit you through the canvas or the port  not i on my honor i did suppose him too much entertained to leave us  ah sir smees has just vanished into the imagination growled the podest√† which is going home to the great logical family of which he is an ideal member there being no lugger no corsair no sea and no frigate it seems to me that we are all making a stir about nothing  griffin did not stop to question further he was quickly on deck where he found cuffe who had just been brought out of his cabin by a hurried report  what the dl is the meaning of all this gentlemen demanded the latter in a tone which a commander so naturally assumes when things go wrong whoever has suffered the prisoner to escape may expect to hear from the admiral directly on the subject  he is not in his stateroom sir answered griffin and i directed the boatswain to pipe away all the boats crews as i came up the ladder  as this was said boat after boat was falling and in two or three minutes no less than five were in the water including that in which yelverton was already rowing round the ship to catch the presumed swimmer or drowning man  the frenchman is gone sir said winchester and he must have passed out of the port i have sent one of the gentlemen to examine if he is not stowed away about the chains  where is the boat of the old italian and his niece  a pause succeeded this question and light broke in upon all at the same instant  that yawl was alongside cried griffinno one was in her however but giuntotardi and the girl  beg your pardon sir said a young foretopman who had just descended the riggingi saw the boat from aloft sir and it hung some time sir under the starboard mainchains it was so dark i couldnt fairly make it out but summat seemed to be passed into it from a port i didnt like the look of the thing and so our captain just told me to come on deck and report it sir  send ithuel bolt here mr winchesterbear a hand sir and let us have a look at that gentleman  it is needless to say that the call was unanswered and then all on board began to understand the mode of escape officers rushed into the several boats and no less than five different parties commenced the pursuit at the same time the ship hoisted a lantern as a signal for the boats to rally to  it has been said that the proserpine when this incident occurred was off the point of the campanella distance about half a marine league the wind was light at east or was what is called the land breeze and the vessel had about three knots way on her the headland was nearly abeam and she was looking up through the pass which separates capri from the main hauling round into the bay of naples intending to anchor in the berth she had left the previous day the night was too dark to permit an object small as a boat to be seen at any distance but the black mass of capri was plainly visible in its outlines towering into the air near two thousand feet while the formation of the coast on the other side might be traced with tolerable certainty and distinctness such was the state of things when the five boats mentioned quitted the ship  yelverton had acted as if a man were overboard or he had not waited for orders while pulling round the ship alone he caught sight though very dimly of the yawl as it moved in toward the land and without communicating with any on board the truth flashed on his mind also and he gave chase when the other boats were ready the two that were on the outside of the ship pulled off to seaward a short distance to look about them in that direction while the two others hearing the oars of the light gig in which yelverton was glancing ahead followed the sound under the impression that they were in pursuit of the yawl such was the state of things at the commencement of an exceedingly vigorous and hot pursuit  as raoul and ithuel had been at work while time was lost in doubt in and around the ship they had got about three hundred yards the start of even yelverton their boat pulled unusually well and being intended for only two oars it might be deemed full manned with two as vigorous hands in it as those it had still it was not a match for the second gig and the four chosen men who composed its crew which was the boat taken by yelverton in the hurry of the moment in a pull of a mile and a half the yawl was certain to be overtaken and the practiced ears of raoul soon assured him of the fact his own oars were muffled he determined to profit by the circumstance and turn aside in the hope that his fleet pursuers would pass him unseen a sheer was accordingly given to the boat and instead of pulling directly toward the land the fugitives inclined to the westward the sea appearing the most obscure in that direction on account of the proximity of capri this artifice was completely successful yelverton was so eager in the chase that he kept his eyes riveted before him fancying from time to time that he saw the boat ahead and he passed within a hundred and fifty yards of the yawl without in the least suspecting her vicinity raoul and ithuel ceased rowing to permit this exchange of position and the former had a few sarcastic remarks on the stupidity of his enemies as some relief to the feelings of the moment none of the english had muffled oars on the contrary the sounds of the regular manofwar jerks were quite audible in every direction but so familiar were they to the ears of the proserpines that the crews of the two boats that came next after yelverton actually followed the sounds of his oars under the belief that they were in the wake of the fugitives in this manner then raoul suffered three of the five boats to pass ahead of him the remaining two were so distant as not to be heard and when those in advance were sufficiently distant he and ithuel followed them with a leisurely stroke reserving themselves for any emergency that might occur  it was a fair race between the gig and the two cutters that pursued her the last had the sounds of the formers oars in the ears of their crews to urge them to exertion it being supposed they came from the strokes of the pursued while yelverton was burning with the desire to outstrip those who followed and to secure the prize for himself this made easy work for those in the yawl which was soon left more than a cables length astern  one would think ghita said raoul laughing though he had the precaution to speak in an undertoneone would think that your old friends the vicegovernatore and the podest√† commanded the boats inshore of us were it not known that they are this very moment quarrelling about the fact whether there is such a place as elba on this great planet of ours or not  ah raoul remember the last dreadful eightandforty hours i do not stop to trifle until we are once more fairly beyond the power of your enemies  peste i shall be obliged to own hereafter that there is some generosity in an englishman i cannot deny their treatment and yet i had rather it had been more ferocious  this is an unkind feeling you should strive to tear it from your heart  its a great deal to allow to an englishman captain rule to allow him ginerosty interrupted ithuel theyre a fierce race and fatten on mortal misery  mais bon etooelle your back has escaped this time you ought to be thankful  theyre shorthanded and didnt like to cripple a topman answered he of the granite state unwilling to concede anything to liberal or just sentiments had the ships complement been full they wouldnt have left as much skin on my back as would cover the smallestsized pincushion i owe em no thanks therefore  bien quant √† moi i shall speak well of the bridge which carries me over said raoul monsieur cuffe has given me good food good wine good words a good stateroom a good bed and a most timely reprieve  is not your heart grateful to god for the last dear raoul asked ghita in a voice so gentle and tender that the young man could have bowed down and worshipped her  after a pause however he answered as if intentionally to avoid the question by levity  i forgot the philosophy too he said that was no small part of the good cheer ciel it was worth some risk to have the advantage of attending such a school did you understand the matter in dispute between the two italians brave etooelle  i heerd their eyetalian jabber answered ithuel but supposed it was all about saints days and eating fish no reasonable man makes so much noise when he is talking sense  pardieit was philosophy they laugh at us french for living by the rules of reason rather than those of prejudice and then to hear what they call philosophy you would scarce think it ghita continued raoul who was now light of heart and full of the scene he had so lately witnessedyou would hardly think it ghita but signor andrea sensible and learned as he is maintained that it was not folly to believe in a philosophy which teaches that nothing we see or do actually exists but that everything was mere seeming in short that we live in an imaginary world with imaginary people in it float on an imaginary sea and cruise in imaginary ships  and was all that noise about an idee captain rule  sibut men will quarrel about an ideaan imaginary thing etooelle as stoutly as about substantials hist they will chase imaginary things too as are the boats ahead of us at this moment  there are others following us observed carlo giuntotardi who was more alive to surrounding objects than common and who from his habitual silence often heard that which escaped the senses of others i have noticed the sound of their oars some time  this produced a pause and even a cessation in the rowing in order that the two seamen might listen sure enough the sound of oars was audible outside as well as in shore leaving no doubt that some pursuers were still behind them this was bringing the fugitives between two fires as it might be and ithuel proposed pulling off at right angles to the course again in order to get into the rear of the whole party but to this raoul objected he thought the boats astern were still so distant as to enable them to reach the shore in time to escape once on the rocks there could be little danger of being overtaken in the darkness still as it was a first object with raoul to rejoin his lugger as soon as possible after landing ghita he did not wish to place his boat in any situation of much risk this induced some deliberation and it was finally determined to take a middle course by steering into the pass between capri and campanella in the expectation that when the leading english boats reached the point of the latter they would abandon the pursuit as hopeless and return to the ship  we can land you dearest ghita at the marina grande of sorrento then your walk to st agata will be neither long nor painful  do not mind me raoul put me on the land at the nearest place and go you to your vessel god has relieved you from this great jeopardy and your duty is to strive to act as it is evident he intends you to do as for me leagues will be light if i can only be satisfied that thou art in safety  angel thou never thinkest of self but not afoot this side of sorrento will i quit thee we can pull thither in an hour or two then i shall feel that i have done a duty once ashore etooelle and i can set our little sail and will run out to sea between the two islands no fear but what we can do that with this land breeze after which a few rockets burned will tell us where to find le feufollet  ghita again remonstrated but in vain raoul persisted and she was obliged to submit the conversation now ceased the two men plying the oars diligently and to good effect occasionally they ceased and listened to the sounds of the oars in the frigates boats all which were evidently collecting in the vicinity of the point or cape by this time the yawl had the extremity of the land abeam and it soon passed so far into the bay as to bring most if not all the pursuers astern in the darkness with no other guide than the sounds mentioned and with so many pursuers there was some uncertainty of course as to the position of all the boats but there was little doubt that most of them were now somewhere in the immediate vicinity of campanella as raoul gave this point a good berth and his own progress was noiseless this was bringing himself and companions after their recent dangers into comparative security  more than an hour of steady rowing followed daring which time the yawl was making swift way toward the marina grande of sorrento after passing massa raoul felt no further uneasiness and he requested carlo giuntotardi to sheer in toward the land where less resistance from the breeze was met with and where it was also easier to know the precise position apprehension of the boats now ceased though ithuel fancied from time to time that he heard smothered sounds like those of oars imperfectly muffled raoul laughed at his conceits and apprehensions and to confess the truth he became negligent of his duty again in the soothing delight of finding himself once more free in all but heart in the company of ghita in this manner the yawl moved ahead though with materially diminished speed until by the formation of the heights and the appearance of the lamps and candles on the piano ghita knew that they were drawing quite near to the indentation of the coast on which is situated the town of sorrento  as soon as my uncle and myself have landed at the marina grande raoul said ghita thou and the american will be certain to seek thy lugger then thou promisest to quit the coast  why ask promises of one that thou dost not sufficiently respect to think he will keep them  i do not deserve this raoul between thee and me no promise has ever been broken  it is not easy to break vows with one who will neither given nor accept them i cannot boast of keeping such idle faith as this go with me before some priest ghita ask all that man ever has or can swear to and then thou shalt see how a sailor can be true to his vow  and why before a priest thou knowst raoul that in thine eyes all the offices of the church are mummery that nothing is more sacred with thee for being sworn to at the altar of god and with one of his holy ministers for a witness  every oath or promise made to thee ghita is sacred in my eyes it wanteth not any witness or any consecrated place to make it more binding than thy truth and tenderness can insure thou art my priestmy altarmy  forbear exclaimed ghita in alarm lest he should utter the name of that holy being toward whom her heart was even at that moment swelling with gratitude for his own recent escape from death thou knowst not the meaning of thine own words and mightst add that which would give me more pain than i can express  boat ahoy cried a deep nautical voice within twenty yards of them and inshore the hail coming in the sudden quick demand that distinguishes the call of a manofwars man  a pause of half a minute succeeded for they in the yawl were completely taken by surprise  at length ithuel who felt the necessity of saying something if he would not bring the stranger close alongside of them answered in the customary manner of the italians  clinch for it was he scouring the shore in quest of the lugger on his way back to the proserpine gave a growl when he found that he must speak in a foreign tongue if he would continue the discourse then he mustered all the italian of which he was master for the occasion having cruised long on the station this was sufficient however for his present purpose  is that a boat from massa or from capri he inquired  neither snore answered raoul afraid to trust carlos conscience with the management of such a dialogue we come round the cape from st agata and carry figs to napoli  st agata aye that is the village on the heights i passed a night there myself in the house of one maria giuntotardi  who can this be murmured ghitamy aunt knows no forestieri  an inglese by his thick speech and accent i hope he will not ask for figs for his supper  clinch was thinking of other things at that moment and when he continued it was to follow the train of his own thoughts  have you seen anything of a baronelooking lugger he asked frenchrigged and frenchmanned skulking anywhere about this coast  sishe went north into the gulf of gaeta just as the sun was setting and is no doubt gone to anchor under the cannon of her countrymen  if she has shell find herself in hot water answered clinch in english weve craft enough up there to hoist her in and dub her down to a jollyboats size in a single watch did you see anything of a frigate this evening near the point of campanella an inglese i mean a tight sixandthirty with three new topsails  sithe light you see here just in a range with capri is at her gaff we have seen her the whole afternoon and evening in fact she towed us kindly round the cape until we got fairly into this bay  then you are the people for me was there a man hanged on board her or not about sunset  this question was put with so much interest that raoul cursed his interrogator in his heart imagining that he was burning with the wish to learn his own execution he was also now aware that this was he boat which had left the proserpine about noon  i can tell you there was not snoreif that will gladden your heart a man was all ready to be hanged when captain cuffe was pleased to order him taken down  just as three heavy guns were fired up at townwas it not so clinch eagerly inquired  diable this man may have been my preserver after all you say true snore it was just as three guns were fired up at naples though i did not know those guns had anything to do with the intended execution can you tell me if they had  if they had why i touched them off with my own hands they were signals made by the admiral to spare poor raoul yvard for a few days at least i am rejoiced to hear that all my great efforts to teach the fleet were not in vain i dont like this hanging mr italian  snore you show a kind heart and will one day reap the reward of such generous feelings i wish i knew the name of so humane a gentleman that i might mention him in my prayers  theyll never fancy that captain rule said that muttered ithuel grinning  as for my name friend its no great matter they call me clinch which is a good fast word to sail under too but it has no handle to it other than of a poor devil of a mastersmate and that too at an age when some men carry broad pennants  this was said bitterly and in english when uttered the supposed italian was wished a buona sera and the gig proceeded  that is un brave said raoul with emphasis as they departed if ever i meet with monsieur cleench he will learn that i do not forget his good wishes peste if there were a hundred such men in the british marine etooelle we might love it  theyre fiery serpents captain rule and not to be trusted any on em as for fine words i might have fancied myself a cousin of the kings if id only put my name to their shipping articles this mr clinch is well enough in the main being his own worst inimy in the way of the grog pitcher  boat ahoy shouted clinch again now about a hundred yards distant having passed toward the cape raoul and ithuel mechanically ceased rowing under the impression that the mastersmate had still something to communicate  boat ahoy answer at once or youll hear from me repeated clinch  aye aye answered another voice which in fact was yelvertons clinch is that you  aye aye sirmr yelverton is it not i think i know the voice sir  you are quite right but make less noisewho was that you hailed a minute or two since  clinch began to answer but as the two gigs were approaching each other all the time they were soon so near as to render it unnecessary to speak loud enough to be heard at any distance all this time raoul and ithuel lay on their oars almost afraid to stir the water and listening with an attention that was nearly breathless they were satisfied that the oars of the english were now muffled a sign that they were in earnest in the pursuit and bent on making a thorough search the two gigs could not be more than a hundred yards from the yawl and ithuel knew that they were the two fastestrowing boats of the english fleetso fast indeed that cuffe and his lieutenants had made several successful matches with them against the officers of different vessels  hist said ghita whose heart was in her mouth oh raoul they come  coming indeedwere they and that with vast velocity so careful however was the stroke that they were within two hundred feet of the yawl before raoul and his companion took the alarm and plunged their own oars again into the water then indeed the gigs might be dimly seen though the shadows of the land deepened the obscurity of night so far as to render objects at even a less distance quite indistinct the suddenness and imminency of the danger appeared to arouse all there was of life in carlo giuntotardi he steered and steered well being accustomed to the office by living so long on the coast and he sheered in for the rocks with the double view of landing if necessary and of getting still deeper within the shadows it was soon evident the english gained four oars against two were fearful odds and it was plainly apparent the yawl must be overtaken  oh uncle toward the arch and watercavern of the point whispered ghita whose hands were clasped on her breast as if to keep down her emotions that may yet save him  the yawl was in the act of whirling round the rocks which form the deep cove on which the marina grande of sorrento lies carlo caught his nieces idea and he kept his tiller hard aport telling raoul and ithuel at the same time to take in their oars as quick as possible the men obeyed supposing it was the intention to land and take to the heights for shelter but just as they supposed the boat was about to strike against some perpendicular rocks and raoul was muttering his surprise that such a spot should be chosen to land at it glided through a low natural arch and entered a little basin as noiselessly as a bubble floating in a current the next minute the two gigs came whirling round the rocks one following the shore close in to prevent the fugitives from landing and the other steering more obliquely athwart the bay in still another minute they had passed a hundred yards ahead and the sound of their movements was lost    chapter xxv        and chiefly thou o spirit that dust prefer      before all temples the upright heart and pure      instruct me for thou knowst       milton  the spot in which carlo giuntotardi had taken refuge is well known on the sorrentine shore as the watercavern at the ruins of queen joans countryhouse cavern it is not though the entrance is beneath a low natural archthe basin within being open to the heavens and the place resembling an artificial excavation made to shelter boats let the origin of this little haven be what it may art could not have devised a more convenient or a more perfect refuge than it afforded to our fugitives once through the arch they would have been effectually concealed from their pursuers under a noonday sun nor would any who were unacquainted with the peculiarities of the entrance dream of a boats lying as it might be buried in the rocks of the little promontory neither ghita nor her uncle any longer felt concern but the former announced her intention to land here assuring raoul that she could easily find her way into the bridlepath which leads to st agata  the desperate character of the recent chase aided by his late almost miraculous escape from death joined to the necessity of parting from his mistress rendered our hero melancholy if not moody he could not ask ghita to share his dangers any longer yet he felt if he permitted her now to quit him the separation might be for ever still he made no objection but leaving ithuel in charge of the boat he assisted ghita up the funnellike side of the basin and prepared to accompany her on her way to the road carlo preceded the pair telling his niece that she would find him at a cottage on the way that was well known to both  the obscurity was not so great as to render the walking very difficult and raoul and ghita pursued their course slowly along the rocks each oppressed with the same sensation of regret at parting though influenced by nearly opposing views for the future the girl took the young mans arm without hesitation and there was a tenderness in the tones of her voice as well as in her general manner that betrayed how nearly her heart was interested in what was passing still principle was ever uppermost in her thoughts and she determined now to speak plainly and to the purpose  raoul she said after listening to some one of those fervent declarations of love that were peculiarly agreeable to one of her affectionate and sincere nature even when she most felt the necessity of repelling the insinuating suit there must be an end of this i can never go through again the scenes i have lately witnessed nor allow you to run such fearful risks the sooner we understand each other and i may say the sooner we part it will be the wiser and the better for the interests of both i blame myself for suffering the intimacy to last so long and for proceeding so far  and this is said by a ferventsouled italian girl one of eighteen yearswho comes of a region in which it is the boast that the heart is even warmer than the sun of a race among whom it is hard to find oneoui even a poor onewho is not ready to sacrifice home country hopes fortune nay life itself to give happiness to the man who has chosen her from all the rest of her sex  it would seem to me easy to do all this raoul sii think i could sacrifice everything you have named to make you happy home i have not unless the princes towers can thus be called country since the sad event of this week i feel as if i had altogether lost of hopes i have few in this world with which your image has not been connected but those which were once so precious to me are now i fear lost you know i have no fortune to tempt me to stay or you to follow as for my life i fear it will soon be very valuelessan sure it will be miserable  then why not decide at once dearest ghita to throw the weight of your sorrows on the shoulders of one strong enough to bear them you care not for dress or gay appearances and can take a bridegroom even with the miserable aspect of a lazzarone when you know the heart is right you will not despise me because i am not decked as i might be for the bridal nothing is easier than to find an altar and a priest among these monasteries and the hour for saying mass is not very distant give me a right to claim you and i will appoint a place of rendezvous bring in the lugger tomorrow night and carry you off in triumph to our gay provence where you will find hearts gentle as your own to welcome you with joy and call you sister  raoul was earnest in his manner and it was not possible to doubt his sincerity though an air of selfsatisfaction gleamed in his face when he alluded to his present personal appearance for he well knew all his advantages in that way in spite of the dress of a lazzarone  urge me not dear raoul ghita answered though unconsciously to herself she pressed closer to his side and both sadness and love were in the very tones of her voice urge me not dear raoul this can never be i have already told you the gulf that lies between us you will not cross it to join me and i cannot cross it to join you nothing but that could separate us but that to my eyes grows broader and deeper every hour  ah ghita thou deceivest me and thyself were thy feelings as thou fanciest no human inducement could lead thee to reject me  it is not a human inducement raoul it is one above earth and all it holds  peste these priests are scourges sent to torment men in every shape they inflict hard lessons in childhood teach asperity in youth and make us superstitious and silly in age i do not wonder that my brave compatriots drove them from france they did nothing but devour like locusts and deface the beauties of providence  raoul thou art speaking of the ministers of god ghita observed meekly but in sorrow  pardon me dearest ghita i have no patience when i remember what a trifle after all threatens to tear us asunder thou pretendest to love me  it is not pretence raoul but a deep and i fear a painful reality  to think that a girl so frank with a heart so tender and a soul so true will allow any secondary thing to divide her from the man of her choice  it is not a secondary but a primary thing raoul oh that i could make thee think so the question is between thee and godwere it aught else thou mightst indeed prevail  why trouble thyself about my religion at all are there not thousands of wives who tell their beads and repeat their aves while their husbands think of anything but heaven thou and i can overlook this difference others overlook them and keep but one heart between them still i never would molest thee ghita in thy gentle worship  it is not thou that i dread raoul but myself answered the girl with streaming eyes though she succeeded in suppressing the sobs that struggled for utterance a house divided against itself cannot stand they say how could a heart that was filled with thee find a place for the love it ought to bear the author of its being when the husband lives only for the world it is hard for the wife to think of heaven as she ought  raoul was deeply touched with the feeling ghita betrayed while he was ready to adore her for the confiding sincerity with which she confessed his power over her heart his answer was given with seductive tenderness of manner which proved that he was not altogether unworthy of the strange conflict he had created in so gentle a breast  thy god will never desert thee ghita he said thou hast nothing to fear as my wife or that of any other man none but a brute could ever think of molesting thee in thy worship or in doing aught that thy opinions render necessary or proper i would tear the tongue from my mouth before reproach sneer or argument should be used to bring thee pain after i once felt that thou leanedst on me for support all that i have said has come from the wish that thou wouldst not misunderstand me in a matter that i know thou thinkst important  ah raoul little dost thou understand the hearts of women if thy power is so great over me today as almost to incline me from the most solemn of all my duties what would it become when the love of a girl should turn into the absorbing affection of a wife i find it hard even now to reconcile the love i bear to god with the strong feeling thou hast created in my heart a year of wedded life would endanger more than i can express to you in words  and then the fear of losing thy salvation is stronger than thy earthly attachments  nay raoul it is not that i am not selfish or cowardly as respects myself i hope nor do i think at all of any punishment that might follow from a marriage with an unbeliever what i most apprehend is being taught to love my god less than i feel i now do or than as the creature of his mercy i ought  thou speakest as if man could rival the being whom thou worshippest i have always understood that the love we bear the deity and that we bear each other are of a very different quality i can see no necessity for their interfering with each other  nothing can be less alike raoul yet one may impair if not destroy the other oh if thou wouldst but believe that thy saviour was thy godif thou couldst but be dead to his love and not active against him i might hope for better things but i dare not pledge all my earthly duties to one who is openly an enemy of my own great master and redeemer  i will not cannot deceive thee ghitathat i leave to the priests thou knowst my opinions and must take me as i am or wholly reject me this i say though i feel that disappointment if you persist in your cruelty will drive me to some desperate act by means of which i shall yet taste of the mercies of these english  say not so raoul be prudent for the sake of your country  but not for thine ghita  yes raoul and for mine also i wish not to conceal how much happier i shall be in hearing of your welfare and peace of mind i fear though an enemy it will ever give me pleasure to learn that thou art victorious but here is the road yonder the cottage where my uncle waits for me and we must part heaven bless theeraoul my prayers will be full of thee do notdo not risk more to see me but if the heart of the girl was so full that emotion choked her raoul listened intently for the next word but he listened in vain  if what dear ghita thou wert about to utter something that i feel is encouraging  oh how i hope it may be so my poor raoul i was going to add if god ever touches thy heart and thou wouldst stand before his altar a believer with one at thy side who is ready and anxious to devote all to thee but her love of the being who created her and her treasures of future happiness seek ghita thou will find her thou wouldst have  raoul stretched forth his arms to clasp the tender girl to his bosom but fearful of herself she avoided him and fled along the path like one terrified with the apprehension of pursuit the young man paused a moment half inclined to follow then prudence regained its influence and he bethought him of the necessity of getting to a place of safety while it was yet night the future was still before him in hope and that hope led him to look forward to other occasions to press his suit  little however did raoul yvard much as he prized her know ghita caraccioli her nature was full of womanly sensibilities it is true and her heart replete with tenderness for him in particular but the adoration she paid to god was of that lasting character which endures to the end in all she said and felt she was truth itself and while no false shame interposed to cause her to conceal her attachment there was a moral armor thrown about her purposes that rendered them impregnable to the assaults of the world  our hero found ithuel sleeping in the boat in perfect security the granite man thoroughly understood his situation and foreseeing a long row before him he had quietly lain down in the sternsheet of the yawl and was taking his rest as tranquilly as he had ever done in his berth on board le feufollet he was even aroused with difficulty and he resumed the oar with reluctance before descending the funnel raoul had taken a survey of the water from the rocks above he listened intently to catch any sounds that might arise from the english boats but nothing was visible in the obscurity while distance or caution prevented anything from being audible satisfied that all was safe outside he determined to row out into the bay and making a circuit to avoid his enemies push to the westward in the expectation of finding his lugger in the offing as there was now a considerable landbreeze and the yawl was lightened of so much of her freight there was little doubt of his being able to effect his purpose so far as getting out of sight was concerned at least long ere the return of light  pardie etooelle raoul exclaimed after he had given the american jog the third you sleep like a friar who is paid for saying masses at midnight come mon ami no is our time to move all is clear outside  well natur they say is a good workman captain rule answered ithuel gasping and rubbing his eyes and never did she turn off a prettier hidingplace than this one sleeps so quietly in it heigho i suppose the ash must be kept moving or we may yet miss our passage back to france shove her bows round captain rule here is the hole which is almost as hard to find as it is to thread a needle with a cable a good shove and she will shoot out into the open water  raoul did as desired ithuel touching the tiller the yawl glided through the opening and felt the long groundswell of the glorious bay the two adventurers looked about them with some concern as they issued from their hidingplace but the obscurity was too deep to bring anything in view on the face of the waters the flashing that occasionally illuminated the summit of vesuvius resembled heatlightning and would have plainly indicated the position of that celebrated mountain had not its dark outlines been visible exposing a black mass at the head of the bay the ragged mountaintops behind and above castel √† mare were also to be traced as was the whole range of the nearest coast though that opposite was only discoverable by the faint glimmerings of a thousand lights that were appearing and disappearing like stars eclipsed on the other side of the broad sheet of placid water on the bay itself little could be discerned under the near coast nothing the shadows of the rocks obscuring its borders with a wide belt of darkness  after looking around them quite a minute in silence the men dropped their oars and began to pull from under the point with the intention of making an offing before they set their little lugs  as they came out the heavy flap of canvas quite near startled their ears and both turned instinctively to look ahead there indeed was a vessel standing directly in threatening even to cross their very track she was close on a wind with her larboard tacks aboard and had evidently just shaken everything in the expectation of luffing past the point without tacking could she succeed in this it would be in her power to stand on until compelled to go about beneath the very cliffs of the town of sorrento this was in truth her aim for again she shook all her sails  peste muttered raoul this is a bold pilothe hugs the rocks as if they were his mistress we must lie quiet etooelle and let him pass else he may trouble us  twill be the wisest captain rule though i do not think him an englishman hark the ripple under his bow is like that of a knife going through a ripe watermelon  mon feufollet exclaimed raoul rising and actually extending his arms as if to embrace the beloved craft etooelle they seek us for we are much behind our time  the stranger drew near fast when his outlines became visible there was no mistaking them the two enormous lugs the little jigger the hull almost awash and the whole of the fairy form came mistily into view as the swift bird assumes color and proportion while it advances out of the depth of the void the vessel was but a hundred yards distant in another minute she would be past  vive la r√©publique said raoul distinctly though he feared to trust his voice with a loud hail  again the canvas flapped and the trampling of feet was heard on the luggers deck then she came sweeping into the wind within fifty feet of the yawl raoul watched the movement and by the time her way was nearly lost he was alongside and had caught a rope at the next instant he was on board her  raoul trod the deck of his lugger again with the pride of a monarch as he ascends his throne certain of her sailing qualities and confident of his own skill this gallant seaman was perfectly indifferent to the circumstance that he was environed by powerful enemies the wind and the hour were propitious and no sensation of alarm disturbed the exultation of that happy moment the explanations that passed between him and his first lieutenant pintard were brief but distinct le feufollet had kept off the land with her sails lowered a trim in which a vessel of her rig and lowness in the water would not be visible more than five or six miles until sufficient time had elapsed when she was taken into the gulf of salerno to look for signals from the heights of st agata finding none she went to sea again as has been stated sweeping along the coast in the hope of falling in with intelligence although she could not be seen by her enemies she saw the three cruisers who were on the lookout and great uneasiness prevailed on board concerning the fates of the absentees on the afternoon of that day the lugger was carried close in with the northwest side of ischia which island she rounded at dusk seemingly intending to anchor at baiae a harbor seldom without allied cruisers as the wind came off the land however she kept away and passing between procida and mysenum she came out into the bay of naples about three hours before meeting with raoul with the intention of examining the whole of the opposite coast in search of the yawl she had seen the light at the gaff of the proserpine and at first supposed it might be a signal from the missing boat with a view to make sure of it the lugger had been kept away until the nightglasses announced a ship when she was hauled up on a wind and had made two or three successive halfboards to weather the point where her captain lay concealed the marina grande of sorrento being one of the places of rendezvous mentioned by our hero in his last instructions  there was a scene of lively congratulation and of even pleasing emotion on the deck of the lugger when raoul so unexpectedly appeared he had every quality to make himself beloved by his men brave adventurous active generous and kindhearted his character rendered him a favorite to a degree that was not common even among the people of that chivalrous nation the french mariner will bear familiarity better than his great rival and neighbor the englishman and it was natural with our hero to be frank and free with all whether above him or below him in condition the temperaments to be brought into subjection were not as rude and intractable as those of the anglosaxon and the offhand dashing character of raoul was admirably adapted to win both the admiration and the affections of his people they now thronged about him without hesitation or reserve each man anxious to make his good wishes known his felicitations heard  i have kept you playing about the fire camarades said raoul affected by the proofs of attachment he received but we will now take our revenge there are english boats in chase of me at this moment under the land we will try to pick up one or two of them by way of letting them know there is still such a vessel as le feufollet  an exclamation of pleasure followed then an old quartermaster who had actually taught his commander his first lessons in seamanship shoved through the crowd and put his questions with a sort of authority  mon capitaine he said have you been near these english  aye benoit somewhat nearer than i could wish to own the truth the reason you have not sooner seen me was that i was passing my time on board our old friend la proserpine her officers and crew would not lose my company when they had once begun to enjoy it  pestemon cher capitainewere you a prisoner  something of that sort benoit at least they had me on a grating with a rope round the neck and were about to make me swing off as a spy when a happy gun or two from nelson up above there at the town ordered them to let me go below as i had no taste for such amusements and wanted to see mon cher feufollet etooelle and i got into the yawl and left them intending to return and be hanged when we can find nothing better to do  this account required an explanation which raoul gave in a very few words and then the crew were directed to go to their stations in order that the lugger might be properly worked the next minute the sails were filled on the larboard tack as before and le feufollet again drew ahead standing in for the cliffs  there is a light in motion near capri man capitaine observed the first lieutenant i suppose it to be on board some enemy they are plenty as gulls about this bay  you are very right monsieur tis la proserpine she shows the light for her boats she is too far to leeward to meddle with us however and we are pretty certain there is nothing between her and the ships off the town that can do us any harm are all our lights concealed let them be well looked to monsieur  all safe mancapitaine le feufollet never shows her lantern until she wishes to lead an enemy into the mire  raoul laughed and pronounced the word bon in the emphatic manner peculiar to a frenchman then as the lugger was drawing swiftly in toward the rocks he went on the forecastle himself to keep a proper lookout ahead ithuel as usual standing at his side  the piano or plain of sorrento terminates on the side of the bay in perpendicular cliffs of tufa that vary from one to near two hundred feet in height those near the town are among the highest and are lined with villas convents and other dwellings of which the foundations are frequently placed upon shelves of rock fifty feet below the adjacent streets raoul had been often here during the short reign of the rufo faction and was familiar with most of the coast he knew that his little lugger might brush against the very rocks in most places and was satisfied that if he fell in with the proserpines boats at all it must be quite near the land as the night wind blew directly down the play sighing across the campagna between vesuvius and castel √† mare it became necessary to tack offshore as soon as le feufollet got close to the cliffs where the obscurity was greatest and her proportions and rig were not discernible at any distance while in the very act of going round and before the headsheets were drawn raoul was startled by a sudden hail  felucca ahoy cried one in english from a boat that was close on the luggers bow  halloo answered ithuel raising an arm for all near him to be quiet  what crafts that resumed he in the boat  a felucca sent down by the admiral to look for the proserpinenot finding her at capri we are turning up to the anchorage of the fleet again  hold on a moment sir if you please ill come on board you perhaps i can help you out of your difficulty for i happen to know something of that ship  aye ayebear a hand if you please for we want to make the most of this wind while it stands  it is singular how easily we are deceived when the mind commences by taking a wrong direction such was now the fact with him in the boat for he had imbibed the notion that he could trace the outlines of a felucca of which so many navigate those waters and the idea that it was the very lugger he had been seeking never crossed his mind acting under the delusion he was soon alongside and on the deck of his enemy  do you know this gentleman etooelle demanded raoul who had gone to the gangway to receive his visitor  it is mr clinch the mastersmate of the accursed proserpine he who spoke us in the yawl off the point yonder  how exclaimed clinch his alarm being sufficiently apparent in his voice have i fallen into the hands of frenchmen  you have monsieur answered raoul courteously but not into the hands of enemies this is le feufollet and i am raoul yvard  then all hope for jane is gone forever i have passed a happy day though a busy one for i did begin to think there was some chance for me a man cannot see nelson without pulling up and wishing to be something like him but a prison is no place for promotion  let us go into my cabin monsieur there we can converse more at our ease and we shall have a light  clinch was in despair it mattered not to him whither he was taken in the cabin he sat the picture of a helpless man and a bottle of brandy happening to stand on the table he eyed it with something like the ferocity with which the hungry wolf may be supposed to gaze at the lamb ere he leaps the fold  is this the gentleman you mean etooelle demanded raoul when the cabinlamp shone on the prisoners face he who was so much rejoiced to hear that his enemy was not hanged  tis the same captain rule in the main he is a goodnatured officerone that does more harm to himself than to any one else they said in the ship that he went up to naples to do you some good turn or other  bonyou have been long in your boat mr clinchwe will give you a warm supper and a glass of wineafter which you are at liberty to seek your frigate and to return to your own flag  clinch stared as if he did not or could not believe what he heardthen the truth flashed on his mind and he burst into tears throughout that day his feelings had been in extremes hope once more opening a long vista of happiness for the future through the renewed confidence and advice of his captain thus far he had done well and it was by striving to do still better that he had fallen into the hands of the enemy for a single moment the beautiful fabric which revived hopes had been industriously weaving throughout the day was torn into tatters the kindness of raouls manner however his words and the explanations of ithuel removed a mountain from his breast and he became quite unmanned there is none so debased as not to retain glimmerings of the bright spirit that is associated with the grosser particles of their material nature clinch had in him the living consciousness that he was capable of better things and he endured moments of deep anguishas the image of the patient selfdevoting and constant jane rose before his minds eye to reproach him with his weaknesses  it is true that she never made these reproaches in terms so far from that she would not even believe the slanders of those she mistook for his enemies but clinch could not always quiet the spirit within him and he often felt degraded as he remembered with how much more firmness jane supported the load of hope deferred than he did himself the recent interview with cuffe had aroused all that remained of ambition and selfrespect and he had left the ship that morning with a full and manly determination to reform and to make one continued and persevering effort to obtain a commission and with it jane then followed capture and the moment of deep despair but raouls generosity removed the load and again the prospect brightened    chapter xxvi       oh many a dream was in the ship      an hour before her death      and sight of home with sighs disturbed      the sleepers longdrawn breath       wilson  raoul soon decided on his course while he was consoling clinch orders had been sent to pintard to look for the other gig but a few minutes search under the cliffs satisfied those on deck that she was not to be found and the fact was so reported below nor could all ithuels ingenuity extract from the captured boats crew any available information on the subject there was an esprit de corps among the proserpines as between their own ship and le feufollet which would have withstood on an occasion like this both threats and bribes and he of the granite state was compelled to give the matter up as hopeless though in so doing he did not fail to ascribe the refusal to betray their shipmates on the part of these men to english obstinacy rather than to any creditable feeling the disposition to impute the worst to those he hated however was not peculiar to ithuel or his country it being pretty certain he would have fared no better on board the english frigate under circumstances at all analogous  satisfied at length that the other boat had escaped him and feeling the necessity of getting out of the bay while it was still dark raoul reluctantly gave the order to bear up and put the lugger dead before the wind wingandwing by the time this was done the light craft had turned so far to windward as to be under the noble rocks that separate the piano of sorrento from the shores of vico a bold promontory that buttresses the sea with a wall of near or quite a thousand feet in perpendicular height here she felt the full force of the landwind and when her helm was put up and her sheets eased off a bird turning on the wing would not have come round more gracefully and scarcely with greater velocity the course now lay from point to point in order to avoid being becalmed within the indentations of the coast this carried the lugger athwart the cove of sorrento rather than into it and of course left yelverton who had landed at the smaller marina quite out of the line of her course  so swift was the progress of the little craft that within fifteen minutes after bearing up raoul and ithuel who again occupied their stations on the forecastle saw the headland where they had so lately been concealed and ordered the helm aport in order to sheer out and give it a berth then rock was passed after rock cove after cove and village after village until the entrance between capri and campanella was again reached in sweeping down the shore in this manner the intention was to pick up any boat that might happen to be in the luggers track for while raoul was disposed to let his prisoner go he had a strong desire to seize any other officers of the frigate that might fall in his way the search was ineffectual however and when the lugger came out into the open sea all expectation of further success of this nature was reluctantly abandoned  as le feufollet was now in dangerous proximity to three cruisers of the enemy the moment was one that called for decision fortunately the positions of the english vessels were known to raoul a circumstance that lessened the danger certainly but it would not do to continue long within a league of their anchorage with the risk of the land breezes failing as yet the darkness and the shadows of the land concealed the privateer and her commander determined if not literally to make hay while the sun shone at least to profit by its absence with this view then he ordered the lugger hoveto the boat of clinch hauled to the lee gangway and the prisoners to be all brought on deck the common men in the waist and the masters mate aft  here i must lose the pleasure of your company monsieur clinch said raoul with a courtesy that may almost be termed national we are quite as near votre belle proserpine as is safe and i long for notre belle france the wind is fair to take us off the coast and two hours will carry us out of sight even were it noonday you will have the complaisance to make my duty to monsieur cuffeoui pardie and to ces braves italiens who are so much ze amis of sir smees touchezla  raoul laughed for his heart was light and sundry droll conceits danced through his brain as clinch the whole was greek to him with the exception that he understood it was the intention of the french to take their vessel off the coast a circumstance that he was not sorry to learn though he would have given so much a few hours earlier to have known where to find her raouls generosity had worked a revolution in his feelings however and nothing was further from his wishes now than to be employed against the celebrated privateersman still he had a duty to perform to the service of which he was a member another to jane and a last to himself  captain yvard said the mastersmate taking the others offered hand i shall never forget this kindness on your part it comes at a most fortunate moment for me my happiness in this world and perhaps in the world to comean ejaculation of bah involuntarily escaped the listenerdepended on my being at liberty i hold it to be fair however to tell you the whole truth i must do all i can to capture or destroy this very lugger as well as any other of the kings enemies as soon as i am my own master again  boni like your frankness monsieur clinch as much as i like your humanity i always look for a brave enemy when un anglais comes against me if you are ever in the number i shall expect nothing worse  it will be my duty captain yvard to report to captain cuffe where i found the folly where i left her and where i think she is steering even your armament crew and all such little particulars i shall be questioned on i must answer honestly  mon cher you are honest fellow as you anglais say i wish it was noonday that you might better see our deckle feufollet is not ugly that she should wish to wear a veil tell everything clinch mon brave if monsieur cuffe wish to send another party against our lugger come in the first boat en personne we shall always be happy to see monsieur clinch as for where we steer you see out head is toward la belle france and there is plenty of room for a long chase adieu mon amiau revoir  clinch now shook hands heartily with all the officers again expressed his sense of the liberality with which he was treated and this too with emotion then he followed his people into the boat and pulled away from the luggers side holding his course toward the light which was still burning on board the proserpine at the same time le feufollet filled and soon disappeared from his eyes in the darkness running off wingandwing and steering west as if really making the best of her way toward the straits of bonifacio on her road to france  but in fact raoul had no such intention his cruise was not up and his present position surrounded as he was with enemies was full of attraction to one of his temperament only the day before he had appeared in the disguise of a lazzarone he had captured manned and sent to marseilles a valuable storeship and he knew that another was hourly expected in the bay this was an excuse to his people for remaining where they were but the excitement of constantly running the gauntlet the pleasure of demonstrating the superior sailing of his lugger the opportunities for distinction and every other professional motive were trifling as compared with the tie which bound him to the feeling that unceasingly attracted him toward ghita with his love also there began to mingle a sensation approaching to despair while ghita was so gentle and even tender with him he had ever found her consistent and singularly firm in her principles in their recent dialogues some that we hare forborne to relate on account of their peculiar character ghita had expressed her reluctance to trust her fate with one whose god was not her god with a distinctness and force that left no doubt of the seriousness of her views or of her ability to sustain them in acts what rendered her resolution more impressive was the ingenuous manner with which she never hesitated to admit raouls power over her affections leaving no pretext for the commonplace supposition that the girl was acting the conversation of that night weighed heavily on the heart of the lover and he could not summon sufficient resolution to partperhaps for monthswith such an apparent breach between him and his hopes  as soon as it was known therefore that the lugger was far enough at sea to be out of sight from the boat of clinch she came by the wind on the larboard tack again heading up toward the celebrated ruins of paestum on the eastern shore of the bay of salerno to one accustomed to the sea there would not have seemed sufficient wind to urge even that light craft along at the rate with which she glided through the water but the land breeze was charged with the damps of midnight the canvas was thickened from the same cause and the propelling power had nearly double its apparent force in an hour after hauling up le feufollet tacked quite eight miles distant from the spot where she altered her direction and far enough to windward to lay her course in directly for the cliffs beneath the village of st agata or the present residence of ghita in proceeding thus raoul had a double intention before him english ships were constantly passing between sicily malta and naples and as those bound north would naturally draw in with the land at this point his position might enable him to strike a sudden blow with the return of day should any suitable vessel be in the offing next morning then he hoped for a signal from ghita at leastand such things were very dear to his heart or possibly anxiety and affection might bring her down to the waterside when another interview would be possible this was the weakness of passion and raoul submitted to its power like feeblerminded and less resolute men the hero becoming little better than the vulgar herd under its influence  the two or three last days and nights had been hours of extreme anxiety and care to the officers and crew of the lugger as well as to their commander and all on board began to feel the necessity of sleep as for ithuel he had been in his hammock an hour and raoul now thought seriously of following his example giving his instructions to the young lieutenant who was in charge of the deck our hero went below and in a few minutes he was also lost to present hopes and fears  everything seemed propitious to the lugger and the intentions of her commander the wind went down gradually until there was little more than air enough to keep steerageway on the vessel while the ripple on the water disappeared leaving nothing behind it but the long heavy groundswell that always stirs the bosom of the ocean like the heaving respiration of some gigantic animal the morning grew darker but the surface of the gulf was glassy and tranquil leaving no immediate motive for watchfulness or care  these are the lethargic moments of a seamans life days of toil bring nights of drowsiness and the repose of nature presents a constant temptation to imitate her example the reaction of excitement destroys the disposition to indulge in the song the jest or the tale and the mind like the body is disposed to rest from its labors even the murmuring wash of the water as it rises and falls against the vessels sides sounds like a lullaby and sleep seems to be the one great blessing of existence under such circumstances therefore it is not surprising that the watch on the deck of the lugger indulged this necessary want it is permitted to the common men to doze at such moments while a few are on the alert but even duty in the absence of necessity feels its task to be irksome and difficult of performance lookout after lookout lowered his head the young man who was seated on the armchest aft began to lose his consciousness of present things in dreamy recollections of provence his home and the girl of his youthful admiration the seaman at the helm alone kept his eyes open and all his faculties on the alert this is a station in which vigilance is ever required and it sometimes happens in vessels where the rigid discipline of a regular service does not exist that others rely so much on the circumstance that they forget their own duties in depending on the due discharge of his by the man at the wheel  such to a certain degree was now the fact on board le feufollet one of the best seamen in the lugger was at the helm and each individual felt satisfied that no shift of wind could occur no change of sails become necessary that antoine would not be there to admonish them of the circumstance one day was so much like another too in that tranquil season of the year and in that luxurious sea that all on board knew the regular mutations that the hours produced the southerly air in the morning the zephyr in the afternoon and the land wind at night were as much matters of course as the rising and setting of the sun no one felt apprehension while all submitted to the influence of a want of rest and of the drowsiness of the climate  not so with antoine his hairs were gray sleep was no longer so necessary to him he had much pride of calling too was long experienced and possessed senses sharpened and rendered critical by practice and many dangers time and again did he turn his eyes toward campanella to ascertain if any signs of the enemy were in sight the obscurity prevented anything from being visible but the dark outline of the high and rockbound coast then he glanced his eyes over the deck and felt how completely everything depended on his own vigilance and faithfulness the look at the sails and to windward brought no cause for uneasiness however and presuming on his isolation he began to sing in suppressed tones an air of the troubadours one that he had learned in childhood in his native langue du midi thus passed the minutes until antoine saw the first glimmerings of morning peeping out of the darkness that came above the mountaintops that lay in the vicinity of eboli antoine felt solitary he was not sorry to greet these symptoms of a return to the animation and communion of a new day  hist mon lieutenant whispered the old mariner unwilling to expose the drowsiness of his young superior to the gaze of the common men mon lieutenanttis i antoine  ehbahoh antoine estceque toi bonwhat would you have mon ami  i hear the surf i think mon lieutenant listenis not that the water striking on the rocks of the shore  jamais you see the land is a mile from us this coast has no shoals the captain told us to stand close in before we hove to or called him pardieantoine how the little witch has travelled in my watch here we are within a muskets range from the heights yet there has been no wind  pardon mon lieutenanti do not like that sound of the surf it is too near for the shore will you have the kindness to step on the forecastle and look ahead monsieurthe light is beginning to be of use  the young man yawned stretched his arms and walked forward the first to indulge himself the first also to relieve the uneasiness of an old shipmate whose experience he respected still his step was not as quick as common and it was near a minute ere he reached the bows or before he gained the knightheads but his form was no sooner visible there than he waved his arms frantically and shouted in a voice that reached the recesses of the vessel  hard uphard up with the helm antoineease off the sheets mes enfans  le feufollet rose on a heavy groundswell at that moment in the next she settled down with a shock resembling that which we experience when we leap and alight sooner than was expected there she lay cradled in a bed of rocks as immovable as one of the stones around herstones that had mocked the billows of the mediterranean within the known annals of man more than three thousand years in a word the lugger had struck on one of those celebrated islets under the heights of st agata known as the islands of the sirens and which are believed to have been commemorated by the oldest of all the living profane writers homer himself the blow was hardly given before raoul appeared on deck the vessel gave up all that had life in her and she was at once a scene of alarm activity and exertion  it is at such a moment as this that the most useful qualities of a naval captain render themselves apparent of all around him raoul was the calmest the most collected and the best qualified to issue the orders that had become necessary he made no exclamationsuttered not a word of reproachcast not even a glance of disapprobation on any near him the mischief was done the one thing needful was to repair it if possible leaving to the future the cares of discipline and the distribution of rewards and punishments  she is as fast anchored as a cathedral mon lieutenant he quietly observed to the very officer through whose remissness the accident had occurred i see no use in these sails take them in at once they may set her further on the rocks should she happen to lift  the young man obeyed every nerve in his body agitated by the sense of delinquency then he walked aft cast one look around him at the desperate condition of the lugger and with the impetuosity of character that belongs to his country he plunged into the sea from which his body never reappeared the melancholy suicide was immediately reported to raoul  bon was the answer had he done it an hour earlier le feufollet would not have been set up on these rocks like a vessel in a shipyardmais mes enfans couragewell yet see if our beautiful lugger cannot be saved  if there were stoicism and bitterness in this answer there was not deliberate cruelty raoul loved his lugger next to ghita before all things on earth and in his eyes the fault of wrecking her in a calm was to be classed among the unpardonable sins still it was by no means a rare occurrence ships like men are often cast away by an excess of confidence and our own coast one of the safest in the known world for the prudent mariner to approach on account of the regularity of its soundings has many a tale to tell of disasters similar to this which have occurred simply because no signs of danger were apparent our hero would not have excused himself for such negligence and that which selflove will not induce us to pardon will hardly be conceded to philanthropy  the pumps were sounded and it was ascertained that the lugger had come down so easily into her bed and lay there with so little straining of her seams that she continued tight as a bottle this left all the hope which circumstances would allow of still saving the vessel raoul neglected no useful precaution by this time the light was strong enough to enable him to see a felucca coming slowly down from salerno before the wind or all that was still left of the night air and he despatched ithuel with an armed boat to seize her and bring her alongside of the rocks he took this course with the double purpose of using the prize if practicable in getting his own vessel off or in the last resort of making his own escape and that of his people in her to france he did not condescend to explain his motives however nor did any one presume to inquire into them raoul was now strictly a commander acting in a desperate emergency he even succeeded in suppressing the constitutional volubility of his countrymen and in substituting for it the deep attentive silence of thorough discipline one of the great causes of his own unusual success in maritime enterprises to the want of this very silence and attention may be ascribed so many of those naval disasters which have undeniably befallen a people of singular enterprise and courage those who wish them well will be glad to learn that the evil has been in a great measure repaired  as soon as the boat was sent to seize the felucca the yawl was put into the water and raoul himself began to sound around the lugger the rocks of the sirens as the islets are called to this day are sufficiently elevated above the surface of the sea to be visible at some distance though lying in a line with the coast it would not have been easy for the lookouts of le feufollet to discern them at the hour when she struck even had they been on the alert the increasing light however enabled the french fully to ascertain their position and to learn the extent of the evil the lugger had been lifted into a crevice between two of the rocks by a groundswell heavier than common and though there was deep water all around her it would be impossible to get her afloat again without lightening so long as the wind did not blow and the sea did not rise she was safe enough but a swell that should force the hull to rise and fall would inevitably cause her to bilge these facts were learned in five minutes after the yawl was in the water and much did raoul rejoice at having so promptly sent ithuel in quest of the felucca the rocks were next reconnoitred in order to ascertain what facilities they offered to favor the discharging of the vessels stores some of them were high enough to protect articles from the wash of the water but it is at all times difficult to lie alongside of rocks that are exposed to the open sea the heaving and setting of the element even in calms causing the elevation of its surface so much to vary on the present occasion however the french found less swell than common and that it was possible to get their stores ashore at two or three different points  raoul now directed the work to commence in earnest the lugger carried four boats viza launch a cutter the yawl and a jollyboat the second had been sent after the felucca with a strong crew in her but the three others were employed in discharging stores raoul perceived at once that the moment was not one for halfway measures and that large sacrifices must be made to save the hull of the vessel this and the safety of his crew were the two great objects he kept before him all his measures were directed to that end the water was started in the luggers hold by staving the casks and the pumps were set in motion as soon as possible provisions of all sorts were cast into the sea for le feufollet had recently supplied herself from a prize and was a little deeper than her best trim allowed in short everything that could be spared was thrown overboard barely a sufficiency of food and water being retained to last the people until they could reach corsica whither it was their captains intention to proceed the moment he got his vessel afloat  the mediterranean has no regular tides though the water rises and falls materially at irregular intervals either the effect of gales or of the influence of the adjacent seas this circumstance prevented the calamity of having gone ashore at high water while it also prevented the mariners from profiting by any flood it left them as they had been placed by the accident itself mainly dependent on their own exertions  under such circumstances then our hero set about the discharge of his responsible duties an hour of active toil well directed and perseveringly continued wrought a material change the vessel was small while the number of hands was relatively large at the end of the time mentioned the officer charged with the duty reported that the hull moved under the power of the heaving sea and that it might soon be expected to strike with a force to endanger its planks and ribs this was the sign to cease discharging and to complete the preparations that had been making for heaving the lugger off it being unsafe to delay that process after the weight was sufficiently lessened to allow it the launch had carried out an anchor and was already returning toward the rocks paying out cable as it came in but the depth of the water rendered this an anxious service since there was the danger of dragging the groundtackle home as it is termed on account of the angle at which it lay  at this moment with the exception of difficulty last named everything seemed propitious the wind had gone done entirely the southerly air having lasted but a short time and no other succeeding it the sea was certainly not more disturbed than it had been all the morning which was at its minimum of motion while the day promised to be calm and clear nothing was in sight but the felucca and she was not only in ithuels possession but she had drawn within half a mile of the rocks and was sweeping still nearer at each instant in ten minutes she must come alongside raoul had ascertained that there was water enough were le feufollet lay to permit a vessel like his prize to touch her and many things lay on deck in readiness to be transferred to this tender previously to beginning to heave the rocks too were well garnished with casks cordage shot ballast and such other articles and could be come atthe armament and ammunition excepted these last our hero always treated with religious care for in all he did there was a latent determination resolutely to defend himself but there ware no signs of any such necessitys being likely to occur and the officers began to flatter themselves with their ability to get their lugger afloat and in sailing trim before the usual afternoons breeze should set in in waiting therefore for the arrival of the felucca and in order that the work might meet with no interruption when the men once began to heave the people were ordered to get their breakfasts  this pause in the proceedings gave raoul an opportunity to look about him and to reflect twenty times did he turn his eyes anxiously toward the heights of st agata where there existed subjects equally of attraction and apprehension it is scarcely necessary to say that the first was ghita while the last arose from the fear that some curious eye might recognize the lugger and report her condition to the enemies known to be lying at capri only a league or two on the other side of the hills but all was seemingly tranquil there at that early hour and the lugger making very little show when her canvas was not spread there was reason to hope that the accident was as yet unseen the approach of the felucca would probably betray it though the precaution had been taken to order ithuel to show no signs of national character  raoul yvard was a very different man at this moment of leisure and idleness from what he had been a few hours earlier then he trod the deck of his little cruiser with some such feelings as the man who exults in his strength and rejoices in his youth now he felt as all are apt to feel who are rebuked by misfortunes and disease nevertheless his character had lost none of its high chivalry and even there as he sat on the taffrail of the stranded feufollet he meditated carrying some stout englishman by surprise and boarding in the event of his not succeeding in getting off the lugger the felucca would greatly aid such an enterprise and his crew was strong enough as well as sufficiently trained to promise success  on such an expedient even was he ruminating as ithuel in obedience to an order given through the trumpet brought his prize alongside and secured her to the lugger the men who had accompanied the american were now dismissed to their mornings meal while raoul invited their leader to share his frugal repast where he sat as the two broke their fasts questions were put and answered concerning what had occurred during the hour or two the parties had been separated raouls tale was soon told and then he learned with concern that the crew of the felucca had taken to their boat and escaped to the landing of the scaricatojo on finding that the capture of their vessel was inevitable this proved that the character of the wreck was known and left but little hope that their situation would not be reported to the english in the course of the morning    chapter xxvii       but now lead on      in me is no delay with thee to go      is to stay here with thee here to stay      is to go hence unwilling thou to me      art all things under heaven all places thou       milton  the intelligence communicated by ithuel essentially altered raouls views of his actual situation an active man might go from the marinella at the foot of the scaricatojo or the place where the crew of the felucca had landed to the marina grande of sorrento in an hour at the latter beach boats were always to be found and two hours more would carry the messenger by water to the ships off capri even in a calm the first of these important hours had now elapsed some time and he could not doubt that vigorous aims were already employed in pulling across the few leagues of water that separated the island from the shores of sorrento the day was calm it is true and it would be impossible to move the ships but two frigates and a heavy sloopofwar might send such a force against him in boats as in his present situation would render resistance next to hopeless  raoul ceased eating and standing on the taffrail he cast anxious looks around him his sturdy followers ignorant of all the dangers by which they were environed were consuming their mornings meal with the characteristic indifference to danger that marks the ordinary conduct of seamen even ithuel usually so sensitive on the subject of english power and who had really so much to apprehend should he again fall into the hands of the proserpines was masticating his food with the keen relish of a man who had been hard at work the whole morning all appeared unconscious of their critical condition and to raoul it seemed as if the entire responsibility rested on his own shoulders fortunately he was not a man to shrink from his present duties and he occupied the only leisure moment that would be likely to offer that day in deliberating on his resources and in maturing his plans  the armament still remained in the lugger but it was doubtful if she would float without removing it and admitting this necessity the question arose of what was to be done with it in order to render it available in the event of an attack two or even four of the light guns might be worked on the decks of the felucca and here he determined they should be immediately placed with a proper supply of cartridges and shot twenty men thrown into that light craft which ithuel reported as sailing and sweeping well might prove of the last importance then one of the islets had a ruin on it of what was believed to be an ancient temple it is true these ruins were insignificant and scarcely visible at any distance but on a close examination and by using some of the displaced stones with judgment it was possible to entrench a party behind them and make a stout resistance against light missiles or such as boats would most probably use raoul got into the yawl and sculled himself to this spot examining the capabilities with care and judgment after this his mode of proceeding was matured to his own satisfaction  the usual time had been consumed and the hands were turned to each officer receiving the orders necessary to the discharge of the duty confided to his particular superintendence as ithuel had captured the felucca raoul felt it right to intrust him with the command of the prize he was directed to take on board the armament and ammunition necessary to a defence to mount the guns in the best manner he could and to make all the other fighting preparations while another gang struck into the feluccas hold such articles from the lugger as it was desirable to save  another party under the first lieutenant landed the remainder of the light carronades pieces of twelve pounds only with the proper stores and commenced the arrangements to place them in battery among the ruins a small supply of food and water was also transferred to this islet  while these dispositions were in progress raoul himself assisted by his sailingmaster prepared to heave the lugger off the rocks to this at present the most important duty our hero gave his personal inspection for it required skill judgment and caution the physical force of the crew was reserved to aid in the attempt at length everything was ready and the instant had arrived when the momentous trial was to be made the lugger had now been ashore quite four hours and the sun had been up fully three by this time raoul calculated that the english at capri knew of his misfortune and little leisure remained in which to do a vast deal of work the hands were all summoned to the bars therefore and the toil of heaving commenced  as soon as the cable got the strain raoul felt satisfied that the anchor would hold fortunately a fluke had taken a rock a circumstance that could be known only by the result but so long as the iron held together there was no danger of that material agents failing them the last part of the process of lightening was now performed as rapidly as possible and then came the trialheave at the bars every effort was fruitless however inch being gained after inch until it seemed as if the hemp of the cable were extending its minutest fibres without the hulls moving any more than the rocks on which it lay even the boys were called to the bars but the united force of all hands the officers included produced no change there was an instant when raoul fancied his best course would be to set fire to the hulk get on board the felucca and sweep off to the southward in season to avoid the expected visit from the english he even called his officers together and laid the proposition before them but the project was too feebly urged and it met with too little response in the breasts of his auditors to be successful the idea of abandoning that beautiful and faultless little craft was too painful while the remotest hope of preserving it remained  raoul had measured his hours with the accuracy of a prudent general it was now almost time for the english boats to appear and he began to hope that the neapolitans had made the great mistake of sending their information to the fleet off naples rather than carrying it to the ships at capri should it prove so he had still the day before him and might retire under cover of the night at all events the lugger could not be abandoned without an enemy in sight and the people were again called to the bars for a renewed effort as water might be obtained at a hundred points on the coast and the distance to corsica was so small the last gallon had been started and pumped out during the recent pause  our hero felt that this was the final effort the hold of le feufollet was literally empty and all her spare spars were floating among the rocks if she could not be started now he did not possess the means to get her off the anchor held the cable though stretched to the utmost stood and every creature but himself was at the bars the groundswell had been lessening all the morning and little aid was now to be had from the rising of the water still that little must be obtained without it the task seemed hopeless  get ready men cried raoul as he paced the taffrail and heave at the word we will wait for a swell then strain every nerve till something part pas encore mes enfanspas encore stand byyonder comes a fellow who will lift usheave a strainheave harderheave body and soulheave altogether  the men obeyed first they hove a gentle strain then the effort was increased and obedient to the order just as the groundswell rolled under the luggers bottom they threw out their utmost strength and the hull started for the first time this was encouraging though the movement did not exceed six inches it was a decided movement and was made in the right direction this success nerved the people to an increased effort it was probable that at the next strain they would throw a tenth more impetus into their muscles of all this raoul was aware and he determined not to let the feeling flag  encore mes enfans he said heave and get ready be watchfulnows your time heave and rip the planks off the luggers bottomheave men heave  this time the effort answered the emergency the swell rolled in the men threw out their strength a surge was felt it was followed up by a strain and le feufollet shot off her bed into deep water rolling for want of ballast nearly to her hammockcloths she soon lay directly over her anchor  here was successtriumphant success and that at a moment when the most sanguine had begun to despair the men embraced each other showing a hundred manifestations of extravagant joy the tears came to raouls eyes but he had no opportunity to concealing them every officer he had pressing around him to exchange felicitations the scene was one of happy disorder it had lasted two or three minutes when ithuel always cold and calculating edged his way through the throng to his commanders side and pointed significantly in the direction of campanella there indeed was visible a division of the expected boats it was pulling toward them having that moment doubled the cape  ithuels gesture was too significant to escape attention and every eye followed its direction the sight was of a nature not to be mistaken it at once changed the current of feeling in all who beheld it there was no longer a doubt concerning the manner in which the news of the accident had travelled or of its effect on the english at capri in point of fact the padrone of the captured felucca with a sole eye to the recovery of his vessel had ascended the scaricatojo after landing at the marinella at its foot as fast as his legs could carry him had rather run than glided along the narrow lanes of the piano and the hillside to the beach of sorrento had thrown himself into a boat manned by four lusty sorrentine watermenand europe does not contain lustier or bolder had gone on board the terpsichore and laid his case before sir frederick dashwood ignorant of the person of the real commanding officer among the three ships the young baronet though neither very wise nor very much experienced in his profession was exceedingly well disposed to seek distinction it immediately occurred to his mind that the present was a fitting opportunity to gain laurels he was second in rank present and in virtue of that claim he fancied that the first could do no more than send him in command of the expedition which he rightly foresaw cuffe would order against the french but there arose a difficulty as soon as sir frederick reported the nature of the intelligence he had received to his senior captain and his own wish to be employed on the occasion the rights of winchester interposed to raise a question cuffe was prompt enough in issuing an order for each ship to man and arm two boats making six in all and in giving the necessary details but he lost some precious time in deciding who was to command this was the cause of delay and had given rise to certain hopes in raoul that facts were subsequently to destroy in the end sir frederick prevailed his rank giving him a decided advantage and the division of boats that was now approaching was under his orders  raoul saw he had rather more than an hour to spare to fight the felucca unsupported against so many enemies and that in a calm was quite out of the question that small low craft might destroy a few of her assailants but she would inevitably be carried at the first onset there was not time to get the ballast and other equipments into the lugger so as to render her capable of a proper resistance nor did even she offer the same advantages for a defence unless in quick motion as the ruins it was determined therefore to make the best disposition of the two vessels that circumstances would allow while the main dependence should be placed on the solid defences of stone with this end ithuel was directed to haul his felucca to a proper berth the first lieutenant was ordered to get as much on board le feufollet as possible in readiness to profit by events while raoul himself selecting thirty of his best men commenced preparing the guns on the rocks for active service  a single halfhour wrought a material change in the state of things ithuel had succeeded in hauling the felucca into a berth among the islets where she could not easily be approached by boats and where her carronades might be rendered exceedingly useful much of the ballast was again on board the lugger and a few of her stores sufficient to render her tolerably stiff in the event of a breeze springing up and raoul had directed the two inside guns of the felucca to be sent on board her and mounted that she might assist in the defence with a flanking fire the great difficulty which exists in managing a force at anchor is the opportunity that is given the assailant of choosing his point of attack and by bringing several of the vessels in a line cause them to intercept each others fire in order to prevent this as much as in his power raoul placed his two floatingbatteries out of line though it was impossible to make such a disposition of them as would not leave each exposed on one point of attack in a degree greater than any other nevertheless the arrangement was so made that either a vessel or the ruins might aid each craft respectively against the assault on her weakest point  when his own guns were ready and the two vessels moored raoul visited both the lugger and felucca to inspect their preparations and to say a cheerful word to their men he found most things to his mind where they were not he ordered changes to be made with the lieutenant his conversation was brief for that officer was one who possessed much experience in this very sort of warfare and could be relied on with ithuel he was more communicative not that he distrusted the citizen of the granite state but that he knew him to be a man of unusual resources could the proper spirit be aroused within him  bien etooelle he said when the inspection was ended much will depend on the use you make of these two guns  i know that as well as you do yourself captain rule answered the other biting off at least two inches from half a yard of pigtail and whats more i know that i fight with a rope round my neck the spiteful devils will hardly overlook all thats passed and though it will be dead agin all law theyll work out their eends on us both if we dont work out our eends on them to my mind the last will be the most agreeable as well as the most just  bondo not throw away your shot etooelle  iwhy captain rule im natrally economical that would be wasteful and waste i set down for a sin the only place i calculate on throwing the shot is into the face and eyes of the english for my part i wish nelson himself was in one of them boatsi wish the man no harm but i do wish he was in one of them very boats  and etooelle i do not it is bad enough as it is entre nous and nelson is very welcome to stay on board his foudroyant voil√†the enemy is in council we shall soon hear from them adieu mon ami remember our two r√©publiques  raoul squeezed ithuels hand and entered his boat the distance to the ruin was trifling but it was necessary to make a small circuit in order to reach it while doing this the young mariner discovered a boat pulling from the direction of the marinella at the foot of the scaricatojo which had got so near unseen as at first to startle him by its proximity a second look however satisfied him that no cause of apprehension existed in that quarter his eye could not be deceived the boat contained ghita and her uncle the latter rowing and the former seated in the stern with her head bowed to her knees apparently in tears raoul was alone sculling the light yawl with a single hand and he exerted himself to meet these unexpected and in the circumstances unwelcome visitors as far as possible from the rocks presently the two boats lay side by side  what means this ghita the young man exclaimed do you not see the english yonder at this moment making their preparations to attack us in a few minutes we shall be in the midst of a battle and thou here  i see it all now raoul was the answer though we did not on quitting the shore but we would not turn back having once come upon the bay i was the first in st agata to discover the evil that had befallen thee from that moment i have never ceased to entreat my uncle until he has consented to come hither  with what motive ghita asked raoul with sparkling eyesat length thou relentestwilt become my wife in my adversity thou rememberest thou art a woman  not exactly that dear raoul but i cannot desert thee altogether in this strait the same objection exists now i fear that has ever existed to our union but that is no reason i should not aid thee we have many friends along the heights here who will consent to conceal thee and i have come to carry thee and the american to the shore until an opportunity offer to get thee to thine own france  what desert ces braves ghita at a moment like thisnot to possess thy hand dearest girl could i be guilty of an act so base  thy situation is not theirs the condemnation to death hangs over thee raoul shouldst thou again fall into english hands there will be no mercy for thee  assezthis is no moment for argument the english are in motion and there is barely time for thee to get to a safe distance ere they begin to fire heaven bless thee ghita this care of thine draws my heart to thee closer than ever but we must now separate signor giuntotardi pull more toward amalfi i see that the english mean to attack us from the side of the landpull more toward amalfi  thou tellest us this in vain raoul ghita quietly but firmly answered we have not come here on an unmeaning errandif thou refusest to go with us we will remain with thee these prayers that thou so despisest may not prove useless  ghitathis can never be we are without coveralmost without defencesour vessel is unfit to receive thee and this affair will be very different from that off elba thou wouldst not willingly distract my mind with care for thee at such a moment  we will remain raoul there may come a moment when thou wilt be glad to have the prayers of believers god leadeth us hither either to take thee away or to remain and look to thy eternal welfare amid the din of war  raoul gazed at the beautiful enthusiast with an intensity of love and admiration that even her truthful simplicity had never before excited her mild eyes were kindling with holy ardor her cheeks were flushed and something like the radiance of heaven seemed to beam upon her countenance the young man felt that time pressed he saw no hope of overcoming her resolution in season to escape the approaching boats and it might be that the two would be safer in some nook of the ruins than in attempting to return to the shore then that neverdying but latent wish to have ghita with him aided his hasty reasoning and he decided to permit the girl and her uncle to come upon the islet that he was to defend in person  some signs of impatience had begun to manifest themselves among his people ere raoul made up his mind to the course he would follow but when he landed supporting ghita that chivalry of character and homage to the sex which distinguish the southern frenchman changed the current of feeling and their two acquaintances were received with acclamation the act of selfdevotion seemed heroic and that it always enough to draw applause among a people so keenly alive to glory still the time to make the necessary dispositions was short fortunately the surgeon had taken his post on this islet as the probably scene of the warmest conflict and he had contrived to make his preparations to receive the hurt in a cavity of the rock behind a portion of the ruin where the person would be reasonably safe raoul saw the advantages of this position and he led ghita and her uncle to it without pausing to deliberate here he tenderly embraced the girl a liberty ghita could not repel at such a moment then he tore himself away to attend to duties which had now become urgently pressing  in point of fact sir frederick dashwood had made his disposition and was advancing to the assault being already within the range of grape for the obvious reason of preventing the french from attempting to escape to the shore he chose to approach from that side himselfan arrangement that best suited raoul who foreseeing the probability of the course had made his own preparations with an eye to such an event  of boats there were eight in sight though only seven were drawing near and were in line six had strong crews were armed and were evidently fitted for action of these three had light boatguns in their bows while the other three carried smallarmsmen only the seventh boat was the terpsichores gig with its usual crew armed though it was used by the commanding officer himself as a sort of cheval de bataille in the stricter meaning of the term in other words sir frederick dashwood pulled through the line in it to give his orders and encourage his people the eighth boat which kept aloof quite out of the range of grape was a shore craft belonging to capri in which andrea barrofaldi and vito viti had come expressly to witness the capture or destruction of their old enemy when raoul was taken in the bay of naples these two worthies fancied that their mission was endedthat they might return with credit to porto ferrajo and again hold up their heads with dignity and selfcomplacency among the functionaries of the island but the recent escape and the manner in which they had been connected with it entirely altered the state of things a new load of responsibility rested on their shoulders fresh opprobrium was to be met and put down and the last acquisition of ridicule promised to throw the first proofs of their simplicity and dulness entirely into the shade had not griffin and his associates been implicated in the affair it is probable the vicegovernatore and the podest√† would have been still more obnoxious to censure but as things were the sly looks open jests and oblique innuendoes of all they met in the ship had determined the honest magistrates to retire to their proper pursuits on terra firma at the earliest occasion in the mean time to escape persecution and to obtain a modicum of the glory that was now to be earned they had hired a boat and accompanied the expedition in the character of amateurs it formed no part of their plan however to share in the combat a view of its incidents being quite as much as vito viti strongly maintained when his friend made a suggestion to the contrary as was necessary to vindicate their conduct and courage in the judgment of every elban  cospetto he exclaimed in the warmth of oppositionsignor andrea your propositions are more in the spirit of an unreflecting boy than in that of a discreet vicegovernatore if we take swords and muskets into the boat as you appear to wish the devil may tempt us to use them and what does either of us know of such things the pen is a more befitting weapon for a magistrate than a keenedged sword or a foulsmelling piece of firearms i am amazed that your native sensibilities do not teach you this there is an indecency in mens mistaking their duties and of all things on earth heaven protect me from falling into such an error a false position is despicable  thou art warm friend vito and that without occasion for my part i think men should be prepared for any emergency that may happen history is full of examples in which civilians and scholarsaye even churchmenhave distinguished themselves by feats of arms on proper occasions and i confess to a philosophical curiosity to ascertain the sensations with which men seek and expose life  thats your besetting weakness signor andrea and the emergency drives me so far to lose sight of the respect that a podest√† owes to a vicegovernatore as to feel constrained to tell you as much philosophy plays the very devil with your judgment with about half of what you possess the grand duke couldnt boast of a more sensible subject as for history i dont believe anything thats in it more especially since the nations of the north have begun to write it italy once had histories but where are they now for my part i never heard of a mans fighting who was not regularly bred to arms unless it might be some fellow who had reason to wish he had never been born  i can name you several men of letters in particular whose fame as soldiers is only eclipsed by that earned by their more peaceful labors honest vito michael angelo buonarotti for instance to say nothing of various warlike popes cardinals and bishops but we can discuss this matter after the battle is over thou seest the english are already quitting their ships and we shall be in the rear of the combatants  so much the better corpo di bacco who ever heard of an army that carries its brains in its head like a human being no no signor andrea i have provided myself with a string of beads which i intend to count over with aves and paters while the firing lasts like a good catholic if you are so hot and bent on making one in this battle you may proclaim in a loud voice one of the speeches of the ancient consuls and generals such as you will find them in any of the old books  vito viti prevailed the vicegovernatore was obliged to leave the arms behind him and this too without making any great difference in the result of the days fighting inasmuch as the boatmen employed in addition to asking a triple price for their time and labor obstinately refused to go nearer to the french than half a league distant as this was however raoul while reconnoitring the enemy with a glass detected the presence of the two elbans he laughed outright at the discovery notwithstanding the many serious reflections that naturally pressed upon his mind at such a moment  but this was not the time to indulge in merriment and the countenance of our hero almost immediately resumed its look of care now that he felt certain of the manner in which the english intended to assail him he had new orders to give to all his subordinates as has been said the principal point was to make the different guns support each other in order to do this effectually it became necessary to spring the luggers broadside round more obliquely toward the felucca which accomplished raoul deemed his arrangements complete  then followed the pause which ordinarily prevails between preparation and the battle this in a vessel is always a period of profound and solemn stillness so important to concert order and intelligent obedience in the narrow compass and amid the active evolutions of a ship does silence become at such moments that one of the first duties of discipline is to inculcate its absolute necessity and a thousand men shall be seen standing in their batteries ready to serve the fierce engines of war without a sound arising among them all of sufficient force to still the washing of the gentlest waves it is true the french were not now strictly arrayed for a naval action but they carried into the present conflict the habits and discipline of the peculiar branch of service to which they belonged      chapter xxviii       his back against a rock he bore      and firmly placed his foot before      come one come all this rock shall fly      from its firm base as soon as i       lady of the lake  our battle will be told with greater clearness if the reader is furnished with an outline of its order as has been more than once intimated already sir frederick dashwood had made all his preparations to commence the assault from the side of the land the object being to prevent a retreat to the shore raoul had foreseen the probability of this and with a special view to prevent the two vessels from being easily boarded he had caused both to be placed in such positions as left low barriers of rocks between them and that quarter of the bay these rocks were portions that were not visible at any distance being just awash as it is termed or on a level with the surface of the water offering the same sort of protection against an attack in boats that ditches afford in cases of assaults on terr√¢ firm√¢ this was a material advantage to the expected defence and our hero showed his discrimination in adopting it on board the felucca which was named the holy michael was ithuel with fifteen men and two twelvepound carronades with a proper supply of smallarms and ammunition the graniteman was the only officer though he had with him three or four of the luggers best men  le feufollet was confided to the care of jules pintard her first lieutenant who had under his immediate orders some fiveandtwenty of the crew to work four more of the carronades the lugger had a part only of her ballast in and something like a third of her stores the remainder of both still lay on the adjacent rocks in waiting for the result of the day she was thought however to be sufficiently steady for any service that might be expected of her while moored and might even have carried whole sail in light winds with perfect safety all four of her guns were brought over on one side in readiness to use in battery in the same direction by this arrangement the french essentially increased their means of defence bringing all their artillery into use at the same timean expedient that could not have been adopted had they been fought in broadside  raoul had planted among the ruins the remaining four guns with the aid of a few planks the breechings tackles and other appliances of a vessel this had been easily effected and on reviewing his work he had great confidence in the permanency of his pieces the ruins themselves were no great matter at a little distance they were scarcely perceptible though aided by the formation of the natural rock and by removing some of the stones to more favorable positions they answered the purpose of the seamen sufficiently well the carronades were placed en barbette but a falling of the surface of the rock enabled the men to cover even their heads by stepping back a few feet the danger would be much the greatest to those whose duty it would be to reload  the surgeon carlo giuntotardi and ghita were established in a cavity of the rocks perfectly protected against missiles so long as the enemy continued on the side next the land and yet within fifty feet of the battery here the former made the usual bloodylooking if not bloodyminded preparations for applying tourniquets and for amputating all unheeded however by his two companions both of whom were lost to the scene around them in devout prayer  just as these several dispositions were completed ithuel who ever kept an eye to windward called out to raoul and inquired if it might not be well to run the yards up to the mastheads as they would be more out of the way in their places aloft than littering the decks there was no possible objection to the measure it being a dead calm and both the lugger and the felucca swayed their yards into their places the sails being bent and hanging in the brails this is the ordinary state of craft of the latter rig though not always that of luggers and the graniteman mindful that his own gear was down in consequence of having been lowered by her former owners previously to the capture bethought him of the expediency of getting everything ready for a run he wished the lugger to be in an equal state of preparation it being plain enough that two to be pursued would embarrass the english in a chase twice as much as one this was the reason of his suggestion and he felt happier for seeing it attended to  on the other side all preliminary difficulties had been disposed of captain sir frederick dashwood was in command and lieutenants winchester and griffin after a few open protestations certain grimaces and divers secret curses were fain to submit the discussion however had produced one result not altogether unfavorable to the proserpines cuffe sent four of her boats against the enemy while he restricted the terpsichore to two including her gig and the ringdove to two each ship sent her launch as a matter of course with a twelvepound boatgun on its grating winchester was in that of the proserpine mr stothard the second of the other frigate was in the terpsichores and mcbean as of right commanded the ringdoves griffin was in the first cutter of his own ship and clinch had charge of the second the third was headed by strand whose call was to have precedence on the occasion the other boats had subordinates from their respective ships all were in good heart and while all expected a severe struggle for her knowing the desperate character of their enemy every man in the boats felt confident that the lugger was finally to fall into british hands still a grave consideration of the possible consequences to the actors mingled with the exultation of the more reflecting men among the assailants  sir frederick dashwood who ought to have felt the moral responsibility of his command of all the higher officers present was the most indifferent to consequences constitutionally brave personal considerations had little influence on him habitually confident of english prowess he expected victory and credit as a matter of course and favored by birth fortune and parliamentary interest he gave himself no trouble as to the possibility of a failure certain though not avowing that certainty even to himself that any little mishap would be covered by the broad mantle of the accident that had so early raised him to the rank he held  in making his dispositions for the fight however sir frederick had not disdained the counsels of men older and more experienced than himself cuffe had given him much good advice before they parted and winchester and strand had been particularly recommended to him as seamen whose suggestions might turn out to be useful  i send a mastersmate named clinch in charge of one of our boats too dashwood added the senior captain as he concluded his remarks who is one of the most experienced seamen in the proserpine he has seen much boatservice and has always behaved himself well a vile practice of drinking has kept the poor fellow under but he is now determined to make an effort and i beg you will put him forward today that he may have a chance jack clinch has the right sort of stuff in him if opportunities offer to bring it out  i flatter myself cuffe that all hands will meet with opportunity enough answered sir frederick in his drawling way for i intend to put em all in together like a thorough pack coming in at the death ive seen lord echos harriers so close at the end of a long chase that you might have covered the whole with this ships maincourse and i intend it shall be so with our boats today by the way cuffe that would be a pretty figure for a despatch and would make bronte smilehawouldnt it  dn the figure the harriers and the despatch too dashwood first win the day before you begin to write poetry about it bronte as you call nelson has lightning in him as well as thunder and there isnt an admiral in the service who cares less for blood and private rank than himself the way to make him smile is to do a thing neatly and well for gods sake now be careful of the menwe are shorthanded as it is and cant afford such another scrape as that off porto ferrajo  never fear for us cuffe youll never miss the men i shall expend  every captain had a word to say to his officers but none other worth recording with the exception of what passed between lyon and his first lieutenant  yell remember airchy that a ship can have a reputation for economy as well as a man theres several of our own countrymen about the admiralty just now and next to courage and enterprise they view the expenditures with the keenest eyes ive known an admiral reach a red ribbon just on that one quality his accounts showing cheaper ships and cheaper squadrons than any in the sairvice yell all do your duties for the honor o scotland but theres six or seven leith and glasgow lads in the boats that it may be as well not to let murder themselves out of a need ive put the whole of the last draft from the river guardship into the boats and with them theres no great occasion to be tender theyre the sweepings of the thames and wapping and quite half of them would have been at botany bay before this had they not been sent here  does the law about being in sight apply to the boats or to the ships the day captain lyon  to the boats man or who the deil do you think would sairve in them its a pitiful affair altogether as it has turned out the honor being little more than the profit i opine and yet twill never do to let old scotia lag astairn in a handtohand battle yell remember we have a name for coming to the claymore and so do yer best every mithers son o ye  mcbean grunted assent and went about his work as methodically as if it were a sum in algebra the second lieutenant of the terpsichore was a young irishman with a sweet musical voice and as the boats left the ships he was with difficulty kept in the line straining to move ahead with his face on a grin and his cheers stimulating the men to undue or unreasonable efforts such is an outline of the english materials on this occasion both parties being now ready for the struggle if we add that it was already past two and that all hands began to feel some anxiety on the score of the wind which might soon be expected the preliminary picture is sufficiently sketched  sir frederick dashwood had formed his line about a mile within the rocks with one launch in the centre and one on each extremity that in the centre was commanded by oleary his own second lieutenant that on the left of his force by mcbean and the one on its right by winchester oleary was tanked by griffin and clinch in the proserpines cutters while the intervals were filled by the remaining boats the captain kept moving about in his own gig giving his directions somewhat confusedly beyond a question yet with a cheerfulness and indifference of air that aided in keeping alive the general gait√© de coeur when all was ready he gave the signal to advance pulling for the first half mile chivalrously in advance of the line with his own gig  raoul had noted the smallest movement of the enemy with a glass and with grave attention nothing escaped his jealous watchfulness and he saw that sir frederick had made a capital error in the outset had he strengthened his centre by putting all his carronades in the same battery as it might be the chances for success would have been doubled but by dividing them he so far weakened their effect as to render it certain no one of the three french batteries could be wholly crippled by their fire this of course left the difficult task to the english of pushing up to their handtohand work under the embarrassment of receiving constant discharges of grape and canister  the few minutes that intervened between the order to advance and the moment when the boats got within a quarter of a mile of the rock were passed in a profound quiet neither side making any noise though raoul had no small difficulty in restraining the constitutional impatience of his own men to begin a boat presents so small an object however to artillerists as little skilled as seamen generally are who depend more on general calculations than on the direct or scientific aim the latter being usually defeated by the motion of their vessels that he was unwilling to throw away even his canister a frenchman himself however he could refrain no longer and he pointed a carronade firing it with his own hand this was the commencement of the strife all the other guns in the ruin followed and the lugger kept time as it might be by note the english rose gave three cheers and each launch discharged her gun at the same instant the two men who held the matches in the felucca applied them briskly to the vents of their respective pieces to their surprise neither exploded and on examination it was discovered that the priming had vanished to own the truth he of the granite state had slyly brushed his hand over the guns and robbed them of this great essential of their force he held the priminghorns in his own hands and resolutely refused to allow them to pass into those of any other person  it was fortunate ithuel was known to be such a determined hater of the english else might his life have been the forfeit of this seeming act of treachery but he meditated no such dereliction of duty perfectly aware of the impossiblity of preventing his men from firing did they possess the means this deliberate and calculating personage had resorted to this expedient to reserve his own effort until in his judgment it might prove the most available his men murmured but too much excited to deliberate they poured in a discharge of musketry as the only means of annoying the enemy then left them even raoul glanced aside a little wondering at not hearing the feluccas carronades but perceiving her people busy with their firearms he believed all right  the first discharge in such an affair is usually the most destructive on the present occasion the firing was not without serious effects the english much the most exposed suffered in proportion four men were hurt in winchesters boat two in griffins six or eight men in the other launches and cutters and one of sir fredericks gigmen was shot through the hearta circumstance which induced that officer to drop alongside of a cutter and exchange the dead body for a living man  on the rocks but one man was injured a roundshot had hit a stone shivered it in fragments and struck down a valuable seaman just as he was advancing with a gallant mien to sponge one of the guns  poor josef said raoul as he witnessed the mans fall carry him to the surgeon mes braves  mon capitaine josef is dead  this decided the matter and the body was laid aside while another stepped forward and sponged the gun at that moment raoul found leisure to walk a yard or two toward the rear in order to ascertain if the cover of ghita were sufficient the girl was on her knees lost to all around her though could he have read her heart he would have found it divided between entreaties to the deity and love for himself  the lugger sustained no harm oleary had overshot her in his desire to make his missiles reach not even a canister had lodged in her spars or torn her sails the usual luck appeared to attend her and the people on board fought with renewed confidence and zeal not so with the felucca however here the fire of the english had been the most destructive the wary and calculating mcbean had given his attention to this portion of the french defences and the consequences partook of the sagacity and discretion of the man a charge of canister had swept across the feluccas decks more than decimating ithuels small force for it actually killed one and wounded three of his party  but the din once commenced there was no leisure to pause the fire was kept up with animation on both sides and men fell rapidly the boats cheered and pressed ahead the water becoming covered with a wide sheet of smoke  in moments like this the safest course for the assailants is to push on this the english did firing and cheering at every fathom they advanced but suffering also the constant discharge of the carronades and the total absence of wind soon caused a body of smoke to collect in front of the rock while the english brought on with them another trailing along the water the effect of their own fire the two shrouds soon united and then there was a minute when the boats could only be seen with indistinctness this was ithuels moment perceiving that the ten or twelve men who remained to him were engrossed with their muskets he pointed the two carronades himself and primed them from the horns which he had never quitted for the felucca he felt no present concern winchester and all the boats in the centre of the english line were most in advance the fire of the ruins urging them to the greatest exertion then mcbean besides being more distant could not cross the rock in front of the felucca without making a circuit and he must as yet be ignorant of the existence of the impediment ithuel was cool and calculating by nature as well as by habit but this immunity from present risk probably increased the immediate possession of qualities so important in battle his carronades were loaded to their muzzles with bags of bullets and he beckoned to the best seaman of his party to take one of the matches while he used the other himself each holding a monkeystail in one hand in readiness to train the light gun as circumstances required the pieces had been depressed by ithuel himself in the midst of the fray and nothing remained but to wait the moment for using them  this moment was now near the object of the english was to land on the principal islet and to carry the ruin by storm in order to do this all the boats of their centre converged in their courses to the same point and the smoke being driven off by each concussion of the guns a dark cluster of the enemy diverged from the ragged outline of the vapor within fifty yards of the intended point of landing ithuel and his companion were ready together they sighted and together they fired this unexpected discharge from a quarter that had been so comparatively silent surprised both friends and foes and it drove a fresh mantle of smoke momentarily athwart the rock and the open space in its front  a cry arose from the dense shroud of battle that differed from the shouts of success and courage physical agony had extorted shrieks from the stoutest hearts and even the french in the ruins paused to look for the next act of the desperate drama raoul seized the opportunity to prepare for the expected handtohand struggle but it was unnecessary the cessation in the firing was common in both parties and it gave the vapor a minute in which to lift the curtain from the water  when the late obstacle was raised high enough to admit of a view the result became evident all the english boats but one had scattered and were pulling swiftly in different directions from the scene of slaughter by taking this course they diverted and divided the fire of the enemies an expedient of which it would have been happier had they bethought them earlier the remaining boat was a cutter of the terpsichore it had received the weight of canister from ithuels own gun and of sixteen men it had contained when it left the frigates side but two escaped these fellows had thrown themselves into the sea and were picked up by passing boats the cutter itself came drifting slowly in toward the rock announcing the nature of its fearful cargo by the groans and cries that arose from out its bosom raoul stopped the fire equally from humanity and policy after a few discharges at the retreating boats and the first act of the battle closed  the breathing time gave both parties a desirable opportunity for ascertaining in what positions they were left in the whole the french had lost the services of eleven men all with the exception of ithuels four in the ruin the loss of the english amounted to thirtythree including several officers the masters mate who had commanded the crippled cutter lay over its stern flat on his back with no less than five musketballs through his chest his passage into another state of existence had been sudden as the flight of the electric spark of his late companions several were dead also though most were still enduring the pain of fractured bones and bruised nerves the boat itself slowly touched the rocks raising fresh cries among the wounded by the agony they endured from the shocks of rising and falling under the groundswell  raoul was too deliberate and too much collected not to feel his advantage anxious to keep his means of further defence in the best condition he directed all the guns to cease and the damages to be repaired then he went with a party toward the boat that had fallen into his hands to encumber himself with prisoners of any sort in his actual situation would have been a capital mistake but to do this with wounded men would have been an act of folly the boat had tourniquets and other similar appliances in it and he directed some of the french to use them on those that wanted them most he also supplied the parched lips of the sufferers with water when conceiving that his duty was performed he gave an order to haul the boat on one side and to shove it forcibly out of the line of any coming conflict  halloo captain rule called out ithuel you are wrong there let the boat lie where it is and it will answer a better turn than another breastwork the english will scarcely fire through their own wounded  the look that raoul cast toward his auxiliary was fierceeven indignant but disregarding the advice he motioned for his own men to obey the order he had already given them then as if mindful of ithuels importance his late timely succor and the necessity of not offending him he walked to the side of the islet nearest to the felucca and spoke courteously and cheerfully to him whose advice he had just treated with indifference if not with disdain this was not hypocrisy but a prudent adaptation of his means to his circumstances  bon brave etooelle he said your bags of bullets were welcome friends and they arrived at the right moment  why captain rule in the granite country we are never wasteful of our means you can always wait for the white of englishmens eyes in these affairs theyre spiteful devils on the whull and seem to be nearsighted to a man they came so clus at bunker hill our folks  bon repeated raoul feeling no wish to hear a thricetold tale gone through again bunker hill invariably placing ithuel on a great horse in the way of bragging for he not only imagined that great victory a new england triumph as in fact it was but he was much disposed to encourage the opinion that it was in a great measure granite bon interrupted raoulbunkair was goodmais les roches aux sirens is bettair if you have more de ces bulles load encore  what think you of this captain rule asked the other pointing up at a little vane that began to flutter at the head of one of his masts here is the west wind and an opportunity offers to be off let us take wit and run  raoul started and gazed at the heavens the vane and the surface of the sea the latter beginning to show a slightly ruffled surf ace then his eye wandered toward ghita the girl had risen from her knees and her eyes followed his every movement when they met his with a sweet imploring smile she pointed upward as if beseeching him to pay the debt of gratitude he owed to that dread being who had as yet borne him unharmed through the fray he understood her meaning kissed his hand in affectionate gallantry and turned toward ithuel to pursue the discourse  it is too soon he said we are impregnable here and the wind is still too light an hour hence and we will all go together  ithuel grumbled but his commander heeded it not the judgment of the latter had decided right the boats were rallying within musketshot indifferent to the danger and it was evident the attack was to be renewed to have attempted to escape at such an instant would have been throwing away the great advantage of the ruins and might have endangered all without benefiting any one  in point of fact sir frederick dashwood had become keenly alive to a sense of the disgrace he was likely to incur in the event of the ships getting round and robbing him of the credit of capturing the lugger the usually apathetic nature of this young man was thoroughly aroused and like all who are difficult to excite he became respectable when his energies were awakened the boats were already collected all the disabled were put into one of them and ordered off to the ships and with those that remained arrangements were made to renew the attempt it was fortunate that cuffe had sent an expedition so stronghanded for notwithstanding the loss the three launches and the cutters could still muster double the number of the french  this time sir frederick was willing to listen to counsel winchester mcbean griffin and strand united in advising that the boats should separate and make their assaults from different points this would prevent the possibility of a recurrence of so concentrated a disaster as that which had already befallen them to the scotchman was assigned the felucca the terpsichores launch was to assail the lugger while the two cutters and the heavier boat of the proserpine were to dash in at the ruins sir frederick still remained in his own gig to push for the point that might seem to require his presence  mcbean was the first to fire on this occasion he threw a roundshot from his carronade into the felucca aimed by himself and directed with care it fell upon one of ithuels carronades broke it into a dozen pieces knocked down no less than three men besides injuring others less severely and actually drove the gun it struck off its slide into the feluccas hold this was a rough commencement and the result being seen by all hands it greatly encouraged the assailants three hearty english cheers followed and ithuel was so far disconcerted as to fire the remaining gun loaded as before with bullets at least two minutes too soon the sea was thrown into a foam but not a man in the boats was hurt then the fire became general gun after gun exploding the rattling of smallarms filling up the pauses the boats came on with steady strong pulls of the oar and this too with an impunity that often happens though difficult to be explained several shot fell among the ruins knocking the stones about and for a minute or two all the injury was on one side but pintard and ithuel felt the security conferred by the rocks in their front and each endeavored to give one effective discharge ithuel succeeded the best he repaid mcbean in his own coin sending a grist of bullets into the bows of his launch which admonished that prudent officer of the necessity of shearing toward the islet of the ruins pintards assailant was brought up by the barrier in front and turned aside also then in the midst of a cloud of smoke shouts curses cries shrieks orders and the roar of guns all the english precipitated themselves in a body on the principal post and became the masters of the battery in the twinkling of an eye    chapter xxix       thus doth the everchanging course of thing      run a perpetual circle ever turning      and that same day that highest glory brings      brings us to the point of back returning       daniel  in scenes like that just related it is not easy to collect details all that was ever known beyond the impetuous manner of the assault in which the ruins were carried was in the dire result half the french on the islet were weltering in their blood and the surface of the rocks was well sprinkled with enemies who had not been more fortunate it had been a desperate onset in which mortification increased natural intrepidity which had been nobly resisted but in which numbers had necessarily prevailed among the english slain was sir frederick dashwood himself he lay about a yard from his own gig with a ball directly through his head griffin was seriously hurt but clinch was untouched on the low rampart waving an english jackafter having hauled down a similar emblem of the french his boat had first touched the rock her crew had first reached the ruin and of all in her he himself had taken the lead desperately had he contended for jane and a commission and this time providence appeared to smile on his efforts as for raoul he lay in front of his own rampart having rushed forward to meet the party of clinch and had actually crossed swords with his late prisoner when a musketball fired by the hands of mcbean traversed his body  courage mes braves en avant he was heard to shout as he leaped the low wall to repel the invadersand when he lay on the hard rock his voice was still strong enough to make itself heard cryinglieutenantnom de dieusauve mon feufollet  it is probable that pintard would not have stirred even at this order had not the english ships been seen at that instant coming round campanella with a leading westerly wind the flap of canvas was audible near by too and turning he saw the michael falling off under her foresail and already gathering steerageway not a soul was visible on her decks ithuel who steered lying so close as to be hid by her waistcloths the hawsers of the lugger were cut and le feufollet started back like an affrighted steed it was only to let go the brails and her foresail fell light and feeling the breeze which now came in strong puffs she shot out of the little bay and wore short round on her keel two or three of the english boats attempted to follow but it was idle winchester who now commanded recalled them saying that it remained for the ships to perform their task the day had been too bloody indeed to think of more than securing the present success and of attending to the hurt  leaving the party on the islets for a moment we will follow the two vessels in their attempt to escape pintard and his companions abandoned raoul with heavy hearts but they plainly saw him prostrated on the rocks and by the hand placed on his side understood the desperate nature of his wound like him they felt some such interest as one entertains for a beloved mistress in the fate of the lugger and the wordssauve mon feufollet were ringing in their ears  as soon as the lugger got round she set her aftersail and then she began to glide through the water with the usual knifelike parting of the element under her bows the course she steered took her directly out of the bay seeming to lead across the forefoots of the english ships ithuel did not imitate this manoeuvre he kept more away in the line for paestum rightly enough believing that in the greedy desire to overtake the lugger his own movement would pass unheeded the owner of this craft was still on board the terpsichore but every remonstrance and all the requests he made that his own vessel might be followed and captured were utterly unheeded by the lieutenant now in command to him as to all others in authority there seemed to be but one thing desirable and that was to secure the lugger of course none yet knew of the fatal character of the struggle on the rocks or of the death of the english leader though the nature of the result was sufficiently understood by seeing the english jack flying among the ruins and the two vessels under weigh endeavoring to escape  the season was now so far advanced as to render the old stability of the breezes a little uncertain the zephyr had come early and it had come fresh but there were symptoms of a sirocco about the barometer and in the atmosphere this rendered all in the ships eager to secure their prize before a shift of wind should come now that there were three fast vessels in chase none doubted of the final result and cuffe paced the quarterdeck of the proserpine rubbing his hands with delight as he regarded all the propitious signs of the times  the ringdove was ordered by signal to haul up southsouthwest or close on a wind with a view to make such an offing as would prevent the possibility of the luggers getting outside of the ships and gaining the wind of them an achievement cuffe thought she might very well be enabled to accomplish could she once fairly come by the wind under circumstances that would prevent any of his vessels from bringing her under their guns the terpsichore was directed to run well into the bay to see that a similar artifice was not practised in that direction while the proserpine shaped her own course at the angle that would intercept the chase should the latter continue to stand on  it was an easy thing for the french to set all their canvas the hamper of a lugger being so simple this was soon done and pintard watched the result with intense interest well knowing that everything now depended on heels and ignorant what might be the effect of her present trim on the sailing of his beautiful craft luckily some attention had been paid to her lines in striking in the ballast again and it was soon found that the vessel was likely to behave well pintard thought her so light as to be tender but not daring to haul up high enough to prove her in that way it remained a matter of opinion only it was enough for him that she lay so far to the west of south as to promise to clear the point of piane and that she skimmed along the water at a rate that bade fair to distance all three of her pursuers anxious to get an offing however which would allow him to alter his course at night in more directions than one he kept luffing as the wind favored so as sensibly to edge off the land  as the two chases commenced their flight quite a mile to the southward of the ships having that much the start of them on account of the position of the rocks it rendered them both tolerably free from all danger of shot at the beginning of the race the course steered by ithuel soon placed him beyond their reach altogether and cuffe knew that little would be gained while much might be lost in making any attempt of this sort on the lugger consequently not a gun was fired but the result was thrown fairly on the canvas and on the sailing of the respective vessels  such was the state of things at the beginning of this chase the wind freshened fast and soon blew a strong breeze one that drove the ships ahead under clouds of studdingsails and staysailsthe latter being much used at that periodat the rate of quite ten knots the hour but neither gained on le feufollet the course was by no means favorable to her the wind being well on her quarter still she rather gained than was gained on all four vessels went off rapidly to the southward as a matter of course nor was it long before they were to leeward of the felucca which had both shortened sail and hauled up to the eastward as soon as ithuel felt satisfied he was not to be followed after a sufficient time had elapsed the holy michael tacked and came out of the bay crossing the wake of the terpsichore just beyond gunshot of course this manoeuvre was seen from the frigate and the padrone of the felucca tore his hair threw himself on the quarterdeck and played many other desperate antics in the indulgence of his despair or to excite sympathy but all in vain the lieutenant was obstinate refusing to alter tack or sheet to chase a miserable felucca with so glorious an object in full view before him as the celebrated lugger of raoul yvard as a matter of course ithuel passed out to sea unmolested and it may as well be said here that in due time he reached marseilles in safety where the felucca was sold and the graniteseaman disappeared for a season there will be occasion to speak of him only once again in this legend  the trial of speed must soon have satisfied pintard that he had little to apprehend from his pursuers even with the breeze there was but circumstances favored the lugger the wind hauled materially to the northward and before the sun set it enabled the french to run off wingandwing still edging from the land it now began to blow so heavily as to compel the ships to reduce their light canvas some time before the night set in both frigates and the sloop were under maintopgallantsails only with topmast and lower studdingsails on each side le feufollet made no change her jigger had been taken in as soon as she kept dead away and then she dashed ahead under her two enormous lugs confident in their powers of endurance the night was not very dark but it promised to carry her beyond the vision of her pursuers even before eight bells did the present difference in sailing continue  a stern chase is proverbially a long chase for one fast vessel to outsail another a single mile in an hour is a great superiority and even in such circumstances many hours must elapse ere one loses sight of the other by day the three english ships held way together surprisingly the proserpine leading a little while le feufollet might possibly have found herself at the end of a six hours chase some four miles in advance of her three of which she had gained since keeping off wingandwing the lightness of the little craft essentially aided her the canvas had less weight to drag after it and pintard observed that the hull seemed to skim the waves as soon as the sharp stem had divided them and the water took the bearings of the vessel hour after hour did he sit on the bowsprit watching her progress a crest of foam scarce appearing ahead before it was glittering under the luggers bottom occasionally a pursuing sea cast the stern upward as if about to throw it in advance of the bows but le feufollet was too much accustomed to this treatment to be disturbed and she ever rose on the billow like a bubble and then the glancing arrow scarce surpassed the speed with which she hastened forward as if to recover lost time  cuffe did not quit the deck until the bell struck two in the middle watch this made it one oclock yelverton and the master kept the watches between them but the captain was always near with his advice and orders  that craft seems faster when she gets her sails wingandwing than she is even closehauled it seems to me yelverton observed cuffe after taking a long look at the chase with a nightglass i begin to be afraid we shall lose her neither of the other ships does anything to help us here we are all three dead in her wake following each other like so many old maids going to church of a sunday morning  it would have been better captain cuffe had the ringdove kept more to the westward and the frigate further east fast as the lugger is with her wings spread shes faster with them jammed up on a wind i expect every moment to find her sheering off to the westward and gradually getting us in her wake on a wind i fear we should find that worse work than even this sir  i would not lose her now for a thousand pounds i do not see what the dl dashwood was about that he did not secure her when he got possession of the rocks i shall rattle him down a little as soon as we meet  cuffe would have been shocked had he known that the body of sir frederick dashwood was just as that moment going through the melancholy process of being carried on board a twodecker up at naples the captain of which was his kinsman but he did not know it nor did he learn his death for more than a week or after the body had been interred  take the glass yelverton and look at her to me she grows very dimshe must be leaving us fast be careful to note if there are any signs of an intention to sheer to the westward  that can hardly be done without jibing her forward lughang me captain cuffe if i can see her at all ah here she is dead ahead as before but as dim as a ghost i can barely make out her canvasshe is still wingandwing dn her looking more like the spectre of a craft than a real thing i lost her in that yaw siri wish you would try captain cuffedo my best i cannot find her again  cuffe did try but without success once indeed he fancied he saw her but further examination satisfied him it was a mistake so long had he been gazing at the same object that it was easy for the illusion to pass before his minds eye of imagining a dim outline of the little lugger flying away like the scud of the heavens wingandwing ever seeming to elude his observation that night he dreamed of her and there were haply five minutes during which his wandering thoughts actually portrayed the process of taking possession and of manning the prize  previously to this however signals were made to the other ships ordering them to alter their courses with a view to meet anticipated changes in that of le feufollet lyon was sent to the westward the terpsichore a little easterly while the proserpine herself ventured so far as to steer southwest after two oclock but a sudden and violent shift of wind came an hour before day it was the expectednay the announcedsirocco and it brought the lugger to windward beyond all dispute the south breeze came strong from the first puff and while it did not amount to a gale until the afternoon of the next day it blew heavily in squalls after the first hour  when the day dawned the three ships were out of sight of each other the proserpine which we shall accompany as our old acquaintance and an actor in what is to succeed was under doublereefed topsails with her head up as high as westsouthwest laboring along through the troughs of the seas left by the late tramontana the weather was thick rain and drizzle coming in the squalls and there were moments when the water could not be seen a cableslength from the ship at no time was the usual horizon fairly visible in this manner the frigate struggled ahead cuffe unwilling to abandon all hopes of success and yet seeing little prospect of its accomplishment the lookouts were aloft as usual but it was as much for form as for any great use they were likely to be since it was seldom a man could see further from the crosstrees than he could from the deck  the officers as well as the men had breakfasted a species of sullen discontent pervaded the ship and the recent kind feelings toward raoul yvard had nearly vanished in disappointment some began to grumble about the chances of the other ships falling in with the lugger while others swore that it mattered not who saw her catch her none could who had not an illicit understanding with the father of lies she was well named the jackolantern for jackolantern she was and jackolantern would she ever prove to be as well might a false fire be followed in a meadow as such a craft at sea they might think themselves fortunate if the officers andpeople sent against her in the boats ever got back to their own wholesome ship again  in the midst of such prognostics and complaints the captain of the foretop shouted the words sail ho the usual inquiry and answer followed and the officers got a glimpse of the object the stranger was distant half a league and he was seen very indistinctly on account of the haze but seen he was  tis a xebec growled the master who was one of the grumblers of the daya fellow with his hold crammed with a wine that would cover the handsomest womans face in lunnun with wrinkles  by jupiter ammon cuffe exclaimed tis le feufolly or i do not know an old acquaintance quartermaster hand me the glassnot that the shorter glass is the best  long or short youll never make that out muttered the master the folly has more folly about her than i give her credit for if we get another look at her this summer  what do you make of him captain cuffe yelverton eagerly demanded  just what i told you sirtis the luggerandi cannot be mistakenaye by jove she is coming down before it wingandwing again thats her play just now it would seem and she does not appear to have got enough of it yet  an attentive look satisfied yelverton that his commander was right even the master had to confess his error though he did it ungraciously and with reluctance it was the lugger of a certainty though so dimly seen as to render it difficult at moments to trace her outlines at all she was running in a line that would carry her astern of the frigate about a mile and she was rather more than thrice that distance to windward  she cannot see us said cuffe thoughtfully beyond a doubt she thinks us to windward and is endeavoring to get out of our neighborhood we must get round gentlemen and now is a favorable moment tack ship at once mr yelvertoni think shell do it  the experiment was made and it succeeded the proserpine worked beautifully and yelverton knew how to humor her to a nicety in five minutes the ship was round with everything trimmed on the other tackclosereefed mizzen and doublereefed fore and maintopsailsa reefed mainsail with other sails to suit as she was kept a rap full or a little off indeed to prevent the lugger from slipping past she might have gone from five to six knots  the next five minutes were intensely interesting to the people of the proserpine the weather became thicker and all traces of le feufollet were lost still when last seen she was wingandwing flying rather than sailing down toward their own track by cuffes calculation the two vessels would nearly meet in less than a quarter of an hour should neither alter her course several guns were got ready in preparation for such a rencontre  let the weather hold thick a few minutes longer and we have her cried cuffe mr yelverton you must go down and see to those guns yourself plump it right into her if youre ordered to fire the fellow has no hamper and stripping him must be a matter of pure accident make it too hot for him on deck and hell have to give up raoul yvard or the dl  there she is sir shouted a midshipman from a catheadfor everybody who dared had crowded forward to get an early look at the chase  there she was sure enough wingandwing as before the dulness of the luggers lookouts has never been explained as a matter of course but it was supposed when all the circumstances came to be known that most of her people were asleep to recover from the recent extraordinary fatigue and a night in which all hands had been kept on deck in readiness to make sail the vessel having but some thirty souls in her at length the frigate was seen the weather lighting and it was not an instant too soon the two vessels at that critical instant were about half a mile apart le feufollet bearing directly off the proserpines weatherbow in the twinkling of an eye the former jibed then she was seen coming to the wind losing sufficient ground in doing so to bring her just in a range with the two weather chaseguns cuffe instantly gave the order to open a fire  what the dl has got into her exclaimed the captain she topples like a mock mandarin she used to be as stiff as a church what can it mean sir  the master did not know but we may say that the lugger was flying light too much so for the canvas she carried for in such heavy weather there was not time to shorten sail she lurched heavily under the sea that was now getting up and a squall striking her her lee guns were completely buried just at this moment the proserpine belched forth her flame and smoke the shot could not be followed and no one knew where they struck four had been fired when a squall succeeded that shut in the chase and of course the firing was suspended so severe was this momentary effort of the african gales hot drowsy and deadening as they are that the proserpine started her mizzentopsail sheets and clewed up her maincourse to save the spar but the tack was instantly boarded again and the topsail set a gleam of sunshine succeeded but the lugger had disappeared  the sun did not remain visible and that faintly more than a minute still the eye could range several miles for thrice that period after this the horizon became more limited but no squall occurred for quarter of an hour when the lugger was missed the proserpine was heading up within half a point of the spot at which she was supposed to be in a short time she drove past this point perhaps a hundred fathoms to leeward of it here she tacked and stretching off a sufficient distance to the southward and westward came round again and heading up eastsoutheast was thought to sweep along over the empty track not a sign of the missing vessel was discovered the sea had swallowed all lugger people and hamper it was supposed that owing to the fact that so many light articles had been left on the rocks nothing remained to float all had accompanied le feufollet to the bottom of boats there were none these being at the islet of the ruins and if any seaman swam off in the desperate attempt to save his life in the midst of the cauldron of waters he did not succeed or was overlooked by the english in their search the latter indeed may have miscalculated their distances and not have passed within a cableslength of the place where the victims if any such there were still struggled for existence  cuffe and all around him were forcibly struck with so unlookedfor and so dire a calamity the loss of a vessel under such circumstances produces an effect like a sudden death among companions it is a fate all may meet with and it induces reflection and sadness still the english did not give up the hope of rescuing some unfortunate wretch clinging to a spar or supporting himself by supernatural efforts for several hours at noon however the ship squared away and ran for naples before the wind being drawn aside from her course by another chase in which she succeeded better capturing a sloopofwar which she carried in several days later  the first act of cuffe on anchoring in the fleet was to go on board the foudroyant and report himself and his proceedings to the rearadmiral nelson had heard nothing of the result beyond what had occurred at the islets and the separation of the ships  well cuffe he said reaching out his remaining hand kindly to his old agamemnon as the other entered the cabinthe fellow has got off after all it has been a bad business altogether but we must make the best of it where do you fancy the lugger to be  cuffe explained what had happened and put into the admirals hand an official letter explaining his recent success with the last nelson was pleasedat the first surprised after a long thoughtful pause he went into the aftercabin and returned throwing a small jacklike flag on the floor  as lyon was cruising about he said and his sloop was pitching her catheads under this thing was washed upon a spare anchor where it stuck its a queer flag can it have had any connection with the lugger  cuffe looked and he immediately recognized the little ala e ala jack that the italians had described to him in their many conversations it was the only vestige that was ever found of the wingandwing    chapter xxx       how beautiful is sorrow when tis drest      by virgin innocence it makes      felicity in others seem deformed       davenant  we must return to the rocks and the melancholy scene they offered our purposes will be answered however by advancing the time into the evening omitting many things that the reader can imagine without our relating them  it is scarcely necessary to say that andrea barrofaldi and vito viti took no part in the bloody transactions we have related when all was over however they drew near to the rocks and sitting in their boat contemplating the sad spectacle presented within the narrow compass of the islet of the ruins the following short dialogue occurred between them  vicegovernatore demanded the podest√† pointing to the place where sir frederick lay a motionless corpse raoul bleeding and others were writhing under their woundsdo you call this reality or is it a part of that damnable doctrine which is enough to set the whole earth by the ears and to turn men into tigers and hawks  i fear neighbor vito this will only prove too true i see the bodies of sir dashwood and sir smees and god knows how many more have this day departed for the world of spirits  leaving behind them only a world of shadows muttered vito viti even that melancholy spectacle failing to draw his thoughts altogether from a discussion that had now lasted near fourandtwenty hours but the moment was not propitious to argument and the two italians landed this was within half an hour after the struggle had ceased and our intentions are to advance the time to the moment mentioned in the opening of this chapter  we must give here however a rapid sketch of the proceedings that narrowed down the view to that we intend shortly to lay before the reader as soon as there was leisure winchester made a survey of the field of battle he found many of his own men slain and more wounded of the french on the islet quite half were hurt but the mortal wound received by their leader was the blow that all lamented the surgeon soon pronounced raouls case to be hopeless and this declaration was heard with regret even by generous enemies the defence had been desperate it would have succeeded had it been within the scope of possibility for so few courageous men to repel double their numbers of those who were equally brave both sides had fought for honor and when this is the case victory generally awaits the strongest  as soon as it was perceived that all the ships were likely to be led far to leeward in chase the english officers felt the necessity of acting for themselves the medical men had been busy from the first and in the course of a couple of hours all had been done for the wounded that present circumstances would allow the amputations were few and each vessel having sent a surgeon these were all made while the other appliances had been successfully used in such cases as would be benefited by them the day was drawing near a close and the distance from the fleet was so great as to call for exertion  as soon therefore as the uninjured men were refreshed and the wounded cared for the latter were put into the launches in the best manner they might be and the cutters took them in tow one had no sooner received its melancholy freight than it left the islets on its way to the hospitalship of the fleet the others succeeded in turn the unhurt french willingly offering to assist in the performance of this pious duty at length but three boats remained one was sir fredericks gig which winchester had kept for his own particular use another was the yawl of andrea barrofaldi and the third the little craft in which carlo giuntotardi had come from the shore of the french no one remained but the surgeon of the lugger raouls steward and personal attendant and raoul himself if to these be added the two italians and their oarsmen carlo and his niece with winchester and his boats crew we enumerate all who now remained at the rocks  by this time the sun had sunk below the adjacent hills and it was necessary to decide on some course winchester consulted the surgeon as to the expediency of removing his patient could it be done it had better be done soon  mon lieutenant answered this personage a little dryly mon brave capitaine has but a short time to live he has entreated to be left here on the scene of his glory and in the company of that female whom he so well lovedmaisyou are the victorsshrugging his shouldersand you will do your own pleasure  winchester colored and bit his lips the idea of torturing raoul either in body or mind was the last intention of one so humane but he felt indignant at the implied suspicion commanding himself notwithstanding he bowed courteously and intimated that he would remain himself with his prisoner until all were over the frenchman was surprised and when he read the sympathy of the other in the expression of his countenance he felt regret for his own distrust and still more at having expressed it  mais monsieur he answered night will soon comeyou may have to pass it on the rocks  and if we do doctor it is no more than we seamen are used to boatservice is common duty with us i have only to wrap myself in my cloak to enjoy a seamans comfort  this settled the matter and no more was said the surgeon a man accustomed to the exercise of such resources soon managed to make his dispositions for the final scene in clearing the lugger a hundred light articles had been thrown on the islet on which she had touched and among others were several rude mattresses of the seamen two or three of these were procured placed on the smoothest surface of the rock and a bed formed for raoul the medical man and the seamen would have erected a tent with a sail but this the wounded man forbade  let me breathe the free air he saidi shall use but little of itlet that little be free  it was useless to oppose such a wish nor was there any motive for it the air was pure and little need be apprehended from the night in behalf of ghita surrounded as they were by the pure waters of the ocean even when the tramontana came although it was cool its coolness was not unpleasant the adjacent hill sheltering the islets from its immediate influence  the english seamen collected some fuel from the spare spars of the lugger and lighted a fire on the rock where they had been found food of all sorts was abundant and several casks of water had been struck out whole as provision against a siege here they made coffee and cooked enough food for the wants of all the party the distance prevented their disturbing those who remained near raoul while the light of the fire which was kept in a cheerful blaze cast a picturesque glow upon the group around the dying man as soon as the night had fairly set in it superseded too the necessity of any lamps or torches  we pass over all the first outpourings of ghitas anguish when she learned the wound of raoul her many and fervent prayers and the scenes that took place during the time that the islet was still crowded with the combatants more quiet hours succeeded when these last were gone and as the night advanced something like the fixed tranquillity of settled despair followed the first emotions when ten oclock arrived we reach the moment at which we wish to raise the curtain once more in order to present the principal actors in the scene  raoul lay on the summit of the islet where his eye could range over the mild waters that washed the rock and his ear listen to the murmurings of his own element the tramontana as usual had driven all perceptible vapor from the atmosphere and the vault of heaven in its cerulean blue and spangled with thousands of stars stretched itself above him a glorious harbinger for the future to one who died in hope the care of ghita and the attendants had collected around the spot so many little comforts as to give it the air of a room suddenly divested of sides and ceiling but habitable and useful winchester fatigued with his days work and mindful of the wish that raoul might so naturally feel to be alone with ghita had lain down on a mattress leaving orders to be called should anything occur while the surgeon conscious that he could do no more had imitated his example making a similar request as for carlo giuntotardi he seldom slept he was at this prayers in the ruins andrea and the podest√† paced the rock to keep themselves warm slightly regretting the sudden burst of humanity which had induced them to remain  raoul and ghita were alone the former lay on his back his head bolstered and his face upturned toward the vault of heaven the pain was over and life was ebbing fast still the mind was unshackled and thought busy as ever his heart was still full of ghita though his extraordinary situation and more especially the glorious view before his eyes blended certain pictures of the future with his feelings that were as novel as he found them powerful  with the girl it was different as a woman she felt the force of this sudden blow in a manner that she found difficult to bear still she blessed god that what had occurred happened in her presence as it might be leaving her the means of acting and the efficacy of prayer to say that she did not yet feel the liveliest love for raoul all that tenderness which constitutes so large a portion of womans nature would be untrue but her mind was made up to the worst and her thoughts were of another state of being  a long pause occurred in which raoul remained steadfastly gazing at the starry canopy above  it is remarkable ghita he said at length that iraoul yvardthe corsairthe man of wars and tempests combats and hairbreadth escapesshould be dying here on this rock with all those stars looking down upon me as it might be from your heaven seeming to smile upon me  why not your heaven as well as mine raoul ghita answered tremulously it is as vast as he who dwells in itwhose throne it isand can contain all who love him and seek his mercy  dost thou think one like me would be received into his presence ghita  do not doubt itfree from all error and weakness himself his holy spirit delights in the penitent and the sorrowful oh dearest dearest raoul if thou wouldst but pray  a gleam like that of triumph glowed on the face of the wounded man and ghita in the intensity of her expectation rose and stood over him her own features filled with a momentary hope  mon feufollet exclaimed raoul letting the tongue reveal the transient thought which brought the gleam of triumph to his countenance thou at least hast escaped these english will not count thee among their victims and glut their eyes on thy charming proportions  ghita felt a chill at her heart she fell back on her seat and continued watching her lovers countenance with a feeling of despair though inextinguishable tenderness was still crowding around her soul raoul heard the movement and turning his head he gazed at the girl for quite a minute with a portion of that intense admiration that used to gleam from his eyes in happier moments  it is better as it is ghita he said than that i should live without thee fate has been kind in thus ending my misery  oh raoul i there is no fate but the holy will of god deceive not thyself at this awful moment bow down thy proud spirit in humility and turn to him for succor  poor ghitawell thine is not the only innocent mind by millions that hath been trammelled by priests and i suppose what hath commenced with the beginning will last till the end  the beginning and the end are both with god raoul since the commencement of time hath he established laws which have brought about the trials of thy lifethe sadness of this very hour  and dost thou think he will pardon all thy care of one so unworthy  ghita bowed her head to the mattress over which she leaned and buried her face in her hands when the minute of prayer that succeeded was over and her face was again raised with the flush of feeling tempered by innocence on it raoul was lying on his back his eyes riveted again on the vault of heaven his professional pursuits had led him further into the study of astronomy than comported with his general education and addicted to speculation its facts had often seized upon his fancy though they had failed to touch his heart hitherto indeed he had fallen into the common error of limited research and found a confirmation of his suspicions in the assumed grasp of his own reason the dread moment that was so near could not fail of its influence however and that unknown future over which he hung as it might be suspended by a hair inevitably led his mind into an inquiry after the unknown god  dost thou know ghita he asked that the learned of france tell us that all yonder bright stars are worlds peopled most probably like this of our own and to which the earth appears but as a star itself and that too of no great magnitude  and what is this raoul to the power and majesty of him who created the universe ah think not of the things of his hand but of him who made them  hast thou ever heard my poor ghita that the mind of man hath been able to invent instruments to trace the movements of all these worlds and hath power even to calculate their wanderings with accuracy for ages to come  and dost thou know my poor raoul what this mind of man is  a part of his naturethe highest quality that which maketh him the lord of earth  his highest qualityand that which maketh him lord of earth in one sense truly but after all a mere fragmenta spot on the width of the heavensof the spirit of god himself it is in this sense that he hath been made in the image of his creator  thou thinkst then ghita that man is god after all  raoulraoul if thou wouldst not see me die with thee interpret not my words in this manner  would it then be so hard to quit life in my company ghita to me it would seem supreme felicity were our places to be changed  to go whither hast thou bethought thee of this my beloved  raoul answered not for some time his eyes were fastened on a bright star and a tumult of thoughts began to crowd upon his brain there are moments in the life of every man when the mental vision obtains clearer views of remote conclusions equally in connection with the past and the future as there are days when an atmosphere purer than common more readily gives up its objects to the physical organsleaving the mind momentarily the master almost without control one of these gleams of truth passed over the faculties of the dying man and it could not be altogether without its fruits raouls soul was agitated by novel sensations  do thy priests fancy that they who have known and loved each other in this life he asked will know and love each other in that which they fancy is to come  the life that is to come raoul is one all love or one all hatred that we may know each other i try to hope nor do i see any reason for disbelieving it my uncle is of opinion it must be so  thy uncle ghita what carlo giuntotardihe who seemeth never to think of things around himdoth a mind like his dwell on thoughts as remote and sublime as this  little dost thou know or understand him raoul his mind seldom ceases to dwell on thoughts like these this is the reason why earth and all it contains seem so indifferent  raoul made no answer but appearing to suffer under the pain of his wound the feelings of woman so far prevailed over ghitas tender nature that she had not the heart to press even his salvation on him at such a moment she offered him soothing drinks and nursed him with unabated care and when there seemed to be a cessation to his sufferings she again passed minutes on her knees her whole soul absorbed in his future welfare an hour passed in this manner all on or near the rock sleeping overcome by fatigue but ghita and the dying man  that star haunts me ghita raoul at length muttered if it be really a world some allpowerful hand must have created it chance never made a world more than chance made a ship thoughtmindintelligence must have governed at the formation of one as well as of the other  for months ghita had not known an instant as happy as that it appeared as if the mind of raoul were about to extricate itself from the shallow philosophy so much in fashion and which had hitherto deadened a nature so kind an intellect ordinarily so clear could his thoughts but once take the right direction she had strong confidence in the distinctness of their views but most of all in the goodness of the deity  raoul she whispered god is there as he is with us on this rock his spirit is everywhere bless himbless him in thy soul my beloved and be forever happy  raoul answered not his face was upturned and his eye still remained riveted on that particular star ghita would not disturb him but taking his hand in hers she once more knelt and resumed her prayers minute passed after minute and neither seemed disposed to speak at length ghita became woman again and bethought her of her patients bodily wants it was time to administer the liquids of the surgeon and she advanced to hold them to his lips the eye was still fastened on the star but the lips did not meet her with the customary smile of love they were compressed as when the body was about to mingle in the strife of a battle a sort of stern resolution being settled on them raoul yvard was dead  the discovery of the truth was a fearful moment to ghita not a living being near her had the consciousness of her situation all being bound in the sleep of the weary the first feeling was that which belonged to her sex she threw herself on the body and embraced it wildly giving way to those pentup emotions which her lover in his moody humors was wont to accuse her of not possessing she kissed the forehead the cheeks the pallid stern lips of the dead and for a time there was the danger that her own spirit might pass away in the paroxysm of her grief but it was morally impossible for ghita to remain long under the influence of despair her gentle spirit had communed too long and too closely with her heavenly father not to resort to his support in all the critical moments of life she prayed for the tenth time that night and arose from her knees calm if not absolutely resigned  the situation of ghita was now as wildly picturesque as it was moving to her inmost spirit all around her still slept and that to the eye as profoundly as he who was only to rise again when the sea and the land give up their dead the excitement and exertions of the past day produced their reaction and seldom did sleep exercise a more profound influence the fire was still burning bright on the islet of the gigmen casting its rays fairly athwart the ruins the different sleepers in them and the immovable body of the dead at moments gusts of the tramontana which was now blowing fresh descended so low as to fan the flames when the glare that succeeded seemed to give a startling reality to all that surrounded the place  still the girl was too highly sustained to be moved with anything but her loss and her restless inquietude for the departed spirit she saw that even her uncle slept leaving her truly alone with raoul once a feeling of desertion came over her and she was inclined to arouse some of the sleepers she did approach the spot where the surgeon lay and her hand was raised to stir him when a flash of light shot athwart the pallid countenance of raoul and she perceived that his eyes were still open drawing near she bent over the body gazing long and wistfully into those windows of the soul that had so often beamed on her in manly tenderness and she felt like a miser with his hoarded gold unwilling to share it with any other  throughout the livelong night did ghita watch by the body of her wellbeloved now hanging over it with a tenderness no change could extinguish now besieging heaven with her prayers not one awoke to interfere with the strange happiness she felt in those pious offices or to wound her sensibilities by the surprise or the sneers of the vulgar ere the day came she closed the eyes of raoul with her own hands covered his body with a french ensign that lay upon the rock and sat patient and resigned awaiting the moment when some of the others might be ready to aid her in performing the last pious offices in behalf of the dead as a romanist she found a holy consolation in that beautiful portion of her churchs creed that admits of unceasing petition for the souls of the departed even to the latest hour of earthly things  winchester was the first to stir starting up he appeared to be astonished at the situation in which he found himself but a glance around told the whole truth advancing toward ghita he was about to inquire after the welfare of raoul when struck by the expression of her seraphic countenance he turned to the body and read the truth in the appropriate pall it was no time for selfupbraidings or for reproaches to others but arousing the sleepers in a subdued and respectful manner he gave to the place the quiet and seeming sanctity of a chapel  carlo giuntotardi soon after begged the dead body from the conquerors there was no motive for denying the request and it was placed in a boat and towed to the shore accompanied by all who had remained the heavy sirocco that soon succeeded drove the waves athwart the islet of the ruins effectually erasing its stains of blood and sweeping every trace of le feufollet and of the recent events into the sea  at the foot of the scaricatojo the seamen constructed a rude bier and thus they bore the dead up that wild and yet lovely precipice persevering in their good work until they reached the cottage of carlo giuntotardis sister a little procession accompanied the body from the first and ghita being universally known and respected among the simple inhabitants of those heights when it entered the street of st agata it had grown into a line that included a hundred believers  the convent the empty buildings of which still crown the summit of one of the adjacent hills was then in existence as a religious community and the influence of carlo giuntotardi was sufficient to procure its offices in behalf of the dead for three days and nights did the body of raoul yvard the unbeliever lie in the chapel of that holy fraternity his soul receiving the benefit of masses then it was committed to holy ground to await the summons of the last trump  there is a strange disposition in the human breast to withhold praise from a man when living that is freely accorded to him when dead although we believe that envy and its attendant evil detraction are peculiarly democratic vices meaning thereby that democracy is the most fertile field in which these human failings luxuriate yet is there much reason to think that our parent nation is preeminent in the exhibition of the peculiarity first mentioned that which subsequently awaited napoleon after his imprisonment and death was now exhibited in the case of raoul yvard on a scale suited to his condition and renown from being detested in the english fleet he got to be honored and extolled now that he was dead and harmless his seamanship could be praised his chivalry emulated and his courage glorified winchester mcbean oleary and clinch attended his funeral quite as a matter of course they had proved themselves worthy to be there but many others insisted on being of the party some came to get a last look of so celebrated an adventurer even in his coffin others to say they had been present and not a few to catch a glimpse of the girl whose romantic but innocent passion had got to be the subject of much discourse in the ships the result was such a procession and such funeral honors as threw the quiet little hamlet of st agata into commotion all noted the particulars and all were pleased but ghita on her these tardy compliments failed of their effect her soul being engrossed with the great care of petitioning heaven in behalf of the deceased  andrea barrofaldi and vito viti too figured on this occasion the latter taking care to let all who would listen understand how closely he had been connected with sir smees no longer viewed as an impostor but honored as a hero he even created a little difficulty in claiming a precedency for the toga over arms on the occasion well knowing that if the vicegovernatore got a conspicuous place in the ceremony the podest√† could not fail to be near at hand the matter was settled entirely to andreas satisfaction if not to that of his friend  to confess the truth nelson was not sorry for what had occurred when he learned the desperate nature of raouls defence and heard some traits of his liberal conduct on various occasions he felt a generous regret at his death but he thought even this preferable to escape when cuffe got in and brought the report of the luggers fate though he would have preferred her capture the common sentiment settled down into a feeling that both lugger and commander had fared as well as a privateer and her people usually merited  as a matter of course those concerned in the capture and who survived the affair reaped some advantage from their success england seldom fails in the duty of conferring rewards more especially in her marine when cook returned from his renowned voyages it was not to meet with persecution and neglect but credit and justice nelson knew how to appreciate that spirit and enterprise which were so often exercised by himself as for sir frederick dashwood little could be done besides giving his name an honorable place on the list of those who had fallen in battle his heir wore mourning seemed filled with sorrow and inwardly rejoiced at being a baronet with some thousands a year lyon got his ship and from that moment he ceased to consider the chase and all connected with le feufollet an unprofitable thing airchy followed him to the terpsichore with visions of prizemoney before his eyes which were tolerably realized in the course of the succeeding five years  winchester was promoted into the ringdove and griffin became first of the proserpine this of course made yelverton second and left one vacancy thus far the orders had been made out when cuffe dined with the admiral by invitation t√™te√†t√™te  one of my objects in having you here today cuffe observed nelson as they sat together over their wine the cabin cleared was to say something about the vacant berth in your gunroom and the other was to beg a mastersmate of you in behalf of berry you remember that some of your people were received on board here before you got in the other day  i do my lord and i meant to make my acknowledgments for the favor the poor fellows had a warm time of it at the rocks and deserved comfortable berths after it was over  i believe we gave them as much at least i know few suffer in this ship well there was a mate among them who is a little advanced and who is likely to stick where he is by what i learn we want just such a man for the hold and i have promised my captain to speak to you about him dont let him go if theres any reason for wishing to retain him but we have three seamen ready to exchange against him good fellows too they tell me  cuffe picked some nuts and appeared a little at a loss for a reply nelson saw this and he fancied the other reluctant to give up his mate  well i see how it is he said smiling we must do without him and you will keep your mr clinch a thorough officer in a ships hold is an advantage not to be thrown away and i suppose if hotham had asked such a thing of old agamemnon he might have whistled for the favor the deuce is in it if we do not get as good a mate somewhere  its not that my lordyoure welcome to the man though a better in his station cannot be had but i was in hopes his recent good conduct and his long services might give him a lift into the vacant gunroom berth  the admiral appeared surprised while he did not seem to be exactly pleased  it has a hard look i grant you cuffe to keep a poor devil ten or fifteen years in the same station and this too after he has served long enough for a commission i was a captain ten years younger than this mr clinch must be today and it does seem hard and yet i doubt not it is just i have rarely known a midshipman or a mate passed over in this way that there was not some great fault at the bottom we must think of the service as well as of generosity  i confess all this my lordand yet i did hope poor clinchs delinquencies would at length be forgotten  if there are any particular reasons for it i should like to hear them  cuffe now related all that had passed between himself and the masters mate taking care to give jane a due place in his history nelson began to twitch the stump of his arm and by the time the story was told clinchs promotion was settled an order was sent forthwith to the secretary to make out the orders and cuffe carried them back with him to the proserpine that night when he returned to his own ship  all nelsons promotions were confirmed by the admiralty pretty much as a matter of course among others was that of clinch who now became the junior lieutenant of the proserpine this elevation awakened new feelings within him he dressed better refrained from the bottle paid more attention to his mind improved in manners by keeping better company and in the course of the next twelvemonth had made rapid advances toward respectability at the end of that time the ship was sent home and jane in her imagination at least received the reward
