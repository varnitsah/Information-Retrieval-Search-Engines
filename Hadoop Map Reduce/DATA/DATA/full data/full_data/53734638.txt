53734638	three ghost stories by charles dickens    contents  the signalman the hauntedhouse the trial for murder     the signalman     halloa  below there  when he heard a voice thus calling to him he was standing at the door of his box with a flag in his hand furled round its short pole  one would have thought considering the nature of the ground that he could not have doubted from what quarter the voice came but instead of looking up to where i stood on the top of the steep cutting nearly over his head he turned himself about and looked down the line  there was something remarkable in his manner of doing so though i could not have said for my life what  but i know it was remarkable enough to attract my notice even though his figure was foreshortened and shadowed down in the deep trench and mine was high above him so steeped in the glow of an angry sunset that i had shaded my eyes with my hand before i saw him at all  halloa  below  from looking down the line he turned himself about again and raising his eyes saw my figure high above him  is there any path by which i can come down and speak to you  he looked up at me without replying and i looked down at him without pressing him too soon with a repetition of my idle question just then there came a vague vibration in the earth and air quickly changing into a violent pulsation and an oncoming rush that caused me to start back as though it had force to draw me down  when such vapour as rose to my height from this rapid train had passed me and was skimming away over the landscape i looked down again and saw him refurling the flag he had shown while the train went by  i repeated my inquiry  after a pause during which he seemed to regard me with fixed attention he motioned with his rolledup flag towards a point on my level some two or three hundred yards distant  i called down to him all right and made for that point  there by dint of looking closely about me i found a rough zigzag descending path notched out which i followed  the cutting was extremely deep and unusually precipitate  it was made through a clammy stone that became oozier and wetter as i went down  for these reasons i found the way long enough to give me time to recall a singular air of reluctance or compulsion with which he had pointed out the path  when i came down low enough upon the zigzag descent to see him again i saw that he was standing between the rails on the way by which the train had lately passed in an attitude as if he were waiting for me to appear  he had his left hand at his chin and that left elbow rested on his right hand crossed over his breast his attitude was one of such expectation and watchfulness that i stopped a moment wondering at it  i resumed my downward way and stepping out upon the level of the railroad and drawing nearer to him saw that he was a dark sallow man with a dark beard and rather heavy eyebrows  his post was in as solitary and dismal a place as ever i saw  on either side a drippingwet wall of jagged stone excluding all view but a strip of sky the perspective one way only a crooked prolongation of this great dungeon the shorter perspective in the other direction terminating in a gloomy red light and the gloomier entrance to a black tunnel in whose massive architecture there was a barbarous depressing and forbidding air  so little sunlight ever found its way to this spot that it had an earthy deadly smell and so much cold wind rushed through it that it struck chill to me as if i had left the natural world  before he stirred i was near enough to him to have touched him not even then removing his eyes from mine he stepped back one step and lifted his hand  this was a lonesome post to occupy i said and it had riveted my attention when i looked down from up yonder  a visitor was a rarity i should suppose not an unwelcome rarity i hoped  in me he merely saw a man who had been shut up within narrow limits all his life and who being at last set free had a newlyawakened interest in these great works  to such purpose i spoke to him but i am far from sure of the terms i used for besides that i am not happy in opening any conversation there was something in the man that daunted me  he directed a most curious look towards the red light near the tunnels mouth and looked all about it as if something were missing from it and then looked it me  that light was part of his charge  was it not  he answered in a low voicedont you know it is  the monstrous thought came into my mind as i perused the fixed eyes and the saturnine face that this was a spirit not a man  i have speculated since whether there may have been infection in his mind  in my turn i stepped back  but in making the action i detected in his eyes some latent fear of me  this put the monstrous thought to flight  you look at me i said forcing a smile as if you had a dread of me  i was doubtful he returned whether i had seen you before  where  he pointed to the red light he had looked at  there i said  intently watchful of me he replied but without sound yes  my good fellow what should i do there  however be that as it may i never was there you may swear  i think i may he rejoined  yes i am sure i may  his manner cleared like my own  he replied to my remarks with readiness and in wellchosen words  had he much to do there  yes that was to say he had enough responsibility to bear but exactness and watchfulness were what was required of him and of actual work manual labourhe had next to none  to change that signal to trim those lights and to turn this iron handle now and then was all he had to do under that head  regarding those many long and lonely hours of which i seemed to make so much he could only say that the routine of his life had shaped itself into that form and he had grown used to it  he had taught himself a language down hereif only to know it by sight and to have formed his own crude ideas of its pronunciation could be called learning it  he had also worked at fractions and decimals and tried a little algebra but he was and had been as a boy a poor hand at figures  was it necessary for him when on duty always to remain in that channel of damp air and could he never rise into the sunshine from between those high stone walls  why that depended upon times and circumstances  under some conditions there would be less upon the line than under others and the same held good as to certain hours of the day and night  in bright weather he did choose occasions for getting a little above these lower shadows but being at all times liable to be called by his electric bell and at such times listening for it with redoubled anxiety the relief was less than i would suppose  he took me into his box where there was a fire a desk for an official book in which he had to make certain entries a telegraphic instrument with its dial face and needles and the little bell of which he had spoken  on my trusting that he would excuse the remark that he had been well educated and i hoped i might say without offence perhaps educated above that station he observed that instances of slight incongruity in such wise would rarely be found wanting among large bodies of men that he had heard it was so in workhouses in the police force even in that last desperate resource the army and that he knew it was so more or less in any great railway staff  he had been when young if i could believe it sitting in that huthe scarcely could a student of natural philosophy and had attended lectures but he had run wild misused his opportunities gone down and never risen again  he had no complaint to offer about that  he had made his bed and he lay upon it  it was far too late to make another  all that i have here condensed he said in a quiet manner with his grave dark regards divided between me and the fire  he threw in the word sir from time to time and especially when he referred to his youthas though to request me to understand that he claimed to be nothing but what i found him  he was several times interrupted by the little bell and had to read off messages and send replies once he had to stand without the door and display a flag as a train passed and make some verbal communication to the driver  in the discharge of his duties i observed him to be remarkably exact and vigilant breaking off his discourse at a syllable and remaining silent until what he had to do was done  in a word i should have set this man down as one of the safest of men to be employed in that capacity but for the circumstance that while he was speaking to me he twice broke off with a fallen colour turned his face towards the little bell when it did not ring opened the door of the hut which was kept shut to exclude the unhealthy damp and looked out towards the red light near the mouth of the tunnel  on both of those occasions he came back to the fire with the inexplicable air upon him which i had remarked without being able to define when we were so far asunder  said i when i rose to leave him you almost make me think that i have met with a contented man  i am afraid i must acknowledge that i said it to lead him on  i believe i used to be so he rejoined in the low voice in which he had first spoken but i am troubled sir i am troubled  he would have recalled the words if he could  he had said them however and i took them up quickly  with what  what is your trouble  it is very difficult to impart sir  it is very very difficult to speak of  if ever you make me another visit i will try to tell you  but i expressly intend to make you another visit  say when shall it be  i go off early in the morning and i shall be on again at ten to morrow night sir  i will come at eleven  he thanked me and went out at the door with me  ill show my white light sir he said in his peculiar low voice till you have found the way up  when you have found it dont call out  and when you are at the top dont call out  his manner seemed to make the place strike colder to me but i said no more than very well  and when you come down tomorrow night dont call out  let me ask you a parting question  what made you cry halloa  below there tonight  heaven knows said i  i cried something to that effect  not to that effect sir  those were the very words  i know them well  admit those were the very words  i said them no doubt because i saw you below  for no other reason  what other reason could i possibly have  you had no feeling that they were conveyed to you in any supernatural way  no  he wished me goodnight and held up his light  i walked by the side of the down line of rails with a very disagreeable sensation of a train coming behind me until i found the path  it was easier to mount than to descend and i got back to my inn without any adventure  punctual to my appointment i placed my foot on the first notch of the zigzag next night as the distant clocks were striking eleven he was waiting for me at the bottom with his white light on  i have not called out i said when we came close together may i speak now  by all means sir  goodnight then and heres my hand  goodnight sir and heres mine  with that we walked side by side to his box entered it closed the door and sat down by the fire  i have made up my mind sir he began bending forward as soon as we were seated and speaking in a tone but a little above a whisper that you shall not have to ask me twice what troubles me  i took you for some one else yesterday evening  that troubles me  that mistake  no  that some one else  who is it  i dont know  like me  i dont know  i never saw the face  the left arm is across the face and the right arm is wavedviolently waved  this way  i followed his action with my eyes and it was the action of an arm gesticulating with the utmost passion and vehemence for gods sake clear the way  one moonlight night said the man i was sitting here when i heard a voice cry halloa  below there  i started up looked from that door and saw this some one else standing by the red light near the tunnel waving as i just now showed you  the voice seemed hoarse with shouting and it cried look out  look out  and then attain halloa  below there  look out  i caught up my lamp turned it on red and ran towards the figure calling whats wrong  what has happened  where  it stood just outside the blackness of the tunnel  i advanced so close upon it that i wondered at its keeping the sleeve across its eyes  i ran right up at it and had my hand stretched out to pull the sleeve away when it was gone  into the tunnel said i  no  i ran on into the tunnel five hundred yards  i stopped and held my lamp above my head and saw the figures of the measured distance and saw the wet stains stealing down the walls and trickling through the arch  i ran out again faster than i had run in for i had a mortal abhorrence of the place upon me and i looked all round the red light with my own red light and i went up the iron ladder to the gallery atop of it and i came down again and ran back here  i telegraphed both ways an alarm has been given  is anything wrong  the answer came back both ways all well  resisting the slow touch of a frozen finger tracing out my spine i showed him how that this figure must be a deception of his sense of sight and how that figures originating in disease of the delicate nerves that minister to the functions of the eye were known to have often troubled patients some of whom had become conscious of the nature of their affliction and had even proved it by experiments upon themselves  as to an imaginary cry said i do but listen for a moment to the wind in this unnatural valley while we speak so low and to the wild harp it makes of the telegraph wires  that was all very well he returned after we had sat listening for a while and he ought to know something of the wind and the wires he who so often passed long winter nights there alone and watching but he would beg to remark that he had not finished  i asked his pardon and he slowly added these words touching my arm   within six hours after the appearance the memorable accident on this line happened and within ten hours the dead and wounded were brought along through the tunnel over the spot where the figure had stood  a disagreeable shudder crept over me but i did my best against it it was not to be denied i rejoined that this was a remarkable coincidence calculated deeply to impress his mind  but it was unquestionable that remarkable coincidences did continually occur and they must be taken into account in dealing with such a subject though to be sure i must admit i added for i thought i saw that he was going to bring the objection to bear upon me men of common sense did not allow much for coincidences in making the ordinary calculations of life  he again begged to remark that he had not finished  i again begged his pardon for being betrayed into interruptions  this he said again laying his hand upon my arm and glancing over his shoulder with hollow eyes was just a year ago  six or seven months passed and i had recovered from the surprise and shock when one morning as the day was breaking i standing at the door looked towards the red light and saw the spectre again  he stopped with a fixed look at me  did it cry out  no  it was silent  did it wave its arm  no  it leaned against the shaft of the light with both hands before the face  like this  once more i followed his action with my eyes  it was an action of mourning  i have seen such an attitude in stone figures on tombs  did you go up to it  i came in and sat down partly to collect my thoughts partly because it had turned me faint  when i went to the door again daylight was above me and the ghost was gone  but nothing followed  nothing came of this  he touched me on the arm with his forefinger twice or thrice giving a ghastly nod each time  that very day as a train came out of the tunnel i noticed at a carriage window on my side what looked like a confusion of hands and heads and something waved  i saw it just in time to signal the driver stop  he shut off and put his brake on but the train drifted past here a hundred and fifty yards or more  i ran after it and as i went along heard terrible screams and cries  a beautiful young lady had died instantaneously in one of the compartments and was brought in here and laid down on this floor between us  involuntarily i pushed my chair back as i looked from the boards at which he pointed to himself  true sir  true  precisely as it happened so i tell it you  i could think of nothing to say to any purpose and my mouth was very dry  the wind and the wires took up the story with a long lamenting wail  he resumed  now sir mark this and judge how my mind is troubled  the spectre came back a week ago  ever since it has been there now and again by fits and starts  at the light  at the dangerlight  what does it seem to do  he repeated if possible with increased passion and vehemence that former gesticulation of for gods sake clear the way  then he went on  i have no peace or rest for it  it calls to me for many minutes together in an agonised manner below there look out  look out  it stands waving to me  it rings my little bell  i caught at that  did it ring your bell yesterday evening when i was here and you went to the door  twice  why see said i how your imagination misleads you  my eyes were on the bell and my ears were open to the bell and if i am a living man it did not ring at those times  no nor at any other time except when it was rung in the natural course of physical things by the station communicating with you  he shook his head i have never made a mistake as to that yet sir i have never confused the spectres ring with the mans  the ghosts ring is a strange vibration in the bell that it derives from nothing else and i have not asserted that the bell stirs to the eye  i dont wonder that you failed to hear it  but i heard it  and did the spectre seem to be there when you looked out  it was there  both times  he repeated firmly  both times  will you come to the door with me and look for it now  he bit his under lip as though he were somewhat unwilling but arose  i opened the door and stood on the step while he stood in the doorway  there was the dangerlight  there was the dismal mouth of the tunnel  there were the high wet stone walls of the cutting  there were the stars above them  do you see it i asked him taking particular note of his face his eyes were prominent and strained but not very much more so perhaps than my own had been when i had directed them earnestly towards the same spot  no he answered  it is not there  agreed said i  we went in again shut the door and resumed our seats  i was thinking how best to improve this advantage if it might be called one when he took up the conversation in such a matterofcourse way so assuming that there could be no serious question of fact between us that i felt myself placed in the weakest of positions  by this time you will fully understand sir he said that what troubles me so dreadfully is the question what does the spectre mean  i was not sure i told him that i did fully understand  what is its warning against he said ruminating with his eyes on the fire and only by times turning them on me  what is the danger  where is the danger  there is danger overhanging somewhere on the line  some dreadful calamity will happen  it is not to be doubted this third time after what has gone before  but surely this is a cruel haunting of me  what can i do  he pulled out his handkerchief and wiped the drops from his heated forehead  if i telegraph danger on either side of me or on both i can give no reason for it he went on wiping the palms of his hands  i should get into trouble and do no good  they would think i was mad  this is the way it would workmessage  danger  take care  answer  what danger  where  message  dont know but for gods sake take care  they would displace me  what else could they do  his pain of mind was most pitiable to see  it was the mental torture of a conscientious man oppressed beyond endurance by an unintelligible responsibility involving life  when it first stood under the dangerlight he went on putting his dark hair back from his head and drawing his hands outward across and across his temples in an extremity of feverish distress why not tell me where that accident was to happenif it must happen  why not tell me how it could be avertedif it could have been averted  when on its second coming it hid its face why not tell me instead she is going to die  let them keep her at home if it came on those two occasions only to show me that its warnings were true and so to prepare me for the third why not warn me plainly now  and i lord help me  a mere poor signalman on this solitary station  why not go to somebody with credit to be believed and power to act  when i saw him in this state i saw that for the poor mans sake as well as for the public safety what i had to do for the time was to compose his mind  therefore setting aside all question of reality or unreality between us i represented to him that whoever thoroughly discharged his duty must do well and that at least it was his comfort that he understood his duty though he did not understand these confounding appearances  in this effort i succeeded far better than in the attempt to reason him out of his conviction  he became calm the occupations incidental to his post as the night advanced began to make larger demands on his attention and i left him at two in the morning  i had offered to stay through the night but he would not hear of it  that i more than once looked back at the red light as i ascended the pathway that i did not like the red light and that i should have slept but poorly if my bed had been under it i see no reason to conceal  nor did i like the two sequences of the accident and the dead girl  i see no reason to conceal that either  but what ran most in my thoughts was the consideration how ought i to act having become the recipient of this disclosure  i had proved the man to be intelligent vigilant painstaking and exact but how long might he remain so in his state of mind  though in a subordinate position still he held a most important trust and would i for instance like to stake my own life on the chances of his continuing to execute it with precision  unable to overcome a feeling that there would be something treacherous in my communicating what he had told me to his superiors in the company without first being plain with himself and proposing a middle course to him i ultimately resolved to offer to accompany him otherwise keeping his secret for the present to the wisest medical practitioner we could hear of in those parts and to take his opinion  a change in his time of duty would come round next night he had apprised me and he would be off an hour or two after sunrise and on again soon after sunset  i had appointed to return accordingly  next evening was a lovely evening and i walked out early to enjoy it  the sun was not yet quite down when i traversed the fieldpath near the top of the deep cutting  i would extend my walk for an hour i said to myself half an hour on and half an hour back and it would then be time to go to my signalmans box  before pursuing my stroll i stepped to the brink and mechanically looked down from the point from which i had first seen him  i cannot describe the thrill that seized upon me when close at the mouth of the tunnel i saw the appearance of a man with his left sleeve across his eyes passionately waving his right arm  the nameless horror that oppressed me passed in a moment for in a moment i saw that this appearance of a man was a man indeed and that there was a little group of other men standing at a short distance to whom he seemed to be rehearsing the gesture he made the dangerlight was not yet lighted  against its shaft a little low hut entirely new to me had been made of some wooden supports and tarpaulin  it looked no bigger than a bed  with an irresistible sense that something was wrongwith a flashing selfreproachful fear that fatal mischief had come of my leaving the man there and causing no one to be sent to overlook or correct what he didi descended the notched path with all the speed i could make  what is the matter i asked the men  signalman killed this morning sir  not the man belonging to that box  yes sir  not the man i know  you will recognise him sir if you knew him said the man who spoke for the others solemnly uncovering his own head and raising an end of the tarpaulin for his face is quite composed  o how did this happen how did this happen i asked turning from one to another as the hut closed in again  he was cut down by an engine sir  no man in england knew his work better  but somehow he was not clear of the outer rail  it was just at broad day  he had struck the light and had the lamp in his hand  as the engine came out of the tunnel his back was towards her and she cut him down  that man drove her and was showing how it happened  show the gentleman tom  the man who wore a rough dark dress stepped back to his former place at the mouth of the tunnel  coming round the curve in the tunnel sir he said i saw him at the end like as if i saw him down a perspectiveglass  there was no time to check speed and i knew him to be very careful  as he didnt seem to take heed of the whistle i shut it off when we were running down upon him and called to him as loud as i could call  what did you say  i said below there  look out  look out  for gods sake clear the way  i started  ah it was a dreadful time sir  i never left off calling to him i put this arm before my eyes not to see and i waved this arm to the last but it was no use   without prolonging the narrative to dwell on any one of its curious circumstances more than on any other i may in closing it point out the coincidence that the warning of the enginedriver included not only the words which the unfortunate signalman had repeated to me as haunting him but also the words which i myselfnot hehad attached and that only in my own mind to the gesticulation he had imitated     the haunted house     chapter ithe mortals in the house    under none of the accredited ghostly circumstances and environed by none of the conventional ghostly surroundings did i first make acquaintance with the house which is the subject of this christmas piece  i saw it in the daylight with the sun upon it  there was no wind no rain no lightning no thunder no awful or unwonted circumstance of any kind to heighten its effect  more than that i had come to it direct from a railway station  it was not more than a mile distant from the railway station and as i stood outside the house looking back upon the way i had come i could see the goods train running smoothly along the embankment in the valley i will not say that everything was utterly commonplace because i doubt if anything can be that except to utterly commonplace people and there my vanity steps in but i will take it on myself to say that anybody might see the house as i saw it any fine autumn morning  the manner of my lighting on it was this  i was travelling towards london out of the north intending to stop by the way to look at the house  my health required a temporary residence in the country and a friend of mine who knew that and who had happened to drive past the house had written to me to suggest it as a likely place  i had got into the train at midnight and had fallen asleep and had woke up and had sat looking out of window at the brilliant northern lights in the sky and had fallen asleep again and had woke up again to find the night gone with the usual discontented conviction on me that i hadnt been to sleep at allupon which question in the first imbecility of that condition i am ashamed to believe that i would have done wager by battle with the man who sat opposite me  that opposite man had had through the nightas that opposite man always hasseveral legs too many and all of them too long  in addition to this unreasonable conduct which was only to be expected of him he had had a pencil and a pocketbook and had been perpetually listening and taking notes  it had appeared to me that these aggravating notes related to the jolts and bumps of the carriage and i should have resigned myself to his taking them under a general supposition that he was in the civilengineering way of life if he had not sat staring straight over my head whenever he listened  he was a goggleeyed gentleman of a perplexed aspect and his demeanour became unbearable  it was a cold dead morning the sun not being up yet and when i had outwatched the paling light of the fires of the iron country and the curtain of heavy smoke that hung at once between me and the stars and between me and the day i turned to my fellowtraveller and said  i beg your pardon sir but do you observe anything particular in me  for really he appeared to be taking down either my travellingcap or my hair with a minuteness that was a liberty  the goggleeyed gentleman withdrew his eyes from behind me as if the back of the carriage were a hundred miles off and said with a lofty look of compassion for my insignificance  in you sirb  b sir said i growing warm  i have nothing to do with you sir returned the gentleman pray let me listeno  he enunciated this vowel after a pause and noted it down  at first i was alarmed for an express lunatic and no communication with the guard is a serious position  the thought came to my relief that the gentleman might be what is popularly called a rapper  one of a sect for some of whom i have the highest respect but whom i dont believe in  i was going to ask him the question when he took the bread out of my mouth  you will excuse me said the gentleman contemptuously if i am too much in advance of common humanity to trouble myself at all about it  i have passed the nightas indeed i pass the whole of my time nowin spiritual intercourse  o said i somewhat snappishly  the conferences of the night began continued the gentleman turning several leaves of his notebook with this message  evil communications corrupt good manners  sound said i but absolutely new  new from spirits returned the gentleman  i could only repeat my rather snappish o and ask if i might be favoured with the last communication  a bird in the hand said the gentleman reading his last entry with great solemnity is worth two in the bosh  truly i am of the same opinion said i but shouldnt it be bush  it came to me bosh returned the gentleman  the gentleman then informed me that the spirit of socrates had delivered this special revelation in the course of the night  my friend i hope you are pretty well  there are two in this railway carriage  how do you do  there are seventeen thousand four hundred and seventynine spirits here but you cannot see them  pythagoras is here  he is not at liberty to mention it but hopes you like travelling  galileo likewise had dropped in with this scientific intelligence  i am glad to see you amico come sta  water will freeze when it is cold enough  addio  in the course of the night also the following phenomena had occurred  bishop butler had insisted on spelling his name bubler for which offence against orthography and good manners he had been dismissed as out of temper john milton suspected of wilful mystification had repudiated the authorship of paradise lost and had introduced as joint authors of that poem two unknown gentlemen respectively named grungers and scadgingtone  and prince arthur nephew of king john of england had described himself as tolerably comfortable in the seventh circle where he was learning to paint on velvet under the direction of mrs trimmer and mary queen of scots  if this should meet the eye of the gentleman who favoured me with these disclosures i trust he will excuse my confessing that the sight of the rising sun and the contemplation of the magnificent order of the vast universe made me impatient of them  in a word i was so impatient of them that i was mightily glad to get out at the next station and to exchange these clouds and vapours for the free air of heaven  by that time it was a beautiful morning  as i walked away among such leaves as had already fallen from the golden brown and russet trees and as i looked around me on the wonders of creation and thought of the steady unchanging and harmonious laws by which they are sustained the gentlemans spiritual intercourse seemed to me as poor a piece of journeywork as ever this world saw  in which heathen state of mind i came within view of the house and stopped to examine it attentively  it was a solitary house standing in a sadly neglected garden  a pretty even square of some two acres  it was a house of about the time of george the second as stiff as cold as formal and in as bad taste as could possibly be desired by the most loyal admirer of the whole quartet of georges  it was uninhabited but had within a year or two been cheaply repaired to render it habitable i say cheaply because the work had been done in a surface manner and was already decaying as to the paint and plaster though the colours were fresh  a lopsided board drooped over the garden wall announcing that it was to let on very reasonable terms well furnished  it was much too closely and heavily shadowed by trees and in particular there were six tall poplars before the front windows which were excessively melancholy and the site of which had been extremely ill chosen  it was easy to see that it was an avoided housea house that was shunned by the village to which my eye was guided by a church spire some half a mile offa house that nobody would take  and the natural inference was that it had the reputation of being a haunted house  no period within the fourandtwenty hours of day and night is so solemn to me as the early morning  in the summertime i often rise very early and repair to my room to do a days work before breakfast and i am always on those occasions deeply impressed by the stillness and solitude around me  besides that there is something awful in the being surrounded by familiar faces asleepin the knowledge that those who are dearest to us and to whom we are dearest are profoundly unconscious of us in an impassive state anticipative of that mysterious condition to which we are all tendingthe stopped life the broken threads of yesterday the deserted seat the closed book the unfinished but abandoned occupation all are images of death  the tranquillity of the hour is the tranquillity of death  the colour and the chill have the same association  even a certain air that familiar household objects take upon them when they first emerge from the shadows of the night into the morning of being newer and as they used to be long ago has its counterpart in the subsidence of the worn face of maturity or age in death into the old youthful look  moreover i once saw the apparition of my father at this hour  he was alive and well and nothing ever came of it but i saw him in the daylight sitting with his back towards me on a seat that stood beside my bed  his head was resting on his hand and whether he was slumbering or grieving i could not discern  amazed to see him there i sat up moved my position leaned out of bed and watched him  as he did not move i spoke to him more than once  as he did not move then i became alarmed and laid my hand upon his shoulder as i thoughtand there was no such thing  for all these reasons and for others less easily and briefly statable i find the early morning to be my most ghostly time  any house would be more or less haunted to me in the early morning and a haunted house could scarcely address me to greater advantage than then  i walked on into the village with the desertion of this house upon my mind and i found the landlord of the little inn sanding his doorstep  i bespoke breakfast and broached the subject of the house  is it haunted i asked  the landlord looked at me shook his head and answered i say nothing  then it is haunted  well cried the landlord in an outburst of frankness that had the appearance of desperationi wouldnt sleep in it  why not  if i wanted to have all the bells in a house ring with nobody to ring em and all the doors in a house bang with nobody to bang em and all sorts of feet treading about with no feet there why then said the landlord id sleep in that house  is anything seen there  the landlord looked at me again and then with his former appearance of desperation called down his stableyard for ikey  the call produced a highshouldered young fellow with a round red face a short crop of sandy hair a very broad humorous mouth a turnedup nose and a great sleeved waistcoat of purple bars with motherofpearl buttons that seemed to be growing upon him and to be in a fair wayif it were not prunedof covering his head and overunning his boots  this gentleman wants to know said the landlord if anythings seen at the poplars  ooded woman with a howl said ikey in a state of great freshness  do you mean a cry  i mean a bird sir  a hooded woman with an owl  dear me  did you ever see her  i seen the howl  never the woman  not so plain as the howl but they always keeps together  has anybody ever seen the woman as plainly as the owl  lord bless you sir  lots  who  lord bless you sir  lots  the generaldealer opposite for instance who is opening his shop  perkins  bless you perkins wouldnt go anigh the place  no observed the young man with considerable feeling he ant overwise ant perkins but he ant such a fool as that  here the landlord murmured his confidence in perkinss knowing better  who isor who wasthe hooded woman with the owl  do you know  well said ikey holding up his cap with one hand while he scratched his head with the other they say in general that she was murdered and the howl he ooted the while  this very concise summary of the facts was all i could learn except that a young man as hearty and likely a young man as ever i see had been took with fits and held down in em after seeing the hooded woman  also that a personage dimly described as a hold chap a sort of oneeyed tramp answering to the name of joby unless you challenged him as greenwood and then he said why not and even if so mind your own business had encountered the hooded woman a matter of five or six times  but i was not materially assisted by these witnesses  inasmuch as the first was in california and the last was as ikey said and he was confirmed by the landlord anywheres  now although i regard with a hushed and solemn fear the mysteries between which and this state of existence is interposed the barrier of the great trial and change that fall on all the things that live and although i have not the audacity to pretend that i know anything of them i can no more reconcile the mere banging of doors ringing of bells creaking of boards and suchlike insignificances with the majestic beauty and pervading analogy of all the divine rules that i am permitted to understand than i had been able a little while before to yoke the spiritual intercourse of my fellow traveller to the chariot of the rising sun  moreover i had lived in two haunted housesboth abroad  in one of these an old italian palace which bore the reputation of being very badly haunted indeed and which had recently been twice abandoned on that account i lived eight months most tranquilly and pleasantly notwithstanding that the house had a score of mysterious bedrooms which were never used and possessed in one large room in which i sat reading times out of number at all hours and next to which i slept a haunted chamber of the first pretensions  i gently hinted these considerations to the landlord  and as to this particular house having a bad name i reasoned with him why how many things had bad names undeservedly and how easy it was to give bad names and did he not think that if he and i were persistently to whisper in the village that any weirdlooking old drunken tinker of the neighbourhood had sold himself to the devil he would come in time to be suspected of that commercial venture  all this wise talk was perfectly ineffective with the landlord i am bound to confess and was as dead a failure as ever i made in my life  to cut this part of the story short i was piqued about the haunted house and was already half resolved to take it  so after breakfast i got the keys from perkinss brotherinlaw a whip and harness maker who keeps the post office and is under submission to a most rigorous wife of the doubly seceding little emmanuel persuasion and went up to the house attended by my landlord and by ikey  within i found it as i had expected transcendently dismal  the slowly changing shadows waved on it from the heavy trees were doleful in the last degree the house was illplaced illbuilt illplanned and illfitted  it was damp it was not free from dry rot there was a flavour of rats in it and it was the gloomy victim of that indescribable decay which settles on all the work of mans hands whenever its not turned to mans account  the kitchens and offices were too large and too remote from each other  above stairs and below waste tracts of passage intervened between patches of fertility represented by rooms and there was a mouldy old well with a green growth upon it hiding like a murderous trap near the bottom of the backstairs under the double row of bells  one of these bells was labelled on a black ground in faded white letters master b  this they told me was the bell that rang the most  who was master b i asked  is it known what he did while the owl hooted  rang the bell said ikey  i was rather struck by the prompt dexterity with which this young man pitched his fur cap at the bell and rang it himself  it was a loud unpleasant bell and made a very disagreeable sound  the other bells were inscribed according to the names of the rooms to which their wires were conducted  as picture room double room clock room and the like  following master bs bell to its source i found that young gentleman to have had but indifferent thirdclass accommodation in a triangular cabin under the cockloft with a corner fireplace which master b must have been exceedingly small if he were ever able to warm himself at and a corner chimney piece like a pyramidal staircase to the ceiling for tom thumb  the papering of one side of the room had dropped down bodily with fragments of plaster adhering to it and almost blocked up the door it appeared that master b in his spiritual condition always made a point of pulling the paper down  neither the landlord nor ikey could suggest why he made such a fool of himself  except that the house had an immensely large rambling loft at top i made no other discoveries  it was moderately well furnished but sparely  some of the furnituresay a thirdwas as old as the house the rest was of various periods within the last halfcentury i was referred to a cornchandler in the marketplace of the county town to treat for the house  i went that day and i took it for six months  it was just the middle of october when i moved in with my maiden sister i venture to call her eightandthirty she is so very handsome sensible and engaging  we took with us a deaf stable man my bloodhound turk two women servants and a young person called an odd girl  i have reason to record of the attendant last enumerated who was one of the saint lawrences union female orphans that she was a fatal mistake and a disastrous engagement  the year was dying early the leaves were falling fast it was a raw cold day when we took possession and the gloom of the house was most depressing  the cook an amiable woman but of a weak turn of intellect burst into tears on beholding the kitchen and requested that her silver watch might be delivered over to her sister 2 tuppintocks gardens liggss walk clapham rise in the event of anything happening to her from the damp  streaker the housemaid feigned cheerfulness but was the greater martyr  the odd girl who had never been in the country alone was pleased and made arrangements for sowing an acorn in the garden outside the scullery window and rearing an oak  we went before dark through all the naturalas opposed to supernaturalmiseries incidental to our state  dispiriting reports ascended like the smoke from the basement in volumes and descended from the upper rooms  there was no rollingpin there was no salamander which failed to surprise me for i dont know what it is there was nothing in the house what there was was broken the last people must have lived like pigs what could the meaning of the landlord be  through these distresses the odd girl was cheerful and exemplary  but within four hours after dark we had got into a supernatural groove and the odd girl had seen eyes and was in hysterics  my sister and i had agreed to keep the haunting strictly to ourselves and my impression was and still is that i had not left ikey when he helped to unload the cart alone with the women or any one of them for one minute  nevertheless as i say the odd girl had seen eyes no other explanation could ever be drawn from her before nine and by ten oclock had had as much vinegar applied to her as would pickle a handsome salmon  i leave a discerning public to judge of my feelings when under these untoward circumstances at about halfpast ten oclock master bs bell began to ring in a most infuriated manner and turk howled until the house resounded with his lamentations  i hope i may never again be in a state of mind so unchristian as the mental frame in which i lived for some weeks respecting the memory of master b  whether his bell was rung by rats or mice or bats or wind or what other accidental vibration or sometimes by one cause sometimes another and sometimes by collusion i dont know but certain it is that it did ring two nights out of three until i conceived the happy idea of twisting master bs neckin other words breaking his bell short offand silencing that young gentleman as to my experience and belief for ever  but by that time the odd girl had developed such improving powers of catalepsy that she had become a shining example of that very inconvenient disorder  she would stiffen like a guy fawkes endowed with unreason on the most irrelevant occasions  i would address the servants in a lucid manner pointing out to them that i had painted master bs room and balked the paper and taken master bs bell away and balked the ringing and if they could suppose that that confounded boy had lived and died to clothe himself with no better behaviour than would most unquestionably have brought him and the sharpest particles of a birchbroom into close acquaintance in the present imperfect state of existence could they also suppose a mere poor human being such as i was capable by those contemptible means of counteracting and limiting the powers of the disembodied spirits of the dead or of any spiritsi say i would become emphatic and cogent not to say rather complacent in such an address when it would all go for nothing by reason of the odd girls suddenly stiffening from the toes upward and glaring among us like a parochial petrifaction  streaker the housemaid too had an attribute of a most discomfiting nature  i am unable to say whether she was of an usually lymphatic temperament or what else was the matter with her but this young woman became a mere distillery for the production of the largest and most transparent tears i ever met with  combined with these characteristics was a peculiar tenacity of hold in those specimens so that they didnt fall but hung upon her face and nose  in this condition and mildly and deplorably shaking her head her silence would throw me more heavily than the admirable crichton could have done in a verbal disputation for a purse of money  cook likewise always covered me with confusion as with a garment by neatly winding up the session with the protest that the ouse was wearing her out and by meekly repeating her last wishes regarding her silver watch  as to our nightly life the contagion of suspicion and fear was among us and there is no such contagion under the sky  hooded woman  according to the accounts we were in a perfect convent of hooded women  noises  with that contagion downstairs i myself have sat in the dismal parlour listening until i have heard so many and such strange noises that they would have chilled my blood if i had not warmed it by dashing out to make discoveries  try this in bed in the dead of the night  try this at your own comfortable fireside in the life of the night  you can fill any house with noises if you will until you have a noise for every nerve in your nervous system  i repeat the contagion of suspicion and fear was among us and there is no such contagion under the sky  the women their noses in a chronic state of excoriation from smellingsalts were always primed and loaded for a swoon and ready to go off with hair triggers  the two elder detached the odd girl on all expeditions that were considered doubly hazardous and she always established the reputation of such adventures by coming back cataleptic  if cook or streaker went overhead after dark we knew we should presently hear a bump on the ceiling and this took place so constantly that it was as if a fighting man were engaged to go about the house administering a touch of his art which i believe is called the auctioneer to every domestic he met with  it was in vain to do anything  it was in vain to be frightened for the moment in ones own person by a real owl and then to show the owl  it was in vain to discover by striking an accidental discord on the piano that turk always howled at particular notes and combinations  it was in vain to be a rhadamanthus with the bells and if an unfortunate bell rang without leave to have it down inexorably and silence it  it was in vain to fire up chimneys let torches down the well charge furiously into suspected rooms and recesses  we changed servants and it was no better  the new set ran away and a third set came and it was no better  at last our comfortable housekeeping got to be so disorganised and wretched that i one night dejectedly said to my sister  patty i begin to despair of our getting people to go on with us here and i think we must give this up  my sister who is a woman of immense spirit replied no john dont give it up  dont be beaten john  there is another way  and what is that said i  john returned my sister if we are not to be driven out of this house and that for no reason whatever that is apparent to you or me we must help ourselves and take the house wholly and solely into our own hands  but the servants said i  have no servants said my sister boldly  like most people in my grade of life i had never thought of the possibility of going on without those faithful obstructions  the notion was so new to me when suggested that i looked very doubtful we know they come here to be frightened and infect one another and we know they are frightened and do infect one another said my sister  with the exception of bottles i observed in a meditative tone  the deaf stableman  i kept him in my service and still keep him as a phenomenon of moroseness not to be matched in england  to be sure john assented my sister except bottles  and what does that go to prove  bottles talks to nobody and hears nobody unless he is absolutely roared at and what alarm has bottles ever given or taken  none  this was perfectly true the individual in question having retired every night at ten oclock to his bed over the coachhouse with no other company than a pitchfork and a pail of water  that the pail of water would have been over me and the pitchfork through me if i had put myself without announcement in bottless way after that minute i had deposited in my own mind as a fact worth remembering neither had bottles ever taken the least notice of any of our many uproars  an imperturbable and speechless man he had sat at his supper with streaker present in a swoon and the odd girl marble and had only put another potato in his cheek or profited by the general misery to help himself to beefsteak pie  and so continued my sister i exempt bottles  and considering john that the house is too large and perhaps too lonely to be kept well in hand by bottles you and me i propose that we cast about among our friends for a certain selected number of the most reliable and willingform a society here for three monthswait upon ourselves and one anotherlive cheerfully and sociallyand see what happens  i was so charmed with my sister that i embraced her on the spot and went into her plan with the greatest ardour  we were then in the third week of november but we took our measures so vigorously and were so well seconded by the friends in whom we confided that there was still a week of the month unexpired when our party all came down together merrily and mustered in the haunted house  i will mention in this place two small changes that i made while my sister and i were yet alone  it occurring to me as not improbable that turk howled in the house at night partly because he wanted to get out of it i stationed him in his kennel outside but unchained and i seriously warned the village that any man who came in his way must not expect to leave him without a rip in his own throat  i then casually asked ikey if he were a judge of a gun  on his saying yes sir i knows a good gun when i sees her i begged the favour of his stepping up to the house and looking at mine  shes a true one sir said ikey after inspecting a double barrelled rifle that i bought in new york a few years ago  no mistake about her sir  ikey said i dont mention it i have seen something in this house  no sir he whispered greedily opening his eyes  ooded lady sir  dont be frightened said i  it was a figure rather like you  lord sir  ikey said i shaking hands with him warmly  i may say affectionately if there is any truth in these ghoststories the greatest service i can do you is to fire at that figure  and i promise you by heaven and earth i will do it with this gun if i see it again  the young man thanked me and took his leave with some little precipitation after declining a glass of liquor  i imparted my secret to him because i had never quite forgotten his throwing his cap at the bell because i had on another occasion noticed something very like a fur cap lying not far from the bell one night when it had burst out ringing and because i had remarked that we were at our ghostliest whenever he came up in the evening to comfort the servants  let me do ikey no injustice  he was afraid of the house and believed in its being haunted and yet he would play false on the haunting side so surely as he got an opportunity the odd girls case was exactly similar  she went about the house in a state of real terror and yet lied monstrously and wilfully and invented many of the alarms she spread and made many of the sounds we heard  i had had my eye on the two and i know it  it is not necessary for me here to account for this preposterous state of mind i content myself with remarking that it is familiarly known to every intelligent man who has had fair medical legal or other watchful experience that it is as well established and as common a state of mind as any with which observers are acquainted and that it is one of the first elements above all others rationally to be suspected in and strictly looked for and separated from any question of this kind  to return to our party  the first thing we did when we were all assembled was to draw lots for bedrooms  that done and every bedroom and indeed the whole house having been minutely examined by the whole body we allotted the various household duties as if we had been on a gipsy party or a yachting party or a hunting party or were shipwrecked  i then recounted the floating rumours concerning the hooded lady the owl and master b  with others still more filmy which had floated about during our occupation relative to some ridiculous old ghost of the female gender who went up and down carrying the ghost of a round table and also to an impalpable jackass whom nobody was ever able to catch  some of these ideas i really believe our people below had communicated to one another in some diseased way without conveying them in words we then gravely called one another to witness that we were not there to be deceived or to deceivewhich we considered pretty much the same thingand that with a serious sense of responsibility we would be strictly true to one another and would strictly follow out the truth  the understanding was established that any one who heard unusual noises in the night and who wished to trace them should knock at my door lastly that on twelfth night the last night of holy christmas all our individual experiences since that then present hour of our coming together in the haunted house should be brought to light for the good of all and that we would hold our peace on the subject till then unless on some remarkable provocation to break silence  we were in number and in character as follows  firstto get my sister and myself out of the waythere were we two  in the drawing of lots my sister drew her own room and i drew master bs  next there was our first cousin john herschel so called after the great astronomer  than whom i suppose a better man at a telescope does not breathe  with him was his wife  a charming creature to whom he had been married in the previous spring  i thought it under the circumstances rather imprudent to bring her because there is no knowing what even a false alarm may do at such a time but i suppose he knew his own business best and i must say that if she had been my wife i never could have left her endearing and bright face behind  they drew the clock room  alfred starling an uncommonly agreeable young fellow of eightandtwenty for whom i have the greatest liking was in the double room mine usually and designated by that name from having a dressingroom within it with two large and cumbersome windows which no wedges i was ever able to make would keep from shaking in any weather wind or no wind  alfred is a young fellow who pretends to be fast another word for loose as i understand the term but who is much too good and sensible for that nonsense and who would have distinguished himself before now if his father had not unfortunately left him a small independence of two hundred a year on the strength of which his only occupation in life has been to spend six  i am in hopes however that his banker may break or that he may enter into some speculation guaranteed to pay twenty per cent for i am convinced that if he could only be ruined his fortune is made  belinda bates bosom friend of my sister and a most intellectual amiable and delightful girl got the picture room  she has a fine genius for poetry combined with real business earnestness and goes into use an expression of alfredsfor womans mission womans rights womans wrongs and everything that is womans with a capital w or is not and ought to be or is and ought not to be  most praiseworthy my dear and heaven prosper you i whispered to her on the first night of my taking leave of her at the pictureroom door but dont overdo it  and in respect of the great necessity there is my darling for more employments being within the reach of woman than our civilisation has as yet assigned to her dont fly at the unfortunate men even those men who are at first sight in your way as if they were the natural oppressors of your sex for trust me belinda they do sometimes spend their wages among wives and daughters sisters mothers aunts and grandmothers and the play is really not all wolf and red ridinghood but has other parts in it  however i digress  belinda as i have mentioned occupied the picture room  we had but three other chambers  the corner room the cupboard room and the garden room  my old friend jack governor slung his hammock as he called it in the corner room  i have always regarded jack as the finestlooking sailor that ever sailed  he is gray now but as handsome as he was a quarter of a century agonay handsomer  a portly cheery wellbuilt figure of a broadshouldered man with a frank smile a brilliant dark eye and a rich dark eyebrow  i remember those under darker hair and they look all the better for their silver setting  he has been wherever his union namesake flies has jack and i have met old shipmates of his away in the mediterranean and on the other side of the atlantic who have beamed and brightened at the casual mention of his name and have cried you know jack governor  then you know a prince of men  that he is  and so unmistakably a naval officer that if you were to meet him coming out of an esquimaux snowhut in seals skin you would be vaguely persuaded he was in full naval uniform  jack once had that bright clear eye of his on my sister but it fell out that he married another lady and took her to south america where she died  this was a dozen years ago or more  he brought down with him to our haunted house a little cask of salt beef for he is always convinced that all salt beef not of his own pickling is mere carrion and invariably when he goes to london packs a piece in his portmanteau  he had also volunteered to bring with him one nat beaver an old comrade of his captain of a merchantman mr beaver with a thickset wooden face and figure and apparently as hard as a block all over proved to be an intelligent man with a world of watery experiences in him and great practical knowledge at times there was a curious nervousness about him apparently the lingering result of some old illness but it seldom lasted many minutes  he got the cupboard room and lay there next to mr undery my friend and solicitor  who came down in an amateur capacity to go through with it as he said and who plays whist better than the whole law list from the red cover at the beginning to the red cover at the end  i never was happier in my life and i believe it was the universal feeling among us  jack governor always a man of wonderful resources was chief cook and made some of the best dishes i ever ate including unapproachable curries  my sister was pastrycook and confectioner  starling and i were cooks mate turn and turn about and on special occasions the chief cook pressed mr beaver  we had a great deal of outdoor sport and exercise but nothing was neglected within and there was no illhumour or misunderstanding among us and our evenings were so delightful that we had at least one good reason for being reluctant to go to bed  we had a few night alarms in the beginning  on the first night i was knocked up by jack with a most wonderful ships lantern in his hand like the gills of some monster of the deep who informed me that he was going aloft to the main truck to have the weathercock down  it was a stormy night and i remonstrated but jack called my attention to its making a sound like a cry of despair and said somebody would be hailing a ghost presently if it wasnt done so up to the top of the house where i could hardly stand for the wind we went accompanied by mr beaver and there jack lantern and all with mr beaver after him swarmed up to the top of a cupola some two dozen feet above the chimneys and stood upon nothing particular coolly knocking the weathercock off until they both got into such good spirits with the wind and the height that i thought they would never come down  another night they turned out again and had a chimneycowl off  another night they cut a sobbing and gulping waterpipe away  another night they found out something else  on several occasions they both in the coolest manner simultaneously dropped out of their respective bedroom windows hand over hand by their counterpanes to overhaul something mysterious in the garden  the engagement among us was faithfully kept and nobody revealed anything  all we knew was if any ones room were haunted no one looked the worse for it    chapter iithe ghost in master bs room    when i established myself in the triangular garret which had gained so distinguished a reputation my thoughts naturally turned to master b  my speculations about him were uneasy and manifold whether his christian name was benjamin bissextile from his having been born in leap year bartholomew or bill  whether the initial letter belonged to his family name and that was baxter black brown barker buggins baker or bird  whether he was a foundling and had been baptized b  whether he was a lionhearted boy and b was short for briton or for bull  whether he could possibly have been kith and kin to an illustrious lady who brightened my own childhood and had come of the blood of the brilliant mother bunch  with these profitless meditations i tormented myself much  i also carried the mysterious letter into the appearance and pursuits of the deceased wondering whether he dressed in blue wore boots he couldnt have been bald was a boy of brains liked books was good at bowling had any skill as a boxer even in his buoyant boyhood bathed from a bathingmachine at bognor bangor bournemouth brighton or broadstairs like a bounding billiard ball  so from the first i was haunted by the letter b  it was not long before i remarked that i never by any hazard had a dream of master b or of anything belonging to him  but the instant i awoke from sleep at whatever hour of the night my thoughts took him up and roamed away trying to attach his initial letter to something that would fit it and keep it quiet  for six nights i had been worried this in master bs room when i began to perceive that things were going wrong  the first appearance that presented itself was early in the morning when it was but just daylight and no more  i was standing shaving at my glass when i suddenly discovered to my consternation and amazement that i was shavingnot myselfi am fiftybut a boy apparently master b  i trembled and looked over my shoulder nothing there  i looked again in the glass and distinctly saw the features and expression of a boy who was shaving not to get rid of a beard but to get one  extremely troubled in my mind i took a few turns in the room and went back to the lookingglass resolved to steady my hand and complete the operation in which i had been disturbed  opening my eyes which i had shut while recovering my firmness i now met in the glass looking straight at me the eyes of a young man of four or five and twenty  terrified by this new ghost i closed my eyes and made a strong effort to recover myself  opening them again i saw shaving his cheek in the glass my father who has long been dead  nay i even saw my grandfather too whom i never did see in my life  although naturally much affected by these remarkable visitations i determined to keep my secret until the time agreed upon for the present general disclosure  agitated by a multitude of curious thoughts i retired to my room that night prepared to encounter some new experience of a spectral character  nor was my preparation needless for waking from an uneasy sleep at exactly two oclock in the morning what were my feelings to find that i was sharing my bed with the skeleton of master b  i sprang up and the skeleton sprang up also  i then heard a plaintive voice saying where am i  what is become of me and looking hard in that direction perceived the ghost of master b  the young spectre was dressed in an obsolete fashion  or rather was not so much dressed as put into a case of inferior pepperand salt cloth made horrible by means of shining buttons  i observed that these buttons went in a double row over each shoulder of the young ghost and appeared to descend his back  he wore a frill round his neck  his right hand which i distinctly noticed to be inky was laid upon his stomach connecting this action with some feeble pimples on his countenance and his general air of nausea i concluded this ghost to be the ghost of a boy who had habitually taken a great deal too much medicine  where am i said the little spectre in a pathetic voice  and why was i born in the calomel days and why did i have all that calomel given me  i replied with sincere earnestness that upon my soul i couldnt tell him  where is my little sister said the ghost and where my angelic little wife and where is the boy i went to school with  i entreated the phantom to be comforted and above all things to take heart respecting the loss of the boy he went to school with  i represented to him that probably that boy never did within human experience come out well when discovered  i urged that i myself had in later life turned up several boys whom i went to school with and none of them had at all answered  i expressed my humble belief that that boy never did answer  i represented that he was a mythic character a delusion and a snare  i recounted how the last time i found him i found him at a dinner party behind a wall of white cravat with an inconclusive opinion on every possible subject and a power of silent boredom absolutely titanic  i related how on the strength of our having been together at old doylances he had asked himself to breakfast with me a social offence of the largest magnitude how fanning my weak embers of belief in doylances boys i had let him in and how he had proved to be a fearful wanderer about the earth pursuing the race of adam with inexplicable notions concerning the currency and with a proposition that the bank of england should on pain of being abolished instantly strike off and circulate god knows how many thousand millions of tenandsixpenny notes  the ghost heard me in silence and with a fixed stare  barber it apostrophised me when i had finished  barber i repeatedfor i am not of that profession  condemned said the ghost to shave a constant change of customersnow menow a young mannow thyself as thou artnow thy fathernow thy grandfather condemned too to lie down with a skeleton every night and to rise with it every morning  i shuddered on hearing this dismal announcement  barber  pursue me  i had felt even before the words were uttered that i was under a spell to pursue the phantom  i immediately did so and was in master bs room no longer  most people know what long and fatiguing night journeys had been forced upon the witches who used to confess and who no doubt told the exact truthparticularly as they were always assisted with leading questions and the torture was always ready  i asseverate that during my occupation of master bs room i was taken by the ghost that haunted it on expeditions fully as long and wild as any of those  assuredly i was presented to no shabby old man with a goats horns and tail something between pan and an old clothesman holding conventional receptions as stupid as those of real life and less decent but i came upon other things which appeared to me to have more meaning  confident that i speak the truth and shall be believed i declare without hesitation that i followed the ghost in the first instance on a broomstick and afterwards on a rockinghorse  the very smell of the animals paintespecially when i brought it out by making him warmi am ready to swear to  i followed the ghost afterwards in a hackney coach an institution with the peculiar smell of which the present generation is unacquainted but to which i am again ready to swear as a combination of stable dog with the mange and very old bellows  in this i appeal to previous generations to confirm or refute me  i pursued the phantom on a headless donkey at least upon a donkey who was so interested in the state of his stomach that his head was always down there investigating it on ponies expressly born to kick up behind on roundabouts and swings from fairs in the first cabanother forgotten institution where the fare regularly got into bed and was tucked up with the driver  not to trouble you with a detailed account of all my travels in pursuit of the ghost of master b which were longer and more wonderful than those of sinbad the sailor i will confine myself to one experience from which you may judge of many  i was marvellously changed  i was myself yet not myself  i was conscious of something within me which has been the same all through my life and which i have always recognised under all its phases and varieties as never altering and yet i was not the i who had gone to bed in master bs room  i had the smoothest of faces and the shortest of legs and i had taken another creature like myself also with the smoothest of faces and the shortest of legs behind a door and was confiding to him a proposition of the most astounding nature  this proposition was that we should have a seraglio  the other creature assented warmly  he had no notion of respectability neither had i  it was the custom of the east it was the way of the good caliph haroun alraschid let me have the corrupted name again for once it is so scented with sweet memories the usage was highly laudable and most worthy of imitation  o yes  let us said the other creature with a jump have a seraglio  it was not because we entertained the faintest doubts of the meritorious character of the oriental establishment we proposed to import that we perceived it must be kept a secret from miss griffin  it was because we knew miss griffin to be bereft of human sympathies and incapable of appreciating the greatness of the great haroun  mystery impenetrably shrouded from miss griffin then let us entrust it to miss bule  we were ten in miss griffins establishment by hampstead ponds eight ladies and two gentlemen  miss bule whom i judge to have attained the ripe age of eight or nine took the lead in society  i opened the subject to her in the course of the day and proposed that she should become the favourite  miss bule after struggling with the diffidence so natural to and charming in her adorable sex expressed herself as flattered by the idea but wished to know how it was proposed to provide for miss pipson  miss bulewho was understood to have vowed towards that young lady a friendship halves and no secrets until death on the church service and lessons complete in two volumes with case and lockmiss bule said she could not as the friend of pipson disguise from herself or me that pipson was not one of the common  now miss pipson having curly hair and blue eyes which was my idea of anything mortal and feminine that was called fair i promptly replied that i regarded miss pipson in the light of a fair circassian  and what then miss bule pensively asked  i replied that she must be inveigled by a merchant brought to me veiled and purchased as a slave  the other creature had already fallen into the second male place in the state and was set apart for grand vizier  he afterwards resisted this disposal of events but had his hair pulled until he yielded  shall i not be jealous miss bule inquired casting down her eyes  zobeide no i replied you will ever be the favourite sultana the first place in my heart and on my throne will be ever yours  miss bule upon that assurance consented to propound the idea to her seven beautiful companions  it occurring to me in the course of the same day that we knew we could trust a grinning and good natured soul called tabby who was the serving drudge of the house and had no more figure than one of the beds and upon whose face there was always more or less blacklead i slipped into miss bules hand after supper a little note to that effect dwelling on the blacklead as being in a manner deposited by the finger of providence pointing tabby out for mesrour the celebrated chief of the blacks of the hareem  there were difficulties in the formation of the desired institution as there are in all combinations  the other creature showed himself of a low character and when defeated in aspiring to the throne pretended to have conscientious scruples about prostrating himself before the caliph wouldnt call him commander of the faithful spoke of him slightingly and inconsistently as a mere chap said he the other creature wouldnt playplayand was otherwise coarse and offensive  this meanness of disposition was however put down by the general indignation of an united seraglio and i became blessed in the smiles of eight of the fairest of the daughters of men  the smiles could only be bestowed when miss griffin was looking another way and only then in a very wary manner for there was a legend among the followers of the prophet that she saw with a little round ornament in the middle of the pattern on the back of her shawl  but every day after dinner for an hour we were all together and then the favourite and the rest of the royal hareem competed who should most beguile the leisure of the serene haroun reposing from the cares of statewhich were generally as in most affairs of state of an arithmetical character the commander of the faithful being a fearful boggler at a sum  on these occasions the devoted mesrour chief of the blacks of the hareem was always in attendance miss griffin usually ringing for that officer at the same time with great vehemence but never acquitted himself in a manner worthy of his historical reputation in the first place his bringing a broom into the divan of the caliph even when haroun wore on his shoulders the red robe of anger miss pipsons pelisse though it might be got over for the moment was never to be quite satisfactorily accounted for  in the second place his breaking out into grinning exclamations of lork you pretties was neither eastern nor respectful  in the third place when specially instructed to say bismillah he always said hallelujah  this officer unlike his class was too goodhumoured altogether kept his mouth open far too wide expressed approbation to an incongruous extent and even onceit was on the occasion of the purchase of the fair circassian for five hundred thousand purses of gold and cheap tooembraced the slave the favourite and the caliph all round  parenthetically let me say god bless mesrour and may there have been sons and daughters on that tender bosom softening many a hard day since  miss griffin was a model of propriety and i am at a loss to imagine what the feelings of the virtuous woman would have been if she had known when she paraded us down the hampstead road two and two that she was walking with a stately step at the head of polygamy and mahomedanism  i believe that a mysterious and terrible joy with which the contemplation of miss griffin in this unconscious state inspired us and a grim sense prevalent among us that there was a dreadful power in our knowledge of what miss griffin who knew all things that could be learnt out of book didnt know were the main spring of the preservation of our secret  it was wonderfully kept but was once upon the verge of selfbetrayal  the danger and escape occurred upon a sunday  we were all ten ranged in a conspicuous part of the gallery at church with miss griffin at our headas we were every sundayadvertising the establishment in an unsecular sort of waywhen the description of solomon in his domestic glory happened to be read  the moment that monarch was thus referred to conscience whispered me thou too haroun  the officiating minister had a cast in his eye and it assisted conscience by giving him the appearance of reading personally at me  a crimson blush attended by a fearful perspiration suffused my features  the grand vizier became more dead than alive and the whole seraglio reddened as if the sunset of bagdad shone direct upon their lovely faces  at this portentous time the awful griffin rose and balefully surveyed the children of islam  my own impression was that church and state had entered into a conspiracy with miss griffin to expose us and that we should all be put into white sheets and exhibited in the centre aisle  but so westerlyif i may be allowed the expression as opposite to eastern associationswas miss griffins sense of rectitude that she merely suspected apples and we were saved  i have called the seraglio united  upon the question solely whether the commander of the faithful durst exercise a right of kissing in that sanctuary of the palace were its peerless inmates divided  zobeide asserted a counterright in the favourite to scratch and the fair circassian put her face for refuge into a green baize bag originally designed for books  on the other hand a young antelope of transcendent beauty from the fruitful plains of camden town whence she had been brought by traders in the half yearly caravan that crossed the intermediate desert after the holidays held more liberal opinions but stipulated for limiting the benefit of them to that dog and son of a dog the grand vizier who had no rights and was not in question  at length the difficulty was compromised by the installation of a very youthful slave as deputy  she raised upon a stool officially received upon her cheeks the salutes intended by the gracious haroun for other sultanas and was privately rewarded from the coffers of the ladies of the hareem  and now it was at the full height of enjoyment of my bliss that i became heavily troubled  i began to think of my mother and what she would say to my taking home at midsummer eight of the most beautiful of the daughters of men but all unexpected  i thought of the number of beds we made up at our house of my fathers income and of the baker and my despondency redoubled  the seraglio and malicious vizier divining the cause of their lords unhappiness did their utmost to augment it  they professed unbounded fidelity and declared that they would live and die with him  reduced to the utmost wretchedness by these protestations of attachment i lay awake for hours at a time ruminating on my frightful lot  in my despair i think i might have taken an early opportunity of falling on my knees before miss griffin avowing my resemblance to solomon and praying to be dealt with according to the outraged laws of my country if an unthoughtof means of escape had not opened before me  one day we were out walking two and twoon which occasion the vizier had his usual instructions to take note of the boy at the turnpike and if he profanely gazed which he always did at the beauties of the hareem to have him bowstrung in the course of the nightand it happened that our hearts were veiled in gloom  an unaccountable action on the part of the antelope had plunged the state into disgrace  that charmer on the representation that the previous day was her birthday and that vast treasures had been sent in a hamper for its celebration both baseless assertions had secretly but most pressingly invited thirtyfive neighbouring princes and princesses to a ball and supper  with a special stipulation that they were not to be fetched till twelve  this wandering of the antelopes fancy led to the surprising arrival at miss griffins door in divers equipages and under various escorts of a great company in full dress who were deposited on the top step in a flush of high expectancy and who were dismissed in tears  at the beginning of the double knocks attendant on these ceremonies the antelope had retired to a back attic and bolted herself in and at every new arrival miss griffin had gone so much more and more distracted that at last she had been seen to tear her front ultimate capitulation on the part of the offender had been followed by solitude in the linencloset bread and water and a lecture to all of vindictive length in which miss griffin had used expressions  firstly i believe you all of you knew of it secondly every one of you is as wicked as another thirdly a pack of little wretches  under these circumstances we were walking drearily along and i especially with my  moosulmaun responsibilities heavy on me was in a very low state of mind when a strange man accosted miss griffin and after walking on at her side for a little while and talking with her looked at me  supposing him to be a minion of the law and that my hour was come i instantly ran away with the general purpose of making for egypt  the whole seraglio cried out when they saw me making off as fast as my legs would carry me i had an impression that the first turning on the left and round by the publichouse would be the shortest way to the pyramids miss griffin screamed after me the faithless vizier ran after me and the boy at the turnpike dodged me into a corner like a sheep and cut me off  nobody scolded me when i was taken and brought back miss griffin only said with a stunning gentleness this was very curious  why had i run away when the gentleman looked at me  if i had had any breath to answer with i dare say i should have made no answer having no breath i certainly made none  miss griffin and the strange man took me between them and walked me back to the palace in a sort of state but not at all as i couldnt help feeling with astonishment in culprit state  when we got there we went into a room by ourselves and miss griffin called in to her assistance mesrour chief of the dusky guards of the hareem  mesrour on being whispered to began to shed tears  bless you my precious said that officer turning to me your pas took bitter bad  i asked with a fluttered heart is he very ill  lord temper the wind to you my lamb said the good mesrour kneeling down that i might have a comforting shoulder for my head to rest on your pas dead  haroun alraschid took to flight at the words the seraglio vanished from that moment i never again saw one of the eight of the fairest of the daughters of men  i was taken home and there was debt at home as well as death and we had a sale there  my own little bed was so superciliously looked upon by a power unknown to me hazily called the trade that a brass coalscuttle a roastingjack and a birdcage were obliged to be put into it to make a lot of it and then it went for a song  so i heard mentioned and i wondered what song and thought what a dismal song it must have been to sing  then i was sent to a great cold bare school of big boys where everything to eat and wear was thick and clumpy without being enough where everybody largo and small was cruel where the boys knew all about the sale before i got there and asked me what i had fetched and who had bought me and hooted at me going going gone  i never whispered in that wretched place that i had been haroun or had had a seraglio  for i knew that if i mentioned my reverses i should be so worried that i should have to drown myself in the muddy pond near the playground which looked like the beer  ah me ah me  no other ghost has haunted the boys room my friends since i have occupied it than the ghost of my own childhood the ghost of my own innocence the ghost of my own airy belief  many a time have i pursued the phantom  never with this mans stride of mine to come up with it never with these mans hands of mine to touch it never more to this mans heart of mine to hold it in its purity  and here you see me working out as cheerfully and thankfully as i may my doom of shaving in the glass a constant change of customers and of lying down and rising up with the skeleton allotted to me for my mortal companion     the trial for murder     i have always noticed a prevalent want of courage even among persons of superior intelligence and culture as to imparting their own psychological experiences when those have been of a strange sort  almost all men are afraid that what they could relate in such wise would find no parallel or response in a listeners internal life and might be suspected or laughed at  a truthful traveller who should have seen some extraordinary creature in the likeness of a seaserpent would have no fear of mentioning it but the same traveller having had some singular presentiment impulse vagary of thought vision socalled dream or other remarkable mental impression would hesitate considerably before he would own to it to this reticence i attribute much of the obscurity in which such subjects are involved  we do not habitually communicate our experiences of these subjective things as we do our experiences of objective creation  the consequence is that the general stock of experience in this regard appears exceptional and really is so in respect of being miserably imperfect  in what i am going to relate i have no intention of setting up opposing or supporting any theory whatever  i know the history of the bookseller of berlin i have studied the case of the wife of a late astronomer royal as related by sir david brewster and i have followed the minutest details of a much more remarkable case of spectral illusion occurring within my private circle of friends  it may be necessary to state as to this last that the sufferer a lady was in no degree however distant related to me  a mistaken assumption on that head might suggest an explanation of a part of my own casebut only a partwhich would be wholly without foundation  it cannot be referred to my inheritance of any developed peculiarity nor had i ever before any at all similar experience nor have i ever had any at all similar experience since  it does not signify how many years ago or how few a certain murder was committed in england which attracted great attention  we hear more than enough of murderers as they rise in succession to their atrocious eminence and i would bury the memory of this particular brute if i could as his body was buried in newgate jail  i purposely abstain from giving any direct clue to the criminals individuality  when the murder was first discovered no suspicion fellor i ought rather to say for i cannot be too precise in my facts it was nowhere publicly hinted that any suspicion fellon the man who was afterwards brought to trial  as no reference was at that time made to him in the newspapers it is obviously impossible that any description of him can at that time have been given in the newspapers  it is essential that this fact be remembered  unfolding at breakfast my morning paper containing the account of that first discovery i found it to be deeply interesting and i read it with close attention  i read it twice if not three times the discovery had been made in a bedroom and when i laid down the paper i was aware of a flashrushflowi do not know what to call itno word i can find is satisfactorily descriptivein which i seemed to see that bedroom passing through my room like a picture impossibly painted on a running river  though almost instantaneous in its passing it was perfectly clear so clear that i distinctly and with a sense of relief observed the absence of the dead body from the bed  it was in no romantic place that i had this curious sensation but in chambers in piccadilly very near to the corner of st jamess street  it was entirely new to me  i was in my easychair at the moment and the sensation was accompanied with a peculiar shiver which started the chair from its position  but it is to be noted that the chair ran easily on castors  i went to one of the windows there are two in the room and the room is on the second floor to refresh my eyes with the moving objects down in piccadilly  it was a bright autumn morning and the street was sparkling and cheerful the wind was high  as i looked out it brought down from the park a quantity of fallen leaves which a gust took and whirled into a spiral pillar  as the pillar fell and the leaves dispersed i saw two men on the opposite side of the way going from west to east they were one behind the other  the foremost man often looked back over his shoulder  the second man followed him at a distance of some thirty paces with his right hand menacingly raised  first the singularity and steadiness of this threatening gesture in so public a thoroughfare attracted my attention and next the more remarkable circumstance that nobody heeded it  both men threaded their way among the other passengers with a smoothness hardly consistent even with the action of walking on a pavement and no single creature that i could see gave them place touched them or looked after them  in passing before my windows they both stared up at me  i saw their two faces very distinctly and i knew that i could recognise them anywhere  not that i had consciously noticed anything very remarkable in either face except that the man who went first had an unusually lowering appearance and that the face of the man who followed him was of the colour of impure wax  i am a bachelor and my valet and his wife constitute my whole establishment  my occupation is in a certain branch bank and i wish that my duties as head of a department were as light as they are popularly supposed to be  they kept me in town that autumn when i stood in need of change  i was not ill but i was not well my reader is to make the most that can be reasonably made of my feeling jaded having a depressing sense upon me of a monotonous life and being slightly dyspeptic  i am assured by my renowned doctor that my real state of health at that time justifies no stronger description and i quote his own from his written answer to my request for it  as the circumstances of the murder gradually unravelling took stronger and stronger possession of the public mind i kept them away from mine by knowing as little about them as was possible in the midst of the universal excitement  but i knew that a verdict of wilful murder had been found against the suspected murderer and that he had been committed to newgate for trial  i also knew that his trial had been postponed over one sessions of the central criminal court on the ground of general prejudice and want of time for the preparation of the defence  i may further have known but i believe i did not when or about when the sessions to which his trial stood postponed would come on  my sittingroom bedroom and dressingroom are all on one floor with the last there is no communication but through the bedroom true there is a door in it once communicating with the staircase but a part of the fitting of my bath has beenand had then been for some yearsfixed across it  at the same period and as a part of the same arrangementthe door had been nailed up and canvased over  i was standing in my bedroom late one night giving some directions to my servant before he went to bed  my face was towards the only available door of communication with the dressingroom and it was closed  my servants back was towards that door  while i was speaking to him i saw it open and a man look in who very earnestly and mysteriously beckoned to me  that man was the man who had gone second of the two along piccadilly and whose face was of the colour of impure wax  the figure having beckoned drew back and closed the door  with no longer pause than was made by my crossing the bedroom i opened the dressingroom door and looked in  i had a lighted candle already in my hand  i felt no inward expectation of seeing the figure in the dressingroom and i did not see it there  conscious that my servant stood amazed i turned round to him and said  derrick could you believe that in my cool senses i fancied i saw a  as i there laid my hand upon his breast with a sudden start he trembled violently and said o lord yes sir  a dead man beckoning  now i do not believe that this john derrick my trusty and attached servant for more than twenty years had any impression whatever of having seen any such figure until i touched him  the change in him was so startling when i touched him that i fully believe he derived his impression in some occult manner from me at that instant  i bade john derrick bring some brandy and i gave him a dram and was glad to take one myself  of what had preceded that nights phenomenon i told him not a single word  reflecting on it i was absolutely certain that i had never seen that face before except on the one occasion in piccadilly  comparing its expression when beckoning at the door with its expression when it had stared up at me as i stood at my window i came to the conclusion that on the first occasion it had sought to fasten itself upon my memory and that on the second occasion it had made sure of being immediately remembered  i was not very comfortable that night though i felt a certainty difficult to explain that the figure would not return  at daylight i fell into a heavy sleep from which i was awakened by john derricks coming to my bedside with a paper in his hand  this paper it appeared had been the subject of an altercation at the door between its bearer and my servant  it was a summons to me to serve upon a jury at the forthcoming sessions of the central criminal court at the old bailey  i had never before been summoned on such a jury as john derrick well knew  he believedi am not certain at this hour whether with reason or otherwisethat that class of jurors were customarily chosen on a lower qualification than mine and he had at first refused to accept the summons  the man who served it had taken the matter very coolly  he had said that my attendance or nonattendance was nothing to him there the summons was and i should deal with it at my own peril and not at his  for a day or two i was undecided whether to respond to this call or take no notice of it  i was not conscious of the slightest mysterious bias influence or attraction one way or other  of that i am as strictly sure as of every other statement that i make here  ultimately i decided as a break in the monotony of my life that i would go  the appointed morning was a raw morning in the month of november there was a dense brown fog in piccadilly and it became positively black and in the last degree oppressive east of temple bar  i found the passages and staircases of the courthouse flaringly lighted with gas and the court itself similarly illuminated  i think that until i was conducted by officers into the old court and saw its crowded state i did not know that the murderer was to be tried that day  i think that until i was so helped into the old court with considerable difficulty i did not know into which of the two courts sitting my summons would take me  but this must not be received as a positive assertion for i am not completely satisfied in my mind on either point  i took my seat in the place appropriated to jurors in waiting and i looked about the court as well as i could through the cloud of fog and breath that was heavy in it  i noticed the black vapour hanging like a murky curtain outside the great windows and i noticed the stifled sound of wheels on the straw or tan that was littered in the street also the hum of the people gathered there which a shrill whistle or a louder song or hail than the rest occasionally pierced  soon afterwards the judges two in number entered and took their seats  the buzz in the court was awfully hushed  the direction was given to put the murderer to the bar  he appeared there  and in that same instant i recognised in him the first of the two men who had gone down piccadilly  if my name had been called then i doubt if i could have answered to it audibly  but it was called about sixth or eighth in the panel and i was by that time able to say here  now observe  as i stepped into the box the prisoner who had been looking on attentively but with no sign of concern became violently agitated and beckoned to his attorney  the prisoners wish to challenge me was so manifest that it occasioned a pause during which the attorney with his hand upon the dock whispered with his client and shook his head  i afterwards had it from that gentleman that the prisoners first affrighted words to him were at all hazards challenge that man  but that as he would give no reason for it and admitted that he had not even known my name until he heard it called and i appeared it was not done  both on the ground already explained that i wish to avoid reviving the unwholesome memory of that murderer and also because a detailed account of his long trial is by no means indispensable to my narrative i shall confine myself closely to such incidents in the ten days and nights during which we the jury were kept together as directly bear on my own curious personal experience  it is in that and not in the murderer that i seek to interest my reader it is to that and not to a page of the newgate calendar that i beg attention  i was chosen foreman of the jury  on the second morning of the trial after evidence had been taken for two hours i heard the church clocks strike happening to cast my eyes over my brother jurymen i found an inexplicable difficulty in counting them  i counted them several times yet always with the same difficulty  in short i made them one too many  i touched the brother jurymen whose place was next me and i whispered to him oblige me by counting us  he looked surprised by the request but turned his head and counted why says he suddenly we are thirt but no its not possible  no  we are twelve  according to my counting that day we were always right in detail but in the gross we were always one too many  there was no appearanceno figureto account for it but i had now an inward foreshadowing of the figure that was surely coming  the jury were housed at the london tavern  we all slept in one large room on separate tables and we were constantly in the charge and under the eye of the officer sworn to hold us in safekeeping i see no reason for suppressing the real name of that officer  he was intelligent highly polite and obliging and i was glad to hear much respected in the city  he had an agreeable presence good eyes enviable black whiskers and a fine sonorous voice  his name was mr harker  when we turned into our twelve beds at night mr harkers bed was drawn across the door  on the night of the second day not being disposed to lie down and seeing mr harker sitting on his bed i went and sat beside him and offered him a pinch of snuff  as mr harkers hand touched mine in taking it from my box a peculiar shiver crossed him and he said who is this  following mr harkers eyes and looking along the room i saw again the figure i expectedthe second of the two men who had gone down piccadilly  i rose and advanced a few steps then stopped and looked round at mr harker  he was quite unconcerned laughed and said in a pleasant way i thought for a moment we had a thirteenth juryman without a bed  but i see it is the moonlight  making no revelation to mr harker but inviting him to take a walk with me to the end of the room i watched what the figure did  it stood for a few moments by the bedside of each of my eleven brother jurymen close to the pillow  it always went to the righthand side of the bed and always passed out crossing the foot of the next bed it seemed from the action of the head merely to look down pensively at each recumbent figure  it took no notice of me or of my bed which was that nearest to mr harkers  it seemed to go out where the moonlight came in through a high window as by an aerial flight of stairs  next morning at breakfast it appeared that everybody present had dreamed of the murdered man last night except myself and mr harker  i now felt as convinced that the second man who had gone down piccadilly was the murdered man so to speak as if it had been borne into my comprehension by his immediate testimony  but even this took place and in a manner for which i was not at all prepared  on the fifth day of the trial when the case for the prosecution was drawing to a close a miniature of the murdered man missing from his bedroom upon the discovery of the deed and afterwards found in a hidingplace where the murderer had been seen digging was put in evidence  having been identified by the witness under examination it was handed up to the bench and thence handed down to be inspected by the jury  as an officer in a black gown was making his way with it across to me the figure of the second man who had gone down piccadilly impetuously started from the crowd caught the miniature from the officer and gave it to me with his own hands at the same time saying in a low and hollow tonebefore i saw the miniature which was in a locketi was younger then and my face was not then drained of blood  it also came between me and the brother juryman to whom i would have given the miniature and between him and the brother juryman to whom he would have given it and so passed it on through the whole of our number and back into my possession  not one of them however detected this  at table and generally when we were shut up together in mr harkers custody we had from the first naturally discussed the days proceedings a good deal  on that fifth day the case for the prosecution being closed and we having that side of the question in a completed shape before us our discussion was more animated and serious  among our number was a vestrymanthe densest idiot i have ever seen at largewho met the plainest evidence with the most preposterous objections and who was sided with by two flabby parochial parasites all the three impanelled from a district so delivered over to fever that they ought to have been upon their own trial for five hundred murders  when these mischievous blockheads were at their loudest which was towards midnight while some of us were already preparing for bed i again saw the murdered man  he stood grimly behind them beckoning to me  on my going towards them and striking into the conversation he immediately retired this was the beginning of a separate series of appearances confined to that long room in which we were confined  whenever a knot of my brother jurymen laid their heads together i saw the head of the murdered man among theirs  whenever their comparison of notes was going against him he would solemnly and irresistibly beckon to me  it will be borne in mind that down to the production of the miniature on the fifth day of the trial i had never seen the appearance in court  three changes occurred now that we entered on the case for the defence  two of them i will mention together first  the figure was now in court continually and it never there addressed itself to me but always to the person who was speaking at the time  for instance  the throat of the murdered man had been cut straight across  in the opening speech for the defence it was suggested that the deceased might have cut his own throat  at that very moment the figure with its throat in the dreadful condition referred to this it had concealed before stood at the speakers elbow motioning across and across its windpipe now with the right hand now with the left vigorously suggesting to the speaker himself the impossibility of such a wound having been selfinflicted by either hand  for another instance  a witness to character a woman deposed to the prisoners being the most amiable of mankind the figure at that instant stood on the floor before her looking her full in the face and pointing out the prisoners evil countenance with an extended arm and an outstretched finger  the third change now to be added impressed me strongly as the most marked and striking of all  i do not theorise upon it i accurately state it and there leave it  although the appearance was not itself perceived by those whom it addressed its coming close to such persons was invariably attended by some trepidation or disturbance on their part  it seemed to me as if it were prevented by laws to which i was not amenable from fully revealing itself to others and yet as if it could invisibly dumbly and darkly overshadow their minds  when the leading counsel for the defence suggested that hypothesis of suicide and the figure stood at the learned gentlemans elbow frightfully sawing at its severed throat it is undeniable that the counsel faltered in his speech lost for a few seconds the thread of his ingenious discourse wiped his forehead with his handkerchief and turned extremely pale  when the witness to character was confronted by the appearance her eyes most certainly did follow the direction of its pointed finger and rest in great hesitation and trouble upon the prisoners face  two additional illustrations will suffice  on the eighth day of the trial after the pause which was every day made early in the afternoon for a few minutes rest and refreshment i came back into court with the rest of the jury some little time before the return of the judges  standing up in the box and looking about me i thought the figure was not there until chancing to raise my eyes to the gallery i saw it bending forward and leaning over a very decent woman as if to assure itself whether the judges had resumed their seats or not  immediately afterwards that woman screamed fainted and was carried out  so with the venerable sagacious and patient judge who conducted the trial  when the case was over and he settled himself and his papers to sum up the murdered man entering by the judges door advanced to his lordships desk and looked eagerly over his shoulder at the pages of his notes which he was turning  a change came over his lordships face his hand stopped the peculiar shiver that i knew so well passed over him he faltered excuse me gentlemen for a few moments  i am somewhat oppressed by the vitiated air and did not recover until he had drunk a glass of water  through all the monotony of six of those interminable ten daysthe same judges and others on the bench the same murderer in the dock the same lawyers at the table the same tones of question and answer rising to the roof of the court the same scratching of the judges pen the same ushers going in and out the same lights kindled at the same hour when there had been any natural light of day the same foggy curtain outside the great windows when it was foggy the same rain pattering and dripping when it was rainy the same footmarks of turnkeys and prisoner day after day on the same sawdust the same keys locking and unlocking the same heavy doorsthrough all the wearisome monotony which made me feel as if i had been foreman of the jury for a vast cried of time and piccadilly had flourished coevally with babylon the murdered man never lost one trace of his distinctness in my eyes nor was he at any moment less distinct than anybody else  i must not omit as a matter of fact that i never once saw the appearance which i call by the name of the murdered man look at the murderer  again and again i wondered why does he not  but he never did  nor did he look at me after the production of the miniature until the last closing minutes of the trial arrived  we retired to consider at seven minutes before ten at night  the idiotic vestryman and his two parochial parasites gave us so much trouble that we twice returned into court to beg to have certain extracts from the judges notes reread  nine of us had not the smallest doubt about those passages neither i believe had any one in the court the dunderheaded triumvirate having no idea but obstruction disputed them for that very reason  at length we prevailed and finally the jury returned into court at ten minutes past twelve  the murdered man at that time stood directly opposite the jurybox on the other side of the court  as i took my place his eyes rested on me with great attention he seemed satisfied and slowly shook a great gray veil which he carried on his arm for the first time over his head and whole form  as i gave in our verdict guilty the veil collapsed all was gone and his place was empty  the murderer being asked by the judge according to usage whether he had anything to say before sentence of death should be passed upon him indistinctly muttered something which was described in the leading newspapers of the following day as a few rambling incoherent and halfaudible words in which he was understood to complain that he had not had a fair trial because the foreman of the jury was prepossessed against him  the remarkable declaration that he really made was this  my lord i knew i was a doomed man when the foreman of my jury came into the box  my lord i knew he would never let me off because before i was taken he somehow got to my bedside in the night woke me and put a rope round my neck
