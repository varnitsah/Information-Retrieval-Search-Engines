96307387	the great taboo  by  grant allen        preface  i desire to express my profound indebtedness for the central mythological idea embodied in this tale to mr jg frazers admirable and epochmaking work the golden bough whose main contention i have endeavored incidentally to popularize in my present story i wish also to express my obligations in other ways to mr andrew langs myth ritual and religion mr ho forbess naturalists wanderings and mr julian thomass cannibals and convicts if i have omitted to mention any other author to whom i may have owed incidental hints it will be some consolation to me to reflect that i shall at least have afforded an opportunity for legitimate sport to the amateurs of the new and popular british pastime of badgerbaiting or plagiaryhunting it may also save critics some moments search if i say at once that after careful consideration i have been unable to discover any moral whatsoever in this humble narrative i venture to believe that in so enlightened an age the majority of my readers will never miss it  ga  the nook dorking october 1890       chapter i  in mid pacific   man overboard  it rang in felix thurstans ears like the sound of a bell he gazed about him in dismay wondering what had happened  the first intimation he received of the accident was that sudden sharp cry from the bosuns mate almost before he had fully taken it in in all its meaning another voice farther aft took up the cry once more in an altered form a lady a lady somebody overboard great heavens it is her its miss ellis miss ellis  next instant felix found himself he knew not how struggling in a wild grapple with the dark black water a woman was clinging to himclinging for dear life but he couldnt have told you himself that minute how it all took place he was too stunned and dazzled  he looked around him on the seething sea in a sudden awakening as it were to life and consciousness all about the great water stretched dark and tumultuous white breakers surged over him far ahead the steamers lights gleamed red and green in long lines upon the ocean at first they ran fast then they slackened somewhat she was surely slowing now they must be reversing engines and trying to stop her they would put out a boat but what hope what chance of rescue by night in such a wild waste of waves as that and muriel ellis was clinging to him for dear life all the while with the despairing clutch of a halfdrowned woman  the people on the australasian for their part knew better what had occurred there was bustle and confusion enough on deck and on the captains bridge to be sure man overboardthree sharp rings at the engine bellstop her shortreverse engineslower the giglook sharp there all of you passengers hurried up breathless at the first alarm to know what was the matter sailors loosened and lowered the boat from the davits with extraordinary quickness officers stood by giving orders in monosyllables with practised calm all was hurry and turmoil yet with a marvellous sense of order and prompt obedience as well but at any rate the people on deck hadnt the swift swirl of the boisterous water the hampering wet clothes the pervading consciousness of personal danger to make their brains reel like felix thurstans they could ask one another with comparative composure what had happened on board they could listen without terror to the story of the accident  it was the thirteenth day out from sydney and the australasian was rapidly nearing the equator toward evening the wind had freshened and the sea was running high against her weather side but it was a fine starlit night though the moon had not yet risen and as the brief tropical twilight faded away by quick degrees in the west the fringe of cocoanut palms on the reef that bounded the little island of boupari showed out for a minute or two in dark relief some miles to leeward against the pale pink horizon in spite of the heavy sea many passengers lingered late on deck that night to see the last of that coralgirt shore which was to be their final glimpse of land till they reached honolulu en route for san francisco  bit by bit however the cocoanut palms silhouetted with their graceful waving arms for a few brief minutes in black against the glowing background merged slowly into the sky or sank below the horizon all grew dark one by one as the trees disappeared the passengers dropped off for whist in the saloon or retired to the uneasy solitude of their own staterooms at last only two or three men were left smoking and chatting near the top of the companion ladder while at the stern of the ship muriel ellis looked over toward the retreating island and talked with a certain timid maidenly frankness to felix thurstan  theres nowhere on earth for getting really to know people in a very short time like the deck of a great atlantic or pacific liner youre thrown together so much and all day long that you see more of your fellowpassengers inner life and nature in a few brief weeks than you would ever be likely to see in a long twelvemonth of ordinary town or country acquaintanceship and muriel ellis had seen a great deal in those thirteen days of felix thurstan enough to make sure in her own heart that she really liked himwellso much that she looked up with a pretty blush of selfconsciousness every time he approached and lifted his hat to her muriel was an english rectors daughter from a country village in somersetshire and she was now on her way back from a long years visit to recruit her health to an aunt in paramatta she was travelling under the escort of an amiable old chaperon whom the aunt in question had picked up for her before leaving sydney but as the amiable old chaperon being but an indifferent sailor spent most of her time in her own berth closely attended by the obliging stewardess muriel had found her chaperonage interfere very little with opportunities of talk with that nice mr thurstan and now as the last glow of sunset died out in the western sky and the last palmtree faded away against the colder green darkness of the tropical night muriel was leaning over the bulwarks in confidential mood and watching the big waves advance or recede and talking the sort of talk that such an hour seems to favor with the handsome young civil servant who stood on guard as it were beside her for felix thurstan held a government appointment at levuka in fiji and was now on his way home on leave of absence after six years service in that newmade colony  how delightful it would be to live on an island like that muriel murmured half to herself as she gazed out wistfully in the direction of the disappearing coral reef with those beautiful palms waving always over ones head and that delicious evening air blowing cool through their branches it looks such a paradise  felix smiled and glanced down at her as he steadied himself with one hand against the bulwark while the ship rolled over into the trough of the sea heavily well i dont know about that miss ellis he answered with a doubtful air eying her close as he spoke with eyes of evident admiration one might be happy anywhere of coursein suitable society but if youd lived as long among cocoanuts in fiji as i have i dare say the poetry of these calm palmgrove islands would be a little less real to you remember though they look so beautiful and dreamy against the sky like that at sunset especially that was a heavy one that time im really afraid we must go down to the cabin soon shell be shipping seas before long if we stop on deck much laterand yet its so delightful stopping up here till the dusk comes on isnt itwell remember i was saying though they look so beautiful and dreamy and poeticalsummer isles of eden lying in dark purple spheres of sea and all that sort of thingthese islands are inhabited by the fiercest and most bloodthirsty cannibals known to travellers  cannibals muriel repeated looking up at him in surprise you dont mean to say that islands like these standing right in the very track of european steamers are still heathen and cannibal  oh dear yes felix replied holding his hand out as he spoke to catch his companions arm gently and steady her against the wave that was just going to strike the stern excuse me just so the seas rising fast isnt itoh dear yes of course they are theyre all heathen and cannibals you couldnt imagine to yourself the horrible bloodthirsty rites that may this very minute be taking place upon that idylliclooking island under the soft waving branches of those whispering palmtrees why i knew a man in the marquesas myselfa hideous old native as ugly as you can fancy himwho was supposed to be a god an incarnate god and was worshipped accordingly with profound devotion by all the other islanders you cant picture to yourself how awful their worship was i darent even repeat it to you it was too too horrible he lived in a hut by himself among the deepest forest and human victims used to be broughtwell there its too loathsome why see theres a great light on the island now a big bonfire or something dont you make it out you can tell it by the red glare in the sky overhead he paused a moment then he added more slowly i shouldnt be surprised if at this very moment while were standing here in such perfect security on the deck of a christian english vessel some unspeakable and unthinkable heathen orgy maynt be going on over there beside that sacrificial fire and if some poor trembling native girl isnt being led just now with blows and curses and awful savage ceremonies her hands bound behind her backoh look out miss ellis  he was only just in time to utter the warning words he was only just in time to put one hand on each side of her slender waist and hold her tight so when the big wave which he saw coming struck full tilt against the vessels flank and broke in one white drenching sheet of foam against her stern and quarterdeck  the suddenness of the assault took felixs breath away for the first few seconds he was only aware that a heavy sea had been shipped and had wet him through and through with its unexpected deluge a moment later he was dimly conscious that his companion had slipped from his grasp and was nowhere visible the violence of the shock and the slimy nature of the sea water had made him relax his hold without knowing it in the tumult of the moment and had at the same time caused muriel to glide imperceptibly through his fingers as he had often known an illcaught cricketball do in his schooldays then he saw he was on his hands and knees on the deck the wave had knocked him down and dashed him against the bulwark on the leeward side as he picked himself up wet bruised and shaken he looked about for muriel a terrible dread seized upon his soul at once impossible impossible she couldnt have been washed overboard  and even as he gazed about and held his bruised elbow in his hand and wondered to himself what it could all mean that sudden loud cry arose beside him from the quarterdeck man overboard man overboard followed a moment later by the answering cry from the men who were smoking under the lee of the companion a lady a lady its miss ellis miss ellis  he didnt take it all in he didnt reflect he didnt even know he was actually doing it but he did it all the same with the simple straightforward instinctive sense of duty which makes civilized man act aright all unconsciously in any moment of supreme danger and difficulty leaping on to the taffrail without one instants delay and steadying himself for an indivisible fraction of time with his hand on the rope ladder he peered out into the darkness with keen eyes for a glimpse of muriel elliss head above the fierce black water and espying it for one second as she came up on a white crest he plunged in before the vessel had time to roll back to windward and struck boldly out in the direction where he saw that helpless object dashed about like a cork on the surface of the ocean  only those who have known such accidents at sea can possibly picture to themselves the instantaneous haste with which all that followed took place upon that bustling quarterdeck almost at the first cry of man overboard the captains bell rang sharp and quick as if by magic with three peremptory little calls in the engineroom below the australasian was going at full speed but in a marvellously short time as it seemed to all on board the great ship had slowed down to a perfect standstill and then had reversed her engines so that she lay just nose to the wind awaiting further orders in the meantime almost as soon as the words were out of the bosuns lips a sailor amidships had rushed to the safety belts hung up by the companion ladder and had flung half a dozen of them one after another with hasty but wellaimed throws far far astern in the direction where felix had disappeared into the black water the belts were painted white and they showed for a few seconds as they fell like bright specks on the surface of the darkling sea then they sunk slowly behind as the big ship still not quite stopped ploughed her way ahead with gigantic force into the great abyss of darkness in front of her  it seemed but a minute too to the watchers on board before a party of sailors summoned by the whistle with that marvellous readiness to meet any emergency which long experience of sudden danger has rendered habitual among seafaring men had lowered the boat and taken their seats on the thwarts and seized their oars and were getting under way on their hopeless quest of search through the dim black night for those two belated souls alone in the midst of the angry pacific  it seemed but a minute or two i say to the watchers on board but oh what an eternity of time to felix thurstan struggling there with his live burden in the seething water  he had dashed into the ocean which was dark but warm with tropical heat and had succeeded in spite of the heavy seas then running in reaching muriel who clung to him now with all the fierce clinging of despair and impeded his movement through that swirling water more than that he saw the white lifebelts that the sailors flung toward him they were well and aptly flung in the inspiration of the moment to allow for the sea itself carrying them on the crest of its waves toward the two drowning creatures felix saw them distinctly and making a great lunge as they passed in spite of muriels struggles which sadly hampered his movements he managed to clutch at no less than three before the great billow rolling on carried them off on its top forever away from him two of these he slipped hastily over muriels shoulders the other he put as best he might round his own waist and then for the first time still clinging close to his companions arm and buffeted about wildly by that running sea he was able to look about him in alarm for a moment and realize more or less what had actually happened  by this time the australasian was a quarter of a mile away in front of them and her lights were beginning to become stationary as she slowly slowed and reversed engines then from the summit of a great wave felix was dimly aware of a boat being loweredfor he saw a separate light gleaming across the seaa search was being made in the black night alas how hopelessly the light hovered about for many many minutes revealed to him now here now there searching in vain to find him as wave after wave raised him time and again on its irresistible summit the men in the boat were doing their best no doubt but what chance of finding any one on a dark night like that in an angry sea and with no clue to guide them toward the two struggling castaways current and wind had things all their own way as a matter of fact the light never came near the castaways at all and after half an hours ineffectual search which seemed to felix a whole long lifetime it returned slowly toward the steamer from which it cameand left those two alone on the dark pacific  there wasnt a chance of picking em up the captain said with philosophic calm as the men clambered on board again and the australasian got under way once more for the port of honolulu i knew there wasnt a chance but in common humanity one was bound to make some show of trying to save em he was a brave fellow to go after her though it was no good of course he couldnt even find her at night and with such a sea as that running  and even as he spoke felix thurstan rising once more on the crest of a much smaller billowfor somehow the waves were getting incredibly smaller as he drifted on to leewardfelt his heart sink within him as he observed to his dismay that the australasian must be steaming ahead once more by the movement of her lights and that they two were indeed abandoned to their fate on the open surface of that vast and trackless ocean     chapter ii  the temple of the deity   while these things were happening on the sea close by a very different scene indeed was being enacted meanwhile beneath those waving palms on the island of boupari it was strange to be sure as felix thurstan had said that such unspeakable heathen orgies should be taking place within sight of a passing christian english steamer but if only he had known or reflected to what sort of land he was trying now to struggle ashore with muriel he might well have doubted whether it were not better to let her perish where she was in the pure clear ocean rather than to submit an english girl to the possibility of undergoing such horrible heathen rites and ceremonies  for on the island of boupari it was high feast with the worshippers of their god that night the sun had turned on the tropic of capricorn at noon and was making his way northward toward the equator once more and his votaries as was their wont had all come forth to do him honor in due season and to pay their respects in the inmost and sacredest grove on the island to his incarnate representative the living spirit of trees and fruits and vegetation the very high god the divine tukilakila  early in the evening as soon as the suns rim had disappeared beneath the ocean a strange noise boomed forth from the central shrine of boupari those who heard it clapped their hands to their ears and ran hastily forward it was a noise like distant rumbling thunder or the whir of some great english mill or factory and at its sound every woman on the island threw herself on the ground prostrate with her face in the dust and waited there reverently till the audible voice of the god had once more subsided for no woman knew how that sound was produced only the grown men initiated into the mysteries of the shrine when they came of age at the tattooing ceremony were aware that the strange buzzing whirring noise was nothing more or less than the cry of the bullroarer  a bullroarer as many english schoolboys know is merely a piece of oblong wood pointed at either end and fastened by a leather thong at one corner but when whirled round the head by practised priestly hands it produces a low rumbling noise like the wheels of a distant carriage growing gradually louder and clearer from moment to moment till at last it waxes itself into a frightful din or bursts into perfect peals of imitation thunder then it decreases again once more as gradually as it rose becoming fainter and ever fainter like thunder as it recedes till the horrible bellowing as of supernatural bulls dies away in the end by slow degrees into low and soft and imperceptible murmurs  but when the savage hears the distant humming of the bullroarer at whatever distance he knows that the mysteries of his god are in full swing and he hurries forward in haste leaving his work or his pleasure and running naked as he stands to take his share in the worship lest the anger of heaven should burst forth in devouring flames to consume him but the women knowing themselves unworthy to face the dread presence of the high god in his wrath rush wildly from the spot and flinging themselves down at full length with their mouths to the dust wait patiently till the voice of their deity is no longer audible  and as the bullroarer on boupari rang out with wild echoes from the coral caverns in the central grove that evening tukilakila their god rose slowly from his place and stood out from his hut a deity revealed before his reverential worshippers  as he rose a hushed whisper ran wavelike through the dense throng of dusky forms that bent low like corn beneath the wind before him tukilakila rises he rises to speak hush for the voice of the mighty mangod  the god looking around him superciliously with a cynical air of contempt stood forward with a firm and elastic step before his silent worshippers he was a stalwart savage in the very prime of life tall lithe and active his figure was that of a man well used to command but his face though handsome was visibly marked by every external sign of cruelty lust and extreme bloodthirstiness one might have said merely to look at him he was a being debased by all forms of brutal and hateful selfindulgence a baleful light burned in his keen gray eyes his lips were thick full purple and wistful  my people may look upon me he said in a strangely affable voice standing forward and smiling with a curious halfcruel halfcompassionate smile upon his awestruck followers on every day of the suns course but this none save the ministers dedicated to the service of tukilakila dare gaze unhurt upon his sacred person if any other did the light from his holy eyes would wither them up and the glow of his glorious countenance would scorch them to ashes he raised his two hands palm outward in front of him so all the year round he went on tukilakila who loves his people and sends them the earlier and the later rain in the wet season and makes their yams and their taro grow and causes his sun to shine upon them freelyall the year round tukilakila your god sits shut up in his own house among the skeletons of those whom he has killed and eaten or walks in his walled paddock where his breadfruit ripens and his plantains springhimself and the ministers that his tribesmen have given him  at the sound of their mystic deitys voice the savages bending lower still till their foreheads touched the ground repeated in chorus to the clapping of hands like some solemn litany tukilakila speaks true our lord is merciful he sends down his showers upon our crops and fields he causes his sun to shine brightly over us he makes our pigs and our slaves bring forth their increase tukilakila is good his people praise him  the god took another step forward the divine mantle of red feathers glowing in the sunset on his dusky shoulders and smiled once more that hateful gracious smile of his he was standing near the open door of his wattled hut overshadowed by the huge spreading arms of a gigantic banyantree through the open door of the hut it was possible to catch just a passing glimpse of an awful sight within on the beams of the house and on the boughs of the trees behind it human skeletons half covered with dry flesh hung in ghastly array their skulls turned downward they were the skeletons of the victims tukilakila their prince had slain and eaten they were the trophies of the cannibal mangods hateful prowess  tukilakila raised his right hand erect and spoke again i am a great god he said slowly i am very powerful i make the sun to shine and the yams to grow i am the spirit of plants without me there would be nothing for you all to eat or drink in boupari if i were to grow old and die the sun would fade away in the heavens overhead the breadfruit trees would wither and cease to bear on earth all fruits would come to an end and die at once all rivers would stop forthwith from running  his worshippers bowed down in acquiescence with awestruck faces it is true they answered in the same slow singsong of assent as before tukilakila is the greatest of gods we owe to him everything we hang upon his favor  tukilakila started back laughed and showed his pearly white teeth they were beautiful and regular like the teeth of a tiger a strong young tiger but i need more sacrifices than all the other gods he went on melodiously like one who plays with consummate skill upon some difficult instrument i am greedy i am thirsty i am a hungry god you must not stint me i claim more human victims than all the other gods beside if you want your crops to grow and your rivers to run the fields to yield you game and the sea fishthis is what i ask give me victims victims that is our compact tukilakila calls you  the men bowed down once more and repeated humbly you shall have victims as you will great god only give us yam and taro and breadfruit and cause not your bright light the sun to grow dark in heaven over us  cut yourselves tukilakila cried in a peremptory voice clapping his hands thrice i am thirsting for blood i want your freewill offering  as he spoke every man as by a set ritual took from a little skin wallet at his side a sharp flake of coralstone and drawing it deliberately across his breast in a deep red gash caused the blood to flow out freely over his chest and long grass waistband then having done so they never strove for a moment to stanch the wound but let the red drops fall as they would on to the dust at their feet without seeming even to be conscious at all of the fact that they were flowing  tukilakila smiled once more a ghastly selfsatisfied smile of unquestioned power it is well he went on my people love me they know my strength how i can wither them up they give me their blood to drink freely so i will be merciful to them i will make my sun shine and my rain drop from heaven and instead of taking all i will choose one victim he paused and glanced along their line significantly  choose tukilakila the men answered without a moments hesitation we are all your meat choose which one you will take of us  tukilakila walked with a leisurely tread down the lines and surveyed the men critically they were all drawn up in rows one behind the other according to tribes and families and the god walked along each row examining them with a curious and interested eye as a farmer examines sheep fit for the market now and then he felt a leg or an arm with his finger and thumb and hesitated a second it was an important matter this choosing a victim as he passed a close observer might have noted that each man trembled visibly while the gods eye was upon him and looked after him askance with a terrified sidelong gaze as he passed on to his neighbor but not one savage gave any overt sign or token of his terror or his reluctance on the contrary as tukilakila passed along the line with lazy cruel deliberateness the men kept chanting aloud without one tremor in their voices we are all your meat choose which one you will take of us  on a sudden tukilakila turned sharply round and darting a rapid glance toward a row he had already passed several minutes before he exclaimed with an air of unexpected inspiration tukilakila has chosen he takes maloa  the man upon whose shoulder the god laid his heavy hand as he spoke stood forth from the crowd without a moments hesitation if anger or fear was in his heart at all it could not be detected in his voice or his features he bowed his head with seeming satisfaction and answered humbly what tukilakila says must need be done this is a great honor he is a mighty god we poor men must obey him we are proud to be taken up and made one with divinity  tukilakila raised in his hand a large stone axe of some polished green material closely resembling jade which lay on a block by the door and tried its edge with his finger in an abstracted manner bind him he said quietly turning round to his votaries and the men each glad to have escaped his own fate bound their comrade willingly with green ropes of plantain fibre  crown him with flowers tukilakila said and a female attendant absolved from the terror of the bullroarer by the gods command brought forward a great garland of crimson hibiscus which she flung around the victims neck and shoulders  lay his head on the sacred stone block of our fathers tukilakila went on in an easy tone of command waving his hand gracefully and the men moving forward laid their comrade face downward on a huge flat block of polished greenstone which lay like an altar in front of the hut with the mouldering skeletons  it is well tukilakila murmured once more half aloud you have given me the freewill offering now for the trespass where is the woman who dared to approach too near the templehome of the divine tukilakila bring the criminal forward  the men divided and made a lane down their middle then one of them a minister of the mangods shrine led up by the hand all trembling and shrinking with supernatural terror in every muscle a wellformed young girl of eighteen or twenty her naked bronze limbs were shapely and lissome but her eyes were swollen and red with tears and her face strongly distorted with awe for the mangod when she stood at last before tukilakilas dreaded face she flung herself on the ground in an agony of fear  oh mercy great god she cried in a feeble voice i have sinned i have sinned mercy mercy  tukilakila smiled as before a smile of imperial pride no ray of pity gleamed from those steelgray eyes does tukilakila show mercy he asked in a mocking voice does he pardon his suppliants does he forgive trespasses is he not a god and must not his wrath be appeased she being a woman and not a wife sealed to tukilakila has dared to look from afar upon his sacred home she has spied the mysteries therefore she must die my people bind her  in a second without more ado while the poor trembling girl writhed and groaned in her agony before their eyes that mob of wild savages let loose to torture and slay fell upon her with hideous shouts and bound her as they had bound their comrade before with coarse native ropes of twisted plantain fibre  lay her head on the stone tukilakila said grimly and his votaries obeyed him  now light the sacred fire to make our feast before i slay the victims the god said in a gloating voice running his finger again along the edge of his huge hatchet  as he spoke two men holding in their hands hollow bamboos with coals of fire concealed within which they kept aglow meanwhile by waving them up and down rapidly in the air laid these primitive matches to the base of a great pyramidal pile of wood and palmleaves ready prepared beforehand in the yard of the temple in a second the dry fuel catching the sparks instantly blazed up to heaven with a wild outburst of flame great red tongues of fire licked up the mouldering mass of leaves and twigs and caught at once at the trunks of palm and li wood within a huge conflagration reddened the sky at once like lightning the effect was magical the glow transfigured the whole island for miles it was in fact the blaze that felix thurstan had noted and remarked upon as he stood that evening on the silent deck of the australasian  tukilakila gazed at it with horrid childish glee a fine fire he said gayly a fire worthy of a god it will serve me well tukilakila will have a good oven to roast his meal in  then he turned toward the sea and held up his hand once more for silence as he did so an answering light upon its surface attracted his eye for a moments space it was a bright red light mixed with white and green ones in point of fact the australasian was passing tukilakila pointed toward it solemnly with his plump brown forefinger see he said drawing himself up and looking preternaturally wise your god is great i am sending some of this fire across the sea to where my sun has set to aid and reinforce it that is to keep up the fire of the sun lest ever at any time it should fade and fail you while tukilakila lives the sun will burn bright if tukilakila were to die it would be night forever  his votaries following their gods forefinger as it pointed all turned to look in the direction he indicated with blank surprise and astonishment such a sight had never met their eyes before for the australasian was the very first steamer to take the eastward route through the dangerous and tortuous boupari channel so their awe and surprise at the unwonted sight knew no bounds fire on the ocean miraculous light on the waves their god must indeed be a mighty deity if he could send flames like that careering over the sea surely the sun was safe in the hands of a potentate who could thus visibly reinforce it with red light and white in their astonishment and awe they stood with their long hair falling down over their foreheads and their hands held up to their eyes that they might gaze the farther across the dim dark ocean the borrowed light of their bonfire was moving slowly moving over the watery sea fire and water were mixing and mingling on friendly terms impossible incredible marvellous miraculous they prostrated themselves in their terror at tukilakilas feet oh great god they cried in awestruck tones your power is too vast spare us spare us spare us  as for tukilakila himself he was not astonished at all strange as it sounds to us he really believed in his heart what he said profoundly convinced of his own godhead and abjectly superstitious as any of his own votaries he absolutely accepted as a fact his own suggestion that the light he saw was the reflection of that his men had kindled the interpretation he had put upon it seemed to him a perfectly natural and just one his worshippers indeed mere men that they were might be terrified at the sight but why should he a god take any special notice of it  he accepted his own superiority as implicitly as our european nobles and rulers accept theirs he had no doubts himself and he considered those who had little better than criminals  by and by a smaller light detached itself by slow degrees from the greater ones the others stood still and halted in midocean the lesser light made as if it would come in the direction of boupari in point of fact the gig had put out in search of felix and muriel  tukilakila interpreted the facts at once however in his own way see he said pointing with his plump forefinger once more and encouraging with his words his terrified followers i am sending back a light again from the sun to my island i am doing my work well i am taking care of my people fear not for your future in the light is yet another victim a man and a woman will come to boupari from the sun to make up for the man and woman whom we eat in our feast tonight give me plenty of victims and you will have plenty of yam make haste then kill eat let us feast tukilakila tomorrow the man and woman i have sent from the sun will come ashore on the reef and reach boupari  at the words he stepped forward and raised that heavy tomahawk with one blow each he brained the two bound and defenceless victims on the altarstone of his fathers the rest a european hand shrinks from revealing the orgy was too horrible even for description  and that was the land toward which that moment felix thurstan was struggling with all his might to carry muriel ellis from the myriad clasping arms of a comparatively gentle and merciful ocean     chapter iii  land but what land   as the last glimmering lights of the australasian died away to seaward felix thurstan knew in his despair there was nothing for it now but to strike out boldly if he could for the shore of the island  by this time the breakers had subsided greatly not indeed that the sea itself was really going down on the contrary a brisk wind was rising sharper from the east and the waves on the open pacific were growing each moment higher and loppier but the huge mountain of water that washed muriel ellis overboard was not a regular ordinary wave it was that far more powerful and dangerous mass a shoalwater breaker the australasian had passed at that instant over a submerged coralbar quite deep enough indeed to let her cross its top without the slightest danger of grazing but still raised so high toward the surface as to produce a considerable constant groundswell which broke in windy weather into huge sheets of surf like the one that had just struck and washed over the australasian carrying muriel with it the very same cause that produced the breakers however bore felix on their summit rapidly landward and once he had got well beyond the region of the bar that begot them he found himself soon to his intense relief in comparatively calm shoal water  muriel ellis for her part was faint with terror and with the buffeting of the waves but she still floated by his side upheld by the lifebelts he had been able by immense efforts to keep unseparated from her amid the rending surf of the breakers now that they found themselves in easier waters for a while felix began to strike out vigorously through the darkness for the shore holding up his companion with one hand and swimming with all his might in the direction where a vague white line of surf lit up by the red glareof some fire far inland made him suspect the nearest land to lie he almost thought he had succeeded at last after a long hour of struggle in feeling his feet after all on a firm coral bottom  at the very moment he did so and touched the ground underneath another great wave curling resistlessly behind him caught him up on its crest whirled him heavenward like a cork and then dashed him down once more a passive burden on some soft and yielding substance which he conjectured at once to be a beach of finely powdered coral fragments as he touched this beach for an instant the undertow of that vast dashing breaker sucked him back with its ebb again a helpless breathless creature and then the succeeding wave rolled him over like a ball upon the beach as before in quick succession four times the backcurrent sucked him under with its wild pull in the selfsame way and four times the return wave flung him up upon the beach again like a fragment of seaweed with frantic efforts felix tried at first to cling still to murielto save her from the irresistible force of that roaring surfto snatch her from the open jaws of death by sheer struggling dint of thews and muscle he might as well have tried to stem niagara the great waves curling irresistibly in huge curves landward caught either of them up by turns on their arched summits and twisted them about remorselessly raising them now aloft on their foaming crest beating them back now prone in their hollow trough and flinging them fiercely at last with pitiless energy against the soft beach of coral if the beach had been hard they must infallibly have been ground to powder or beaten to jelly by the colossal force of those gigantic blows fortunately it was yielding smooth and claylike and received them almost as a layer of moist plaster of paris might have done or they would have stood no chance at all for their lives in that desperate battle with the blind and frantic forces of unrelenting nature  no man who has not himself seen the surf break on one of these farsouthern coral shores can form any idea in his own mind of the terror and horror of the situation the water as it reaches the beach rears itself aloft for a second into a huge upright wall which advancing slowly curls over at last in a hollow circle and pounds down upon the sand or reef with all the crushing force of some enormous sledgehammer but after the fourth assault felix felt himself flung up high and dry by the wave as one may sometimes see a bit of light reed or pith flung up some distance ahead by an advancing tide on the beach in england in an instant he steadied himself and staggered to his feet torn and bruised as he was by the pummelling of the billows he looked eagerly into the water in search of his companion the next wave flung up muriel as the last had flung himself he bent over her with a panting heart as she lay there insensible on the long white shore alive or dead that was now the question  raising her hastily in his arms with her clothes all clinging wet and close about her felix carried her over the narrow strip of tidal beach above highwater level and laid her gently down on a soft green bank of short tropical herbage close to the edge of the coral then he bent over her once more and listened eagerly at her heart it still beat with faint pulsesbeatbeatbeat felix throbbed with joy she was alive alive he was not quite alone then on that unknown island  and strange as it seemed it was only a little more than two short hours since they had stood and looked out across the open sea over the bulwarks of the australasian together  but felix had no time to moralize just then the moment was clearly one for action fortunately he happened to carry three useful things in his pocket when he jumped overboard after muriel the first was a pocketknife the second was a flask with a little whiskey in it and the third perhaps the most important of all a small metal box of wax vesta matches pouring a little whiskey into the cup of the flask he held it eagerly to muriels lips the fainting girl swallowed it automatically then felix stooping down tried the matches against the box they were unfortunately wet but half an hours exposure he knew on sunwarmed stones in that hot tropical air would soon restore them again so he opened the box and laid them carefully out on a flat white slab of coral after that he had time to consider exactly where they were and what their chances in life if any might now amount to  pitch dark as it was he had no difficulty in deciding at once by the general look of things that they had reached a fringing reef such as he was already familiar with in the marquesas and elsewhere the reef was no doubt circular and it enclosed within itself a second or central island divided from it by a shallow lagoon of calm still water he walked some yards inland from where he now stood on the summit of the ridge he could look either way and by the faint reflected light of the stars or the glare of the great pyre that burned on the central island he could see down on one side to the ocean with its fierce white pounding surf and on the other to the lagoon reflecting the stars overhead and motionless as a millpond between them lay the low raised ridge of coral covered with tall stems of cocoanut palms and interspersed here and there as far as his eye could judge with little rectangular clumps of plantain and taro  but what alarmed felix most was the fire that blazed so brightly to heaven on the central island for he knew too well that meantthere were men on the place the land was inhabited  the cocoanuts and taro told the same doubtful tale from the way they grew even in that dim starlight felix recognized at once they had all been planted  still he didnt hesitate to do what he thought best for muriels relief for all that collecting a few sticks and fragments of palmbranches from the jungle about he piled them into a heap and waited patiently for his matches to dry as soon as they were readyand the warmth of the stone made them quickly inflammablehe struck a match on the box and proceeded to light his fire by muriels side as her clothes grew warmer the poor girl opened her eyes at last and gazing around her exclaimed in blank terror oh mr thurstan where are we what does all this mean where have we got to on a desert island  no not on a desert island felix answered shortly im afraid its a great deal worse than that to tell you the truth im afraid its inhabited  at that moment by the hot embers of the great sacrificial pyre on the central hill two of the savage templeattendants calling their gods attention to a sudden blaze of flame upon the fringing reef pointed with their dark forefingers and called out in surprise see see a fire on the barrier a fire a fire what can it mean there are no men of our people over there tonight have warcanoes arrived has some enemy landed  tukilakila leaned back drained his cocoanut cup of intoxicating kava and surveyed the unwonted apparition on the reef long and carefully it is nothing he said at last in his most deliberate manner stroking his cheeks and chin contentedly with that plump round hand of his it is only the victims the new victims i promised you korong korong they have come ashore with their light from my home in the sun they have brought fire afreshholy fire to boupari  three or four of the savages leaped up in fierce joy and bowed before him as he spoke with eager faces oh tukilakila the eldest among them said making a profound reverence shall we swim across to the reef and fetch them home to your house shall we take over our canoes and bring back your victims  the god motioned them back with one outstretched palm his eyes were flushed and his look lazy not tonight my people he said readjusting the garland of flowers round his neck and giving a careless glance at the wellpicked bones that a few hours before had been two trembling fellow creatures tukilakila has feasted his fill for this evening your god is full his heart is happy i have eaten human flesh i have drunk of the juice of the kava am i not a great deity can i not do as i will i frown and the heavens thunder i gnash my teeth and the earth trembles what is it to me if fresh victims come or if they come not can i not make with a nod as many as i will of them he took up two fresh fingerbones clean gnawed of their flesh and knocked them together in a wild tune carelessly if tukilakila chooses he went on tapping his chest with conscious pride he can knock these bones togethersoand bid them live again is it not i who cause women and beasts to bring forth their young is it not i who give the turtles their increase and is it not a small thing to me therefore whether the sea tosses up my victims from my home in the sun or whether it does not let us leave them alone on the reef for tonight tomorrow we will send over our canoes to fetch them  it was all pure brag all pure guesswork and yet tukilakila himself profoundly believed it  as he spoke the light from felixs fire blazed out against the dark sky stronger and clearer still and through that cloudless tropical air the figure of a man standing for one moment between the flames and the lagoon became distinctly visible to the keen and practised eyes of the savages i see them i see them i see the victims the foremost worshipper exclaimed rushing forward a little at the sight and beside himself with superstitious awe and surprise at tukilakilas presence surely our god is great he knows all things he brings us meat from the setting sun in ships of fire in blazing canoes across the golden road of the sunbathed ocean  as for tukilakila himself leaning on his elbow at ease he gazed across at the unexpected sight with very languid interest he was a god and he liked to see things conducted with proper decorum this crowing and crying over a couple of spiritsmere ordinary spirits come ashore from the sun in a fiery boatstruck his godship as little short of childish let them be he answered petulantly crushing a blossom in his hand let no man disturb them they shall rest where they are till tomorrow morning we have eaten we have drunk our soul is happy the kava within us has made us like a god indeed i shall give my ministers charge that no harm happen to them  he drew a whistle from his side and whistled once there was a moments pause then tukilakila spoke in a loud voice again the king of fire he exclaimed in tones of princely authority  from within the hut there came forth slowly a second stalwart savage big built and burly as the great god himself clad in a long robe or cloak of yellow feathers which shone bright with a strange metallic gleam in the ruddy light of the huge pile of liwood  the king of fire is here tukilakila the lesser god made answer bending his head slightly  fire tukilakila said like a monarch giving orders to his attendant minister if any man touch the newcomers on the reef before i cause my sun to rise tomorrow morning scorch up his flesh with your flame and consume his bones to ash and cinder if any woman go near them before tukilakila bids let her be rolled in palmleaves and smeared with oil and light her up for a torch on a dark night to lighten our temple  the king of fire bent his head in assent it is as tukilakila wills he answered submissively  tukilakila whistled again this time twice the king of water he exclaimed in the same loud tone of command as before  at the words a man of about forty tall and sinewy clad in a short cape of white albatross feathers and with a girdle of nautilus shells interspersed with red coral tied around his waist came forth to the summons  the king of water is here he said bending his head but not his knee before the greater deity  water tukilakila said with halftipsy solemnity you are a god too your power is very great but less than mine do then as i bid you if any man touch my spirits whom i have brought from my home in the sun in a fiery ship before i bid him tomorrow overturn his canoe and drown him in lagoon or spring or ocean if any woman go near them without tukilakilas leave bind her hand and foot with ropes of porpoise hide and cast her out into the surf and dash her with your waves and pummel her to pieces  the king of water bent his head a second time i am a great god he answered before all others save you but for you tukilakila i haste to do your bidding if any man disobey you my billows shall rise and overwhelm him in the sea i am a great god i claim each year many drowned victims  but not so many as me tukilakila interposed his hand playing on his knife with a faint air of impatience  but not so many as you the minor god added in haste as if to appease his rising anger fire and water ever speed to do your bidding  tukilakila stood up turned toward the distant flame and waved his hands round and round three times before him let this be for you all a great taboo he said glancing once more toward his awestruck followers now the mysteries are over tukilakila will sleep he has eaten of human flesh he has drunk of cocoanut rum and of new kava he has brought back his sun on its way in the heavens he has sent it messengers of fire to reinforce its strength he has fetched from it messengers in turn with fresh fire to boupari fire not lighted from any earthly flame fire new divine scorching unspeakable tomorrow we will talk with the spirits he has brought tonight we will sleep now all go to your homes and tell your women of this great taboo lest they speak to the spirits and fall into the hands of fire or of water  the savages dropped on their faces before the eye of their god and lay quite still they made a path as it were from the pyre to the temple door with their prostrate bodies tukilakila walking with unsteady steps over their halfnaked forms turned to his hut in a drunken booze he walked over them with no more compunction or feeling than over so many logs why should he not indeed for he was a god and they were his meat his servants his worshippers     chapter iv  the guests of heaven   all that night throughtheir first lonely night on the island of bouparifelix sat up by his flickering fire wide awake half expecting and dreading some treacherous attack of the unknown savages from time to time he kept adding dry fuel to his smouldering pile and he never ceased to keep a keen eye both on the lagoon and the reef in case an assault should be made upon them suddenly by land or water he knew the south seas quite well enough already to have all the possibilities of misfortune floating vividly before his eyes he realized at once from his own previous experience the full loneliness and terror of their unarmed condition  for boupari was one of those rare remote islets where the very rumor of our european civilization has hardly yet penetrated  as for muriel though she was alarmed enough of course and intensely shaken by the sudden shock she had received the whole surroundings were too wholly unlike any world she had ever yet known to enable her to take in at once the utter horror of the situation she only knew they were alone wet bruised and terribly battered and the australasian had gone on leaving them there to their fate on an unknown island that for the moment was more than enough for her of accumulated misfortune she come to herself but slowly and as her torn clothes dried by degrees before the fire and the heat of the tropical night she was so far from fully realizing the dangers of their position that her first and principal fear for the moment was lest she might take cold from her wet things drying upon her she ate a little of the plantain that felix picked for her and at times toward morning she dozed off into an uneasy sleep from pure fatigue and excess of weariness as she slept felix bending over her with the biggest blade of his knife open in case of attack watched with profound emotion the rise and fall of her bosom and hesitated with himself if the worst should come to the worst as to what he ought to do with her  it would be impossible to let a pure young english girl like that fall helplessly into the hands of such bloodthirsty wretches as he knew the islanders were almost certain to be who could tell what nameless indignities what incredible tortures they might wantonly inflict upon her innocent soul was it right of him to have let her come ashore at all ought he not rather to have allowed the more merciful sea to take her life easily without the chance or possibility of such additional horrors  and nowas she sleptso calm and pure and maidenlywhat was his duty that minute just there to her he felt the blade of his knife with his finger cautiously and almost doubted if only she could tell what things might be in store for her would she not herself prefer death an honorable death at the friendly hands of a tenderhearted fellowcountryman to the unspeakable insults of these maneating polynesians if only he had the courage to release her by one blow as she lay there from the coming ill but he hadnt he hadnt even on board the australasian he had been vaguely aware that he was getting very fond of that pretty little miss ellis and now that he sat there after that desperate struggle for life with the pounding waves mounting guard over her through the livelong night his own heart told him plainly in tones he could not disobey he loved her too well to dare what he thought best in the end for her  still even so he was brave enough to feel he must never let the very worst of all befall her he bethought him in his doubt and agony of how his uncle major thurstan during the great indian mutiny had held his lonely bungalow with his wife and daughter by his side for three long hours against a howling mob of native insurgents and how when further resistance was hopeless and that great black wave of angry humanity burst in upon them at last the brave soldier had drawn his revolver shot his wife and daughter with unerring aim to prevent their falling alive into the hands of the natives and then blown his own brains out with his last remaining cartridge as his uncle had done at jhansi thirty years before so he himself would do on that nameless pacific islandfor he didnt know even now on what shore he had landed if the savages bore down upon them with hostile intent and threatened muriel he would plunge his knife first into that innocent womans heart and then bury it deep in his own and die beside her  so the long night wore onmuriel pillowed on loose cocoanut husk dozing now and again and waking with a start to gaze round about her wildly and realize once more in what plight she found herself felix crouching by her feet and keeping watch with eager eyes and ears on every side for the least sign of a noiseless naked footfall through the tangled growth of that dense tropical underbush time after time he clapped his hand to his ear shellwise and listened and peered with knitted brow suspecting some sudden swoop from an ambush in the jungle of creepers behind the little plantain patch time after time he grasped his knife hard and puckered his eyebrows resolutely and stood still with bated breath for a fierce wild leap upon his fancied assailant but the night wore away by degrees a minute at a time and no man came and dawn began to brighten the sealine to eastward  as the day dawned felix could see more clearly exactly where he was and in what surroundings without the ocean broke in huge curling billows on the shallow beach of the fringing reef with such stupendous force that felix wondered how they could ever have lived through its pounding surf and its fiercely retreating undertow within the lagoon spread its calm lakelike surface away to the white coral shore of the central atoll between these two waters the greater and the less a waving palisade of tallstemmed palmtrees rose on a narrow ribbon of circular land that formed the fringing reef all night through he had felt with a strange eerie misgiving the very foundations of the land thrill under his feet at every dull thud or boom of the surf on its restraining barrier now that he could see that thin belt of shore in its actual shape and size he was not astonished at this constant shock what surprised him rather was the fact that such a speck of land could hold its own at all against the ceaseless cannonade of that seemingly irresistible ocean  he stood up hatless in his battered tweed suit and surveyed the scene of their present and future adventures it took but a glance to show him that the whole groundplan of the island was entirely circular in the midst of all rose the central atoll itself a tiny mountainpeak just projecting with its hills and gorges to a few hundred feet above the surface of the ocean outside it came the lagoon with its placid ring of glassy water surrounding the circular island and separated from the sea by an equally circular belt of fringing reef covered thick with waving stems of picturesque cocoanut it was on the reef they had landed and from it they now looked across the calm lagoon with doubtful eyes toward the central island  as soon as the sun rose their doubts were quickly resolved into fears or certainties scarcely had its rim begun to show itself distinctly above the eastern horizon when a great bustle and confusion was noticeable at once on the opposite shore brownskinned savages were collecting in eager groups by a white patch of beach and putting out rude but wellmanned canoes into the calm waters of the lagoon at sight of their naked arms and bustling gestures muriels heart sank suddenly within her oh mr thurstan she cried clinging to his arm in her terror what does it all mean are they going to hurt us are these savages coming over are they coming to kill us  felix grasped his trusty knife hard in his right hand and swallowed a groan as he looked tenderly down upon her muriel he said forgetting in the excitement of the moment the little conventionalities and courtesies of civilized life if they are trust me you never shall fall alive into their cruel hands sooner than that he held up the knife significantly with its open blade before her  the poor girl clung to him harder still with a ghastly shudder oh its terrible terrible she cried turning deadly pale then after a short pause she added but i would rather have it so do as you say i could bear it from you promise me that rather than that those creatures should kill me  i promise felix answered clasping her hand hard and paused with the knife ever ready in his right awaiting the approach of the halfnaked savages  the boats glided fast across the lagoon propelled by the paddles of the stalwart polynesians who manned them and crowded to the waters edge with groups of grinning and shouting warriors they were dressed in aprons of dracæna leaves only with necklets and armlets of sharks teeth and cowrie shells a dozen canoes at least were making toward the reef at full speed all bristling with spears and alive with noisy and boisterous savages muriel shrank back terrorstricken at the sight as they drew nearer and nearer but felix holding his breath hard grew somewhat less nervous as the men approached the reef he had seen enough of polynesian life before now to feel sure these people were not upon the warpath whatever their ultimate intentions toward the castaways might be their immediate object seemed friendly and goodhumored the boats though large were not regular warcanoes the men instead of brandishing their spears and lunging out with them over the edge in threatening attitudes held them erect in their hands at rest like standards they were laughing and talking not crying their warcry as they drew near the shore one big canoe shot suddenly a length or so ahead of the rest and its leader standing on the grotesque carved figure that adorned its prow held up both his hands open and empty before him in sign of peace while at the same time he shouted out a word or two three times in his own language to reassure the castaways  felixs eye glanced cautiously from boat to boat he says we are friends the young man remarked in an undertone to his terrified companion i can understand his dialect thank heaven its very close to fijian i shall be able at least to palaver to these men i dont think they mean just now to harm us i believe we can trust them at any rate for the present  the poor girl drew back in still greater awe and alarm than ever oh are they going to land here she cried still clinging closer with both hands to her one friend and protector  try not to look so frightened felix exclaimed with a warning glance remember much depends upon it savages judge you greatly by what demeanor you happen to assume if youre frightened they know their power if they see youre resolute they suspect you have some supernatural means of protection try to meet them frankly as if you were not afraid of them then advancing slowly to the waters edge he called out aloud in a strong clear voice a few words which muriel didnt understand but which were really the fijian for we also are friendly our medicine is good we mean no magic we come to you from across the great water we desire your peace receive us and protect us  at the sound of words which he could readily understand and which differed but little indeed from his own language the leader on the foremost canoe who seemed by his manner to be a great chief turned round to his followers and cried out in tones of superstitious awe tukilakila spoke well these are indeed what he told us korong korong they are spirits who have come to us from the disk of the sun to bring us light and pure fresh fire stay back there all of you you are not holy enough to approach i and my crew who are sanctified by the mysteries we alone will go forward to meet them  as he spoke a sudden idea suggested by his words struck felixs mind superstition is the great lever by which to move the savage intelligence gathering up a few dry leaves and fragments of stick on the shore he laid them together in a pile and awaited in silence the arrival of the foremost islanders the first canoe advanced slowly and cautiously the men in it eying these proceedings with evident suspicion the rest hung back with their spears in array and their hands just ready to use them with effect should occasion demand it  the leader of the first canoe coming close to the shore jumped out upon the reef in shallow water half a dozen of his followers jumped after him without hesitation and brandished their weapons round their heads as they advanced in savage unison but felix pretending hardly to notice these hostile demonstrations stepped boldly up toward his little pile with great deliberation though trembling inwardly and proceeded before their eyes to take a match from his box which he displayed ostentatiously all glittering in the sun to the foremost savage the leader stood by and watched him close with eyes of silent wonder then felix kneeling down struck the match on the box and applied it as it lighted to the dry leaves beside him  a chorus of astonishment burst unanimously from the delighted natives as the dry leaves leaped all at once into a tongue of flame and the little pile caught quickly from the fire in the vesta  the leader looked hard at the two white faces and then at the fire on the beach with evident approbation it is as tukilakila said he exclaimed at last with profound awe they are spirits from the sun and they carry with them pure fire in shining boxes  then advancing a pace and pointing toward the canoe he motioned felix and muriel to take their seats within it with native savage politeness tukilakila has sent for you he said in his grandest aristocratic air for your chief is a gentleman he wishes to receive you he saw your messagefire on the reef last night and he knew you had come he has made you a very great taboo he has put you under protection of fire and water  the people in the boats with one accord shouted out in wild chorus as if to confirm his words taboo taboo tukilakila has said it taboo taboo ware fire ware water  though the dialect in which they spoke differed somewhat from that in use in fiji felix could still make out with care almost every word of what the chief had said to him and the universal polynesian expression taboo in particular somewhat reassured him as to their friendly intentions among remote heathen islanders like these he felt sure the very word itself was far too sacred to be taken in vain they would respect its inviolability he turned round to muriel we must go with them he said shortly its our one chance left of life now dont be too terrified there is still some hope they say somebody they call tukilakila has tabooed us no one will dare to hurt us against so great a taboo for tukilakila is evidently some very important king or chief you must step into the boat it cant be avoided if any harm is threatened be sure i wont forget my promise  muriel shrank back in alarm and clung still to his arm now as naturally as she would have clung to a brothers oh mr thurstan she criedfelix i dont know what to say i cant go with them  felix put his arm gently round her girlish waist and half lifted her into the boat in spite of her reluctance you must he said with great firmness you must do as i say i will watch over you and take care of you if the worst comes i have always my knife and i wont forget now friend he went on in fijian turning round to the chief as he took his seat in the canoe fearlessly among all those dusky halfclad figures we are ready to start we do not fear we wish to go take us to tukilakila  and all the savages around shouting in their surprise and awe exclaimed once more in concert tukilakila is great we will take them as he bids us forthwith to heaven  what do they say muriel cried clinging close to the white mans side in her speechless terror do you understand their language  well i cant quite make it out felix answered much puzzled that is to say not every word of it they say theyll take us somewhere i dont quite know where but in fijian the word would certainly mean to heaven  muriel shuddered visibly you dont think she said with a tremulous tongue they mean to kill us  no i dont think so felix replied not overconfidently they said we were taboo but with savages like these of course one can never in any case be quite certain     chapter v  enrolled in olympus   they rowed across the lagoon a mysterious procession almost in silencethe canoe with the two europeans going first the others following at a slight distanceand landed at last on the brink of the central island  several of the boupari people leaped ashore at once then they helped felix and muriel from the frail bark with almost deferential care and led the way before them up a steep white path that zigzagged through the forest toward the centre of the island as they went a band of natives preceded them in regular line of march shouting taboo taboo at short intervals especially as they neared any group of fanpalm cottages the women whom they met fell on their knees at once till the strange procession had passed them by the men only bowed their heads thrice and made a rapid movement on their breasts with their fingers which reminded muriel at once of the sign of the cross in catholic countries  so on they wended their way in silence through the deep tropical jungle along a pathway just wide enough for three to walk abreast till they emerged suddenly upon a large cleared space in whose midst grew a great banyantree with arms that dropped and rooted themselves like buttresses in the soil beneath under the banyantree a raised platform stood upon posts of bamboo the platform was covered with fine network in yellow and red and two little stools occupied the middle as if placed there on purpose and waiting for their occupants  the man who had headed the first canoe turned round to felix and motioned him forward this is heaven he said glibly in his own tongue spirits ascend it  felix much wondering what the ceremony could mean mounted the platform without a word in obedience to the chiefs command closely followed by muriel who dared not leave him for a second  bring water the chief said shortly in a voice of authority to one of his followers  the man handed up a calabash with a little water in it the chief took the rude vessel from his hands in a reverential manner and poured a few drops of the contents on felixs head the water trickled down over his hair and forehead involuntarily felix shook his head a little at the unexpected wetting and scattered the drops right and left on his neck and shoulders the chief watched this performance attentively with profound satisfaction then he turned to his attendants  the spirit shakes his head he said with a deeply convinced air all is well heaven has chosen him korong korong he is accepted for his purpose it is well it is well let us try the other one  he raised the calabash once more and poured a few drops in like manner on muriels dark hair the poor girl trembling in every limb shook her head also in the same unintentional fashion the chief regarded her with still more complacent eyes  it is well he observed once more to his companions smiling she too gives the sign of acceptance korong korong heaven is well pleased with both see how her body trembles  at that moment a girl came forward with a little basket of fruits the chief chose a banana with care from the basket peeled it with his dusky hands broke it slowly in two and handed one half very solemnly to felix  eat king of the rain he said as he presented it the offering of heaven  felix ate it at once thinking it best under the circumstances not to demur at all to anything his strange hosts might choose to impose upon him  the chief handed the other half just as solemnly to muriel eat queen of the clouds he said as he placed it in her fingers the offering of heaven  muriel hesitated she didnt know what his words meant and it seemed to her rather the offering of a very dirty and unwashed savage the chief eyed her hard for gods sake eat it my child he tells you to eat it felix exclaimed in haste muriel lifted it to her lips and swallowed it down with difficulty the mans dusky hands didnt inspire confidence  but the chief seemed relieved when he had seen her swallow it all is well done he said turning again to his followers we have obeyed the words of tukilakila and his orders that he gave us we have offered the strangers the spirits from the sun as a free gift to heaven and heaven has accepted them we have given them fruits the fruits of the earth and they have duly eaten them korong korong the king of the rain and the queen of the clouds have indeed come among us they are truly gods we will take them now as he bid us to tukilakila  what have they done to us muriel asked aside in a terrified undertone of felix  i cant quite make out felix answered in the selfsame voice they call us the king of the rain and the queen of the clouds in their own language i think they imagine weve come from the sun and that were a sort of spirits  at the sound of these words the girl who held the basket of fruits gave a sudden start it almost seemed to muriel as if she understood them but when muriel looked again she gave no further sign she merely held her peace and tried to appear wholly undisconcerted  the chief beckoned them down from the platform with a wave of his hand they rose and followed him as they rose the people around them bowed low to the ground felix could see they were bowing to muriel and himself not merely to the chief a doubt flitted strangely across his mind for a moment what could it all mean did they take the two strangers then for supernatural beings had they enrolled them as gods if so it might serve as some little protection for them  the procession formed again three and three three and three in solemn silence then the chief walked in front of them with measured steps and felix and muriel followed behind wondering as they went the cry rose louder and louder than before taboo taboo people who met them fell on their faces at once as the chief cried out in a loud tone the king of the rain the queen of the clouds korong korong they are coming they are coming  at last they reached a second cleared space standing in a large garden of manilla loquat poncians and hibiscustrees it was entered by a gate a tall gate of bamboo posts at the gate all the followers fell back to right and left awestruck only the chief went calmly on he beckoned to felix and muriel to follow him  they entered half terrified felix still grasped his open knife in his hand ready to strike at any moment that might be necessary the chief led them forward toward a very large tree near the centre of the garden at the foot of the tree stood a hut somewhat bigger and better built than any they had yet seen and in front of the trunk a stalwart savage very powerfully built but with a sinister look in his cruel and lustful eye was pacing up and down like a sentinel on guard a long spear in his right hand and a tomahawk in his left held close by his side all ready for action as he prowled up and down he seemed to be peering warily about him on every side as if each instant he expected to be set upon by an enemy but as the chief approached the people without set up once more the cry of taboo taboo and the stalwart savage by the tree laying down his spear and letting his tomahawk fall free dropped in a second the air of watchful alarm and advanced with some courtesy to greet the newcomers  we have found them tukilakila the chief said presenting them to the god with a graceful wave of his hand we have found the spirits that you brought from the sun with the fire in their hands and the light in boxes we have taken them to heaven heaven has accepted them we have offered them fruit and they have eaten the banana the king of the rainthe queen of the clouds korong receive them  tukilakila glanced at them with an approving glance strangely compounded of pleasure and terror they are plump he said shortly they are indeed korong my sun has sent me an acceptable present  what is your will that we should do with them the chief asked in a deeply deferential tone  tukilakila looked hard at murielsuch a hateful look that the knife trembled irresolute for a second in felixs hand give them two fresh huts he said in a lordly way give them divine platters give them all that they need make everything right for them  the chief bowed and retired with an awed air from the presence exactly as he passed a certain line on the ground marked white with a row of coralsand tukilakila seized his spear and his tomahawk once more and mounted guard as before at the foot of the great tree where they had seen him pacing an instantaneous change seemed to muriel to come over his demeanor at that moment while he spoke with the chief she noticed he looked all cruelty lust and hateful selfindulgence now that he paced up and down warily in front of that sacred floor peering around him with keen suspicion he seemed rather the personification of watchfulness fear and a certain slavish bodily terror especially she observed he cast upon felix as he went a glance of angry hate and yet he did not attempt to hurt or molest him in any way defenceless as they both were before those numerous savages  as they emerged from the enclosure the girl with the fruit basket stood near the gate looking outward from the wall her face turned away from the awful home of tukilakila at the moment when muriel passed to her immense astonishment the girl spoke to her dont be afraid missy she said in english in a rather low voice without obtrusively approaching them boupari man not going to hurt you me going to be your servant me name mali me very good girl me take plenty care of you  the unexpected sound of her own language in the midst of so much unmitigated savagery took muriel fairly by surprise she looked hard at the girl but thought it wisest to answer nothing this particular young woman indeed was just as dark and to all appearance just as much of a savage as any of the rest of them but she could speak english at any rate and she said she was to be muriels servant  the chief led them back to the shore talking volubly all the way in polynesia to felix his dialect differed so much from the fijian that when he spoke first felix could hardly follow him but he gathered vaguely nevertheless that they were to be well housed and fed for the present at the public expense and even that something which the chief clearly regarded as a very great honor was in store for them in the future whatever these peoples particular superstition might be it seemed pretty evident at least that it told in the strangers favor felix almost began to hope they might manage to live there pretty tolerably for the next two or three weeks and perhaps to signal in time to some passing australian liner  the rest of that wonderful eventful day was wholly occupied with practical details before long two adjacent huts were found for them near the shore of the lagoon and felix noticed with pleasure not only that the huts themselves were new and clean but also that the chief took great care to place round both of them a single circular line of white coralsand like the one he had noticed at tukilakilas palacetemple he felt sure this white line made the space within taboo no native would dare without leave to cross it  when the line was well marked out round the two huts together the chief went away for a while leaving the europeans within their broad white circle guarded by an angrylooking band of natives with long spears at rest all pointed inward the natives themselves stood well without the ring but the points of their spears almost reached the line and it was clear they would not for the present permit the europeans to leave the charmed circle  presently the chief returned again followed by two other natives in official costumes one of them was a tall and handsome young man dressed in a long robe or cloak of yellow feathers the other was stouter and perhaps forty or thereabouts he wore a short cape of white albatross plumes with a girdle of shells at his waist interspersed with red coral  the king of fire will make taboo the chief said solemnly  the young man with the cloak of yellow feathers stepped forward and spoke toeing the line with his left foot and brandishing a lighted stick in his right hand taboo taboo taboo he cried aloud with emphasis if any man dare to transgress this line without leave i burn him to ashes if any woman i scorch her to a cinder taboo to the king of the rain and the queen of the clouds taboo taboo taboo korong i say it  he stepped back into the ranks with an air of duty performed the chief looked about him curiously a moment the king of water will make taboo he repeated after a pause in the same deep tone of profound conviction  the stouter man in the short white cape stepped forward in his turn he toed the line with his naked left foot in his brown right hand he carried a calabash of water taboo taboo taboo he exclaimed aloud pouring out the water upon the ground symbolically if any man dare to transgress this line without leave i drown him in his canoe if any woman i drag her alive into the spring as she fetches water taboo to the king of the rain and the queen of the clouds taboo taboo taboo korong i say it  what does it all mean muriel whispered terrified  felix explained to her as far as he could in a few hurried sentences theres only one word in it i dont understand he added hastily and thats korong it doesnt occur in fiji they keep saying were korong whatever that may mean and evidently they attach some very great importance to it  let the shadows come forward the chief said looking up with an air of dignity  a goodlooking young man and the girl who said her name was mali stepped forth from the crowd and fell on their knees before him  the chief laid his hand on the young mans shoulder and raised him up the shadow of the king of the rain he cried turning him three times round follow him in all his incomings and his outgoings and serve him faithfully taboo taboo pass within the sacred circle  he clapped his hands the young man crossed the line with a sort of reverent reluctance and took his place within the ring close up to felix  the chief laid his hand on malis shoulder the shadow of the queen of the clouds he said turning her three times round follow her in all her incomings and outgoings and serve her faithfully taboo taboo pass within the sacred circle  then he waved both hands to felix go where you will now he said your shadow will follow you you are free as the rain that drops where it will you are as free as the clouds that roam through heaven no man will hinder you  and in a moment the spearmen dropped their spears in concert the crowd fell back and the villagers dispersed as if by magic to their own houses  but felix and muriel were left alone beside their huts guarded only in silence by their two mystic shadows     chapter vi  first days in boupari   throughout that day the natives brought them from time to time numerous presents of yam bananas and breadfruit neatly arranged in little palmleaf baskets a few of them brought eggs as well and one offering even included a live chicken but the people who brought them and who were mostly young girls just entering upon womanhood did not venture to cross the white line of coralsand that surrounded the huts they laid down their presents with many salaams on the ground outside and then waited with a halfstartled halfreverent air for one or other of the two shadows to come out and fetch them as soon as the baskets were carried well within the marked line the young girls exhibited every sign of pleasure and calling aloud korong korongthat mysterious polynesian word of whose import felix was ignorantthey retired once more by tortuous paths through the surrounding jungle  why do they bring us presents felix asked at last of his shadow after this curious pantomime had been performed some three or four times are they always going to keep us in such plenty  the shadow looked back at him with an air of considerable surprise they bring presents of course he said in his own tongue because they are badly in want of rain we have had much drought of late in boupari we need water from heaven the bananabushes wither the flowers on the breadfruit tree do not swell to breadfruit the yams are thirsty therefore the fathers send their daughters with presents maidens of the villages all marriageable girls to ask for rainfall but they will always provide for you and also for the queen however you behave for you are both korong tukilakila has said so and heaven has accepted you  what do you mean by korong felix asked with some trepidation  the shadow merely looked back at him with a sort of blank surprise that anybody should be ignorant of so simple a conception why korong is korong he answered aghast you are korong yourself the queen of the clouds is korong too you are both korong that is why they all treat you with such respect and reverence  and that was as much as felix could elicit by his subtlest questions from his taciturn shadow  in fact it was clear that in the open at least the shadow was averse to being observed in familiar conversation with felix during the heat of the day however when they sat alone within the hut he was much more communicative then he launched forth pretty freely into talk about the island and its life which would no doubt have largely enlightened felix had it not been for two drawbacks to their means of intercommunication in the first place the boupari dialect though agreeing in all essentials with the polynesian of fiji nevertheless contained a great many words and colloquial expressions unknown to the fijians this being particularly the case as felix soon remarked in the whole vocabulary of religious rites and ceremonies and in the second place the shadow was so rigidly bound by his own narrow and insular set of ideas that he couldnt understand the difficulty felix felt in throwing himself into them over and over again when felix asked him to explain some word or custom he would repeat with naïve impatience why korong is korong or tula is just tula even a child must surely know what tula is much more yourself who are indeed korong and who have come from the sun to bring fresh fire to us  in the adjoining hut muriel who was now beginning in some small degree to get rid of her most pressing fear for the immediate future and whom the obvious reality of the taboo had reassured for the moment sat with mali her own particular shadow unravelling the mystery of the girls knowledge of english  mali indeed like the other shadow showed every disposition to indulge in abundant conversation as soon as she found herself well within the hut alone with her mistress and secluded from the prying eyes of all the other islanders  dont you be afraid missy she said with genuine kindliness in her tone as soon as the gifts of yam and breadfruit had all been duly housed and garnered no harm come to you you korong you know you very great taboo tukilakila send king of fire and king of water to make taboo over you so nobody hurt you  muriel burst into tears at the sound of her own language from those dusky lips and exclaimed through her sobs clinging to the girls hand for comfort as she spoke why how did you ever come to speak englishtell me  mali looked up at her with a halfastonished air oh i servant in queensland of course missy she answered with great composure labor vessel come to my island far away four five years ago steal boy steal woman my papa just kill my mamma because he angry with her so no want daughters so my papa sell me and my sister for plenty rum plenty tobacco to gentlemen in labor vessel gentlemen in labor vessel take jani and me away away to queensland big sea long voyage we stop there three yamthree

slave of us and that was all to her quite a commonplace everyday history  i see muriel cried then youve been for three years in australia and there you learned english why what did you do there  mali looked back at her with the same matteroffact air of composure as before oh me nurse at first she said shortly then after me housemaid live three year in gentlemans house good gentleman that buy me take care of little girl clean rooms do everything me know how to make english lady quite comfortable me tell that to chief that make him say mali you be queenies shadow  to muriel in her loneliness even such companionship as that was indeed a consolation oh im so glad you told him she cried if we have to stop here long before a ship takes us off itll be so nice to have you here all the time with me you wont go away from me ever will you youll always stop with me  the girls surprise showed more profoundly than ever me cant go away she answered with emphasis me your shadow that great taboo tukilakila great god if me go away tukilakila kill me and eat me  muriel started back in horror but mali she said looking hard at the girls pleasant brown face if you were three years in australia youre a christian surely  the girl nodded her head in passive acquiescence me christian in australia she answered of course me christian all folks make christian when him go to queensland that what for me call mali and my sister jani we have other names on my own island but when we go to queensland gentleman baptize us call us mali and jani me methodist in queensland methodist very good but methodist god no live in boupari not any good be methodist here any longer tukilakila god here him very powerful  what not that dreadful creature that they took us to see this morning muriel exclaimed in horror oh mali you cant mean to say they think hes a god that awful man there  mali nodded her assent with profound conviction yes yes him god she repeated confidently him very powerful my sister jani go too near him temple against taboobecause her not belonga tukilakila temple and last night when it great feast plenty men catch jani and tie him up in rope and tukilakila kill him and plenty boupari men help tukilakila eat up jani  she said it in the same simple matteroffact way as she had said that she was a nurse for three years in queensland to her it was a common incident of everyday life such accidents will happen if you break taboo and go too near forbidden temples  but muriel drew back and let the pleasantlooking brown girls hand drop suddenly you cant mean it she cried you cant mean hes a god such a wicked man as that oh his very looks too horrible  mali drew back in her turn with a somewhat terrified air and peeped suspiciously around her as if to make sure whether any one was listening oh hush she said anxiously dont must talk like that if tukilakila hear him scorch us up to ashes him very great god him good him powerful  how can he be good if he does such awful things muriel exclaimed energetically  mali peered around her once more with terrified eyes in the same uneasy way take care she said again him god him powerful him can do no wrong him king of the trees him king of heaven on boupari island methodist god not much no god so great like tukilakila  but a man cant be a god muriel exclaimed contemptuously hes nothing but a man a savage a cannibal  mali looked back at her in wondering surprise not in queensland she answered calmlyto her all the world naturally divided itself into queensland and polynesiano god in queensland governor him very great chief but him no god like tukilakila methodist god in sky him only god that live in queensland but no use worship methodist god over here in boupari him no live here tukilakila live here all god here make out of man live in man korong what for you say a man cant be a god you god yourself white gentleman there god korong korong chief put you in heaven so make you a god people pray to you now people bring you presents  you dont mean to say muriel cried they bring me these things because they think me a goddess  mali nodded a grave assent same like people give money in church in queensland she answered promptly ask you make rain make plenty crop make breadfruit grow make banana make plantain you korong now while your time last queenie people give you plenty of present  while my time last muriel repeated with a curious sense of discomfort creeping over her slowly  the girl nodded an easy assent yes while your time last she answered laying a small bundle of palmleaves at muriels back by way of a cushion for now you korong by and by korong pass to somebody else this year you korong so people worship you  but nothing that muriel could say would induce the girl further to explain her meaning she shook her head and looked very wise when a god come into somebody she said nodding toward muriel in a mysterious way then him god himself him korong when the god go away from him him korong no longer somebody else korong queenie korong now so people worship him while him time last people plenty kind to him  the day passed away and night came on as it approached heavy clouds drifted up from eastward mali busied herself with laying out a rough bed in the hut for muriel and making her a pillow of soft moss and the curious lichenlike material that hangs parasitic from the trees and is commonly known as old mans beard as both mali and felix assured her confidently no harm would come to her within so strict a taboo muriel worn out with fatigue and terror lay down at last and slept soundly on this native substitute for a bedstead she slept without dreaming while mali lay at her feet ready at a moments call it was all so strange and yet she was too utterly wearied to do otherwise than sleep in spite of her strange and terrible surroundings  felix slept too for some hours but woke with a start in the night it was raining heavily he could hear the loud patter of a fierce tropical shower on the roof of his hut his shadow at his feet slept still unmoved but when felix rose on his elbow the shadow rose on a sudden too and confronted him curiously the young man heard the rain then he bowed down his face with an awed air not visible but audible in the still darkness it has come he said with superstitious terror it has come at last my lord has brought it  after that felix lay awake for some hours hearing the rain on the roof and puzzled in his own head by a halfuncertain memory what was it in his school reading that that ceremony with the water indefinitely reminded him of wasnt there some greek or roman superstition about shaking your head when water was poured upon it what could that superstition be and what light might it cast on that mysterious ceremony he wished he could remember but it was so long since hed read it and he never cared much at school for greek or roman antiquities  suddenly in a lull of the rain the whole context at once came back with a rush to him he remembered now he had read it some time or other in some classical dictionary it was a custom connected with greek sacrifices the officiating priest poured water or wine on the head of the sheep bullock or other victim if the victim shook its head and knocked off the drops that was a sign that it was fit for the sacrifice and that the god accepted it if the victim trembled visibly that was a most favorable omen if it stood quite still and didnt move its neck then the god rejected it as unfit for his purpose couldnt that be the meaning of the ceremony performed on muriel and himself in heaven that morning were they merely intended as human sacrifices were they to be kept meanwhile and as it were fed up for the slaughter it was too horrible to believe yet it almost looked like it  he wished he knew the meaning of that strange word korong clearly it contained the true key to the mystery  anyhow he had always his trusty knife if the worst came to the worstthose wretches should never harm his spotless muriel  for he loved her tonight he would watch over and protect her he would save her at least from the deadliest of insults     chapter vii  interchange of civilities   all night long without intermission the heavy tropical rain descended in torrents at sunrise it ceased and a bright blue vault of sky stood in a spotless dome over the island of boupari  as soon as the sun was well risen and the rain had ceased one shy native girl after another came straggling up timidly to the white line that marked the taboo round felix and muriels huts they came with more baskets of fruit and eggs humbly saluting three times as they drew near they laid down their gifts modestly just outside the line with many loud ejaculations of praise and gratitude to the gods in their own language  what do they say muriel asked in a dazed and frightened way looking out of the hut door and turning in wonder to mali  they say thank you queenie for rain and fruits mali answered unconcerned bustling about in the hut missy want to wash him face and hands this morning lady always wash every day over yonder in queensland  muriel nodded assent it was all so strange to her but mali went to the door and beckoned carelessly to one of the native girls just outside who drew near the line at the summons with a somewhat frightened air putting one finger to her mouth in coyly uncertain savage fashion  fetch me water from the spring mali said authoritatively in polynesian without a moments delay the girl darted off at the top of her speed and soon returned with a large calabash full of fresh cool water which she lay down respectfully by the taboo line not daring to cross it  why didnt you get it yourself muriel asked of her shadow rather relieved than otherwise that mali hadnt left her it was something in these dire straits to have somebody always near who could at least speak a little english  mali started back in surprise oh that would never do she answered catching a colloquial phrase she had often heard long before in queensland me missys shadow that great taboo if me go away out of missys sight very big sinvery big danger manaboupari catch me and kill me like jani for no me stop and wait all the time on missy  it was clear that human life was held very cheap on the island of boupari  muriel made her scanty toilet in the hut as well as she was able with the calabash and water aided by a rough shell comb which mali had provided for her then she breakfasted not ill off eggs and fruit which mali cooked with some rude native skill over the openair fire without in the precincts  after breakfast felix came in to inquire how she had passed the night in her new quarters already muriel felt how odd was the contrast between the quiet politeness of his manner as an english gentleman and the strange savage surroundings in which they both now found themselves civilization is an attribute of communities we necessarily leave it behind when we find ourselves isolated among barbarians or savages but culture is a purely personal and individual possession we carry it with us wherever we go and no circumstances of life can ever deprive us of it  as they sat there talking with a deep and abiding sense of awe at the change muriel more conscious than ever now of how deep was her interest in felix thurstan who represented for her all that was dearest and best in england a curious noise as of a discordant drum or tomtom beaten in a sort of recurrent tune was heard toward the hills and at its very first sound both the shadows flinging themselves upon their faces with every sign of terror endeavored to hide themselves under the native mats with which the bare little hut was roughly carpeted  whats the matter felix cried in english to mali for muriel had already explained to him how the girl had picked up some knowledge of our tongue in queensland  mali trembled in every limb so that she could hardly speak tukilakila come she answered all breathless no blackfellow look at him burn blackfellow up you and missy korong all right for you go out to meet him  tukilakila is coming the young manshadow said in polynesian almost in the same breath and no less tremulously we dare not look upon his face lest he burn us to ashes he is a very great taboo his face is fire but you two are gods step forth to receive him  felix took muriels hand in his somewhat trembling himself and led her forth on to the open space in front of the huts to meet the mangod she followed him like a child she was woman enough for that she had implicit trust in him  as they emerged a strange procession met their eyes unawares coming down the zigzag path that led from the hills to the shore of the lagoon where their huts were situated at its head marched two mentall straight and supplewearing huge feather masks over their faces and beating tomtoms decorated with long strings of shiny cowries after them in order came a sort of hollow square of chiefs or warriors surrounding with fanpalms a central object all shrouded from the view with the utmost precaution this central object was covered with a huge regal umbrella from whose edge hung rows of small nautilus and other shells so as to form a kind of screen like the japanese portières now so common in english doorways two supporters held it up one on either side in long cloaks of feathers under the umbrella a man seemed to move and as he approached the natives to right and left fled precipitately to their huts snatching up their naked little ones from the ground as they went and crying aloud taboo taboo he comes he comes tukilakila tukilakila  the procession wound slowly on unheeding these common creatures till it reached the huts then the chiefs who formed the hollow square fell back one by one and the man under the umbrella with his two supporters came forward boldly felix noticed that they crossed without scruple the thick white line of sand which all the other natives so carefully respected the man within the umbrella drew aside the curtain of hanging nautilus shells his face was covered with a thin mask of paper mulberry bark but felix knew he was the selfsame person whom they had seen the day before in the central temple  tukilakilas air was more insolent and arrogant than even before he was clearly in high spirits you have done well o king of the rain he said turning gayly to felix and you too o queen of the clouds you have done right bravely we have all acquitted ourselves as our people would wish we have made our showers to descend abundantly from heaven we have caused the crops to grow we have wetted the plantain bushes see tukilakila who is so great a god has come from his own home on the hills to greet you  it has certainly rained in the night felix answered dryly  but tukilakila was not to be put off thus adjusting his thin mask or veil of bark so as to hide his face more thoroughly from the inferior god he turned round once more to the chiefs who even so hardly dared to look openly upon him then he struck an attitude the man was clearly bursting with spiritual pride he knew himself to be a god and was filled with the insolence of his supernatural power see my people he cried holding up his hands palm outward in his accustomed godlike way i am indeed a great deitylord of heaven lord of earth life of the world master of time measurer of the suns course spirit of growth creator of the harvest master of mortals bestower of breath upon men chief pillar of heaven  the warriors bowed down before their bloated master with unquestioning assent giver of life to all the host of the gods they cried you are indeed a mighty one weigher of the equipoise of heaven and earth we acknowledge your might we give you thanks eternally  tukilakila swelled with visible importance did i not tell you my meat he exclaimed i would bring you new gods great spirits from the sun fetchers of fire from my bright home in the heavens and have they not come are they not here today have they not brought the precious gift of fresh fire with them  tukilakila speaks true the chiefs echoed submissively with bent heads  did i not make one of them king of the rain tukilakila asked once more stretching one hand toward the sky with theatrical magnificence did i not declare the other queen of the clouds in heaven and have i not caused them to bring down showers this night upon our crops has not the dry earth drunk am i not the great god the saviour of boupari  tukilakila says well the chiefs responded once more in unanimous chorus  tukilakila struck another attitude with childish selfsatisfaction i go into the hut to speak with my ministers he said grandiloquently fire and water wait you here outside while i enter and speak with my friends from the sun whom i have brought for the salvation of the crops to boupari  the king of fire and the king of water supporting the umbrella bowed assent to his words tukilakila motioned felix and muriel into the nearest hut it was the one where the two shadows lay crouching in terror among the native mats as the god tried to enter the two cowering wretches set up a loud shout taboo taboo mercy mercy mercy tukilakila retreated with a contemptuous smile i want to see you alone he said in polynesian to felix is the other hut empty if not go in and cut their throats who sit there and make the place a solitude for tukilakila  there is no one in the hut felix answered with a nod concealing his disgust at the command as far as he was able  that is well tukilakila answered and walked into it carelessly felix followed him close and deemed it best to make muriel enter also  as soonas they were alone tukilakilas manner altered greatly come now he said quite genially yet with a curious undercurrent of hate in his steely gray eye we three are all gods we who are in heaven need have no secrets from one another tell me the truth did you really come to us direct from the sun or are you sailing gods dropped from a great canoe belonging to the warriors who seek laborers for the white men in the distant country  felix told him briefly in as few words as possible the story of their arrival  tukilakila listened with lively interest then he said very decisively with great bravado it was i who made the big wave wash your sister overboard i sent it to your ship i wanted a korong just now in boupari it was i who brought you  you are mistaken felix said simply not thinking it worth while to contradict him further it was a purely natural accident  well tell me the savage god went on once more eying him close and sharp they say you have brought fresh fire from the sun with you and that you know how to make it burst out like lightning at will my people have seen it they tell me the wonder i wish to see it too we are all gods here we need have no secrets only i didnt want to let those common people outside see i asked you to show me make fire leap forth i desire to behold it  felix took out the matchbox from his pocket and struck a vesta carefully tukilakila looked on with profound interest it is wonderful he said taking the vesta in his own hand as it burned and examining it closely i have heard of this before but i have never seen it you are indeed gods you white men you sailors of the sea he glanced at muriel and the woman too he said with a horrible leer the woman is pretty  felix took the measure of his man at once he opened his knife and held it up threateningly see here fellow he said in a low slow tone but with great decision if you dare to speak or look like that at that ladygod or no god ill drive this knife straight up to the handle in your heart though your people kill me for it afterward ten thousand times over i am not afraid of you these savages may be afraid and may think you are a god but if you are then i am a god ten thousand times stronger than you one more wordone more look like that i sayand i plunge this knife remorselessly into you  tukilakila drew back and smiled benignly stalwart ruffian as he was and absolute master of his own peoples lives he was yet afraid in a way of the strange newcomer vague stories of the men with white facesthe sailing godshad reached him from time to time and though only twice within his memory had european boats landed on his island he yet knew enough of the race to know that they were at least very powerful deitiesmore powerful with their weapons than even he was besides a man who could draw down fire from heaven with a piece of wax and a little metal box might surely wither him to ashes if he would as he stood before him the very fact that felix bearded him thus openly to his face astonished and somewhat terrified the superstitious savage everybody else on the island was afraid of him then certainly a man who was not afraid must be the possessor of some most efficacious and magical medicine his one fear now was lest his followers should hear and discover his discomfiture he peered about him cautiously with that careful gleam shining bright in his eye then he said with a leer in a very low voice we two need not quarrel we are both of us gods neither of us is the stronger we are equal thats all let us live like brothers not like enemies on the island  i dont want to be your brother felix answered unable to conceal his loathing any more i hate and detest you  what does he say muriel asked in an agony of fear at the savages black looks is he going to kill us  no felix answered boldly i think hes afraid of us hes going to do nothing you neednt fear him  can she not speak the savage asked pointing with his finger somewhat rudely toward muriel has she no voice but this the chatter of birds does she not know the human language  she can speak felix replied placing himself like a shield between muriel and the astonished savage she can speak the language of the people of our distant countrya beautiful language which is as far superior to the speech of the brown men of polynesia as the sun in the heavens is superior to the light of a candlenut but she cant speak the wretched tongue of you boupari cannibals i thank heaven she cant for it saves her from understanding the hateful things your people would say of her now go i have seen already enough of you i am not afraid remember i am as powerful a god as you i need not fear you cannot hurt me  a baleful light gleamed in the cannibals eye but he thought it best to temporize powerful as he was on his island there was one thing yet more powerful by far than he and that was taboothe custom and superstition handed down from his ancestors these strangers were korong he dare not touch them except in the way and manner and time appointed by custom if he did god as he was his people themselves would turn and rend him he was a god but he was bound on every side by the strictest taboos he dare not himself offer violence to felix  so he turned with a smile and bided his time he knew it would come he could afford to laugh then going to the door he said with his grand affable manner to his chiefs around i have spoken with the gods my ministers within they have kissed my hands my rain has fallen all is well in the land arise let us go away hence to my temple  the savages put themselves in marching order at once it is the voice of a god they said reverently let us take back tukilakila to his temple home let us escort the lord of the divine umbrella wherever he is there trees and plants put forth green leaves and flourish at his bidding flowers bloom and springs of water rise up in fountains his presence diffuses heavenly blessings  i think felix said turning to poor terrified muriel ive sent the wretch away with a bee in his bonnet     chapter viii  the customs of boupari   human nature cannot always keep on the full stretch of excitement it was wonderful to both felix and muriel how soon they settled down into a quiet routine of life on the island of boupari a week passed awaytwo weeksthree weeksand the chances of release seemed to grow slenderer and slenderer all they could do now was to wait for the stray accident of a passing ship and then try if possible to signal it or to put out to it in a canoe if the natives would allow them  meanwhile their lives for the moment seemed fairly safe though for the first few days they lived in constant alarm this feeling after a time gave way to one of comparative security the strange institution of taboo protected them more efficiently in their wattled huts than the whole police force of london could have done in a belgravian mansion there thieves break through and steal in spite of bolts and bars and metropolitan constables but at boupari no native however daring or however wicked would ever venture to transgress the narrow line of white coral sand which protected the castaways like an intangible wall from all outer interference within this impalpable ringfence they were absolutely safe from all rude intrusion save that of the two shadows who waited upon them day and night with unfailing willingness  in other respects considering the circumstances their life was an easy one the natives brought them freely of their simple storeyam taro breadfruit and cocoanut with plenty of fish crabs and lobsters as well as eggs by the basketful and even sometimes chickens they required no pay beyond a nod and a smile and went away happy at those slender recognitions felix discovered in fact that they had got into a region where the arid generalizations of political economy do not apply where adam smith is unread and mill neglected where the medium of exchange is an unknown quantity and where supply and demand readjust themselves continuously by simpler and more generous principles than the familiar european one of the higgling of the market  the people too though utter savages were not in their own way altogether unpleasing it was their customs and superstitions rather than themselves that were so cruel and horrible personally they seemed for the most part simpleminded and good natured creatures at first indeed muriel was afraid to venture for a step beyond the precincts of their own huts and it was long before she could make up her mind to go alone through the jungle paths with mali unaccompanied by felix but by degrees she learned that she could walk by herself of course with the inevitable shadow ever by her side over the whole island and meet everywhere with nothing from men women and children but the utmost respect and gracious courtesy the young lads as she passed would stand aside from the path with downcast eyes and let her go by with all the politeness of chivalrous english gentlemen the old men would raise their eyes but cross their hands on their breasts and stand motionless for a few minutes till she got almost out of sight the women would bring their pretty brown babies for the fair english lady to admire or to pat on the head and when muriel now and again stooped down to caress some fat little naked child lolling in the dust outside the hut with true tropical laziness the mothers would run up at the sight with delight and joy and throw themselves down in ecstacies of gratitude for the notice she had taken of their favored little ones the gods of heaven they would say with every sign of pleasure have looked graciously upon our unaloa  at first felix and muriel were mainly struck with the politeness and deference which the natives displayed toward them but after a time felix at least began to observe behind it all that a certain amount of affection and even of something like commiseration as well seemed to be mingled with the respect and reverence showered upon them by their hosts the women especially were often evidently touched by muriels innocence and beauty as she walked past their huts with her light girlish tread they would come forth shyly bowing many times as they approached and offer her a long spray of the flowering hibiscus or a pretty garland of crimson tileaves saying at the same time many times over in their own tongue receive it korong receive it queen of the clouds you are good you are kind you are a daughter of the sun we are glad you have come to us  a young girl soon makes herself at home anywhere and muriel protected alike by her native innocence and by the invisible cloak of polynesian taboo quickly learned to understand and to sympathize with these poor dusky mothers one morning some weeks after their arrival she passed down the main street of the village accompanied by felix and their two attendants and reached the maraethe open forum or place of public assemblywhich stood in its midst a circular platform surrounded by breadfruit trees under whose broad cool shade the people were sitting in little groups and talking together they were dressed in the regular oldtime festive costume of polynesia for boupari being a small and remote island too insignificant to be visited by european ships retained still all its aboriginal heathen manners and customs the sight was indeed a curious and picturesque one the girls largelimbed softskinned and with delicately rounded figures sat on the ground laughing and talking with their knees crossed under them their wrists were encinctured with girdles of darkred dracæna leaves their swelling bosoms half concealed half accentuated by hanging necklets of flowers their beautiful brown arms and shoulders were bare throughout their long black hair was gracefully twined and knotted with bright scarlet flowers the men strong and stalwart sat behind on short stools or lounged on the buttressed roots of the breadfruit trees clad like the women in narrow waistbelts of the long red dracæna leaves with necklets of sharks teeth pendent chain of pearly shells a warriors cap on their wellshaped heads and an armlet of native beans arranged below the shoulder around their powerful arms altogether it was a striking and beautiful picture muriel now almost released from her early sense of fear stood still to look at it  the men and girls were laughing and chatting merrily together most of them were engaged in holding up before them fine mats and a row of mulberry cloth spread along on the ground led to a hut near one side of the marae toward this the eyes of the spectators were turned what is it mali muriel whispered her womans instinct leading her at once to expect that something special was going on in the way of local festivities  and mali answered at once with many nods and smiles all right missy queenie him a wedding a marriage  the words had hardly escaped her lips when a very pretty young girl half smothered in flowers and decked out in beads and fancy shells emerged slowly from the hut and took her way with stately tread along the path carpeted with native cloth she was girt round the waist with richcolored mats which formed a long train like a court dress trailing on the ground five or six feet behind her  thats the bride i suppose muriel whispered now really interestedfor what woman on earth wherever she may be can resist the seductive delights of a wedding  yes her a bride mali answered and ladies what follow them her bridesmaids  at the word six other girls similarly dressed though without the train and demure as nuns emerged from the hut in slow order two and two behind her  muriel and felix moved forward with natural curiosity toward the scene the natives now ranged in a row along the path with mats turned inward made way for them gladly all seem pleased that heaven should thus auspiciously honor the occasion and the bride herself as well as the bridegroom who decked in shells and teeth advanced from the opposite side along the path to meet her looked up with grateful smiles at the two europeans muriel in return smiled her most gracious and girlish recognition as the bride drew near she couldnt refrain from bending forward a little to look at the girls really graceful costume as she did so the skirt of her own european dress brushed for a second against the brides train trailed carelessly many yards on the ground behind her  almost before they could know what had happened a wild commotion arose as if by magic in the crowd around them loud cries of taboo taboo mixed with inarticulate screams burst on every side from the assembled natives in the twinkling of an eye they were surrounded by an angry threatening throng who didnt dare to draw near but standing a yard or two off drew stone knives freely and shook their fists scowling in the strangers faces the change was appalling in its electric suddenness muriel drew back horrified in an agony of alarm oh what have i done she cried piteously clinging to felix for support why on earth are they angry with us  i dont know felix answered taken aback himself i cant say exactly in what youve transgressed but you must unconsciously in some way have offended their prejudices i hope its not much at any rate theyre clearly afraid to touch us  missy queenie break taboo mali explained at once with polynesian frankness that make people angry so him want to kill you missy queenie touch bride with end of her dress korong may smile on bridethat very good luck but korong taboo no must touch him  the crowd gathered around them still very threatening in attitude yet clearly afraid to approach within armslength of the strangers muriel was much frightened at their noise and at their frantic gestures come away she cried catching felix by the arm once more oh what are they going to do to us will they kill us for this im so horribly afraid oh why did i ever do it  the poor little bride meanwhile left alone on the carpet and unnoticed by everybody sank suddenly down on the mats where she stood buried her face in her hands and began to sob as if her heart would break evidently something very untoward of some sort had happened to the dusky lady on her wedding morning  the final touch was too much for poor muriels overwrought nerves she too gave way in a tempest of sobs and subsiding on one of the native stools hard by burst into tears herself with halfhysterical violence  instantly as she did so the whole assembly seemed to change its mind again as if by contagious magic a loud shout of she cries the queen of the clouds cries went up from all the assembled mob to heaven it is a good omen toko the shadow whispered in polynesian to felix seeing his puzzled look we shall have plenty of rain now the clouds will break our crops will flourish almost before she understood it muriel was surrounded by an eager and friendly crowd still afraid to draw near but evidently anxious to see and to comfort and console her many of the women eagerly held forward their native mats which mali took from them and pressing them for a second against muriels eyes handed them back with just a suspicion of wet tears left glistening in the corner the happy recipients leaped and shouted with joy no more drought they cried merrily with loud shouts and gesticulations the queen of the clouds is good she will weep well from heaven upon my yam and taro plots  muriel looked up all dazed and saw to her intense surprise the crowd was now nothing but affection and sympathy slowly they gathered in closer and closer till they almost touched the hem of her robe then the men stood by respectfully laying their fingers on whatever she had wetted with her tears while the women and girls took her hand in theirs and pressed it sympathetically mali explained their meaning with ready interpretation no cry too much them say she observed nodding her head sagely not good for missy queenie to cry too much them say kind lady be comforted  there was genuine goodnature in the way they consoled her and felix was touched by the tenderness of those savage hearts but the additional explanation given him in polynesian by his own shadow tended somewhat to detract from the disinterestedness of their sympathy they say it is good for the queen of the clouds to weep toko said with frank bluntness but not too muchfor fear the rain should wash away all our yam and taro plants  by this time the little bride had roused herself from her stupor and smiling away as if nothing had happened said a few words in a very low voice to felixs shadow the shadow turned most respectfully to his master and touching his sleevelink which was of bright gold said in a very doubtful voice she asks you oh king will you allow her just for today to wear this ornament  felix unbuttoned the shining bauble at once and was about to hand it to the bride with polite gallantry she may wear it forever for the matter of that if she likes he said goodhumoredly i make her a present of it  but the bride drew back as before in speechless terror as he held out his hand and seemed just on the point of bursting out into tears again at this untoward incident the shadow intervened with fortunate perception of the cause of the misunderstanding korong must not touch or give anything to a bride he said quietly not with his own hand he must not lay his finger on her that would be unlucky but he may hand it by his shadow then he turned to his fellowtribesmen these gods he said in an explanatory voice like one bespeaking forgiveness though they are divine and korong and very powerfulsee they have come from the sun and they are but strangers in bouparithey do not yet know the ways of our island they have not eaten of human flesh they do not understand taboo but they will soon be wiser they mean very well but they do not know behold he gives her this divine shining ornament from the sun as a present and taking it in his hand he held it up for a moment to public admiration then he passed on the trinket ostentatiously to the bride who smiling and delighted hung it low on her breast among her other decorations  the whole party seemed so surprised and gratified at this proof of condescension on the part of the divine stranger that they crowded round felix once more praising and thanking him volubly muriel anxious to remove the bad impression she had created by touching the brides dress hastily withdrew her own little brooch and offered it in turn to the shadow as an additional present but toko shaking his head vigorously pointed with his forefinger many times to mali toko say him no can take it mali explained hastily in her broken english him no your shadow me your shadow me do everything for you me give it to the lady and taking the brooch in her hand she passed it over in turn amid loud cries of delight and shouts of approval  thereupon the ceremony began all over again they seemed by their intervention to have interrupted some set formula at its close the women crowded around muriel and took her hand in theirs kissing it many times over with tears in their eyes and betraying an immense amount of genuine feeling one phrase in polynesian they repeated again and again a phrase that made felixs cheek turn white as he leaned over the poor english girl with a profound emotion  what does it mean that they say muriel asked at last perceiving it was all one phrase many times repeated  felix was about to give some evasive explanation when mali interposed with her simple unthinking translation them say missy queenie very good and kind make them sad to think make them cry to see her make them cry to see missy queenie korong too good too pretty  why so muriel exclaimed drawing back with some faint presentiment of unspeakable horror  felix tried to stop her but the girl would not be stopped because when korong time up she answered blurting it out korong must  felix clapped his hand to her mouth in wild haste and silenced her he knew the worst now he had divined the truth but muriel at least must be spared that knowledge     chapter ix  sowing the wind  vaguely and indefinitely one terrible truth had been forced by slow degrees upon felixs mind whatever else korong meant it implied at least some fearful doom in store sooner or later for the persons who bore it how awful that doom might be he could hardly imagine but he must devote himself henceforth to the task of discovering what its nature was and if possible of averting it  yet how to reconcile this impending terror with the other obvious facts of the situation the fact that they were considered divine beings and treated like gods and the fact that the whole population seemed really to regard them with a devotion and kindliness closely bordering on religious reverence if korongs were gods why should the people want to kill them if they meant to kill them why pay them meanwhile such respect and affection  one point at least was now however quite clear to felix while the natives especially the women displayed toward both of them in their personal aspect a sort of regretful sympathy he could not help noticing at the same time that the men at any rate regarded them also largely in an impersonal light as a sort of generalized abstraction of the powers of naturean embodied form of the rain and the weather the islanders were anxious to keep their white guests well supplied well fed and in perfect health not so much for the strangers sakes as for their own advantage they evidently considered that if anything went wrong with either of their two new gods corresponding misfortunes might happen to their crops and the produce of their breadfruit groves some mysterious sympathy was held to subsist between the persons of the castaways and the state of the weather the natives effusively thanked them after welcome rain and looked askance at them scowling after long dry spells it was for this no doubt that they took such pains to provide them with attentive shadows and to gird round their movements with taboos of excessive stringency nothing that the newcomers said or did was indifferent it seemed to the welfare of the community plenty and prosperity depended upon the passing state of muriels health and famine or drought might be brought about at any moment by the slightest imprudence in felixs diet  how stringent these taboos really were felix learned by slow degrees alone to realize from the very beginning he had observed to be sure that they might only eat and drink the food provided for them that they were supplied with a clean and freshbuilt hut as well as with brandnew cocoanut cups spoons and platters that no litter of any sort was allowed to accumulate near their enclosure and that their shadows never left them or went out of their sight by day or by night for a single moment now however he began to perceive also that the shadows were there for that very purpose to watch over them as it were like guards on behalf of the community to see that they ate or drank no tabooed object to keep them from heedlessly transgressing any unwritten law of the creed of boupari and to be answerable for their good behavior generally they were partly servants it was true and partly sureties but they were partly also keepers and keepers who kept a close and constant watch upon the persons of their prisoners once or twice felix growing tired for the moment of this continual surveillance had tried to give toko the slip and to stroll away from his hut unattended for a walk through the island in the early morning before his shadow had waked but on each such occasion he found to his surprise that as he opened the hut door the shadow rose at once and confronted him angrily with an inquiring eye and in time he perceived that a thin string was fastened to the bottom of the door the other end of which was tied to the shadows ankle and this string could not be cut without letting fall a sort of latch or bar which closed the door outside only to be raised again by some external person  clearly it was intended that the korong should have no chance of escape without the knowledge of the shadow who as felix afterward learned would have paid with his own body by a cruel death for the korongs disappearance  he might as well have tried to escape his own shadow as to escape the one the islanders had tacked on to him  all felixs energies were now devoted to the arduous task of discovering what korong really meant and what possibility he might have of saving muriel from the mysterious fate that seemed to be held in store for them  one evening about six weeks after their arrival in the island the young englishman was strolling by himself after the sun sank low in heaven along a pretty tangled hillside path overhung with lianas and ropelike tropical creepers while his faithful shadow lingered a step or two behind keeping a sharp lookout meanwhile on all his movements  near the top of a little crag of volcanic rock in the center of the hills he came suddenly upon a hut with a cleared space around it somewhat neater in appearance than any of the native cottages he had yet seen and surrounded by a broad white belt of coral sand exactly like that which ringed round and protected their own enclosure but what specially attracted felixs attention was the fact that the space outside this circle had been cleared into a regular flowergarden quite european in the definiteness and orderliness of its quaint arrangement  why who lives here felix asked in polynesian turning round in surprise to his respectful shadow  the shadow waved his hand vaguely in an expansive way toward the sky as he answered with a certain air of awe often observable in his speech when taboos were in question the king of birds a very great god he speaks the bird language  who is he felix inquired taken aback wondering vaguely to himself whether here perchance he might have lighted upon some stray and shipwrecked compatriot  he comes from the sun like yourselves the shadow answered all deference but with obvious reserve he is a very great god i may not speak much of him but he is not korong he is greater than that and less he is tula the same as tukilakila  is he as powerful as tukilakila felix asked with intense interest  oh no hes not nearly so powerful as that the shadow answered half terrified at the bare suggestion no god in heaven or earth is like tukilakila this one is only king of the birds which is a little province while tukilakila is king of heaven and earth of plants and animals of gods and men of all things created at his nod the sky shakes and the rocks tremble but still this god is tula like tukilakila he is not for a year he goes on forever till some other supplants him  you say he comes from the sun felix put in devoured with curiosity and he speaks the bird language what do you mean by that does he speak like the queen of the clouds and myself when we talk together  oh dear no the shadow answered in a very confident tone he doesnt speak the least bit in the world like that he speaks shriller and higher and still more birdlike it is chatter chatter chatter like the parrots in a tree tirra tirra tirra tarra tarra tarra la la la lo lo lo lu lu lu li la and he sings to himself all the time he sings this way  and then the shadow with that wonderful power of accurate mimicry which is so strong in all natural human beings began to trill out at once with a very good parisian accent a few lines from a wellknown song in la fille de madame angot  quand on conspire    quand sans frayeur  on pent se dire    conspirateur  pour tout le monde    il faut avoir  perruque blonde    et collet noir  perruque blonde    et collet noir  thats how the king of the birds sings the shadow said as he finished throwing back his head and laughing with all his might at his own imitation so funny isnt it its exactly like the song of the pinkcrested parrot  why toko its french felix exclaimed using the fijian word for a frenchman which the shadow of course on his remote island had never before heard how on earth did he come here  i cant tell you toko answered waving his arms seaward he came from the sun like yourselves but not in a sunboat it had no fire he came in a canoe all by himself and mali sayshere the shadow lowered his voice to a most mysterious whisperhes a manaouioui  felix quivered with excitement manaouioui is the universal name over semicivilized polynesia for a frenchman felix seized upon it with avidity a manaouioui he cried delighted how strange how wonderful i must go in at once to his hut and see him  he had lifted his foot and was just going to cross the white line of coralsand when his shadow catching him suddenly and stoutly round the waist pulled him back from the enclosure with every sign of horror alarm and astonishment no you cant go he cried grappling with him with all his force yet using him very tenderly for all that as becomes a god taboo taboo there  but i am a god myself felix cried insisting upon his privileges if you have to submit to the disadvantages of taboo you may as well claim its advantages as well the king of fire and the king of water crossed my taboo line why shouldnt i cross equally the king of the birds then  so you mightas a rule the shadow answered with promptitude you are both gods your taboos do not cross you may visit each other you may transgress one anothers lines without danger of falling dead on the ground as common men would do if they broke taboolines but this is the month of birds the king is in retreat no man may see him except his own shadow the little cockatoo who brings him his food and drink do you see that hawks head stuck upon the post by the door at the side that is his special taboo he keeps it for this month even gods must respect that sign for a reason which it would be very bad medicine to mention while the month of birds lasts no man may look upon the king or hear him if they did they would die and the carrion birds would eat them come away this is dangerous  scarcely were the words well out of his mouth when from the recesses of the hut a rollicking french voice was heard trilling out merrily  quand on conspire    quand sans frayeur  without waiting for more the shadow seized felixs arm in an agony of terror come away he cried hurriedly come away what will become of us this is horrible horrible we have broken taboo we have heard the gods voice the sky will fall on us if his shadow were to find it out and tell my people my people would tear us limb from limb quick quick hide away let us run fast through the forest before any man discover it  the shadows voice rang deep with alarm felix felt he dare not trifle with this superstition profound as was his curiosity about the mysterious frenchman he was compelled to bottle up his eagerness and anxiety for the moment and patiently wait till the month of birds had run its course and taken its inconvenient taboo along with it these limitations were terrible yet he counted much upon the information the frenchman could give him the man had been some time on the island it was clear and doubtless he understood its ways thoroughly he might cast some light at last upon the korong mystery  so he went back through the woods with a heart somewhat lighter  not far from their own huts he met muriel and mali  as they walked home together felix told his companion in a very few words the strange discovery about the frenchman and the impenetrable taboo by which he was at present surrounded muriel drew a deep sigh oh felix she saidfor they were naturally by this time very much at home with one another did you ever know anything so dreadful as the mystery of these taboos it seems as if we should never get really to the bottom of them malis always springing some new one upon me i dont believe we shall ever be able to leave the islandwere so hedged round with taboos even if we were to see a ship today i dont believe theyd allow us to signal it  there was a red sunset a lurid tropical redandgreen sunset it boded mischief  they were passing by some huts at the moment and over the stockade of one of them a tree was hanging with small yellow fruits which felix knew well in fiji as wholesome and agreeable he broke off a small branch as he passed and offered a couple thoughtlessly to muriel she took them in her fingers and tasted them gingerly theyre not so bad she said taking another from the bough theyre very much like gooseberries  at the same moment felix popped one into his own mouth and swallowed it without thinking  almost before they knew what had happened with the same extraordinary rapidity as in the case of the wedding the people in the cottages ran out with every sign of fear and apprehension and seizing the branch from felixs hands began upbraiding the two shadows for their want of attention  we couldnt help it toko exclaimed with every appearance of guilt and horror on his face they were much too sharp for us their hearts are black how could we two interfere these gods are so quick they had picked and eaten them before we ever saw them  one of the men raised his hand with a threatening airbut against the shadow not against the sacred person of felix he will be ill he said angrily pointing toward the white man and she will too their hearts are indeed black they have sown the seed of the wind they have both of them eaten of it they will both be ill you deserve to die and what will come now to our trees and plantations  the crowd gathered round them cursing low and horribly the two terrified europeans slunk off to their huts unaware of their exact crime and closely followed by a scowling but despondent mob of natives as they crossed their sacred boundary muriel cried with a sudden outburst of tears oh felix what on earth shall we ever do to get rid of this terrible unendurable godship  the natives without set up a great shout of horror see see she cries they exclaimed in indescribable panic she has eaten the stormfruit and already she cries oh clouds restrain yourselves oh great queen mercy whatever will become of us and our poor huts and gardens  and for hours they crouched around beating their breasts and shrieking  that evening muriel sat up late in felixs hut with mali by her side too frightened to go back into her own alone before those angry people and all the time just beyond the barrier line they could hear above the whistle of the wind around the hut the droning voices of dozens of natives cowering low on the ground they seemed to be going through some litany or chant as if to deprecate the result of this imprudent action  what are they doing outside felix asked of his shadow at last after a peculiarly long wail of misery  and the shadow made answer in very solemn tones they are trying to propitiate your mightiness and to avert the omen lest the rain should fall and the wind should blow and the stormcloud should burst over the island to destroy them  then felix remembered suddenly of himself that the season when this stormfruit or stormapple as they called it was ripe in fiji was also the season when the great pacific cyclones most often swept over the land in full furystorms unexampled on any other sea like that famous one which wrecked so many european menofwar a few years since in the harbor of samoa  and without the wail came louder and clearer still if you sow the breadfruit seed you will reap the breadfruit if you sow the wind you will reap the whirlwind they have eaten the stormfruit oh great king save us     chapter x  reaping the whirlwind   toward midnight muriel began to doze lightly from pure fatigue  put a pillow under her head and let her sleep felix said in a whisper poor child it would be cruel to send her alone tonight into her own quarters  and mali slipped a pillow of mulberry paper under her mistresss head and laid it on her own lap and bent down to watch her  but outside beyond the line the natives murmured loud their discontent the queen of the clouds stays in the king of the rains hut tonight they muttered angrily she will not listen to us before morning be sure the tempest will be born of their meeting to destroy us  about two oclock there came a lull in the wind which had been rising steadily ever since that lurid sunset felix looked out of the hut door the moon was full it was almost as clear as day with the bright tropical moonlight silvery in the open pale green in the shadow the people were still squatting in great rings round the hut just outside the taboo line and beating gongs and sticks and human bones to keep time to the lilt of their lugubrious litany  the air felt unusually heavy and oppressive felix raised his eyes to the sky and saw whisps of light cloud drifting in rapid flight over the scudding moon below an ominous fog bank gathered steadily westward then one clap of thunder rent the sky after it came a deadly silence the moon was veiled all was dark as pitch the natives themselves fell on their faces and prayed with mute lips three minutes later the cyclone had burst upon them in all its frenzy  such a hurricane felix had never before experienced its energy was awful round the palmtrees the wind played a frantic and capricious devils dance it pirouetted about the atoll in the mad glee of unconsciousness here and there it cleared lanes hundreds of yards in length among the foresttrees and the cocoanut plantations the noise of snapping and falling trunks rang thick on the air at times the cyclone would swoop down from above upon the swaying stem of some tall and stately palm that bent like grass before the wind break it off short with a roar at the bottom and lay it low at once upon the ground with a crash like thunder in other places little playful whirlwinds seemed to descend from the sky in the very midst of the dense brushwood where they cleared circular patches strewn thick under foot with trunks and branches in their titanic sport and yet left unhurt all about the surrounding forest then again a special cyclone of gigantic proportions would advance as it were in a single column against one stem of a clump whirl round it spirally like a lightning flash and deserting it for another leave it still standing but turned and twisted like a screw by the irresistible force of its invisible fingers the stormgod said toko was dancing with the palmtrees the sight was awful such destructive energy felix had never even imagined before no wonder the savages all round beheld in it the personal wrath of some mighty spirit  for in spite of the black clouds they could see it allboth the europeans and the islanders the intense darkness of the night was lighted up for them every minute by an almost incessant blaze of sheet and forked lightning the roar of the thunder mingled with the roar of the tempest each in turn overtopping and drowning the other the hut where felix and muriel sheltered themselves shook before the storm the very ground of the island trembled and quiveredlike the timbers of a great ship before a mighty seaat each onset of the breakers upon the surrounding fringereef and side by side with it all to crown their misery wild torrents of rain descending in waterspouts as it seemed or dashed in great sheets against the roof of their frail tenement poured fitfully on with fierce tropical energy  in the midst of the hut muriel crouched and prayed with bloodless lips to heaven this was too too terrible it seemed incredible to her that on top of all they had been called upon to suffer of fear and suspense at the hands of the savages the very dumb forces of nature themselves should thus be stirred up to open war against them her faith in providence was sorely tried dumb forces indeed why they roared with more terrible voices than any wild beast on earth could possibly compass the thunder and the wind were howling each other down in emulous din and the very hiss of the lightning could be distinctly heard like some huge snake at times above the creaking and snapping of the trees before the gale in the surrounding forest  muriel crouched there long in the mute misery of utter despair at her feet mali crouched too as frightened as herself but muttering aloud from time to time in a reproachful voice i tell missy queenie what going to happen i warn her not i tell her she must not eat that very bad stormapple but missy queenie no listen her take her own way then storm come down upon us  and felixs shadow in his own tongue exclaimed more than once in the selfsame tone half terror half expostulation see now what comes from breaking taboo you eat the stormfruit the stormfruit suits ill with the king of the rain and the queen of the clouds the heavens have broken loose the sea has boiled see what wind and what flood you are bringing upon us  by and by above even the fierce roar of the mingled thunder and cyclone a wild orgy of noise burst upon them all from without the hut it was a sound as of numberless drums and tomtoms all beaten in unison with the mad energy of fear a hideous sound suggestive of some hateful heathen devilworship muriel clapped her hands to her ears in horror oh whats that she cried to felix at this new addition to their endless alarms are the savages out there rising in a body have they come to murder us  perhaps felix said smoothing her hair with his hand as a mother might soothe her terrified child perhaps theyre angry with us for having caused this storm as they think by our foolish action i believe they all set it down to our having unluckily eaten that unfortunate fruit ill go out to the door myself and speak to them  muriel clung to his arm with a passionate clinging  oh felix she cried no dont leave me here alone my darling i love you youre all the world there is left to me now felix dont go out to those wretches and leave me here alone theyll murder you theyll murder you dont go out i implore you if they mean to kill us let them kill us both together in one anothers arms oh felix i am yours and you are mine my darling  it was the first time either of them had acknowledged the fact but there before the face of that awful convulsion of nature all the little deceptions and veils of life seemed rent asunder forever as by a flash of lightning they stood face to face with each others souls and forgot all else in the agony of the moment felix clasped the trembling girl in his arms like a lover the two shadows looked on and shook with silent terror if the king of the rain thus embraced the queen of the clouds before their very eyes amid so awful a storm what unspeakable effects might not follow at once from it but they had too much respect for those supernatural creatures to attempt to interfere with their action at such a moment they accepted their masters almost as passively as they accepted the wind and the thunder which they believed to arise from them  felix laid his poor muriel tenderly down on the mud floor again i must go out my child he said for the very love of you i must play the man and find out what these savages mean by their drumming  he crept to the door of the hut for no man could walk upright before that awful storm and peered out into the darkness once more awaiting one of the frequent flashes of lightning he had not long to wait in a moment the sky was all ablaze again from end to end and continued so for many seconds consecutively by the light of the continuous zigzags of fire felix could see for himself that hundreds and hundreds of nativesmen women and children naked or nearly so with their hair loose and wet about their cheekslay flat on their faces many courses deep just outside the taboo line the wind swept over them with extraordinary force and the tropical rain descended in great floods upon their bare backs and shoulders but the savages as if entranced seemed to take no heed of all these earthly things they lay grovelling in the mud before some unseen power and beating their tomtoms in unison with barbaric concord they cried aloud once more as felix appeared in a weird litany that overtopped the tumultuous noise of the tempest oh stormgod hear us oh great spirit deliver us king of the rain and queen of the clouds befriend us be angry no more hide your wrath from your people take away your hurricane and we will bring you many gifts eat no longer of the stormapplethe seed of the windand we will feed you with yam and turtle and much choice breadfruit great king we are yours you shall choose which you will of our children for your meat and drink you shall sup on our blood but take your storm away do not utterly drown and submerge our island  as they spoke they crawled nearer and nearer with gliding serpentine motion till their heads almost touched the white line of coral but not a man of them all went one inch beyond it they stopped there and gazed at him felix signed to them with his hand and pointed vaguely to the sky as much as to say he was not responsible at the gesture the whole assembly burst into one loud shout of gratitude he has heard us he has heard us they exclaimed with a perfect wail of joy he will not utterly destroy us he will take away his storm he will bring the sun and the moon back to us  felix returned into the hut somewhat reassured so far as the attitude of the savages went dont be afraid of them muriel he cried taking her passionately once more in a tender embrace they darent cross the taboo they wont come near theyre too frightened themselves to dream of hurting us     chapter xi  after the storm   next morning the day broke bright and calm as if the tempest had been but an evil dream of the night now past forever the birds sang loud the lizards came forth from their holes in the wall and basked green and gold in the warm dry sunshine but though the sky overhead was blue and the air clear as usually happen after these alarming tropical cyclones and rainstorms the memorials of the great wind that had raged all night long among the forests of the island were neither few nor far between everywhere the ground was strewn with leaves and branches and huge stems of cocoapalms all nature was draggled many of the trees were stripped clean of their foliage as completely as oaks in an english winter on others big strands of twisted fibres marked the scars and joints where mighty boughs had been torn away by main force while elsewhere bare stumps alone remained to mark the former presence of some noble dracæna or some gigantic banyan breadfruits and cocoanuts lay tossed in the wildest confusion on the ground the banana and plantainpatches were beaten level with the soil or buried deep in the mud many of the huts had given way entirely abundant wreckage strewed every corner of the island it was an awful sight muriel shuddered to herself to see how much the two that night had passed through  what the outer fringing reef had suffered from the storm they hardly knew as yet but from the door of the hut felix could see for himself how even the calm waters of the inner lagoon had been lashed into wild fury by the fierce swoop of the tempest round the entire atoll the solid conglomerate coral floor was scooped under broken up chewed fine by the waves or thrown in vast fragments on the beach of the island by the eastern shore in particular just opposite their hut felix observed a regular wall of many feet in height piled up by the waves like the familiar chesil beach near his old home in dorsetshire it was the shelter of that temporary barrier alone no doubt that had preserved their huts last night from the full fury of the gale and that had allowed the natives to congregate in such numbers prone on their faces in the mud and rain upon the unconsecrated ground outside their tabooline  but now not an islander was to be seen within earshot all had gone away to look after their ruined huts or their beatendown plantainpatches leaving the cruel gods who as they thought had wrought all the mischief out of pure wantonness to repent at leisure the harm done during the night to their obedient votaries  felix was just about to cross the tabooline and walk down to the shore to examine the barrier when toko his shadow laying his hand on his shoulder with more genuine interest and affection than he had ever yet shown exclaimed with some horror oh no not that dont dare to go outside it would be very dangerous for you if my people were to catch you on profane soil just now theres no saying what harm they might do to you  why so felix exclaimed in surprise last night surely they were all prayers and promises and vows and entreaties  the young man nodded his head in acquiescence ah yes last night he answered that was very well then vows were sore needed the storm was raging and you were within your taboo how could they dare to touch you a mighty god of the tempest at the very moment when you were rending their banyantrees and snapping their cocoanut stems with your mighty arms like so many little chickenbones even tukilakila himself i expect the very high god lay frightened in his temple cowering by his tree annoyed at your wrath he sent fire and water among the worshippers no doubt to offer up vows and to appease your anger  then felix remembered as his shadow spoke that as a matter of fact he had observed the men who usually wore the red and white feather cloaks among the motley crowd of grovelling natives who lay flat on their faces in the mud of the cleared space the night before and prayed hard for mercy only they were not wearing their robes of office at the moment in accordance with a wellknown savage custom they had come naked and in disgrace as befits all suppliants they had left behind them the insignia of their rank in their own shaken huts and bowed down their bare backs to the rain and the lightning  yes i saw them among the other islanders felix answered halfsmiling but prudently remaining within the tabooline as his shadow advised him  toko kept his hand still on his masters shoulder oh king he said beseechingly and with great solemnity i am doing wrong to warn you i am breaking a very great taboo i dont know what harm may come to me for telling you perhaps tukilakila will burn me to ashes with one glance of his eyes he may know this minute what im saying here alone to you  it is hard for a white man to meet scruples like this but felix was bold enough to answer outright tukilakila knows nothing of the sort and can never find out take my word for it toko nothing that you say to me will ever reach tukilakila  the shadow looked at him doubtfully and trembled as he spoke i like you korong he said with a genuinely truthful ring in his voice you seem to me so kind and goodso different from other gods who are very cruel you never beat me nobody i ever served treated me as well or as kindly as you have done and for your sake i will even dare to break tabooif youre quite quite sure tukilakila will never discover it  im quite sure felix answered with perfect confidence i know it for certain i swear a great oath to it  you swear by tukilakila himself the young savage asked anxiously  i swear by tukilakila himself felix replied at once i swear without doubt he can never know it  that is a great taboo the shadow went on meditatively stroking felixs arm a very great taboo indeed a terrible medicine and you are a god i can trust you well then you see the secret is this you are korong but you are a stranger and you dont understand the ways of boupari if for three days after the end of this storm which tukilakila has sent fire and water to pray and vow against you or the queen of the clouds show yourselves outside your own taboolinewhy then the people are clear of sin whoever takes you may rend you alive they will tear you limb from limb and cut you into pieces  why so felix asked aghast at this discovery they seemed to live on a perpetual volcano in this wonderful island and a volcano ever breaking out in fresh places they could never get to the bottom of its horrible superstitions  because you ate the stormapple the shadow answered confidently that was very wrong you brought the tempest upon us yourselves by your own trespass therefore by the custom of boupari which we learn in the mysteries you become full korong for the sacrifice at once that makes the term for you the people will give you all your dues then they will say we are free we have bought you with a price we have brought your cocoanuts no sin attaches to us we are righteous we are righteous and then they will kill you and fire and water will roast you and boil you  but only if we go outside the tabooline felix asked anxiously  only if you go outside the tabooline the shadow replied nodding a hasty assent inside it till your term comes even tukilakila himself the very high god whose meat we all are dare never hurt you  till our term comes felix inquired once more astonished and perplexed what do you mean by that my shadow  but the shadow was either bound by some superstitious fear or else incapable of putting himself into felixs point of view why till you are full korong he answered like one who speaks of some familiar fact as who should say till you are forty years old or till your beard grows white of course by and by you will be full korong i cannot help you then but till that time comes i would like to do my best by you you have been very kind to me i tell you much more than this it would not be lawful for me to mention  and that was the most that by dexterous questioning felix could ever manage to get out of his mysterious shadow  at the end of three days we will be safe though he inquired at last after all other questions failed to produce an answer  oh yes at the end of three days the storm will have blown over the young man answered easily all will then be well you may venture out once more the rain will have dried over all the island fire and water will have no more power over you  felix went back to the hut to inform muriel of this new peril thus suddenly sprung upon them poor muriel now almost worn out with endless terrors received it calmly im growing accustomed to it all felix she answered resignedly if only i know that you will keep your promise and never let me fall alive into these wretches hands i shall feel quite safe oh felix do you know when you took me in your arms like that last night in spite of everything i felt positively happy  about ten oclock they were suddenly roused by a sound of many natives coming in quick succession single file to the huts and shouting aloud oh king of the rain oh queen of the clouds come forth for our vows receive your presents  felix went forth to the door to look with a warning look in his eyes his shadow followed him the natives were now coming up by dozens at a time bringing with them in great armloads fallen cocoanuts and breadfruits and branches of bananas and large draggled clusters of halfripe plantains  why what are all these felix exclaimed in surprise  his shadow looked up at him as if amused at the absurd simplicity of the question these are yours of course he said yours and the queens they are the windfalls you made did you not knock them all off the trees for yourselves when you were coming down in such sheets from the sky last evening  felix wrung his hands in positive despair it was clear indeed that to the minds of the natives there was no distinguishing personally between himself and muriel and the rain or the cyclone  will they bring them all in he asked gazing in alarm at the huge pile of fruits the natives were making outside the huts  yes all the shadow answered they are vows they are godsends but if you like you can give some of them back if you give much back of course it will make my people less angry with you  felix advanced near the line holding his hand up before him to command silence as he did so he was absolutely appalled himself at the perfect storm of execration and abuse which his appearance excited the foremost natives brandishing their clubs and stonetipped spears or shaking their fists by the line poured forth upon his devoted head at once all the most frightful curses of the polynesian vocabulary oh evil god they cried aloud with angry faces oh wicked spirit you have a bad heart see what a wrong you have purposely done us if your heart were not bad would you treat us like this if you are indeed a god come out across the line and let us try issues together dont skulk like a coward in your hut and within your taboo but come out and fight us we are not afraid who are only men why are you afraid of us  felix tried to speak once more but the din drowned his voice as he paused the people set up their loud shouts again oh you wicked god you eat the stormapple you have wrought us much harm you have spoiled our harvest how you came down in great sheets last night it was pitiful pitiful we would like to kill you you might have taken our breadfruits and our bananas if you would we give you them freely they are yours here take them we feed you well we make you many offerings but why did you wish to have our huts also why did you beat down our young plantations and break our canoes against the beach of the island that shows a bad heart you are an evil god you dare not defend yourself come out and meet us     chapter xii  a point of theology   at last with great difficulty felix managed to secure a certain momentary lull of silence the natives clustering round the line till they almost touched it listened with scowling brows and brandished threatening spears tipped with points of stone or sharks teeth or turtlebone while he made his speech to them from time to time one or another interrupted him coaxing and wheedling him as it were to cross the line but felix never heeded them he was beginning to understand now how to treat this strange people he took no notice of their threats or their entreaties either  by and by partly by words and partly by gestures he made them understand that they might take back and keep for themselves all the cocoanuts and breadfruits they had brought as windfalls at this the people seemed a little appeased his heart is not quite so bad as we thought they murmured among themselves but if he didnt want them what did he mean why did he beat down our huts and our plantations  then felix tried to explain to thema somewhat dangerous taskthat neither he nor muriel were really responsible for last nights storm but at that the people with one accord raised a great loud shout of unmixed derision he is a god they cried and yet he is ashamed of his own acts and deeds afraid of what we mere men will do to him ha ha take care these are lies that he tells listen to him hear him  meanwhile more and more natives kept coming up with windfalls of fruit or with objects they had vowed in their terror to dedicate during the night and felix all the time kept explaining at the top of his voice to all as they came that he wanted nothing and that they could take all back again this curiously inconsistent action seemed to puzzle the wondering natives strangely had he made the storm then they asked and eaten the stormapple for no use to himself but out of pure perverseness if he didnt even want the windfalls and the objects vowed to him why had he beaten down their crops and broken their houses they looked at him meaningly but they dared not cross that great line of taboo it was their own superstition alone in that moment of danger that kept their hands off those defenceless white people  at last a happy idea seemed to strike the crowd what he wants is a child they cried effusively he thirsts for blood let us kill and roast him a proper victim  felixs horror at this appalling proposition knew no bounds if you do he cried turning their own superstition against them in this last hour of need i will raise up a storm worse even than last nights you do it at your peril i want no victim the people of my country eat not of human flesh it is a thing detestable horrible hateful to god and man with us all human life alike is sacred we spill no blood if you dare to do as you say i will raise such a storm over your heads tonight as will submerge and drown the whole of your island  the natives listened to him with profound interest we must spill no blood they repeated looking aghast at one another hear what the king says we must not cut the victims throat we must bind a child with cords and roast it alive for him  felix hardly knew what to do or say at this atrocious proposal if you roast it alive he cried you deserve to be all scorched up with lightning take care what you do spare the childs life i will have no victim beware how you anger me  but the savage no sooner says than he does with him deliberation is unknown and impulse everything in a moment the natives had gathered in a circle a little way off and began drawing lots several children seized hurriedly up among the crowd were huddled like so many sheep in the centre felix looked on from his enclosure half petrified with horror the lot fell upon a pretty little girl of five years old without one word of warning without one sign of remorse before felixs very eyes they began to bind the struggling and terrified child just outside the circle  the white man could stand this horrid barbarity no longer at the risk of his lifeat the risk of murielshe must rush out to prevent them they should never dare to kill that helpless child before his very eyes come what mightthough even muriel should suffer for ithe felt he must rescue that trembling little creature drawing his trusty knife and opening the big blade ostentatiously before their eyes he made a sudden dart like a wild beast across the line and pounced down upon the party that guarded the victim  was it a ruse to make him cross the line alone or did they really mean it he hardly knew but he had no time to debate the abstract question bursting into their midst he seized the child with a rush in his circling arms and tried to hurry back with it within the protecting tabooline  quick as lightning he was surrounded and almost cut down by a furious and frantic mob of halfnaked savages kill him tear him to pieces they cried in their rage he has a bad heart he destroyed our huts he broke down our plantations kill him kill him kill him  as they closed in upon him with spears and tomahawks and clubs felix saw he had nothing left for it now but a hard fight for life to return to the tabooline holding the child in one arm and striking wildly out with his knife with the other he tried to hack his way back by main force to the shelter of the tabooline in frantic lunges the distance was but a few feet but the savages pressed round him half frightened still yet gnashing their teeth and distorting their faces with anger he has broken the taboo they cried in vehement tones he has crossed the line willingly kill him kill him we are free from sin we have bought him with a pricewith many cocoanuts  at the sound of the struggle going on so close outside muriel rushed in frantic haste and terror from the hut her face was pale but her demeanor was resolute before mali could stop her she too had crossed the sacred line of the coral mark and had flung herself madly upon felixs assailants to cover his retreat with her own frail body  hold off she cried in her horror in english but in accents even those savages could read you shall not touch him  with a fierce effort felix tore his way back through the spears and clubs toward the place of safety the savages wounded him on the way more than once with their jagged stone speartips and blood flowed from his breast and arms in profusion but they didnt dare even so to touch muriel the sight of that pure white woman rushing out in her weakness to protect her lovers life from attack seemed to strike them with some fresh access of superstitious awe one or two of themselves were wounded by felixs knife for they were unaccustomed to steel though they had a few blades made out of old european barrelhoops for a minute or two the conflict was sharp and hotly contested then at last felix managed to fling the child across the line to push muriel with one hand at armslength before him and to rush himself within the sacred circle  no sooner had he crossed it than the savages drew up around undecided as yet but in a threatening body rank behind rank their loose hair in their eyes they stood like wild beasts balked of their prey and yelled at him some of them brandished their spears and their stone hatchets angrily in their victims faces others contented themselves with howling aloud as before and piling curses afresh on the heads of the unpopular stormgods look at her they cried in their wrath pointing their skinny brown fingers angrily at muriel see she weeps even now she would flood us with her rain she isnt satisfied with all the harm she has poured down upon boupari already she wants to drown us  and then a little knot drew up close to the line of taboo itself and began to discuss in loud and serious tones a pressing question of savage theology and religious practice  they have crossed the line within the three days some of the foremost warriors exclaimed in excited voices they are no longer taboo we can do as we please with them we may cross the line now ourselves if we will and tear them to pieces come on who follows korong korong let us rend them let us eat them  but though they spoke so bravely they hung back themselves fearful of passing that mysterious barrier others of the crowd answered them back warmly no no not so be careful what you do anger not the gods dont ruin boupari if the taboo is not indeed broken then how dare we break it they are gods fear their vengeance they are indeed terrible see what happened to us when they merely ate of the stormapple what might not happen if we were to break taboo without due cause and kill them  one old graybearded warrior in particular held his countrymen back mind how you trifle with gods the old chief said in a tone of solemn warning mind how you provoke them they are very mighty when i was young our people killed three sailing gods who came ashore in a small canoe built of thin split logs and within a month an awful earthquake devastated boupari and fire burst forth from a mouth in the ground and the people knew that the spirits of the sailing gods were very angry wait therefore till tukilakila himself comes and then ask of him and of fire and water as tukilakila bids you that do you do is he not our great god the king of us all and the guardian of the customs of the island of boupari  is tukilakila coming some of the warriors asked with bated breath  how should he not come the old chief asked drawing himself up very erect know you not the mysteries the rain has put out all the fires in boupari the king of fire himself even his hearth is cold he tried his best in the storm to keep his sacred embers still smouldering but the king of the rain was stronger than he was and put it out at last in spite of his endeavors be careful therefore how you deal with the king of the rain who comes down among lightnings and is so very powerful  and tukilakila comes to fetch fresh fire one of the nearest savages asked with profound awe  he comes to fetch fresh fire new fire from the sun the old man answered with awe in his voice these foreign gods are they not strangers from the sun they have brought the divine seeds of fire growing in a shining box that reflects the sunlight they need no rubbingsticks and no drill to kindle fresh flame they touch the seed on the box and lo like a miracle fire bursts forth from the wood spontaneous tukilakila comes to behold this miracle  the warriors hung back with doubtful eyes for a moment then they spoke with one accord tukilakila shall decide tukilakila tukilakila if the great god says the taboo holds good we will not hurt or offend the strangers but if the great god says the taboo is broken and we are all without sinthen korong korong we will kill them we will eat them  as the two parties thus stood glaring at one another across that narrow imaginary wall another cry went up to heaven at the distant sound of a peculiar tomtom tukilakila comes they shouted our great god approaches women begone men hide your eyes fly fly from the brightness of his face which is as the sun in glory tukilakila comes fly far all profane ones  and in a moment the women had disappeared into space and the men lay flat on the moist ground with low groans of surprise and hid their faces in their hands in abject terror     chapter xiii  as between gods   tukilakila came up in his grandest panoply the great umbrella with the hanging cords rose high over his head the king of fire and the king of water in their robes of state marched slowly by his side a whole group of slaves and temple attendants clapping hands in unison followed obedient at his sacred heels but as soon as he reached the open space in front of the huts and began to speak felix could easily see in spite of his own agitation and the excitement of the moment that the implacable god himself was profoundly frightened last nights storm had indeed been terrible but tukilakila mentally coupled it with felixs attitude toward himself at their last interview and really believed in his own heart he had met after all with a stronger god more powerful than himself who could make the clouds burst forth in fire and the earth tremble the savage swaggered a good deal to be sure as is often the fashion with savages when frightened but felix could see between the lines that he swaggered only on the familiar principle of whistling to keep your courage up and that in his heart of hearts he was most unspeakably terrified  you did not do well o king of the rain last night he said after an interchange of civilities as becomes great gods you have put out even the sacred flame on the holy hearth of the king of fire you have a bad heart why do you use us so  why do you let your people offer human sacrifices felix answered boldly taking advantage of his position they are hateful in our sight these cannibal ways while we remain on the island no human life shall be unjustly taken do you understand me  tukilakila drew back and gazed around him suspiciously in all his experience no one had ever dared to address him like that assuredly the stranger from the sun must be a very great godhow great he hardly dared to himself to realize he shrugged his shoulders when we mighty deities of the first order speak together face to face he said with an uneasy air it is not well that the mere common herd of men should overhear our profound deliberations let us go inside your hut let us confer in private  they entered the hut alone muriel still clinging to felixs arm in speechless terror then felix at once began to explain the situation as he spoke a baleful light gleamed in tukilakilas eye the great god removed his mulberrypaper mask he was evidently delighted at the turn things had taken if only he daredbut there he dared not fire and water would never allow it he murmured softly to himself they know the taboos as well as i do it was clear to felix that the savage would gladly have sacrificed him if he dared and that he made no bones about letting him know it but the custom of the islanders bound him as tightly as it bound themselves and he was afraid to transgress it  now listen felix said at last after a long palaver looking in the savages face with a resolute air tukilakila we are not afraid of you we are not afraid of all your people i went out alone just now to rescue that child and as you see i succeeded in rescuing it your people have wounded melook at the blood on my arms and chestbut i dont mind for wounds i mean you to do as i say and to make your people do so too understand the nation to which i belong is very powerful you have heard of the sailing gods who go over the sea in canoes of fire as swift as the wind and whose weapons are hollow tubes that belch forth great bolts of lightning and thunder very well i am one of them if ever you harm a hair of our heads those sailing gods will before long send one of their mighty firecanoes and bring to bear upon your island their thunder and lightning and destroy your huts and punish you for the wrong you have ventured to do us so now you know remember that you act exactly as i tell you  tukilakila was evidently overawed by the white mans resolute voice and manner he had heard before of the sailing gods as the polynesians of the old school still call the europeans and though but one or two stray individuals among them had ever reached his remote island mostly as castaways he was quite well enough acquainted with their might and power to be deeply impressed by felixs exhortation so he tried to temporize very well he made answer with his jauntiest air assuming a tone of friendly goodfellowship toward his brothergod i will bear it in mind i will try to humor you while your time lasts no man shall hurt you but if i promise you that you must do a good turn for me instead you must come out before the people and give me a new fire from the sun that you carry in a shining box about with you the king of fire has allowed his sacred flame to go out in deference to your flood for last night you know you came down heavily never in my life have i known you come down heavier the king of fire acknowledges himself beaten so give us light now before the people that they may know we are gods and may fear to disobey us  only on one condition felix answered sternly for he felt he had tukilakila more or less in his power now and that he could drive a bargain with him why he wasnt sure but he saw tukilakila attached a profound importance to having the sacred fire relighted as he thought direct from heaven  what condition is that tukilakila asked glancing about him suspiciously  why that you give up in future human sacrifices  tukilakila gave a start then he reflected for a moment evidently the condition seemed to him a very hard one do you want all the victims for yourself and her then he asked with a casual nod aside toward muriel  felix drew back with horror depicted on every line of his face heaven forbid he answered fervently we want no bloodshed no human victims we ask you to give up these horrid practices because they shock and revolt us if you would have your fire lighted you must promise us to put down cannibalism altogether henceforth in your island  tukilakila hesitated after all it was only for a very short time that these strangers could thus beard him their day would come soon they were but korongs meanwhile it was best no doubt to effect a compromise agreed he answered slowly i will put down human sacrificesso long as you live among us and i will tell the people your taboo is not broken all shall be done as you will in this matter now come out before the crowd and light the fire from heaven  remember felix repeated if you break your word my people will come down upon you sooner or later in their mighty firecanoes and will take vengeance for your crime and destroy you utterly  tukilakila smiled a cunning smile i know all that he answered i am a god myself not a fool dont you see you are a very great god too but i am the greater no more of words between us two it is as between gods the fire the fire  tukilakila replaced his mask they proceeded from the hut to the open space within the tabooline the people still lay all flat on their faces fire and water tukilakila said in a commanding tone come forward and screen me  the king of fire and the king of water unrolled a large square of native cloth which they held up as a screen on two poles in front of their superior deity tukilakila sat down on the ground hugging his knees in the common squatting savage fashion behind the veil thus readily formed for him taboo is removed he said in loud clear tones my people may rise the light will not burn them they may look toward the place where tukilakilas face is hidden from them  the people all rose with one accord and gazed straight before them  the king of fire will bring dry sticks tukilakila said in his accustomed regal manner  the king of fire sticking one pole of the screen into the ground securely brought forward a bundle of sundried sticks and leaves from a basket beside him  the king of the rain who has put out all our hearths with his flood last night will relight them again with new fire fresh flame from the sun rays of our disk divine mystic wonderful tukilakila proclaimed in his droning monotone  felix advanced as he spoke to the pile and struck a match before the eyes of all the islanders as they saw it light and then set fire to the wood a loud cry went up once more tukilakila is great his words are true he has brought fire from the sun his ways are wonderful  tukilakila from his point of vantage behind the curtain strove to improve the occasion with a theological lesson that is the way we have learned from our divine ancestors he said slowly the rule of the gods in our island of boupari each god as he grows old reincarnates himself visibly before he can grow feeble and die he immolates himself willingly on his own altar and a younger and a stronger than he receives his spirit thus the gods are always young and always with you behold myself tukilakila am i not from old times am i not very ancient have i not passed through many bodies do i not spring ever fresh from my own ashes do i not eat perpetually the flesh of new victims even so with fire the flames of our island were becoming impure the king of fire saw his cinders flickering so i gave my word the king of the rain descended in floods upon them he put them all out and now he rekindles them they burn up brighter and fresher than ever they burn to cook my meat the limbs of my victims take heed that you do the king of the rain no harm as long as he remains within his sacred circle he is a very great god he is fierce he is cruel his taboo is not broken beware beware disobey at your peril i tukilakila have spoken  as he spoke it seemed to felix that these strange mystic words about each god springing fresh from his own ashes must contain the solution of that dread problem they were trying in vain to read that perhaps was the secret of korong if only they could ever manage to understand it  tukilakila beat his tomtom twice in a second all the people fell flat on their faces again tukilakila rose the kings of fire and water held the umbrella over him the attendants on either side clapped hands in time to the sacred tomtom with proud slow tread the god retraced his steps to his own palacetemple and muriel and felix were left alone at last in their dusty enclosure  tukilakila hates me felix said later in the day to his attentive shadow  of course the young man answered with a tone of natural assent to be sure he hates you how could he do otherwise you are korong you may any day be his enemy  but hes afraid of me too felix went on he would have liked to let the people tear me in pieces yet he dared not risk it he seems to dread offending me  of course the shadow replied as readily as before he is very much afraid of you you are korong you may any day supplant him he would like to get rid of you if he could see his way but till your time comes he dare not touch you  when will my time come felix asked with that dim apprehension of some horrible end coming over him yet again in all its vague weirdness  the shadow shook his head that he answered it is not lawful for me so much as to mention i tell you too far you will know soon enough wait and be patient     chapter xiv  mr thurstan i presume   naturally enough it was some time before felix and muriel could recover from the shock of their deadly peril yet strange to say the natives at the end of three days seemed positively to have forgotten all about it their loves and their hates were as shortlived as childrens as soon as the period of seclusion was over their attentions to the two strangers redoubled in intensity they were evidently most anxious after this brief disagreement to reassure the new gods who came from the sun of their gratitude and devotion the men who had wounded felix in particular now came daily in the morning with exceptional gifts of fish fruit and flowers they would bring a crab from the sea or a joint of turtlemeat forgive us o king they cried prostrating themselves humbly we did not mean to hurt you we thought your time had really come you are a korong we would not offend you do not refuse us your showers because of our sin we are very penitent we will do what you ask of us your look is poison see here is wood here are leaves and fire we are but your meat choose and cook which you will of us  it was useless felixs trying to explain to them that he wanted no victims and no propitiation the more he protested the more they brought gifts he is a very great god they exclaimed he wants nothing from us what can we give him that will be an acceptable gift shall we offer him ourselves our wives our children  as for the women when they saw how thoroughly frightened of them muriel now was they couldnt find means to express their regret and devotion mothers brought their little children whom she had patted on the head and offered them just outside the line as presents for her acceptance they explained to her shadow that they never meant to hurt her and that if only she would venture without the line as of old all should be well and they would love and adore her mali translated to her mistress these speeches and prayers them say you come back queenie she explained in her broken queensland english boupari women love you very much boupari women glad you come you kind you beautiful all boupari men and women very much pleased with you and the gentleman because you give back him cocoanut and fruit that you pick in the storm and because you bring down fresh fire from heaven  gradually after several days felixs confidence was so far restored that he ventured to stroll beyond the line again and he found himself indeed most popular among the people in various ways he picked up gradually the idea that the islanders generally disliked tukilakila and liked himself and that they somehow regarded him as tukilakilas natural enemy what it could all mean he did not yet understand though some inklings of an explanation occasionally occurred to him oh how he longed now for the month of birds to end in order that he might pay his longdeferred visit to the mysterious frenchman from whose voice his shadow had fled on that fateful evening with such sudden precipitancy the frenchman he judged must have been long on the island and could probably give him some satisfactory solution of this abstruse problem  so he was glad indeed when one evening some weeks later his shadow observing the sky narrowly remarked to him in a low voice new moon tomorrow the month of birds will then be up in the morning you can go and see your brother god at the abode of birds without breaking taboo the month of turtles begins at sunrise my family god is a turtle so i know the day for it  so great was felixs impatience to settle this question that almost before the sun was up next day he had set forth from his hut accompanied as usual by his faithful shadow their way lay past tukilakilas temple as they went by the entrance with the bamboo posts felix happened to glance aside through the gate to the sacred enclosure early as it was tukilakila was afoot already and to felixs great surprise was pacing up and down with that stealthy wary look upon his cunning face that muriel had so particularly noted on the day of their first arrival his spear stood in his hand and his tomahawk hung by his left side he peered about him suspiciously with a cautious glance as he walked round and round the sacred tree he guarded so continually there was something weird and awful in the sight of that savage god thus condemned by his own superstition and the custom of his people to tramp ceaselessly up and down before the sacred banyan  at sight of felix however a sudden burst of frenzy seemed to possess at once all tukilakilas limbs he brandished his spear violently and set himself spasmodically in a posture of defence his brow grew black and his eyes darted out eternal hate and suspicion it was evident he expected an instant attack and was prepared with all his might and main to resist aggression yet he never offered to desert his post by the tree or to assume the offensive clearly he was guarding the sacred grove itself with jealous care and was as eager for its safety as for his own life and honor  felix passed on wondering what it all could mean and turned with an inquiring glance to his trembling shadow as for toko he had held his face averted meanwhile lest he should behold the great god and be scorched to a cinder but in answer to felixs mute inquiry he murmured low was tukilakila there were all things right was he on guard at his post by the tree already  yes felix replied with that weird sense of mystery creeping over him now more profoundly than ever he was on guard by the tree and he looked at me angrily  ah the shadow remarked with a sigh of regret he keeps watch well it will be hard work to assail him no god in boupari ever held his place so tight who wishes to take tukilakilas divinity must get up early  they went on in silence to the little volcanic knoll near the centre of the island there in the neat garden plot they had observed before a man in the last relics of a very tattered european costume much covered with a short cape of native cloth was tending his flowers and singing to himself merrily his back was turned to them as they came up felix paused a moment unseen and caught the words the stranger was singing  très jolie  peu polie  possédant un gros magot  fort en gueule  pas bégueule  telle était  the stranger looked up and paused in the midst of his lines openmouthed for a moment he stood and stared astonished then raising his native cap with a graceful air and bowing low as he would have bowed to a lady on the boulevard he advanced to greet a brother european with the familiar words in good educated french monsieur i salute you  to felix the sound of a civilized voice in the midst of so much strange and primitive barbarism was like a sudden return to some forgotten world so deeply and profoundly did it move and impress him he grasped the sunburnt frenchmans rugged hand in his who are you he cried in the very best parisian he could muster up on the spur of the moment and how did you come here  monsieur the frenchman answered no less profoundly moved than himself this is indeed wonderful do i hear once more that beautiful language spoken do i find myself once more in the presence of a civilized person what fortune what happiness ah it is glorious glorious  for some seconds they stood and looked at one another in silence grasping their hands hard again and again with intense emotion then felix repeated his question a second time who are you monsieur and where do you come from  your name surname age occupation the frenchman repeated bursting forth at last into national levity ah monsieur what a joy to hear those wellknown inquiries in my ear once more i hasten to gratify your legitimate curiosity name peyron christian name jules age fortyone occupation convict escaped from new caledonia  under any other circumstances that last qualification might possibly have been held an undesirable one in a new acquaintance but on the island of boupari among so many heathen cannibals prejudices pale before community of blood even a new caledonian convict is at least a christian european felix received the strange announcement without the faintest shock of surprise or disgust he would gladly have shaken hands then and there with m jules peyron indeed had he introduced himself in even less equivocal language as a forger a pickpocket or an escaped housebreaker  and you monsieur the exconvict inquired politely  felix told him in a few words the history of their accident and their arrival on the island  comment the frenchman exclaimed with surprise and delight a lady as well a charming english lady what an acquisition to the society of boupari quelle chance quel bonheur monsieur you are welcome and mademoiselle too and in what quality do you live here you are a god i see otherwise you would not have dared to transgress my taboo nor would this young manyour shadow i supposehave permitted you to do so but which sort of god pray korongor tula  they call me korong felix answered all tremulous feeling himself now on the very verge of solving this profound mystery  and mademoiselle as well the frenchman exclaimed in a tone of dismay  and mademoiselle as well felix replied at least so i make out we are both korong i have many times heard the natives call us so  his new acquaintance seized his hand with every appearance of genuine alarm and regret my poor friend he exclaimed with a horrified face this is terrible terrible tukilakila is a very hard man what can we do to save your life and mademoiselles we are powerless powerless i have only that much to say i condole with you i commiserate you  why what does korong mean felix asked with blanched lips is it then something so very terrible  terrible ah terrible the frenchman answered holding up his hands in horror and alarm i hardly know how we can avert your fate step within my poor hut or under the shade of my tree of liberty here and i will tell you all the little i know about it     chapter xv  the secret of korong   you have lived here long felix asked with tremulous interest as he took a seat on the bench under the big tree toward which his new host politely motioned him you know the people well and all their superstitions  hélas yes monsieur the frenchman answered with a sigh of regret eighteen years have i spent altogether in this beast of a pacific nine as a convict in new caledonia and nine more as a god here and believe me i hardly know which is the harder post yours is the first white face i have ever seen since my arrival in this cursed island  and how did you come here felix asked half breathless for the very magnitude of the stake at issueno less a stake than muriels lifemade him hesitate to put pointblank the question he had most at heart for the moment  monsieur the frenchman answered trying to cover his rags with his native cape that explains itself easily i was a medical student in paris in the days of the commune ah that beloved parishow far away it seems now from boupari like all other students i was advancedrepublican socialistwhat you willa political enthusiast when the events took placethe events of 70i espoused with all my heart the cause of the people you know the rest the bourgeoisie conquered i was taken redhanded as the versaillais saidmy pistol in my graspan open revolutionist they tried me by courtmartialbrrrno delayguilty m le presidenthard labor to perpetuity they sent me with that brave louise michel and so many other good comrades of the cause to new caledonia there nine years of convict life was more than enough for me one day i found a canoe on the shorea little kanaka canoeyou know the typea mere shapeless dugout hastily i loaded it with foodyam taro breadfruiti pushed it off into the seai embarked alonei intrusted myself and all my fortunes to the bon dieu and the wide pacific the bon dieu did not wholly justify my confidence it is a way he hasthat inscrutable one six weeks i floated hither and thither before varying winds at last one evening i reached this island i floated ashore and enfin me voilà  then you were a political prisoner only felix said politely  m jules peyron drew himself up with much dignity in his tattered costume do i look like a cardsharper monsieur he asked simply with offended honor  felix hastened to reassure him of his perfect confidence on the contrary monsieur he said the moment i heard you were a convict from new caledonia i felt certain in my heart you could be nothing less than one of those unfortunate and illtreated communards  monsieur the frenchman said seizing his hand a second time i perceive that i have to do with a man of honor and a man of feeling well i landed on this island and they made me a god from that day to this i have been anxious only to shuffle off my unwelcome divinity and return as a mere man to the shores of europe better be a valet in paris say i than a deity of the best in polynesia it is a monotonous existence hereno society no lifeand the cuisinebah execrable but till the other day when your steamer passed i have scarcely even sighted a european ship a boat came here once worse luck to put off two girls who didnt belong to boupari returned indentured laborers from queensland but unhappily it was during my taboothe month of birds as my jailers call itand though i tried to go down to it or to make signals of distress the natives stood round my hut with their spears in line and prevented me by main force from signalling to them or communicating with them even the other day i never heard of your arrival till a fortnight had elapsed for i had been sick with fever the fever of the country and as soon as my shadow told me of your advent it was my taboo again and i was obliged to defer for myself the honor of calling upon my new acquaintances i am a god of course and can do what i like but while my taboo is on ma foi monsieur i can hardly call my life my own i assure you  but your taboo is up today felix said so my shadow tells me  your shadow is a wellinformed young man m peyron answered with easy french sprightliness as for my donkey of a valet he never by any chance knows or tells me anything i had just sent him outthe pigto learn if possible your nationality and name and what hours you preferred as i proposed later in the day to pay my respects to mademoiselle your friend if she would deign to receive me  miss ellis would be charmed im sure felix replied smiling in spite of himself at so much parisian courtliness under so ragged an exterior it is a great pleasure to us to find we are not really alone on this barbarous island but you were going to explain to me i believe the exact nature of this peril in which we both standthe precise distinction between korong and tula  alas monsieur the frenchman replied drawing circles in the dust with his stick with much discomposure i can only tell you i have been trying to make out the secret of this distinction myself ever since the first day i came to the island but so reticent are all the natives about it and so deep is the taboo by which the mystery is guarded that even now i who am myself tula can tell you but very little with certainty on the subject all i can say for sure is thisthat gods called tula retain their godship in permanency for a very long time although at the end some violent fate which i do not clearly understand is destined to befall them that is my condition as king of the birdsfor no doubt they have told you that i jules peyronrepublican socialist communisthave been elevated against my will to the honors of royalty that is my condition and it matters but little to me for i know not when the end may come and we can but die once how or where what matters meanwhile i have my distractions my little agrémentsmy gardens my music my birds my native friends my coquetries my aviary as king of the birds i keep a small collection of my subjects in the living form not unworthy of a scientific eye monsieur is no ornithologist ah no i thought not well for me it matters little my time is long but for you and mademoiselle who are both korong he paused significantly  what happens then to those who are korong felix asked with a lump in his throatnot for himself but for muriel  the frenchman looked at him with a doubtful look monsieur he said after a pause i hardly know how to break the truth to you properly you are new to the island and do not yet understand these savages it is so terrible a fate so deadly so certain compose your mind to hear the worst and remember that the worst is very terrible  felixs blood froze within him but he answered bravely all the same i think i have guessed it myself already the korong are offered as human sacrifices to tukilakila  that is nearly so his new friend replied with a solemn nod of his head every korong is bound to die when his time comes your time will depend on the particular date when you were admitted to heaven  felix reflected a moment it was on the 26th of last month he answered shortly  very well m peyron replied after a brief calculation you have just six months in all to live from that date they will offer you up by tukilakilas hut the day the sun reaches the summer solstice  but why did they make us gods then felix interposed with tremulous lips why treat us with such honors meanwhile if they mean in the end to kill us  he received his sentence of death with greater calmness than the frenchman had expected monsieur the older arrival answered with a reflective air there comes in the mystery if we could solve that we could find out also the way of escape for you for there is a way of escape for every korong i know it well i gather it from all the natives say it is a part of their mysteries but what it may be i have hitherto in spite of all my efforts failed to discover all i do know is this tukilakila hates and dreads in his heart every korong that is elevated to heaven and would do anything if he dared to get rid of him quietly but he doesnt dare because he is bound hand and foot himself too by taboos innumerable taboo is the real god and king of boupari all the island alike bows down to it and worships it  have you ever known korongs killed felix asked once more trembling  yes monsieur many of them alas and this is what happens when the korongs time is come as these creatures say either on the summer or winter solstice he is bound with native ropes and carried up so pinioned to tukilakilas temple in the time before this man was tukilakila i remember  stop felix cried i dont understand has there then been more than one tukilakila  why yes the frenchman answered certainly many and there the mystery comes in again we have always among us one tukilakila or another he is a sort of pope or grand lama voyezvous no sooner is the last god dead than another god succeeds him and takes his name or rather his title this young man who now holds the place was known originally as lavita the son of sami but what is more curious still the islanders always treat the new god as if he were precisely the selfsame person as the old one so far as i have been able to understand their theology they believe in a sort of transmigration of souls the soul of the tukilakila who is just dead passes into and animates the body of the tukilakila who succeeds to the office thus they speak as though tukilakila were a continuous existence and the god of the moment himself will even often refer to events which occurred to him as he says a hundred years ago or more but which he really knows of course only by the persistent tradition of the islanders they are a very curious people these bouparese but what would you have among savages one expects things to be as among savages  felix drew a quiet sigh it was certain that on the island of boupari that expectation at least was never doomed to disappointment and when a korong is taken to tukilakilas temple he asked continuing the subject of most immediate interest what happens next to him  monsieur the frenchman answered i hardly know whether i do right or not to say the truth to you each korong is a god for one season only when the year renews itself as the savages believe by a change of season then a new korong must be chosen by heaven to fill the place of the old ones who are to be sacrificed this they do in order that the seasons may be ever fresh and vigorous especially is that the case with the two meteorological gods so to speak the king of the rain and the queen of the clouds those i understand are the posts in their pantheon which you and the lady who accompanies you occupy  you are right felix answered with profoundly painful interest and what then becomes of the king and queen who are sacrificed  i will tell you m peyron answered dropping his voice still lower into a sympathetic key but steel your mind for the worst beforehand it is sufficiently terrible on the day of your arrival this i learn from my shadow is just what happened that night tukilakila made his great feast and offered up the two chief human sacrifices of the year the freewill offering and the scapegoat of trespass they keep then a festival which answers to our own newyears day in europe next morning in accordance with custom the king of the rain and the queen of the clouds were to be publicly slain in order that a new and more vigorous king and queen should be chosen in their place who might make the crops grow better and the sky more clement in the midst of this horrid ceremony you and mademoiselle by pure chance arrived you were immediately selected by tukilakila for some reason of his own which i do not sufficiently understand but which is nevertheless obvious to all the initiated as the next representatives of the raingiving gods you were presented to heaven on their little platform raised about the ground and heaven accepted you then you were envisaged with the attributes of divinity the care of the rain and the clouds was made over to you and immediately after as soon as you were gone the old king and queen were laid on an altar near tukilakilas home and slain with tomahawks their flesh was next hacked from their bodies with knives cooked and eaten their bones were thrown into the sea the mother of all waters as the natives call it and that is the fate i fear the inevitable fate that will befall you and mademoiselle at these wretches hands about the commencement of a fresh season  felix knew the worst now and bent his head in silence his worst fears were confirmed but after all even this knowledge was better than so much uncertainty  and now that he knew when his time was up as the natives phrased it he would know when to redeem his promise to muriel     chapter xvi  a very faint clue   but you hinted at some hope some chance of escape felix cried at last looking up from the ground and mastering his emotion what now is that hope conceal nothing from me  monsieur the frenchman answered shrugging his shoulders with an expression of utter impotence i have as good reasons for wishing to find out all that as even you can have your secret is my secret but with all my pains and astuteness i have been unable to discover it the natives are reticent very reticent indeed about all these matters they fear taboo and they fear tukilakila the women to be sure in a moment of expansion might possibly tell one but then the women unfortunately are not admitted to the mysteries they know no more of all these things than we do the most i have been able to gather for certain is thisthat on the discovery of the secret depend tukilakilas life and power every boupari man knows this great taboo it is communicated to him in the assembly of adults when he gets tattooed and reaches manhood but no boupari man ever communicates it to strangers and for that reason perhaps as i believe tukilakila often chooses for korong as far as possible those persons who are cast by chance upon the island it has always been the custom so far as i can make out to treat castaways or prisoners taken in war as gods and then at the end of their term to kill them ruthlessly this plan is popular with the people at large because it saves themselves from the dangerous honors of deification but it also serves tukilakilas purpose because it usually elevates to heaven those innocent persons who are unacquainted with that fatal secret which is as the natives say tukilakilas deathhis word of dismissal  then if only we could find out this secret felix cried  his new friend interrupted him what hope is there of your finding it out monsieur he exclaimed you who have only a few months to livewhen i who have spent nine long years of exile on the island and seen two tukilakilas rise and fall have been unable with my utmost pains to discover it tenez you have no idea yet of the superstitions of these people or the difficulties that lie in the way of fathoming them come this way to my aviary i will show you something that will help you to realize the complexities of the situation  he rose and led the way to another cleared space at the back of the hut where several birds of gaudy plumage were fastened to perches on sticks by leathery lashes of dried sharks skin tied just above their talons i am the king of the birds monsieur you must remember the frenchman said fondling one of his screaming protégés these are a few of my subjects but i do not keep them for mere curiosity each of them is the soul of the tribe to which it belongs this for examplemy cluseretis the soul of all the gray parrots that that you see yonderbadinguet i call himis the soul of the hawks this my mimi is the soul of the little yellowcrested kingfisher my task as king of the birds is to keep a representative of each of these always on hand in which endeavor i am faithfully aided by the whole population of the island who bring me eggs and nests and young birds in abundance if the soul of the little yellow kingfisher now were to die without a successor being found ready at once to receive and embody it then the whole race of little yellow kingfishers would vanish altogether and if i myself the king of the birds who am as it were the soul and life of all of them were to die without a successor being at hand to receive my spirit then all the race of birds with one accord would become extinct forthwith and forever  he moved among his pets easily like a king among his subjects most of them seemed to know him and love his presence presently he came to one very old parrot quite different from any felix had ever seen on any trees in the island it was a parrot with a black crest and a red mark on its throat half blind with age and tottering on its pedestal this solemn old bird sat apart from all the others nodding its head oracularly in the sunlight and blinking now and again with its white eyelids in a curious senile fashion  the frenchman turned to felix with an air of profound mystery this bird he said solemnly stroking its head with his hand while the parrot turned round to him and bit at his finger with halfdoddering affectionthis bird is the oldest of all my birdsis it not so methuselahand illustrates well in one of its aspects the superstition of these people yes my friend you are the last of a kind now otherwise extinct are you not mon vieux no no theregently once upon a time the natives tell me dozens of these parrots existed in the island they flocked among the trees and were held very sacred but they were hard to catch and difficult to keep and the kings of the birds my predecessors failed to secure an heir and coadjutor to this one so as the soul of the species which you see here before you grew old and feeble the whole of the race to which it belonged grew old and feeble with it one by one they withered away and died till at last this solitary specimen alone remained to vouch for the former existence of the race in the island now the islanders say nothing but the soul itself is left and when the soul dies the redthroated parrots will be gone forever one of my predecessors paid with his life in awful tortures for his remissness in not providing for the succession to the soulship i tell you these things in order that you may see whether they cast any light for you upon your own position and also because the oldest and wisest natives say that this parrot alone among beasts or birds or uninitiated things knows the secret on which depends the life of the tukilakila for the time being  can the parrot speak felix asked with profound emotion  monsieur he can speak and he speaks frequently but not one word of all he says is comprehensible either to me or to any other living being his tongue is that of a forgotten nation the islanders understand him no more than i do he has a very long sermon or poem which he knows by heart in some unknown language and he repeats it often at full length from time to time especially when he has eaten well and feels full and happy the oldest natives tell a romantic legend about this strange recitation of the good methuselahi call him methuselah because of his great agebut i do not really know whether their tale is true or purely fanciful you never can trust these polynesian traditions  what is the legend felix asked with intense interest in an island where we find ourselves so girt round by mystery within mystery and taboo within taboo as this every key is worth trying it is well for us at least to learn everything we can about the ideas of the natives who knows what clue may supply us at last with the missing link which will enable us to break through this intolerable servitude  well the story they tell us is this the frenchman replied though i have gathered it only a hint at a time from very old men who declared at the same moment that some religious fearof which they have manyprevented them from telling me any further about it it seems that a long time agohow many years ago nobody knows only that it was in the time of the thirtyninth tukilakila before the reign of lavita the son of samia strange korong was cast up upon this island by the waves of the sea much as you and i have been in the present generation by accident says the story or else as others aver through the indiscretion of a native woman who fell in love with him and who worried the taboo out of her husband the stranger became acquainted with the secret of tukilakila as the natives themselves put it he learned the death of the high god and where in the world his soul was hidden thereupon in some mysterious way or other he became tukilakila himself and ruled as high god for ten years or more here on this island now up to that time the legend goes on none but the men of the island knew the secret they learned it as soon as they were initiated in the great mysteries which occur before a boy is given a spear and admitted to the rank of complete manhood but sometimes a woman was told the secret wrongfully by her husband or her lover and one such woman apparently told the strange korong and so enabled him to become tukilakila  but where does the parrot come in felix asked with still profounder excitement than ever something within him seemed to tell him instinctively he was now within touch of the special key that must sooner or later unlock the mystery  well the frenchman went on still stroking the parrot affectionately with his hand and smoothing down the feathers on its ruffled back the strange tukilakila who thus ruled in the island though he learned to speak polynesian well had a language of his own a language of the birds which no man on earth could ever talk with him so to beguile his time and to have someone who could converse with him in his native dialect he taught this parrot to speak his own tongue and spent most of his days in talking with it and fondling it at last after he had instructed it by slow degrees how to repeat this long sermon or poemwhich i have often heard it recite in a singsong voice from beginning to endhis time came as they say and he had to give way to another tukilakila for the bouparese have a proverb like our own about the king the high god is dead may the high god live forever but before he gave up his soul to his successor and was eaten or buried whichever is the custom he handed over his pet to the king of the birds strictly charging all future bearers of that divine office to care for the parrot as they would care for a son or a daughter and so the natives make much of the parrot to the present day saying he is greater than any save a korong or a god for he is the soul of a dead race summing it up in himself and he knows the secret of the death of tukilakila  but you cant tell me what language he speaks felix asked with a despairing gesture it was terrible to stand thus within measurable distance of the secret which might perhaps save muriels life and yet be perpetually balked by wheel within wheel of more than egyptian mystery  who can say the frenchman answered shrugging his shoulders helplessly it isnt polynesian that i know well for i speak bouparese now like a native of boupari and it isnt the only other language spoken at the present day in the south seasthe melanesian of new caledoniafor that i learned well from the kanakas while i was serving my time as a convict among them all we can say for certain is that it may perhaps be some very ancient tongue for parrots we know are immensely longlived some of them it is said exceed their century is it not so eh my friend methuselah     chapter xvii  facing the worst   muriel meanwhile sat alone in her hut frightened at felixs unexpected disappearance so early in the morning and anxiously awaiting her lovers return for she made no pretences now to herself that she did not really love felix though the two might never return to europe to be husband and wife she did not doubt that before the eye of heaven they were already betrothed to one another as truly as though they had plighted their troth in solemn fashion felix had risked his life for her and had brought all this misery upon himself in the attempt to save her felix was now all the world that was left her with felix she was happy even on this horrible island without him she was miserable and terrified no matter what happened  mali she cried to her faithful attendant as soon as she found felix was missing from his tent whats become of mr thurstan where can he be gone i wonder this morning  you no fear missy queenie mali answered with the childish confidence of the native polynesian mistah thurstan him gone to see manaouioui the king of the birds month of birds finish last night manaouioui no taboo any longer king of the birds keep very old parrot boupari folk tell me and old parrot very wise know how to make tukilakila mistah thurstan him gone to find manaouioui parrot tell him plenty wise thing parrot wiser than boupari people know very good medicine wise like queensland lady and gentleman and mali set herself vigorously to work to wash the wooden platter on which she served up her mistresss yam for breakfast  it was curious to muriel to see how readily mali had slipped from savagery to civilization in queensland and how easily she had slipped back again from civilization to savagery in boupari in waiting on her mistress she was just the ordinary trained native australian servant in every other respect she was the simple unadulterated heathen polynesian she recognized in muriel a white lady of the english sort and treated her within the hut as white ladies were invariably treated in queensland but she considered that at boupari one must do as boupari does and it never for a moment occurred to her simple mind to doubt the omnipotence of tukilakila in his island realm any more than she had doubted the omnipotence of the white man and his local religion in their proper place as she thought it in queensland  an hour or two passed before felix returned at last he arrived very white and pale and muriel saw at once by the mere look on his face that he had learned some terrible news at the frenchmans  well you found him she cried taking his hand in hers but hardly daring to ask the fatal question at once  and felix sitting down as pale as a ghost answered faintly yes muriel i found him  and he told you everything  everything he knew my poor child oh muriel muriel dont ask me what it is its too terrible to tell you  muriel clasped her white hands together held bloodless downward and looked at him fixedly mali you can go she said and the shadow rising up with childish confidence glided from the hut and left them for the first time since their arrival on the central island alone together  muriel looked at him once more with the same deadly fixed look with you felix she said slowly i can bear or dare anything i feel as if the bitterness of death were past long ago i know it must come i only want to be quite sure when and besides you must remember i have your promise  felix clasped his own hands despondently in return and gazed across at her from his seat a few feet off in unspeakable misery  muriel he cried i couldnt i havent the heart i darent  muriel rose and laid her hand solemnly on his arm you will she answered boldly you can you must i know i can trust your promise for that this moment if you like i would not shrink but you will never let me fall alive into the hands of those wretches felix from your hand i could stand anything im not afraid to die i love you too dearly  felix held her white little wrist in his grasp and sobbed like a child her very bravery and confidence seemed to unman him utterly  she looked at him once more when she asked quietly but with lips as pale as death  in about four months from now felix answered endeavoring to be calm  and they will kill us both  yes both i think so  together  together  muriel drew a deep sigh  will you know the day beforehand she asked  yes the frenchman told me it he has known others killed in the selfsame fashion  then felixthe night before it comes you will promise me will you  muriel muriel i could never dare to kill you  she laid her hand soothingly on his she stroked him gently you are a man she said looking up into his eyes with confidence i trust you i believe in you i know you will never let these savages hurt me felix in spite of everything ive been happier since we came to this island together than ever i have been in my life before ive had my wish i didnt want to miss in life the one thing that life has best worth giving i havent missed it now i know i havent for i love you and you love me after that i can die and die gladly if i die with you thats all i ask these seven or eight terrible weeks have made me feel somehow unnaturally calm when i came here first i lived all the time in an agony of terror ive got over the agony of terror now im quite resigned and happy all i ask is to be savedby youfrom the cruel hands of these hateful cannibals  felix raised her white hand just once to his lips it was the first time he had ever ventured to kiss her he kissed it fervently she let it drop as if dead by her side  now tell me all that happened she said im strong enough to bear it i feel such a woman nowso wise and calm these few weeks have made me grow from a girl into a woman all at once theres nothing i darent hear if youll tell me it felix  felix took up her hand again and held it in his as he narrated the whole story of his visit to the frenchman when muriel had heard it she said once more slowly i dont think theres any hope in all these wild plans of playing off superstition against superstition to my mind there are only two chances left for us now one is to concoct with the frenchman some means of getting away by canoe from the islandid rather trust the sea than the tender mercy of these dreadful people the other is to keep a closer lookout than ever for the merest chance of a passing steamer  felix drew a deep sigh im afraid neithers much use he said if we tried to get away dogged as we are day and night by our shadows the natives would follow us with their warcanoes in battle array and hack us to pieces for peyron says that regarding us as gods they think the rain would vanish from their island forever if once they allowed us to get away alive and carry the luck with us and as to the steamers we havent seen a trace of one since we left the australasian probably it was only by the purest accident that even she ever came so close in to boupari  at any rate muriel cried still clasping his hand tight and letting the tears now trickle slowly down her pale white cheeks we can talk it all over some day with m peyron  we can talk it over today felix answered if it comes to that for peyron means to step round he says a little later in the afternoon to pay his respects to the first white lady he has ever seen since he left new caledonia     chapter xviii  tukilakila plays a card   before the frenchman could carry out his plan however he was himself the recipient of the high honor of a visit from his superior god and chief tukilakila  every day and all day long save on a few rare occasions when special duties absolved him the custom and religion of the islanders prescribed that their supreme incarnate deity should keep watch and ward without cessation over the great spreading banyantree that overshadowed with its dark boughs his templepalace high god as he was held to be and allpowerful within the limits of his own strict taboos tukilakila was yet as rigidly bound within those iron laws of custom and religious usage as the meanest and poorest of his subject worshippers from sunrise to sunset and far on into the night the pillar of heaven was compelled to prowl up and down with spear in hand and tomahawk at side as felix had so often seen him before the sacred trunk of which he appeared to be in some mysterious way the appointed guardian his very power it seemed was intimately bound up with the performance of that ceaseless and irksome duty he was a god in whose hands the lives of his people were but as dust in the balance but he remained so only on the onerous condition of pacing to and fro like a sentry forever before the still more holy and venerable object he was chosen to protect from attack or injury had he failed in his task had he slumbered at his post all god though he might be his people themselves would have risen in a body and torn him limb from limb before their ancestral fetich as a sacrilegious pretender  at certain times and seasons however as for example at all high feasts and festivals tukilakila had respite for a while from this constant treadmill of mechanical divinity whenever the moon was at the halfquarter or the planets were in lucky conjunctions or a red glow lit up the sky by night or the sacred sacrificial fires of human flesh were lighted then tukilakila could lay aside his tomahawk and spear and become for a while as the islanders his fellows were at other times too when he went out in state to visit the lesser deities of his court the king of fire and the king of water made a solemn taboo before he left his home which protected the sacred tree from aggression during its guardians absence then tukilakila shaded by his divine umbrella and preceded by the noise of the holy tomtoms could go like a monarch over all parts of his realm giving such orders as he pleased within the limits of custom to his inferior officers it was in this way that he now paid his visit to m jules peyron king of the birds and he did so for what to him were amply sufficient reasons  it had not escaped tukilakilas keen eye as he paced among the skeletons in his yard that morning that felix thurstan the king of the rain had taken his way openly toward the frenchmans quarters he felt pretty sure therefore that felix had by this time learned another white man was living on the island and he thought it an ominous fact that the newcomer should make his way toward his felloweuropeans hut on the very first morning when the law of taboo rendered such a visit possible the savage is always by nature suspicious and tukilakila had grounds enough of his own for suspicion in this particular instance the two white men were surely brewing mischief together for the lord of heaven and earth the illuminer of the glowing light of the sun he must make haste and see what plan they were concocting against the sacred tree and the person of its representative the king of plants and of the host of heaven  but it isnt so easy to make haste when all your movements are impeded and hampered by endless taboos and a minutely annoying ritual before tukilakila could get himself under way sacred umbrella tomtoms and all it was necessary for the king of fire and the king of water to make taboo on an elaborate scale with their respective elements and so by the time the high god had reached m jules peyrons garden felix thurstan had already some time since returned to muriels hut and his own quarters  tukilakila approached the king of the birds amid loud clapping of hands with considerable haughtiness to say the truth there was no love lost between the cannibal god and his european subordinate the savage puffed up as he was in his own conceit had nevertheless always an uncomfortable sense that in his heart of hearts the impassive frenchman had but a low opinion of him so he invariably tried to make up by the solemnity of his manner and the loudness of his assertions for any trifling scepticism that might possibly exist in the mind of his follower  on this particular occasion as he reached the frenchmans plot tukilakila stepped forward across the white tabooline with a suspicious and peering eye the king of the rain has been here he said in a pompous tone as the frenchman rose and saluted him ceremoniously tukilakilas eyes are sharp they never sleep the sun is his sight he beholds all things you cannot hide aught in heaven or earth from the knowledge of him that dwells in heaven i look down upon land and sea and spy out all that takes place or is planned in them i am very holy and very cruel i see all earth and i drink the blood of all men the king of the rain has come this morning to visit the king of the birds where is he now what has your divinity done with him  he spoke from under the sheltering cover of his veiled umbrella the frenchman looked back at him with as little love as tukilakila himself would have displayed had his face been visible yes you are a very great god he answered in the conventional tone of polynesian adulation with just a faint undercurrent of irony running through his accent as he spoke you say the truth you do indeed know all things what need for me then to tell you whose eye is the sun that my brother the king of the rain has been here and gone again you know it yourself your eye has looked upon it my brother was indeed with me he consulted me as to the showers i should need from his clouds for the birds my subjects  and where is he gone now tukilakila asked without attempting to conceal the displeasure in his tone for he more than half suspected the frenchman of a sacrilegious and monstrous design of chaffing him  the king of the birds bowed low once more tukilakilas glance is keener than my hawks he answered with the accustomed polynesian imagery he sees over the land with a glance like my parrots and over the sea with sharp sight like my albatrosses he knows where my brother the king of the rain has gone for me who am the least among all the gods i sit here on my perch and blink like a crow i do not know these things they are too high and too deep for me  tukilakila did not like the turn the conversation was taking before his own attendants such hints indeed were almost dangerous once let the savage begin to doubt and the moral order goes with a crash immediately besides he must know what these white men had been talking about fire and water he said in a loud voice turning round to his two chief satellites go far down the path and beat the tomtoms fence off with flood and flame the airy height where the king of the birds lives fence it off from all profane intrusion i wish to confer in secret with this god my brother when we gods talk together it is not well that others should hear our converse make a great taboo i tukilakila myself have said it  fire and water bowing low backed down the path beating tomtoms as they went and left the savage and the frenchman alone together  as soon as they were gone tukilakila laid aside his umbrella with a positive sigh of relief now his fellowcountrymen were well out of the way his manner altered in a trice as if by magic barbarian as he was he was quite astute enough to guess that europeans cared nothing in their hearts for all his mumbojumbo he believed in it himself but they did not and their very unbelief made him respect and fear them  now that we two are alone he said glancing carelessly around him we two who are gods and know the world wellwe two who see everything in heaven or earththere is no need for concealmentwe may talk as plainly as we will with one another come tell me the truth the new white man has seen you  he has seen me yes certainly the frenchman admitted taking a keen look deep into the savages cunning eyes  does he speak your languagethe language of birds tukilakila asked once more with insinuating cunning i have heard that the sailing gods are of many languages are you and he of one speech or two aliens or countrymen  he speaks my language as he speaks polynesian the frenchman replied keeping his eye firmly fixed on his doubtful guest but it is not his own he has a tongue apartthe tongue of an island not far from my country which we call england  tukilakila drew nearer and dropped his voice to a confidential whisper has he seen the soul of all dead parrots he asked with keen interest in his voice the parrot that knows tukilakilas secret that one over therethe old the very sacred one  m peyron gazed round his aviary carelessly oh that one he answered with a casual glance at methuselah as though one parrot or another were much the same to him yes i think he saw it i pointed it out to him in fact as the oldest and strangest of all my subjects  tukilakilas countenance fell did he hear it speak he asked in evident alarm did it tell him the story of tukilakilas secret  no it didnt speak the frenchman answered it seldom does now it is very old and if it did i dont suppose the king of the rain would have understood one word of it look here great god allay your fears youre a terrible coward i expect the real fact about the parrot is this it is the last of its own race it speaks the language of some tribe of men who once inhabited these islands but are now extinct no human being at present alive most probably knows one word of that forgotten language  you think not tukilakila asked a little relieved  i am the king of the birds and i know the voices of my subjects by heart i assure you it is as i say m peyron answered drawing himself up solemnly  tukilakila looked askance with something very closely approaching a wink in his left eye we two are both gods he said with a tinge of irony in his tone we know what that means i do not feel so certain  he stood close by the parrot with itching fingers it is very very old he went on to himself musingly it cant live long and thennone but boupari men will know the secret  as he spoke he darted a strange glance of hatred toward the unconscious bird the innocent repository as he firmly believed of the secret that doomed him the frenchman had turned his back for a moment now to fetch out a stool tukilakila casting a quick suspicious eye to the right and left took a step nearer the parrot sat mumbling on its perch inarticulately putting its head on one side and blinking its halfblinded eyes in the bright tropical sunshine tukilakila paused irresolute before its face for a second if he only daredone wring of the neckone pinch of his finger and thumb almostand all would be over but he dared not he dared not your savage is overawed by the blind terrors of taboo his predecessor some elder tukilakila of forgotten days had laid a great charm upon that parrots life whoever hurt it was to die an awful death of unspeakable torment the king of the birds had special charge to guard it if even the cannibal god himself wrought it harm who could tell what judgment might fall upon him forthwith what terrible vengeance the dead tukilakila might wreak upon him in his ghostly anger and that dead tukilakila was his own soul his own soul might flare up within him in some mystic way and burn him to ashes  and yetsuppose this hateful newcomer the king of the rain whom he had himself made korong on purpose to get rid of him the more easily and so had elevated into his own worst potential enemysuppose this newcomer the king of the rain were by chance to speak that other dialect of the birdlanguage which the king of the birds himself knew not but which the parrot had learned from his old master the ancient tukilakila of other days and in which the bird still recited the secret of the sacred tree and the death of the great godah then he might still have to fight hard for his divinity he gazed angrily at the bird methuselah blinked and put his head on one side and looked craftily askance at him tukilakila hated it that insolent creature was he not a god and should he be thus bearded in his own island by a mere soul of dead birds a poor wretched parrot but the curse what might not that portend ah well he would risk it glancing around him once more to the right and left to make sure that nobody was looking the cunning savage put forth his hand stealthily and tried with a friendly caress to seize the parrot  in a moment before he had time to know what was happening methuselahsleepy old dotard as he seemedhad woke up at once to a sense of danger turning suddenly round upon the sleek caressing hand he darted his beak with a vicious peck at his assailant and bit the divine finger of the pillar of heaven as carelessly as he would have bitten any child on boupari tukilakila thunderstruck drew back his arm with a start of surprise and a loud cry of pain the bird had wounded him he shook his hand and stamped blood was dropping on the ground from the mangods finger he hardly knew what strange evil this omen of harm might portend for the world the soul of all dead parrots had carried out the curse and had drawn red drops from the sacred veins of tukilakila  one must be a savage ones self and superstitious at that fully to understand the awful significance of this deadly occurrence to draw blood from a god and above all to let that blood fall upon the dust of the ground is the very worst lucktoo awful for the human mind to contemplate  at the same moment the parrot awakened by the unexpected attack threw back its head on its perch and laughing loud and long to itself in its own harsh way began to pour forth a whole volley of oaths in a guttural language of which neither tukilakila nor the frenchman understood one syllable and at the same moment too m peyron himself recalled from the door of his hut by tukilakilas sharp cry of pain and by his liege subjects voluble flow of loud speech and laughter ran up all agog to know what was the matter  tukilakila with an effort tried to hide in his robe his wounded finger but the frenchman caught at the meaning of the whole scene at once and interposed himself hastily between the parrot and its assailant hé my methuselah he cried in french stroking the exultant bird with his hand and smoothing its ruffled feathers did he try to choke you then did he try to get over you that was a brave bird you did well mon ami to bite him no no life of the world and measurer of the suns course he went on in polynesian you shall not go near him keep your distance i beg of you you may be a high godthough you were a scurvy wretch enough dont you recollect when you were only lavita the son of samibut i know your tricks hands off from my birds say i a curse is on the head of the soul of dead parrots you tried to hurt him and see how the curse has worked itself out the blood of the great god the pillar of heaven has stained the gray dust of the island of boupari  tukilakila stood sucking his finger and looking the very picture of the most savage sheepishness     chapter xix  domestic bliss   tukilakila went home that day in a very bad humor the portent of the bitten finger had seriously disturbed him for strange as it sounds to us he really believed himself in his own divinity and the bare thought that the holy soil of earth should be dabbled and wet with the blood of a god gave him no little uneasiness in his own mind on his way homeward besides what would his people think of it if they found it out at all hazards almost he must strive to conceal this episode of the bite from the men of boupari a god who gets wounded and worse still gets wounded in the very act of trying to break a great taboo laid on by himself in a previous incarnationsuch a god undoubtedly lays himself open to the gravest misapprehensions on the part of his worshippers indeed it was not even certain whether his people if they knew would any longer regard him as a god at all the devotion of savages is profound but it is far from personal when deities pass so readily from one body to another you must always keep a sharp lookout lest the great spirit should at any minute have deserted his earthly tabernacle and have taken up his abode in a fresh representative honor the gods by all means but make sure at the same time what particular house they are just then inhabiting  it was the hour of siesta in tukilakilas tent for a short space in the middle of the day during the heat of the sun while fire and water with their embers and their calabash sat on guard in a porch by the bamboo gate tukilakila pillar of heaven and threshold of earth had respite for a while from his daily task of guarding the sacred banyan and could take his ease after his meal in his own quarters while that precious hour of taboo lasted no wandering dragon or spirit of the air could hurt the holy tree and no human assailant dare touch or approach it even the diseasemaking gods who walk in the pestilence could not blight or wither it at all other times tukilakila mounted guard over his tree with a jealousy that fairly astonished felix thurstans soul for felix thurstan only dimly understood as yet how implicitly tukilakilas own life and office were bound up with the inviolability of the banyan he protected  within the hut during that playtime of siesta while the lizards who are also gods ran up and down the wall and puffed their orange throats tukilakila lounged at his ease that afternoon with one of his many wivesa tall and beautiful polynesian woman lithe and supple as is the wont of her race and as exquisitely formed in every limb and feature as a sculptured greek goddess a graceful wreath of crimson hibiscus adorned her shapely head round which her long and glossy black hair was coiled in great rings with artistic profusion a festoon of blue flowers and darkred dracæna leaves hung like a chaplet over her olivebrown neck and swelling bust one breadth of native cloth did duty for an apron or girdle round her waist and hips all else was naked her plump brown arms were set off by the green and crimson of the flowers that decked her tukilakila glanced at his slave with approving eyes he always liked ula she pleased him the best of all his women and she knew his ways too she never contradicted him  among savages guile is womans best protection the wife who knows when to give way with hypocritical obedience and when to coax or wheedle her yielding lord runs the best chance in the end for her life her model is not the oak but the willow she must be able to watch for the rising signs of illhumor in her masters mind and guard against them carefully if she is wise she keeps out of her husbands way when his anger is aroused but soothes and flatters him to the top of his bent when his temper is just slightly or momentarily ruffled  the lord of heaven and earth is ill at ease ula murmured insinuatingly as tukilakila winced once with the pain of his swollen finger what has happened today to the increaser of breadfruit my lord is sad his eye is downcast who has crossed my masters will who has dared to anger him  tukilakila kept the wounded hand wrapped up in a soft leaf like a woolly mullein all the way home he had been obliged to conceal it and disguise the pain he felt lest fire and water should discover his secret for he dared not let his people know that the soul of all dead parrots had bitten his finger and drawn blood from the sacred veins of the mangod but he almost hesitated now whether or not he should confide in ula a god may surely trust his own wedded wives and yetsuch need to be carefulwomen are so treacherous he suspected ula sometimes of being a great deal too fond of that young man toko who used to be one of the temple attendants and whom he had given as shadow accordingly to the king of the rain so as to get rid of him altogether from among the crowd of his followers so he kept his own counsel for the moment and disguised his misfortune i have been to see the king of the birds this morning he said in a grumbling voice and i do not like him that god is too insolent for my part i hate these strangers one and all they have no respect for tukilakila like the men of boupari they are as bad as atheists they fear not the gods and the customs of our fathers are not in them  ula crept nearer with one lithe round arm laid caressingly close to her masters neck then why do you make them korong she asked with feminine curiosity like some wife who seeks to worm out of her husband the secret of freemasonry why do you not cook them and eat them at once as soon as they arrive they are very good foodso white and fine that last newcomer nowthe queen of the cloudswhy not eat her she is plump and tender  i like her tukilakila responded in a gloating tone i like her every way i would have brought her here to my temple and admitted her at once to be one of tukilakilas wivesonly that fire and water would not have permitted me they have too many taboos those awkward gods i do not love them but i make my strangers korong for a very wise reason you women are fools you understand nothing you do not know the mysteries these things are a great deal too high and too deep for you you could not comprehend them but men know well why they are wise they have been initiated much more then do i who am the very high godwho eat human flesh and drink blood like waterwho cause the sun to shine and the fruits to growwithout whom the day in heaven would fade and die out and the foundations of the earth would be shaken like a plantain leaf  ula laid her soft brown hand soothingly on the great gods arm just above the elbow tell me she said leaning forward toward him and looking deep into his eyes with those great speaking gray orbs of hers tell me o sustainer of the equipoise of heaven i know you are great i know you are mighty i know you are holy and wise and cruel but why must you let these sailing gods who come from unknown lands beyond the place where the sun rises or setswhy must you let them so trouble and annoy you why do you not at once eat them up and be done with them is not their flesh sweet is not their blood red are they not a dainty well fit for the banquet of tukilakila  the savage looked at her for a moment and hesitated a very beautiful woman this ula certainly not one of all his wives had larger brown limbs or whiter teeth or a deeper respect for his divine nature he had almost a mindit was only ula why not break the silence enjoined upon gods toward women and explain this matter to her not the great secret itself of coursethe secret on which hung the death and transmigration of tukilakilaoh no not that one the savage was far too cunning in his generation to intrust that final terrible taboo to the ears of a woman but the reason why he made all strangers korong a woman might surely be trusted with thatespecially ula she was so very handsome and she was always so respectful to him  well the fact of it is he answered laying his hand on her neck that plump brown neck of hers under the garland of dracæna leaves and stroking it voluptuously the sailing gods who happen upon this island from time to time are made korongbut hush it is taboo he gazed around the hut suspiciously are all the others away he asked in a frightened tone fire and water would denounce me to all my people if once they found i had told a taboo to a woman and as for you they would take you because you knew it and would pull your flesh from your bones with hot stone pincers  ula rose and looked about her at the door of the tent she nodded thrice then she glided back serpentine and threw herself gracefully in a statuesque pose on the native mat beside him here drink some more kava she cried holding a bowl to his lips and wheedling him with her eyes kava is good it is fit for gods it makes them royally drunk as becomes great deities the spirits of our ancestors dwell in the bowl when you drink of the kava they mount by degrees into your heart and head they inspire brave words they give you thoughts of heaven drink my master drink the ruler of the sun in heaven is thirsty  she lay propped on one elbow with her face close to his and offered him with one brown irresistible hand the intoxicating liquor tukilakila took the bowl and drank a second time for he had drunk of it once with his dinner already it was seldom he allowed himself the luxury of a second draught of that very stupefying native intoxicant for he knew too well the danger of insecurely guarding his sacred tree but on this particular occasion as on so many others in the collective life of humanity the woman tempted him and he acted as she told him he drank it off deep ha ha that is good he cried smacking his lips that is a drink fit for a god no woman can make kava like you ula he toyed with her arms and neck lazily once more you are the queen of my wives he went on in a dreamy voice i like you so well that plump as you are i really believe ula i could never make up my mind to eat you  my lord is very gracious ula made answer in a soft low tone pretending to caress him and for some minutes more she continued to make much of him in the fulsome strain of polynesian flattery  at last the kava had clearly got into tukilakilas head then ula bent forward once more and again attacked him now i know you will tell me she said coaxingly why you make them korong as long as i live i will never speak or hint of it to anybody anywhere and if i dowhy the remedy is near i am your meattake me and eat me  even cannibals are human and at the touch of her soft hand tukilakila gave way slowly i made them korong he answered in rather thick accents because it is less dangerous for me to make them so than to choose for the post from among our own islanders sooner or later my day must come but i can put it off best by making my enemies out of strangers who arrive upon our island and not out of those of my own household all boupari men who have been initiated know the terrible secretthey know where lies the death of tukilakila the strangers who come to us from the sun or the sea do not know it and therefore my life is safest with them so i make them korong whenever i can to prolong my own days and to guard my secret  and the death of tukilakila the woman whispered very low still soothing his arm with her hand and patting his cheek softly from time to time with a gentle caressing motion tell me where does that live who holds it in charge where is tukilakilas great spirit laid by in safety i know it is in the tree but where and in what part of it  tukilakila drew back with a little cry of surprise you know it is in the tree he cried you know my soul is kept there why ula who told you that and you a woman bad medicine indeed some man has been blabbing what he learned in the mysteries if this should reach the ears of the king of the rain he paused mysteriously  what what ula cried seizing his hand in hers and pressing it hard to her bosom in her anxiety and eagerness tell me the secret tell me  with a sudden sharp howl of darting pain tukilakila withdrew his hand she had squeezed the finger the parrot had bitten and blood began once more to flow from it freely  a wild impulse of revenge came over the savage he caught her by the neck with his other hand pressed her throat hard till she was black in the face kicked her several times with ferocious rage and then flung her away from him to the other side of the hut with a fierce and untranslatable native imprecation  ula shaken and hurt darted away toward the door with a face of abject terror for every reason on earth she was intensely alarmed were it merely as a matter of purely earthly fear she had ground enough for fright in having so roused the hasty anger of that powerful and implacable creature he would kill her and eat her with far less compunction than an english farmer would kill and eat one of his own barnyard chickens but besides that it terrified her not a little in more mysterious ways to see the blood of a god falling upon the earth so freely she knew not what awful results to herself and her race might follow from so terrible a desecration  but to her utter astonishment the great god himself mad with rage as he was seemed none the less almost as profoundly frightened and surprised as she herself was what did you do that for he cried now sufficiently recovered for thought and speech wringing his hand with pain and then popping his finger hastily into his mouth to ease it you are a clumsy thing and you want to destroy me too with your foolish clumsiness  he looked at her and scowled he was very angry but the savage woman is nothing if not quickwitted and politic in a flash of intuition ula saw at once he was more frightened than hurt he was afraid of the effect of this strange revelation upon his own reputation for supreme godship with every mark and gesture of deprecatory servility the woman sidled back to his side like a whipped dog for a second she looked down on the floor at the drops of blood then without one word of warning or one instants hesitation she bit her own finger hard till blood flowed from it freely i will show this to fire and water she said holding it up before his eyes all red and bleeding i will say you were angry with me and bit me for a punishment as you often do they will never find out it was the blood of a god have no fear for their eyes let me look at your finger  tukilakila half appeased by her clever quickness held his hand out sulkily like a disobedient child ula examined it close a bite she said shortly a bite from a bird a peck from a parrot  tukilakila jerked out a surly assent yes the soul of all dead parrots he answered with an angry glare it bit me this morning at the king of the birds a vicious brute but no one else saw it  ula put the finger up to her own mouth and sucked the wound gently her medicine stanched it then she took a thin leaf of the paper mulberry soft cool and soothing and bound it round the place with a strip of the lacelike inner bark as deftly as any hospital nurse in london would have done it these savage women are capital hands in sickness tukilakila sat and sulked meanwhile like a disappointed child when ula had finished she nodded her head and glided softly away she knew her chance of learning the secret was gone for the moment and she had too much of the guile of the savage woman to spoil her chances by loitering about unnecessarily while her lord was in his present ungracious humor  as she stole from the hut tukilakila looking ruefully at his wounded hand and then at that light and supple retreating figure muttered sulkily to himself with a very bad grace the woman knows too much she nearly wormed my secret out of me she knows that tukilakilas life and soul are bound up in the tree she knows that i bled and that the parrot bit me if she blabs as women will do mischief may come of it i am a great god a very great godkeen bloodthirsty cruel and i like that woman but it would be wiser and safer perhaps after all to forego my affection and to make a great feast of her  and ula looking back with a smile and a nod and holding up her own bitten and bleeding hand with a farewell shake as if to remind her divine husband of her promise to show it to fire and water murmured low to herself as she went he is a very great god a very great god no doubt but i hate him i hate him he would eat me tomorrow if i didnt coax him and wheedle him and keep him in a good temper you want to be sharp indeed to be the wife of a god i got off today with the skin of my teeth he might have turned and killed me if only i could find out the great taboo i would tell it to the stranger the king of the rain and then perhaps tukilakila would die and the stranger would become tukilakila in turn and i would be one of his wives and toko who is his shadow would return again to the service of tukilakilas temple  but fire as she passed was saying to water we are getting tired in boupari of lavita the son of sami if the luck of the island is not to change it is high time i think we should have a new tukilakila     chapter xx  council of war   that same afternoon muriel had a visitor m jules peyron formerly of the collége de france no longer a mere polynesian god but a french gentleman of the boulevards in voice and manner came to pay his respects as in duty bound to mademoiselle ellis m peyron had performed his toilet under trying circumstances to the best of his ability the remnants of his european clothes much patched and overhung with squares of native tappa cloth were hidden as much as possible by a wide feather cloak very savage in effect but more seemly at any rate than the tattered garments in which felix had first found him in his own garden parterre m peyron however was fully aware of the defects of his costume and profoundly apologetic it is with ten thousand regrets mademoiselle he said many times over bowing low and simpering that i venture to appear in a ladys salonfor after all wherever a european lady goes there her salon follows herin such a tenue as that in which i am now compelled to present myself mais que voulezvous nous ne sommes pas à paris for to m peyron as innocent in his way as mali herself the whole world divided itself into paris and the provinces  nevertheless it was touching to both the newcomers to see the frenchmans delight at meeting once more with civilized beings figure to yourself mademoiselle he said with true french effusionfigure to yourself the joy and surprise with which i this morning receive monsieur your friend at my humble cottage for the first time after nine years on this hateful island i see again a european face i hear again the sound the beautiful sound of that charming french language my emotion believe me was too profound for words when monsieur was gone i retired to my hut i sat down on the floor i gave myself over to tears tears of joy and gratitude to think i should once more catch a glimpse of civilization this afternoon i ask myself can i venture to go out and pay my respects thus attired in these rags to a european lady for a long time i doubt i wonder i hesitate in my quality of frenchman i would have wished to call in civilized costume upon a civilized household but what would you have necessity knows no law i am compelled to envelope myself in my savage robe of office as a polynesian goda robe of office which for the rest is not without an interest of its own for the scientific ethnologist it belongs to me especially as king of the birds and in it in effect is represented at least one feather of each kind or color from every part of the body of every species of bird that inhabits boupari i thus sum up pour ainsi dire in my official costume all the birds of the island as tukilakila the very high god sums up in his quaint and curious dress the land and the sea the trees and the stones earth and air and fire and water  familiarity with danger begets at last a certain callous indifference muriel was surprised in her own mind to discover how easily they could chat with m peyron on such indifferent subjects with that awful doom of an approaching death hanging over them so shortly but the fact was terrors of every kind had so encompassed them round since their arrival on the island that the mere additional certainty of a date and mode of execution was rather a relief to their minds than otherwise it partook of the nature of a reprieve not of a sentence besides this meeting with another speaker of a european tongue seemed to them so full of promise and hope that they almost forgot the terrors of their threatened end in their discussion of possible schemes for escape to freedom even m peyron himself who had spent nine long years of exile in the island felt that the arrival of two new europeans gave him some hope of effecting at last his own retreat from this unendurable position his talk was all of passing steamers if the australasian had come near enough once to sight the island he argued then the homewardbound vessel en route for honolulu must have begun to take a new course considerably to the eastward of the old navigable channel if this were so their obvious plan was to keep a watch day and night for another passing australian liner and whenever one hove in sight to steal away to the shore seize a stray canoe overpower if possible their shadows or give them the slip and make one bold stroke for freedom on the open ocean  none of them could conceal from their own minds to be sure the extreme difficulty of carrying out this programme in the first place it was a tossup whether they ever sighted another steamer at all for during the weeks they had already passed on the island not a sign of one had appeared from any quarter then again even supposing a steamer ever hove in sight what likelihood that they could make out for her in an open canoe in time to attract attention before she had passed the island tukilakila would never willingly let them go their shadows would watch them with unceasing care the whole body of natives would combine together to prevent their departure if they ran away at all they must run for their lives as soon as the islanders discovered they were gone every warcanoe in the place would be manned at once with bloodthirsty savages who would follow on their track with relentless persistence  as for muriel less prepared for such dangerous adventures than the two men she was rather inclined to attach a certain romantic importance as a girl might do to the story of the parrot and the possible disclosures which it could make if it could only communicate with them the mysterious element in the history of that unique bird attracted her fancy the only one of its race now left alive she said with slow reflectiveness like dolly pentreath the last old woman who could speak cornish i wonder how long parrots ever live do you know at all monsieur you are the king of the birdsyou ought to be an authority on their habits and manners  the frenchman smiled a gallant smile unhappily mademoiselle he said though as a medical student i took up to a certain extent biological science in general at the collége de france i never paid any special or peculiar attention in paris to birds in particular but it is the universal opinion of the natives if that counts for much that parrots live to a very great age and this one old parrot of mine whom i call methuselah on account of his advanced years is considered by them all to be a perfect patriarch in effect when the oldest men now living on the island were little boys they tell me that methuselah was already a venerable and muchvenerated parrot he must certainly have outlived all the rest of his race by at least the best part of threequarters of a century for the islanders themselves not infrequently live by unanimous consent to be over a hundred  i remember to have read somewhere felix said turning it over in his mind that when humboldt was travelling in the wilds of south america he found one very old parrot in an indian village which the indians assured him spoke the language of an extinct tribe incomprehensible then by any living person if i recollect aright humboldt believed that particular bird must have lived to be nearly a hundred and fifty  that is so monsieur the frenchman answered i remember the case well and have often recalled it i recollect our professor mentioning it one day in the course of his lectures and i have always mentally coupled that parrot of humboldts with my own old friend and subject methuselah however that only impresses upon one more fully the folly of hoping that we can learn anything worth knowing from him i have heard him recite his story many times over though now he repeats it less frequently than he used formerly to do and i feel convinced it is couched in some unknown and no doubt forgotten language it is a much more guttural and unpleasant tongue than any of the soft dialects now spoken in polynesia it belonged i am convinced to that yet earlier and more savage race which the polynesians must have displaced and as such it is now i feel certain practically irrecoverable  if they were more savage than the polynesians muriel said with a profound sigh im sorry for anybody who fell into their clutches  but what would not many philologists at home in england give felix murmured philosophically for a transcript of the words that parrot can speakperhaps a last relic of the very earliest and most primitive form of human language  at the very moment when these things were passing under the wattled roof of muriels hut it happened that on the taboospace outside toko the shadow stood talking for a moment with ula the fourteenth wife of the great tukilakila  i never see you now toko the beautiful polynesian said leaning almost across the white line of coralsand which she dared not transgress times are dull at the temple since you came to be shadow to the whitefaced stranger  it was for that that tukilakila sent me here the shadow answered with profound conviction he is jealous the great god he is bad he is cruel he wanted to get rid of me so he sent me away to the king of the rain that i might not see you  ula pouted and held up her wounded finger before his eyes coquettishly see what he did to me she said with a mute appeal for sympathythough in that particular matter the truth was not in her your god was angry with me today because i hurt his hand and he clutched me by the throat and almost choked me he has a bad heart see how he bit me and drew blood some of these days i believe he will kill me and eat me  the shadow glanced around him suspiciously with an uneasy air then he whispered low in a voice half grudge half terror if he does he is a great godhe can search all the worldi fear him much but tokos heart is warm let tukilakila look out for vengeance  the woman glanced across at him openeyed with her enticing look if the king of the rain who is korong knew all the secret she murmured slowly he would soon be tukilakila himself and you and i could then meet together freely  the shadow started it was a terrible suggestion you mean to say he cried then fear overcame him and crouching down where he sat he gazed around him terrified who could say that the wind would not report his words to tukilakila  ula laughed at his fears pooh she answered smiling you are a man and yet you are afraid of a little taboo i am a woman and yet if i knew the secret as you do i would break taboo as easily as i would break an eggshell i would tell the whitefaced stranger allif only it would bring you and me together forever  it is a great risk a very great risk the shadow answered trembling tukilakila is a mighty god he may be listening this moment and may pinch us to death by his spirits for our words or burn us to ashes with a flash of his anger  the woman smiled an incredulous smile if you had lived as near tukilakila as i have she answered boldly you would think as little perhaps of his divinity as i do  for even in polynesia superstitious as it is no hero is a god to his wives or his valets     chapter xxi  methuselah gives sign   all the hopes of the three europeans were concentrated now on the bare offchance of a passing steamer m peyron in particular was fully convinced that if the australasian had found the inner channel practicable other ships in future would follow her example with this idea firmly fixed in his head he arranged with felix that one or other of them should keep watch alternately by night as far as possible and he also undertook that a canoe should constantly be in readiness to carry them away to the supposititious ship if occasion arose for it muriel took counsel with mali on the question of rousing the frenchman if a steamer appeared and they were the first to sight it and mali in whom renewed intercourse with white people had restored to some extent the civilized queensland attitude of mind readily enough promised to assist in their scheme provided she was herself taken with them and so relieved from the terrible vengeance which would otherwise overtake her if boupari man catch me she said in her simple graphic polynesian way boupari man kill me and lay me in leaves and cook me very nice and make great feast of me like him do with jani from that untimely end both felix and muriel promised faithfully as far as in them lay to protect her  to communicate with m peyron by daytime without arousing the everwakeful suspicion of the natives felix hit upon an excellent plan he burnished his metal matchbox to the very highest polish it was capable of taking and then heliographed by means of sunflashes on the morse code he had learned the code in fiji in the course of his official duties and he taught the frenchman now readily enough how to read and reply with the other half of the box torn off for the purpose  it was three or four days however before the two english wanderers ventured to return m peyrons visit they didnt wish to attract too greatly the attention of the islanders gradually as their stay on the island went on they learned the truth that tukilakilas eyes as he himself had boasted were literally everywhere for he had spies of his own told off in every direction who dogged the steps of his victims unseen sometimes as felix and muriel walked unsuspecting through the jungle paths closely followed by their shadows a stealthy brown figure crouched low to the ground would cross the road for a moment behind them and disappear again noiselessly into the dense mass of underbrush then mali or toko turning round all hushed with a terrified look would murmur low to themselves or to one another there goes one of the eyes of tukilakila it was only by slow degrees that this system of espionage grew clear to the strangers but as soon as they had learned its reality and ubiquity they felt at once how undesirable it would be for them to excite the terrible mangods jealousy and suspicion by being observed too often in close personal intercourse with their fellowexile and victim the frenchman it was this that made them have recourse to the device of the heliograph  so three or four days passed before muriel dared to approach m peyrons cottage when she did at last go there with felix it was in the early morning before the fierce tropical sun that beat full on the island had begun to exert its midday force and power the path that led there lay through the thick and tangled mass of brushwood which covered the greater part of the island with its dense vegetation it was overhung by huge treeferns and broadleaved southern bushes and abutted at last on the little windswept knoll where the king of the birds had his appropriate dwellingplace the frenchman received them with studied parisian hospitality he had decorated his arbor with fresh flowers for the occasion and bright tropical fruits with their own green leaves did duty for the coffee or the absinthe of his fatherland on his homemade rustic table yet in spite of all the rudeness of the physical surroundings they felt themselves at home again with this one exiled european the faint flavor of civilization pervaded and permeated the frenchmans hut after the unmixed savagery to which they had now been so long accustomed  muriels curiosity however centred most about the mysterious old parrot of whose strange legend so much had been said to her after they had sat for a little under the shade of the spreading banyan to cool down from their walkfor it was an oppressive morningm peyron led her round to his aviary at the back of the hut and introduced her by their native names to all his subjects i am responsible for their lives he said gravely for their welfare for their happiness if i were to let one of them grow old without a successor in the field to follow him up and receive his soulas in the case of my friend methuselah here who was so neglected by my predecessorsthe whole species would die out for want of a spirit and my own life would atone for that of my people there you have the central principle of the theology of boupari every race every element every power of nature is summed up for them in some particular person or thing and on the life of that person or thing depends as they believe the entire health of the species the sequence of events the whole order and succession of natural phenomena  felix approached the mysterious and venerable bird with somewhat incautious fingers it looks very old he said trying to stroke its head and neck with a friendly gesture you do well indeed in calling it methuselah  as he spoke the bird alarmed at the vague consciousness of a hand and voice which it did not recognize and mindful of tukilakilas recent attack made a vicious peck at the fingers outstretched to caress it take care the frenchman cried in a warning voice the patriarchs temper is no longer what it was sixty or seventy years ago he grows old and peevish his humor is soured he will sing no longer the lively little scraps of offenbach i have taught him he does nothing but sit still and mumble now in his own forgotten language and hes dreadfully crossso crabbedmon dieu what a character why the other day as i told you he bit tukilakila himself the high god of the island with a good hard peck when that savage tried to touch him youd have laughed to see his godship sent off bleeding to his hut with a wounded finger i will confess i was by no means sorry at the sight myself i do not love that god nor he me and i was glad when methuselah on whom he is afraid to revenge himself openly gave him a nice smart bite for trying to interfere with him  hes very snappish to be sure felix said with a smile trying once more to push forward one hand to stroke the bird cautiously but methuselah resented all such unauthorized intrusions he was growing too old to put up with strangers he made a second vicious attempt to peck at the hand held out to soothe him and screamed as he did so in the usual discordant and unpleasant voice of an angry or frightened parrot  why felix muriel put in taking him by the arm with a girlish gesturefor even the terrors by which they were surrounded hadnt wholly succeeded in killing out the woman within herhow clumsy you are you dont understand one bit how to manage parrots i had a parrot of my own at my aunts in australia and i know their ways and all about them just let me try him she held out her soft white hand toward the sulky bird with a fearless caressing gesture pretty poll pretty poll she said in english in the conventional tone of address to their kind did the naughty man go and frighten her then was she afraid of his hand did polly want a lump of sugar  on a sudden the bird opened its eyes quickly with an awakened air and looked her back in the face half blindly half quizzingly it preened its wings for a second and crooned with pleasure then it put forward its neck with its head on one side took her dainty finger gently between its beak and tongue bit it for pure love with a soft short pressure and at once allowed her to stroke its back and sides with a very pleased and surprised expression the success of her skill flattered muriel there it knows me she cried with childish delight it understands im a friend it takes to me at once pretty poll pretty poll come poll come and kiss me  the bird drew back at the words and steadied itself for a moment knowingly on its perch then it held up its head gazed around it with a vacant air as if suddenly awakened from a very long sleep and opening its mouth exclaimed in loud clear sharp and distinct tonesand in englishpretty poll pretty poll polly wants a buss polly wants a nice sweet bit of apple  for a moment m peyron couldnt imagine what had happened felix looked at muriel muriel looked at felix the englishman held out both his hands to her in a wild fervor of surprise muriel took them in her own and looked deep into his eyes while tears rose suddenly and dropped down her cheeks one by one unchecked they couldnt say why themselves they didnt know wherefore yet this unexpected echo of their own tongue in the mouth of that strange and mysterious bird thrilled through them instinctively with a strange unearthly tremor in some dim and unexplained way they felt half unconsciously to themselves that this discovery was perhaps the first clue to the solution of the terrible secret whose meshes encompassed them  m peyron looked on in mute astonishment he had heard the bird repeat that strange jargon so often that it had ceased to have even the possibility of a meaning for him it was the way of methuselahjust his language that he talked so harsh so guttural pretty poll pretty poll he had noticed the bird harp upon those quaint words again and again they were part no doubt of that old primitive and forgotten pacific language the creature had learned in other days from some earlier bearer of the name and ghastly honors of tukilakila why should these english seem so profoundly moved by them  mademoiselle doesnt surely understand the barbarous dialect which our methuselah speaks he exclaimed in surprise glancing half suspiciously from one to the other of these incomprehensible britons like most other frenchmen he had been brought up in total ignorance of every european language except his own and the words the parrot pronounced when delivered with the wellknown additions of parrot harshness and parrot volubility seemed to him so inexpressibly barbaric in their clicks and jerks that he hadnt yet arrived at the faintest inkling of the truth as he observed their emotion  felix seized his new friends hand in his and wrung it warmly dont you see what it is he exclaimed half beside himself with this vague hope of some unknown solution dont you realize how the thing stands dont you guess the truth this isnt a polynesian dialect at all its our own mother tongue the bird speaks english  english m peyron replied with incredulous scorn what methuselah speak english oh no monsieur impossible vous vous trompez jen suis sûr i can never believe it those harsh inarticulate sounds to belong to the noble language of shaxper and newtowne ah monsieur incroyable vous vous trompez vous vous trompez  as he spoke the bird put its head on one side once more and looking out of its halfblind old eyes with a crafty glance round the corner at muriel observed again in not very polite english pretty poll pretty poll polly wants some fruit polly wants a nut polly wants to go to bed god save the king to hell with all papists  monsieur felix said a certain solemn feeling of surprise coming over him slowly at this last strange clause it is perfectly true the bird speaks english the bird that knows the secret of which we are all in searchthe bird that can tell us the truth about tukilakilacan tell us in the tongue which mademoiselle and i speak as our native language and what is moreand more strangegather from his tone and the tenor of his remarks he was taught long sincea century ago or moreand by an english sailor  muriel held out a bit of banana on a sharp stick to the bird methuselahpolly took it gingerly off the end like a wellbehaved parrot god save the king muriel said in a quiet voice trying to draw him on to speak a little further  methuselah twisted his eye sideways first this way then that and responded in a very clear tone indeed god save the king confound the duke of york long live dr oates and to hell with all papists     chapter xxii  tantalizing very   they looked at one another again with a wild surmise the voice was as the voice of some long past age could the parrot be speaking to them in the words of seventeenthcentury english  even m peyron who at first had received the strange discovery with incredulity woke up before long to the importance of this sudden and unexpected revelation the tukilakila who had taught methuselah that long poem or sermon which native tradition regarded as containing the central secret of their creed or its mysteries and which the cruel and cunning tukilakila of today believed to be of immense importance to his safetythat tukilakila of other days was in all probability no other than an english sailor cast on these shores perhaps as they themselves had been by the mercy of the waves he had managed to master the language and religion of the savages among whom he found himself thrown he had risen to be the representative of the cannibal god and during long months or years of tedious exile he had beguiled his leisure by imparting to the unconscious ears of a bird the weird secret of his success for the benefit of any others of his own race who might be similarly treated by fortune in future strange and romantic as it all sounded they could hardly doubt now that this was the real explanation of the birds command of english words one problem alone remained to disturb their souls was the bird really in possession of any local secret and mystery at all or was this the whole burden of the message he had brought down across the vast abyss of timegod save the king and to hell with all papists  felix turned to m peyron in a perfect tumult of suspense what he recites is long he said interrogatively with profound interest you have heard him say much more than this at times the words he has just uttered are not those of the sermon or poem you mentioned  m peyron opened his hands expansively before him oh mon dieu no monsieur he answered with effusion you should hear him recite it hes never done it is whole chapterswhole chapters a perfect henriade in parrottalk when once he begins theres no possibility of checking or stopping him on on he goes farewell to the rest he insists on pouring it all forth to the very last sentence gabble gabble gabble chatter chatter chatter pouf pouf pouf boum boum boum he runs ahead eternally in one long discordant singsong monotone the person who taught him must have taken entire months to teach him a phrase at a time paragraph by paragraph it is wonderful a birds memory could hold so much but till now taking it for granted he spoke only some wild south pacific dialect i never paid much attention to methuselahs vagaries  hush hes going to speak muriel cried holding up in alarm one warning finger  and the bird his tonguestrings evidently loosened by the strange recurrence after so many years of those familiar english sounds pretty poll pretty poll opened his mouth again in a loud chuckle of delight and cried with persistent shrillness god save the king a fig for all arrant knaves and roundheads  a creepier feeling than ever came over the two english listeners at those astounding words great heavens felix exclaimed to the unsuspecting frenchman he speaks in the style of the stuarts and the commonwealth  the frenchman started Époque louis quatorze he murmured translating the date mentally into his own more familiar chronology two centuries since oh incredible incredible methuselah is old but not quite so much of a patriarch as that even humboldts parrot could hardly have lived for two hundred years in the wilds of south america  felix regarded the venerable creature with a look of almost superstitious awe facts are facts he answered shortly shutting his mouth with a little snap unless this bird has been deliberately taught historical details in an archaic dictionand a shipwrecked sailor is hardly likely to be antiquarian enough to conceive such an ideahe is undoubtedly a survival from the days of the commonwealth or the restoration and you say he runs on with his tale for an hour at a time good heavens what a thought i wish we could manage to start him now does he begin it often  monsieur the frenchman answered when i came here first though methuselah was already very old and feeble he was not quite a dotard and he used to recite it all every morning regularly that was the hour i suppose at which the master who first taught him this lengthy recitation used originally to impress it upon him in those days his sight and his memory were far more clear than now but by degrees since my arrival he has grown dull and stupid the natives tell me that fifty years ago while he was already old he was still bright and lively and would recite the whole poem whenever anybody presented him with his greatest dainty the claw of a mooracrab nowadays however when he can hardly eat and hardly mumble he is much less persistent and less coherent than formerly to say the truth i have discouraged him in his efforts because his pertinacity annoyed me so now he seldom gets through all his lesson at one bout as he used to do at the beginning the best way to get him on is for me to sing him one of my french songs that seems to excite him or to rouse him to rivalry then he will put his head on one side listen critically for a while smile a superior smile and finally beginjabber jabber jabbertrying to talk me down as if i were a brother parrot  oh do sing now muriel cried with intense persuasion in her voice i do so want to hear it she meant of course the parrots story  but the frenchman bowed and laid his hand on his heart ah mademoiselle he said your wish is almost a royal command and yet do you know it is so long since i have sung except to please myselfmy music is so rusty old pieces you have heardi have no accompaniment no scoremais enfin we are all so far from paris  muriel didnt dare to undeceive him as to her meaning lest he should refuse to sing in real earnest and the chance of learning the parrots secret might slip by them irretrievably oh monsieur she cried fitting herself to his humor at once and speaking as ceremoniously as if she were assisting at a musical party in the avenue victor hugo dont decline i beg of you on those accounts we are both most anxious to hear your song dont disappoint us pray please begin immediately  ah mademoiselle the frenchman said who could resist such an appeal you are altogether too flattering and then in the same cheery voice that felix had heard on the first day he visited the king of birds hut m peyron began in very decent style to pour forth the merry sounds of his rollicking song  quand on conspire     quand sans frayeur  on peut se dire     conspirateur  pour tout le monde     il faut avoir  perruque blonde     et collet noir  he had hardly got as far as the end of the first stanza however when methuselah listening with his ear cocked up most knowingly to the frenchmans song raised his head in opposition and sitting bolt upright on his perch began to scream forth a voluble stream of words in one unbroken flood so fast that muriel could hardly follow them the bird spoke in a thick and very harsh voice and what was more remarkable still with a distinct and extremely peculiar north country accent in the nineteenth year of the reign of his most gracious majesty king charles the second he blurted out viciously with an angry look at the frenchman i nathaniel cross of the borough of sunderland in the county of doorham in england an ablebodied mariner then sailing the south seas in the good bark martyr prince of the port of great grimsby whereof one thomas wells gent under god was master  oh hush hush muriel cried unable to catch the parrots precious words through the emulous echo of the frenchmans music whereof one thomas wells gent under god was mastergo on polly  perruque blonde    et collet noir  the frenchman repeated with a halfoffended voice finishing his stanza  but just as he stopped methuselah stopped too and throwing back his head in the air with a triumphant look stared hard at his vanquished and silenced opponent out of those blinking gray eyes of his i thought id be too much for you he seemed to say wrathfully  whereof one thomas wells gent under god was master muriel suggested again all agog with excitement go on good bird go on pretty polly  but methuselah was evidently put off the scent now by the unseasonable interruption instead of continuing he threw back his head a second time with a triumphant air and laughed aloud boisterously pretty polly he cried pretty polly wants a nut tukilakila maroo pretty poll pretty polly  sing again for heavens sake felix exclaimed in a profoundly agitated mood explaining briefly to the frenchman the full significance of the words methuselah had just begun to utter  the frenchman struck up his tune afresh to give the bird a start but all to no avail methuselah was evidently in no humor for talking just then he listened with a callous uncritical air bringing his white eyelids down slowly and sleepily over his bleared gray eyes then he nodded his head slowly no use the frenchman murmured pursing his lips up gravely the bird wont talk its going off to sleep now methuselah gets visibly older every day monsieur and mademoiselle you are only just in time to catch his last accents     chapter xxiii  a message from the dead   early next morning as felix lay still in his hut dozing and just vaguely conscious of a buzz of a mosquito close to his ear he was aroused by a sudden loud cry outsidea cry that called his native name three times running o king of the rain king of the rain king of the rain awake high time to be up the king of the birds sends you health and greeting  felix rose at once and his shadow rising before him and unbolting the loose wooden fastener of the door went out in haste to see who called beyond the white tabooline of their sacred precincts  a native woman tall lithe and handsome stood there in the full light of morning beckoning a strange glow of hatred gleamed in her large gray eyes her shapely brown bosom heaved and panted heavily big beads glistened moistly on her smooth high brow it was clear she had run all the way in haste she was deeply excited and full of eager anxiety  why what do you want here so early ula the shadow asked in surprisefor it was indeed she how have you slipped away as soon as the sun is risen from the sacred hut of tukilakila  ulas gray eyes flashed angry fire as she answered he has beaten me again she cried in revengeful tones see the weals on my back see my arms and shoulders he has drawn blood from my wounds he is the most hateful of gods i should love to kill him therefore i slipped away from him with the early dawn and came to consult with his enemy the king of the birds because i heard the words that the eyes of tukilakila who pervade the world report to their master the eyes have told him that the king of the rain the queen of the clouds and the king of the birds are plotting together in secret against tukilakila when i heard that i was glad i went to the king of the birds to warn him of his danger and the king of the birds concerned for your safety has sent me in haste to ask his brother gods to go at once to him  in a minute felix was up and had called out mali from the neighboring hut tell missy queenie he cried to come with me to see the manaouioui the manaouioui has sent me for us to come she must make great haste he wants us immediately  with a word and a sign to toko ula glided away stealthily with the catlike tread of the native polynesian woman back to her hated husband  felix went out to the door and heliographed with his bright metal plate turned on the frenchmans hill what is it  in a moment the answer flashed back word by word come quick if you want to hear methuselah is reciting  a few seconds later muriel emerged from her hut and the two europeans closely followed as always by their inseparable shadows took the winding sidepath that led through the jungle by a devious way avoiding the front of tukilakilas temple to the frenchmans cottage  they found m peyron very much excited partly by ulas news of tukilakilas attitude but more still by methuselahs agitated condition the whole night through my dear friends he cried seizing their hands that bird has been chattering chattering chattering oh mon dieu quel oiseau it seems as though the words heard yesterday from mademoiselle had struck some lost chord in the creatures memory but he is also very feeble i can see that well his garrulity is the garrulity of old age in its last flickering moments he mumbles and mutters he chuckles to himself if you dont hear his message now and at once its my solemn conviction you will never hear it  he led them out to the aviary where methuselah in effect was sitting on his perch most tremulous and woebegone his feathers shuddered visibly he could no longer preen himself listen to what he says the frenchman exclaimed in a very serious voice it is your last last chance if the secret is ever to be unravelled at all by methuselahs aid now is without doubt the proper moment to unravel it  muriel put out her hand and stroked the bird gently pretty poll she said soothingly in a sympathetic voice pretty poll poor poll was he ill was he suffering  at the sound of those familiar words unheard so long till yesterday the parrot took her finger in his beak once more and bit it with the tenderness of his kind in their softer moments then he threw back his head with a sort of mechanical twist and screamed out at the top of his voice for the last time on earth his mysterious message  pretty poll pretty poll god save the king confound the duke of york death to all arrant knaves and roundheads  in the nineteenth year of the reign of his most gracious majesty king charles the second i nathaniel cross of the borough of sunderland in the county of doorham in england an ablebodied mariner then sailing the south seas in the good bark martyr prince of the port of great grimsby whereof one thomas wells gent under god was master was by stress of weather wrecked and cast away on the shores of this island called by its gentile inhabitants by the name of boo parry in which wreck as it befell thomas wells gent and his equipment were by divine disposition killed and drowned save and except three mariners whereof i am one who in gods good providence swam safely through an exceeding great flood of waves and landed at last on this island there my two companions owen williams of swansea in the parts of wales and lewis le pickard a french hewgenott refugee were at once by the said gentiles cruelly entreated and after great torture cooked and eaten at the temple of their chief god tookeelakeela but i myself having through gods grace found favor in their eyes was promoted to the post which in their speech is called korong the nature of which this bird my mouthpiece will hereafter to your ears more fully discover  having said so much in a very jerky way methuselah paused and blinked his eyes wearily  what does he say the frenchman began eager to know the truth but felix fearful lest any interruption might break the thread of the birds discourse and cheat them of the sequel held up a warning finger and then laid it on his lips in mute injunction methuselah threw back his head at that and laughed aloud god save the king he cried again in a still feebler way and to hell with all papists  it was strange how they all hung on the words of that unconscious messenger from a dead and gone age who himself knew nothing of the import of the words he was uttering methuselah laughed at their earnestness shook his head once or twice and seemed to think to himself then he remembered afresh the point he had broken off at  more fully discover for seven years have i now lived on this island never having seen or hard christian face or voice and at the end of that time feeling my health feail and being apprehensive lest any of my fellowcountrymen should hereafter suffer the same fate as i have done i began to teach this parrot his message a few words at a time impressing it duly and fully on his memory  larn then o wayfarer that the people of boo parry are most arrant gentiles heathens and carribals and this as i discover is the nature and method of their vile faith they hold that the gods are each and several incarnate in some one particular human being this human being they worship and reverence with all ghostly respect as his incarnation and chiefly above all do they revere the great god tookeelakeela whose representative may the lord in heaven forgive me for the same i myself am at this present speaking having thus for my sins attained to that impious honor  god save the king confound the duke of york to hell with all papists  it is the fashion of this people to hold that their gods must always be strong and lusty for they argue to themselves thus that the continuance of the rain must needs depend upon the vigor and subtlety of its soul the raingod so the continuance and fruitfulness of the trees and plants which yield them food must needs depend upon the health of the treegod and the life of the world and the light of the sun and the wellbeing of all things that in them are must depend upon the strength and cunning of the high god of all tookeelakeela hence they take great care and woorship of their gods surrounding them with many rules which they call taboo and restricting them as to what they shall eat and what drink and wherewithal they shall seemly clothe themselves for they think that if the king of the rain at anything that might cause the colick or like humor or distemper the weather will thereafter be stormy and tempestuous but so long as the king of the rain fares well and retains his health so long will the weather over their island of boo parry be clear and prosperous  furthermore as i have larned from their theologians being myself indeed the greatest of their gods it is evident that they may not let any god die lest that department of nature over which he presideth should wither away and feail as it were with him but reasonably no care that mortal man can exercise will prevent the possibility of their godseeing he is but one of themselvesgrowing old and feeble and dying at last to prevent which calamity these gentile folk have invented as i believe by the aid and device of sathan this horrid and most unnatural practice the mangod must be killed so soon as he showeth in body or mind that his native powers are beginning to feail and it is necessary that he be killed according to their faith in this ensuing fashion  if the mangod were to die slowly by a death in the course of nature the ways of the world might be stopped altogether hence these savages catch the soul of their god as it were ere it grow old and feeble and transfer it betimes by a magic device to a suitable successor and surely they say this suitable successor can be none other than him that is able to take it from him this then is their horrid counsel and devicethat each one of their gods should kill his antecessor in doing thus he taketh the old gods life and soul which thereupon migrates and dwells within him and by this tenuremay heaven be merciful to me a sinnerdo i nathaniel cross of the county of doorham now hold this dignity of tookeelakeela having slain therefor in just quarrel my antecessor in the high godship  as he reached these words methuselah paused and choked in his throat slightly the mere mechanical effort of continuing the speech he had learned by heart two hundred years before and repeated so often since that it had become part of his being was now almost too much for him the frenchman was right they were only just in time a few days later and the secret would have died with the bird that preserved it     chapter xxiv  an unfinished tale   for a minute or two methuselah mumbled inarticulately to himself then to their intense discomfiture he began once more in the nineteenth year of the reign of his most gracious majesty king charles the second i nathaniel cross  oh this will never do felix cried we havent got yet to the secret at all muriel do try to set him right he must waste no breath we cant afford now to let him go all over it  muriel stretched out her hand and soothed the bird gently as before having slain therefore my predecessor in the high godship she suggested in the same singsong voice as the parrots  to her immense relief methuselah took the hint with charming docility  in the high godship he went on mechanically where he had stopped and this here is the manner whereby i obtained it the tookeelakeela from time to time doth generally appoint any castaway stranger that comes to the island to the post of korongthat is to say an annual god or victim for as the year doth renew itself at each change of seasons so do these carribals in their gentilisme believe and hold that the gods of the seasonsto wit the king of the rain the queen of the clouds the lord of green leaves the king of fruits and othersmust needs be sleain and renewed at the diverse solstices now it so happened that i on my arrival in the island was appointed korong and promoted to the post of king of the rain having a native woman assigned me as queen of the clouds with whom i might keep company this woman being after her kind enamored of me and anxious to escape her own fate to be sleain by my side did betray to me that secret which they call in their tongue the great taboo and which had been betrayed to herself in turn by a native man her former lover for the men are instructed in these things in the mysteries when they coom of age but not the women  and the great taboo is this no man can becoom a tookeelakeela unless he first sleay the man in whom the high god is incarnate for the moment but in order that he may sleay him he must also himself be a full korong only those persons who are already gods being capable for the highest post in their hierarchy even as with ourselves none but he that is a deacon may become a priest and none but he that is a priest may be made a bishop for this reason then the tookeelakeela prefers to advance a stranger to the post of korong seeing that such a person will not have been initiated in the mysteries of the island and therefore will not be aware of those sundry steps which must needs be taken of him that would inherit the godship  furthermore even a korong can only obtain the highest rank of tookeelakeela if he order all things according to the forms and ceremonies of the taboo parfectly for these gentiles are very careful of the levitical parts of their religion deriving the same as it seems to me from the polity of the hebrews the fame of whose tabernacle must sure have gone forth through the ends of the woorld and the knowledge of whose temple must have been yet more wide dispersed by solomon his ships when they came into these parts to fetch gold from ophir and the ceremony is that before any man may sleay the arthly tenement of tookeelakeela and inherit his soul which is in very truth as they do think the god himself he must needs fight with the person in whom tookeelakeela doth then dwell and for this reason if the holder of the soul can defend himself in fight then it is clear that his strength is not one whit decayed nor is his vigor feailing nor yet has his assailant been able to take his soul from him but if the korong in open fight do sleay the person in whom tookeelakeela dwells he becometh at once a tookeelakeela himselfthat is to say in their tongue the lord of lords because he hath taken the life of him that preceded him  yet so intricate is the theology and practice of these loathsome savages that not even now have i explained it in full to you o shipwrecked mariner for your aid and protection for a korong though it be a part of his privilege to contend if he will with tookeelakeela for the high godship and princedom of this isle may only do so at certain appointed times places and seasons above all things it is necessary that he should first find out the hidingplace of the soul of tookeelakeela for though the tookeelakeela for the time that is be animated by the god yet for greater security he doth not keep his soul in his own body but being above all things the god of fruitfulness and generation who causes women to bear children and the plant called taro to bring forth its increase he keepeth his soul in the great sacred tree behind his temple which is thus the father of all trees and the chiefest abode of the great god tookeelakeela  nor does tookeelakeelas soul abide equally in every part of this aforesaid tree but in a certain bough of it resembling a mistletoe which hath yellow leaves and being broken off groweth ever green and yellow afresh which is the central mystery of all their sathanic religion for in this very bougheasy to be discerned by the eye among the green leaves of the tree the bird paused and faltered  muriel leaned forward in an agony of excitement among the green leaves of the tree she went on soothing him  her voice seemed to give the parrot a fresh impulse to speak is contained as it were he continued feebly the divine essence itself the soul and life of tookeelakeela whoever then being a full korong breaks this off hath thus possessed himself of the very god in person this however he must do by exceeding stealth for tookeelakeela or rather the man that bears that name being the guardian and defender of the great god walks ever up and down by day and by night in exceeding great cunning armed with a spear and with a hatchet of stone around the root of the tree watching jealously over the branch which is as he believes his own soul and being i therefore being warned of the taboo by the woman that was my consort did craftily near the appointed time for my own death creep out of my hut and my consort having induced one of the wives of tookeelakeela to make him drunken with too much of that intoxicating drink which they do call kava did proceeddid proceeddid proceedin the nineteenth year of the reign of his most gracious majesty king charles the second  muriel bent forward once more in an agony of suspense oh go on good poll she cried go on remember it did proceed to  the single syllable helped methuselahs memory did proceed to stealthily pluck the bough and having shown the same to fire and water the guardians of the taboo did boldly challenge to single combat the bodily tenement of the god with spear and hatchet provided for me in accordance with ancient custom by fire and water in which combat heaven mercifully befriending me against my enemy i did coom out conqueror and was thereupon proclaimed tookeelakeela myself with ceremonies too many and barbarous to mention lest i raise your gorge at them but that which is most important to tell you for your own guidance and safety o mariner is thisthat being the sole and only end i have in imparting this history to so strange a messengerthat after you have by craft plucked the sacred branch and by force of arms overcootn tookeelakeela it is by all means needful whether you will or not that submitting to the hateful and gentile custom of this peopleof this peoplepretty poll pretty poll god savegod save the king death to the nineteenth year of the reign of all arrant knaves and roundheads  he dropped his head on his breast and blinked his white eyelids more feebly than ever his strength was failing him fast the soul of all dead parrots was wearing out m peyron who had stood by all this time not knowing in any way what might be the value of the birds disclosures came forward and stroked poor methuselah with his caressing hand but methuselah was incapable now of any further effort he opened his blind eyes sleepily for the last last time and stared around him with a blank stare at the fading universe god save the king he screamed aloud with a terrible gasp true to his colors still god save the king and to hell with all papists  then he fell off his perch stone dead on the ground they were never to hear the conclusion of that strange quaint message from a forgotten age to our more sceptical century  felix looked at muriel and muriel looked at felix they could hardly contain themselves with awe and surprise the parrots words were so human its speech was so real to them that they felt as though the english tukilakila of two hundred years back had really and truly been speaking to them from that perch it was a human creature indeed that lay dead before them felix raised the warm body from the ground with positive reverence we will bury it decently he said in french turning to m peyron he was a plucky bird indeed and he has carried out his masters intentions nobly  as they spoke a little rustling in the jungle hard by attracted their attention felix turned to look a stealthy brown figure glided away in silence through the tangled brushwood m peyron started we are observed monsieur he said we must look out for squalls it is one of the eyes of tukilakila  let him do his worst felix answered we know his secret now and can protect ourselves against him let us return to the shade monsieur and talk this all over methuselah has indeed given us something today very serious to think about     chapter xxv  tukilakila strikes   and yet when all was said and done knowledge of tukilakilas secret didnt seem to bring felix and muriel much nearer a solution of their own great problems than they had been from the beginning in spite of all methuselah had told them they were as far off as ever from securing their escape or even from the chance of sighting an english steamer  this last was still the main hope and expectation of all three europeans m peyron who was a bit of a mathematician had accurately calculated the time from what felix told him when the australasian would pass again on her next homeward voyage and when that time arrived it was their united intention to watch night and day for the faintest glimmer of her lights or the faintest wreath of her smoke on the far eastern horizon they had ventured to confide their design to all three of their shadows and the shadows attached by the kindness to which they were so little accustomed among their own people had in every case agreed to assist them with the canoe if occasion served them so for a time the two doomed victims subsided into their accustomed calm of mingled hope and despair waiting patiently for the expected arrival of the muchlongedfor australasian  if she took that course once why not a second time and if ever she hove in sight might they not hope after all to signal to her with their rudely constructed heliograph and stop her  as for methuselahs secret there was only one way felix thought in which it could now prove of any use to them when the actual day of their doom drew nigh he might perhaps be tempted to try the fate which nathaniel cross of sunderland had successfully courted that might gain them at least a little respite though even so he hardly knew what good it could do him to be elevated for a while into the chief god of the island it might not even avail him to save muriels life for he did not doubt that when the awful day itself had actually come the natives would do their best to kill her in spite of him unless he anticipated them by fulfilling his own terrible yet merciful promise  week after week went bymonth after month passedand the date when the australasian might reasonably be expected to reappear drew nearer and nearer they waited and trembled at last a few days before the time m peyron had calculated as felix was sitting under the big shady tree in his garden one morning while muriel now worn out with hope deferred lay within her hut alone with mali a sound of tomtoms and beaten palms was heard on the hillpath the natives around fell on their faces or fled it announced the speedy approach of tukilakila  by this time both the castaways had grown comparatively accustomed to that hideous noise and to the hateful presence which it preceded and heralded a dozen temple attendants tripped on either side down the hillpath to guard him clapping their hands in a barbaric measure as they went fire and water in the midst supported and flanked the divine umbrella felix rose from his seat with very little ceremony indeed as the great god crossed the white tabooline of his precincts followed only beyond the limit by fire and water  tukilakila was in his most insolent vein he glanced around with a horrid light of triumph dancing visibly in his eyes it was clear he had come intent upon some grand theatrical coup he meant to take the whitefaced stranger by surprise this time goodmorning o king of the rain he exclaimed in a loud voice and with boisterous familiarity how do you like your outlook now things are getting on things are getting on the end of your rule is drawing very near isnt it before long i must make the seasons change i must make my sun turn i must twist round my sky and then i shall need a new korong instead of you o palefaced one  felix looked back at him without moving a muscle  i am well he answered shortly restraining his anger the year turns round whether you will or not you are right that the sun will soon begin to move southward on its path again but many things may happen to all of us meanwhile i am not afraid of you  as he spoke he drew his knife and opened the blade unostentatiously but firmly if the worst were really coming now sooner than he expected he would at least not forget his promise to muriel  tukilakila smiled a hateful and ominous smile i am a great god he said calmly striking an attitude as was his wont hear how my people clap their hands in my honor i order all things i dispose the course of nature in heaven and earth if i look at a cocoanut tree it dies if i glance at a breadfruit it withers away we will see before long whether or not you are afraid of me meanwhile o korong i have come to claim my dues at your hands prepare for your fate tomorrow the queen of the clouds must be sealed my bride fetch her out that i may speak with her i have come to tell her so  it was a thunderbolt from a clear sky and it fell with terrible effect on felix for a moment the knife trembled in his grasp with an almost irresistible impulse he could hardly restrain himself as he heard those horrible incredible words and saw the loathsome smirk on the speakers face by which they were accompanied from leaping then and there at the savages throat and plunging his blade to the haft into the vile creatures body but by a violent effort he mastered his indignation and wrath for the present planting himself full in front of tukilakila and blocking the way to the door of that sacred english girls hutoh how horrible it was to him even to think of her purity being contaminated by the vile neighborhood for one minute of that loathsome monster he looked full into the wretchs face and answered very distinctly in low slow tones if you dare to take one step toward the place where that lady now rests if you dare to move your foot one inch nearer if you dare to ask to see her face again i will plunge the knife hiltdeep into your vile heart and kill you where you stand without one seconds deliberation now you hear my words and you know what i mean my weapon is keener and fiercer than any you polynesians ever saw repeat those words once more and by all thats true and holy before theyre out of your mouth i leap upon you and stab you  tukilakila drew back in sudden surprise he was unaccustomed to be so bearded in his own sacred island well i shall claim her tomorrow he faltered out taken aback by felixs unexpected energy he paused for a second then he went on more slowly tomorrow i will come with all my people to claim my bride this afternoon they will bring her mats of grass and necklets of nautilus shell to deck her for her wedding as becomes tukilakilas chosen one the young maids of boupari will adorn her for her lord in the accustomed dress of tukilakilas wives they will clap their hands they will sing the marriage song then early in the morning i will come to fetch herand woe to him who strives to prevent me  felix looked at him long with a fixed and dogged look  what has made you think of this devilry he asked at last still grasping his knife hard and half undecided whether or not to use it you have invented all these ideas you have no claim even in the horrid customs of your savage country to demand such a sacrifice  tukilakila laughed loud a laugh of triumphant and discordant merriment ha ha he cried you do not understand our customs and will you teach me the very high god the guardian of the laws and practices of boupari you know nothing you are as a little child i am absolute wisdom with every korong this is always our rule till the moon is full on the last month before we offer up the sacrifice the queen of the clouds dwells apart with her shadow in her own new temple so our fathers decreed it but at the full of the moon when the day has come the usage is that tukilakila the very high god confers upon her the honor of making her his bride it is a mighty honor the feast is great blood flows like water for seven days and nights then she lives with tukilakila in his sacred abode the threshold of heaven she eats of human flesh she tastes human blood she drinks abundantly of the divine kava at the end of that time in accordance with the custom of our fathers those great dead gods tukilakila performs the high act of sacrifice he puts on his mask of the face of a shark for he is holy and cruel he brings forth the queen of the clouds before the eyes of all his people attired in her wedding robes and made drunk with kava then he gashes her with knives he offers her up to heaven that accepted her and the king of the rain he offers after her and all the people eat of their flesh korong and drink of their blood so that the body of gods and goddesses may dwell within all of them and when all is done the high god chooses a new king and queen at his will for he is a mighty god who rule for six moons more and then are offered up at the end in like fashion  as he spoke the ferocious light that gleamed in the savages eye made felix positively mad with anger but he answered nothing directly is this so he asked turning for confirmation to fire and water is it the custom of boupari that tukilakila should wed the queen of the clouds seven days before the date appointed for her sacrifice  the king of fire and the king of water tried guardians of the etiquette of tukilakilas court made answer at once with one accord it is so o king of the rain your lips have said it tukilakila speaks the solemn truth he is a very great god such is the custom of boupari  tukilakila laughed his triumph in harsh savage outbursts  but felix drew back for a second irresolute at last he stood face to face with the absolute need for immediate action now was almost the moment when he must redeem his terrible promise to muriel and yet even so there was still one chance of life one respite left the mystic yellow bough on the sacred banyan the great taboo the wager of battle with tukilakila quick as lightning it all came up in his excited brain time after time since he heard methuselahs strange message from the grave had he passed tukilakilas temple enclosure and looked up with vague awe at that sacred parasite that grew so conspicuously in a fork of the branches it was easy to secure it if no man guarded there still remained one night in that one short night he must do his bestand worst if all then failed he must die himself with muriel  for two seconds he hesitated it was hateful even to temporize with so hideous a proposition but for muriels sake for her dear lifes sake he must meet these savages with guile for guile if it be indeed the custom of boupari he answered back with pale and trembling lips and if i one man am powerless to prevent it i will give your message myself to the queen of the clouds and you may send as you say your wedding decorations but come what willmark thisyou shall not see her yourself today you shall not speak to her there i draw a lineso with my stick in the dust if you try to advance one step beyond i stab you to the heart wait till tomorrow to take your prey give me one more night great god as you are if you are wise you will not drive an angry man to utter desperation  tukilakila looked with a suspicious side glance at the gleaming steel blade felix still fingered tremulously though boupari was one of those rare and isolated small islands unvisited as yet by european trade he had nevertheless heard enough of the sailing gods to know that their skill was deep and their weapons very dangerous it would be foolish to provoke this man to wrath too soon tomorrow when taboo was removed and all was free license he would come when he willed and take his bride backed up by the full force of his assembled people meanwhile why provoke a brother god too far after all in a little more than a week from now the palefaced korong would be eaten and digested  very well he said sulkily but still with the sullen light of revenge gleaming bright in his eye take my message to the queen you may be my herald tell her what honor is in store for herto be first the wife and then the meat of tukilakila she is a very fair woman i like her well i have longed for her for months tomorrow at the early dawn by the break of day i will come with all my people and take her home by main force to me  he looked at felix and scowled an angry scowl of revenge then as he turned and walked away under cover of the great umbrella with its dangling pendants on either side the temple attendants clapped their hands in unison fire and water marched slow and held the umbrella over him as he disappeared in the distance and the sound of his tomtoms grew dim on the hills toko the shadow who had lain flat trembling on his face in the hut while the god was speaking came out and looked anxiously and fearfully after him  the time is ripe he said in a very low voice to felix a korong may strike all the people of boupari murmur among themselves they say this fellow has held the spirit of tukilakila within himself too long he waxes insolent they think it is high time the great god of heaven should find before long some other fleshly tabernacle     chapter xxvi  a rash resolve   the rest of that day was a time of profound and intense anxiety felix and muriel remained alone in their huts absorbed in plans of escape but messengers of many sorts from chiefs and gods kept continually coming to them the natives evidently regarded it as a period of preparation the eyes of tukilakila surrounded their precinct yet felix couldnt help noticing that they seemed in many ways less watchful than of old and that they whispered and conferred very much in a mysterious fashion with the people of the village more than once toko shook his head sagely if only any one dared break the great taboo he said with some terror on his face our people would be glad it would greatly please them they are tired of this tukilakila he has held the god in his breast far far too long they would willingly see some other in place of him  before noon the young girls of the village bringing native mats and huge strings of nautilus shells trooped up to the hut like bridesmaids with flowers in their hands to deck muriel for her approaching wedding before them they carried quantities of red and brown tappacloth and very fine network the dowry to be presented by the royal bride to her divine husband within the hut they decked out the queen of the clouds with garlands of flowers and necklets of shells in solemn native fashion bewailing her fate all the time to a measured dirge in their own language muriel could see that their sympathy though partly conventional was largely real as well many of the young girls seized her hand convulsively from time to time and kissed it with genuine feeling the gentle young english woman had won their savage hearts by her purity and innocence poor thing poor thing they said stroking her hand tenderly she is too good for korong too good for tukilakila if only we knew the great taboo like the men we would tell her everything she is too good to die we are sorry she is to be sacrificed  but when all their preparations were finished the chief among them raised a calabash with a little scented oil in it and poured a few drops solemnly on muriels head oh great god she said in her own tongue we offer this sacrifice a goddess herself to you we obey your words you are very holy we will each of us eat a portion of her flesh at your feast so give us good crops strong health many children  what does she say muriel asked pale and awestruck of mali  mali translated the words with perfect sangfroid at that awful sound muriel drew back chill and cold to the marrow how inconceivable was the state of mind of these terrible people they were really sorry for her they kissed her hand with fervor and yet they deliberately and solemnly proposed to eat her  toward evening the young girls at last retired in regular order to the clapping of hands and felix was left alone with muriel and the shadows  already he had explained to muriel what he intended to do and muriel half dazed with terror and paralyzed by these awful preparations consented passively but how if you never come back felix she cried at last clinging to him passionately  felix looked at her with a fixed look i have thought of that he said m peyron to whom i sent a message by flashes has helped me in my difficulty this bowl has poison in it peyron sent it to me today he prepared it himself from the root of the kava bean if by sunrise tomorrow you have heard no news drink it off at once it will instantly kill you you shall not fall alive into that creatures clutches  by slow degrees the evening wore on and night approachedthe last night that remained to them felix had decided to make his attempt about one in the morning the moon was nearly full now and there would be plenty of light supposing he succeeded if they gained nothing else they would gain at least a day or twos respite  as dusk set in and they sat by the door of the hut they were all surprised to see ula approach the precinct stealthily through the jungle accompanied by two of tukilakilas eyes yet apparently on some strange and friendly message she beckoned imperiously with one finger to toko to cross the line the shadow rose and without one word of explanation went out to speak to her the woman gave her message in short sharp sentences we have found out all she said breathing hard fire and water have learned it but tukilakila himself knows nothing we have found out that the king of the rain has discovered the secret of the great taboo he heard it from the soul of all dead parrots tukilakilas eyes saw and learned and understood but they said nothing to tukilakila for my counsel was wise i planned that they should not with fire and water fire and water and all the people of boupari think with me the time has come that there should arise among us a new tukilakila this one let his blood fall out upon the dust of the ground his luck has gone we have need of another  then for what have you come toko asked all awestruck it was terrible to him for a woman to meddle in such high matters  i have come ula answered laying her hand on his arm and holding her face close to his with profound solemnityi have come to say to the king of the rain whatever you do that do quickly tonight i will engage to keep tukilakila in his temple he shall see nothing he shall hear nothing i know not the great taboo but i know from him this muchthat if by wile or guile i keep him alone in his temple tonight the king of the rain may fight with him in single combat and if the king of the rain conquers in the battle he becomes himself the home of the great deity  she nodded thrice with her hands on her forehead and withdrew as stealthily as she had come through the jungle the eyes of tukilakila falling into line remained behind and kept watch upon the huts with the closest apparent scrutiny  more than ever they were hemmed in by mystery on mystery  the shadow went back and reported to felix felix turning it over in his own mind wondered and debated was this true or a trap to lure him to destruction  as the night wore on and the hour drew nigh muriel sat beside her friend and lover in blank despair and agony how could she ever allow him to leave her now how could she venture to remain alone with mali in her hut in this last extremity it was awful to be so girt with mysterious enemies i must go with you felix i must go too she cried over and over again i darent remain behind with all these awful men and then if he kills either of us he will kill us at least both together  but felix knew he might do nothing of the sort a more terrible chance was still in reserve he might spare muriel and against that awful possibility he felt it his duty now to guard at all hazard  no muriel he said kissing her and holding her pale hand i must go alone you cant come with me if i return we will have gained at least a respite till the australasian may turn up if i dont you will at any rate have strength of mind left to swallow the poison before tukilakila comes to claim you  hour after hour passed by slowly and felix and the shadow watched the stars at the door to know when the hour for the attempt had arrived the eyes of tukilakila peering silent from just beyond the line saw them watching all the time but gave no sign or token of disapproval with heads bent low and tangled hair about their faces they stood like statues watching watching sullenly were they only waiting till he moved felix wondered and would they then hasten off by short routes through the jungle to warn their master of the impending conflict  at last the hour came when felix felt sure there was the greatest chance of tukilakila sleeping soundly in his hut and forgetting the defence of the sacred bough on the holy banyantree he rose from his seat with a gesture for silence and moved forward to muriel the poor girl flung herself all tears into his arms oh felix felix she cried redeem your promise now kill us both here together and then at least i shall never be separated from you it wouldnt be wrong it cant be wrong we would surely be forgiven if we did it only to escape falling into the hands of these terrible savages  felix clasped her to his bosom with a faltering heart no muriel he said slowly not yet not yet i must leave no opening on earth untried by which i can possibly or conceivably save you its as hard for me to leave you here alone as for you to be left but for your own dear sake i must steel myself i must do it  he kissed her many times over he wiped away her tears then with a gentle movement he untwined her clasping arms you must let me go my own darling he said you must let me go without crossing the border if you pass beyond the tabooline tonight heaven only knows what perhaps may happen to you we must give these people no handle of offence goodnight muriel my own hearts wife and if i never come back then goodby forever  she clung to his arm still he disentangled himself gently the shadow rose at the same moment and followed in silence to the open door muriel rushed after them wildly oh felix felix come back she cried bursting into wild floods of hot fierce tears come back and let me die with you let me die let me die with you  felix crossed the white line without one word of reply and went forth into the night half unmanned by this effort muriel sank where she stood into malis arms the girl caught her and supported her but before she had fainted quite away muriel had time vaguely to see and note one significant fact the eyes of tukilakila who stood watching the huts with lynxlike care nodded twice to toko the shadow as he passed between them then they stealthily turned and dogged the two mens footsteps afar off in the jungle  muriel was left by herself in the hut face to face with mali  let us pray mali she cried seizing her shadows arm  and mali moved suddenly by some halfobliterated impulse exclaimed in concert in a terrified voice let us pray to methodist god in heaven  for her life too hung on the issue of that rash endeavor     chapter xxvii  a strange ally   in tukilakilas templehut meanwhile the jealous revengeful god enshrined among his skeletons was having in his turn an anxious and doubtful time of it ever since his sacred blood had stained the dust of earth by the frenchmans cottage and in his own temple tukilakila for all his bluster had been deeply stirred and terrified in his inmost soul by that unlucky portent a savage even if he be a god is always superstitious could it be that his own time was indeed drawing nigh that he who had remorselessly killed and eaten so many hundreds of human victims was himself to fall a prey to some more successful competitor had the whitefaced stranger the king of the rain really learned the secrets of the great taboo from the soul of all dead parrots did that mysterious bird speak the tongue of these new firebearing korongs whose doom was fixed for the approaching solstice tukilakila wondered and doubted his suspicions were keen and deeply aroused late that night he still lurked by the sacred banyantree and when at last he retired to his own inner temple white with the grinning skulls of the victims he had devoured it was with strict injunctions to fire and water and to his eyes that watched there to bring him word at once of any projected aggression on the part of the stranger  within the templehut however ula awaited him that was a pleasant change the beautiful supple satinskinned polynesian looked more beautiful and more treacherous than ever that fateful evening her great brown limbs smooth and glossy as pearl were set off by a narrow girdle or waistband of green and scarlet leaves twined spirally around her armlets of nautilus shell threw up the dainty plumpness of her soft round forearm a garland hung festooned across one shapely shoulder her bosom was bare or but half hidden by the crimson hibiscus that nestled voluptuously upon it as tukilakila entered she lifted her large eyes and smiling showed two even rows of pearly white teeth my master has come she cried holding up both lissome arms with a gesture to welcome him the great god relaxes his care of the world for a while all goes on well he leaves his sun to sleep and his stars to shine and he retires to rest on the unworthy bosom of her his mate his meat that is honored to love him  tukilakila was scarcely just then in a mood for dalliance the queen of the clouds comes hither tomorrow he answered casting a somewhat contemptuous glance at ulas more dusky and solid charms i go to seek her with the wedding gifts early in the morning for a week she shall be mine and after that he lifted his tomahawk and brought it down on a huge block of wood significantly  ula smiled once more that deep treacherous smile of hers and showed her white teeth even deeper than ever if my lord the great god rises so early tomorrow she said sidling up toward him voluptuously to seek one more bride for his sacred temple all the more reason he should take his rest and sleep soundly tonight is he not a god are not his limbs tired does he not need divine silence and slumber  tukilakila pouted i could sleep more soundly he said with a snort if i knew what my enemy the korong is doing i have set my eyes to watch him yet i do not feel secure they are not to be trusted i shall be happier far when i have killed and eaten him he passed his hand across his bosom with a reflective air you have a great sense of security toward your enemy no doubt when you know that he slumbers well digested within you  ula raised herself on her elbow and gazed snakelike into his face my lords eyes are everywhere she said reverently with every mark of respect he sees and knows all things who can hide anything on earth from his face even when he is asleep his eyes watch well for him then why should the great god the measurer of heaven and earth the king of men fear a whitefaced stranger tomorrow the queen of the clouds will be yours and the stranger will be abased ha ha he will grieve at it tonight fire and water keep guard and watch over you whoever would hurt you must pass through fire and water before he reach your door fire would burn water would drown this is a great taboo no stranger dare face it  tukilakila lifted himself up in his thrasonic mood if he did he cried swelling himself i would shrivel him to ashes with one flash of my eyes i would scorch him to a cinder with one stroke of my lightning  ula smiled again a wellsatisfied smile she was working her man up tukilakila is great she repeated slowly all earth obeys him all heaven fears him  the savage took her hand with a doubtful air and yet he said toying with it half irresolute when i went to the whitefaced strangers hut this morning he did not speak fair he answered me insolently his words were bold he talked to me as one talks to a man not to a great god ula i wonder if he knows my secret  ula started back in wellaffected horror a whitefaced stranger from the sun know your secret o great king she cried hiding her face in a square of cloth see me beat my breast impossible impossible no one of your subjects would dare to tell him so great a taboo it would be rank blasphemy if they did your anger would utterly consume them  that is true tukilakila said practically but i might not discover it i am a very great god my eyes are everywhere no corner of the world is hid from my gaze all the concerns of heaven and earth are my care and therefore sometimes i overlook some detail  no man alive would dare to tell the great taboo ula repeated confidently why even i myself who am the most favored of your wives and who am permitted to bask in the light of your presenceeven i ulai do not know it how much less then the spirit from the sun the sailing god the whitefaced stranger  tukilakila pursed up his brow and looked preternaturally wise as the savage loves to do but the parrot he cried the soul of all dead parrots he knew the secret they sayi taught it him myself in an ancient day many many years agowhen no man now living was born save only iin another incarnationand he may have told it for the strangers they say speak the language of birds and in the language of birds did i tell the great taboo to him  ula poohpoohed the mighty mangods fears no no she cried with confidence he can never have told them if he had would not your eyes that watch ever for all that happens on heaven or earth have straightway reported it to you the parrot died without yielding up the tale were it otherwise toko who loves and worships you would surely have told me  the mangod puckered his brows slightly as if he liked not the security well somehow ula he said feeling her soft brown arms with his divine hand slowly i have always had my doubts since that day the soul of all dead parrots bit me a vicious bird what did he mean by his bite he lowered his voice and looked at her fixedly did not his spilling my blood portend he asked with a shudder of fear that through that illomened bird i who was once lavita should cease to be tukilakila  ula smiled contentedly again to say the truth that was precisely the interpretation she herself had put on that terrific omen the parrot had spilled tukilakilas sacred blood upon the soil of earth according to her simple natural philosophy that was a certain sign that through the parrots instrumentality tukilakilas life would be forfeited to the great eternal earthspirit or rather the earthspirit would claim the blood of the man lavita in whose body it dwelt and would itself migrate to some new earthly tabernacle  but for all that she dissembled great god she cried smiling a benign smile you are tired you are thirsty care for heaven and earth has wearied you out you feel the fatigue of upholding the sun in heaven your arms must ache your thews must give under you drink of the soulinspiring juice of the kava my hands have prepared the divine cup for tukilakila did i make itfresh pure invigorating  she held the bowl to his lips with an enticing smile tukilakila hesitated and glanced around him suspiciously what if the whitefaced stranger should come tonight he whispered hoarsely he may have discovered the great taboo after all who can tell the ways of the world how they come about my people are so treacherous some traitor may have betrayed it to him  impossible the beautiful snakelike woman answered with a strong gesture of natural dissent and even if he came would not kava the divine inspiriting drink of the gods in which dwell the embodied souls of our fatherswould not kava make you more vigorous strong for the fight would it not course through your limbs like fire would it not pour into your soul the divine abiding strength of your mighty mother the eternal earthspirit  a little tukilakila said yielding but not too much too much would stupefy me when the spirits that the kavatree sucks up from the earth are too strong within us they overpower our own strength so that even i the high godeven i can do nothing  ula held the bowl to his lips and enticed him to drink with her beautiful eyes a deep draught o supporter of the sun in heaven she cried pressing his arm tenderly am i not ula did i not brew it for you am i not the chief and most favored among your women i will sit at the door i will watch all night i will not close an eye not a footfall on the ground but my ear shall hear it  do tukilakila said laconically i fear fire and water those gods love me not fain would they make me migrate into some other body but i myself like it not this one suits me admirably ula that kava is stronger than you are used to make it  no no ula cried pressing it to his lips a second time passionately you are a very great god you are tired it overcomes you and if you sleep i will watch fire and water dare not disobey your commands are you not great your eyes are everywhere and i even i will be as one of them  the savage gulped down a few more mouthfuls of the intoxicating liquid then he glanced up again suddenly with a quick suspicious look the cunning of his race gave him wisdom in spite of the deadly strength of the kava ula had brewed too deep for him with a sudden resolve he rose and staggered out you are a serpent woman he cried angrily seeing the smile that lurked upon ulas face tomorrow i will kill you i will take the white woman for my bride and she and i will feast off your carrion body you have tried to betray me but you are not cunning enough not strong enough no woman shall kill me i am a very great god i will not yield i will wait by the tree this is a trap you have set but i do not fall into it if the king of the rain comes i shall be there to meet him  he seized his spear and hatchet and walked forth erect without one sign of drunkenness ula trembled to herself as she saw him go she was playing a deep game had she given him only just enough kava to strengthen and inspire him     chapter xxviii  wager of battle   felix wound his way painfully through the deep fernbrake of the jungle by no regular path so as to avoid exciting the alarm of the natives and to take tukilakilas palacetemple from the rear where the big tree which overshadowed it with its drooping branches was most easily approachable as he and toko crept on bending low through that dense tropical scrub in deathly silence they were aware all the time of a low crackling sound that rang ever some paces in the rear on their trail through the forest it was tukilakilas eyes following them stealthily from afar footstep for footstep through the dense undergrowth of bush and the crisp fallen leaves and twigs that snapped light beneath their footfall what hope of success with those watchful spies keen as beagles and cruel as bloodhounds following ever on their track what chance of escape for felix and muriel with the cannibal mangods toils laid round on every side to insure their destruction  silently and cautiously the two men groped their way on through the dark gloom of the woods in spite of their mute pursuers the moonlight flickered down athwart the trackless soil as they went the hum of insects innumerable droned deep along the underbrush now and then the startled scream of a night jar broke the monotony of the buzz that was worse than silence owls boomed from the hollow trees and fireflies darted dim through the open spaces at last they emerged upon the cleared area of the temple there felix without one moments hesitation with a firm and resolute tread stepped over the white coral line that marked the taboo of the great gods precincts that was a declaration of open war he had crossed the rubicon of tukilakilas empire toko stood trembling on the far side none might pass that mystic line unbidden and live save the korong alone who could succeed in breaking off the bough with yellow leaves resembling a mistletoe of which methuselah the parrot had told felix and muriel and so earn the right to fight for his life with the redoubted and redoubtable tukilakila  as he stepped over the tabooline felix was aware of many native eyes fixed stonily upon him from the surrounding precinct clearly they were awaiting him yet not a soul gave the alarm that in itself would have been to break taboo every man or woman among the temple attendants within that charmed circle stood on gaze curiously close by ula the favorite wife of the mangod crouched low by the hut with one finger on her treacherous lips bending eagerly forward in silent expectation of what next might happen once and once only she glanced at toko with a mute sign of triumph then she fixed her big eyes on felix in tremulous anxiety for to her as to him life and death now hung absolutely on the issue of his enterprise a little farther back the king of fire and the king of water in full sacrificial robes stood smiling sardonically for them it was merely a question of one master more or less one tukilakila in place of another they had no special interest in the upshot of the contest save in so far as they always hated most the man who for the moment held by his own strong arm the superior godship over them around tukilakilas eyes kept watch and ward in sinister silence taboo was stronger than even the commands of the high god himself when once a korong had crossed that fatal line unbidden and unwelcomed by tukilakila he came as tukilakilas foe and wouldbe successor the duty of every guardian of the temple was then to see fair play between the god that was and the god that might bethe tukilakila of the hour and the tukilakila who might possibly supplant him  let the great spirit itself choose which body it will inhabit the king of fire murmured in a soft low voice glancing toward a dark spot at the foot of the big tree the moonlight fell dim through the branches on the place where he looked the glibbering bones of dead victims rattled lightly in the wind felixs eyes followed the king of fires and saw lying asleep upon the ground tukilakila himself with his spear and tomahawk  he lay there huddled up by the very roots of the tree breathing deep and regularly right over his head projected the branch in one part of whose boughs grew the fateful parasite by the dim light of the moon straggling through the dense foliage felix could see its yellow leaves distinctly beneath it hung a skeleton suspended by invisible cords head downward from the branches it was the skeleton of a previous korong who had tried in vain to reach the bough and perished tukilakila had made high feast on the victims flesh his bones now collected together and cunningly fastened with native rope served at once as a warning and as a trap or pitfall for all who might rashly venture to follow him  felix stood for one moment alone and awestruck a solitary civilized man among those hideous surroundings above the cold moon all about the grim stolid halfhostile natives close by that strange serpentine savage wife guarding catlike the sleep of her cannibal husband behind the watchful eyes of tukilakila waiting ever in the background ready to raise a loud shout of alarm and warning the moment the fatal branch was actually broken but mute by their vows till that moment was accomplished then a sudden wild impulse urged him on to the attempt the banyan had dropped down rooting offsets to the ground after the fashion of its kind from its main branches felix seized one of these and swung himself lightly up till he reached the very limb on which the sacred parasite itself was growing  to get to the parasite however he must pass directly above tukilakilas head and over the point where that ghastly grinning skeleton was suspended as by an unseen hair from the fork that bore it  he walked along balancing himself and clutching as he went at the neighboring boughs while tukilakila overcome with the kava slept stolidly and heavily on beneath him at last he was almost within grasp of the parasite could he lunge out and clutch it one tryone effort no no he almost lost footing and fell over in the attempt he couldnt keep his balance so he must try farther on come what might he must go past the skeleton  the grisly mass swung again clanking its bones as it swung and groaned in the wind ominously the breeze whistled audibly through its hollow skull and vacant eyesockets tukilakila turned uneasily in his sleep below felix saw there was not one instant of time to be lost now he passed on boldly and as he passed a dozen thin cords of paper mulberry stretched every way in an invisible network among the boughs too small to be seen in the dim moonlight caught him with their toils and almost overthrew him they broke with his weight and felix himself tumbling blindly fell forward at the cost of a sprained wrist and a great jerk on his bruised fingers he caught at a bough by his side but wrenched it away suddenly it was touch and go at the very same moment the skeleton fell heavily and rattled on the ground beside tukilakila  before felix could discover what had actually happened a very great shout went up all round below and made him stagger with excitement tukilakila was awake and had started up all intent mad with wrath and kava glaring about him wildly and brandishing his great spear in his stalwart hands he screamed aloud in a perfect frenzy of passion and despair where is he the korong bring him on my meat let me devour his heart let me tear him to pieces let me drink of his blood let me kill him and eat him  sick and desperate at the accident felix in turn clinging hard to his bough with one hand gazed wildly about him to look for the parasite but it had gone as if by magic he glanced around in despair vaguely conscious that nothing was left for it now but to drop to the ground and let himself be killed at leisure by that frantic savage yet even as he did so he was aware of that great crya cry as of triumphstill rending the air fire and water had rushed forward and were holding back tukilakila now black in the face from rage with all their might ula was smiling a malicious joy the eyes were all agog with interest and excitement and from one and all that wild scream rose unanimous to the startled sky he has it he has it the soul of the tree the spirit of the world the great gods abode hold off your hands lavita son of sami your trial has come he has it he has it  felix looked about him with a whirling brain his eye fell suddenly there in his own hand lay the fateful bough in his efforts to steady himself he had clutched at it by pure accident and broken it off unawares with the force of his clutching as fortune would have it he grasped it still his senses reeled he was almost dead with excitement suspense and uncertainty mingled with pain of his wrenched wrist but for muriels sake he pulled himself together gazing down and trying hard to take it all inthat strange savage scenehe saw that tukilakila was making frantic attempts to lunge at him with the spear while the king of fire and the king of water stern and relentless were holding him off by main force and striving their best to appease and quiet him  there was an awful pause then a voice broke the stillness from beyond the tabooline  the shadow of the king of the rain speaks it said in very solemn conventional accents korong korong the great taboo is broken fire and water hold him in whom dwells the god till my master comes he has the soul of all the spirits of the wood in his hands he will fight for his right taboo taboo i toko have said it  he clapped his hands thrice  tukilakila made a wild effort to break away once more but the king of fire standing opposite him spoke still louder and clearer if you touch the korong before the line is drawn he said with a voice of authority you are no tukilakila but an outcast and a criminal all the people will hold you with forked sticks while the korong burns you alive slowly limb by limb with me who am fire the fierce the consuming i will scorch you and bake you till you are as a bamboo in the flame taboo taboo taboo i fire have said it  the king of water with three attendants forced tukilakila on one side for a moment ula stood by and smiled pleased compliance a temple slave trembling all over at this conflict of the gods brought out a calabash full of white coralsand the king of water spat on it and blessed it by this time a dozen natives at least had assembled outside the tabooline and stood eagerly watching the result of the combat the temple slave made a long white mark with the coralsand on one side of the cleared area then he handed the calabash solemnly to toko toko crossed the sacred precinct with a few inaudible words of muttered charm to save the taboo as prescribed in the mysteries then he drew a similar line on the ground on his side some twenty yards off descend o my lord he cried to felix and felix still holding the bough tight in his hand swung himself blindly from the tree and took his place by toko  toe the line toko cried and felix toed it  bring up your god the shadow called out aloud to the king of water and the king of water using no special ceremony with so great a duty dragged tukilakila helplessly along with him to the farther tabooline  the king of water brought a spear and tomahawk he handed them to felix with these weapons he said fight and merit heaven i hold the bough meanwhilethe victor takes it  the king of fire stood out between the lists korongs and gods he said the king of the rain has plucked the sacred bough according to our fathers rites and claims trial which of you two shall henceforth hold the sacred soul of the world the great tukilakila wager of battle decides the day keep toe to line at the end of my words forth forward and fight for it the great god knows his own and will choose his abode taboo taboo taboo i fire have spoken it  scarcely were the words well out of his mouth when with a wild whoop of rage tukilakila who had the advantage of knowing the rules of the game so to speak dashed madly forward drunk with passion and kava and gave one lunge with his spear full tilt at the breast of the startled and unprepared white man his aim though frantic was not at fault the spear struck felix high up on the left side he felt a dull thud of pain a faint gurgle of blood even in the pale moonlight his eye told him at once a red stream was tricklingout over his flannel shirt he was pricked at least the great god had wounded him     chapter xxix  victoryand after   the great god had wounded him but not to the heart felix as good luck would have it happened to be wearing buckled braces he had worn them on board and like the rest of his costume had of course never since been able to discard them they stood him in good stead now the buckle caught the very point of the bonetipped spear and broke the force of the blow as the great god lunged forward the wound was but a graze and tukilakilas light shaft snapped short in the middle  madder and wilder than ever the savage pitched it away yelling rushed forward with a fierce curse on his angry tongue and flung himself tooth and nail on his astonished opponent  the suddenness of the onslaught almost took the englishmans breath away by this time however felix had pulled together his ideas and taken in the situation tukilakila was attacking him now with his heavy stone axe he must parry those deadly blows he must be alert but watchful he must put himself in a posture of defence at once above all he must keep cool and have his wits about him  if he could but have drawn his knife he would have stood a better chance in that handtohand conflict but there was no time now for such tactics as those besides even in close fight with a bloodthirsty savage an english gentlemans sense of fair play never for one moment deserts him felix felt if they were to fight it out face to face for their lives they should fight at least on a perfect equality steel against stone was a mean advantage parrying tukilakilas first desperate blow with the haft of his own hatchet he leaped aside half a second to gain breath and strength then he rushed on and dealt one deadly downstroke with the ponderous weapon  for a minute or two they closed in perfectly savage single combat fire and water observant and impartial stood by like seconds to see the god himself decide the issue which of the two combatants should be his living representative the contest was brief but very hardfought tukilakila inspired with the last frenzy of despair rushed wildly on his opponent with hands and fists and teeth and nails dealing his blows in blind fury right and left and seeking only to sell his life as dearly as possible in this last extremity his very superstitions told against him everything seemed to show his hour had come the parrots bitethe omen of his own blood that stained the dust of earthulas treacherythe chance by which the korong had learned the great taboofelixs accidental or providential success in breaking off the boughthe length of time he himself had held the divine honorsthe probability that the god would by this time begin to prefer a new and stronger representativeall these things alike combined to fire the drunk and maddened savage with the energy of despair he fell upon his enemy like a tiger upon an elephant he fought with his tomahawk and his feet and his whole lithe body he foamed at the mouth with impotent rage he spent his force on the air in the extremity of his passion  felix on the other hand sobered by pain and nerved by the fixed consciousness that muriels safety now depended absolutely on his perfect coolness fought with the calm skill of a practised fencer happily he had learned the gentle art of thrust and parry years before in england and though both weapon and opponent were here so different the lesson of quickness and calm watchfulness he had gained in that civilized school stood him in good stead even now under such adverse circumstances tukilakila getting spent drew back for a second at last and panted for breath that faint breathingspace of a moments duration sealed his fate seizing his chance with consummate skill felix closed upon the breathless monster and brought down the heavy stone hammer point blank upon the centre of his crashing skull the weapon drove home it cleft a great red gash in the cannibals head tukilakila reeled and fell there was an infinitesimal pause of silence and suspense then a great shout went up from all round to heaven he has killed him he has killed him we have a newmade god tukilakila is dead long live tukilakila  felix drew back for a moment panting and breathless and wiped his wet brow with his sleeve his brain all whirling at his feet the savage lay stretched like a log felix gazed at the bloodbespattered face remorsefully it is an awful thing even in a just quarrel to feel that you have really taken a human life the responsibility is enough to appall the bravest of us he stooped down and examined the prostrate body with solemn reverence blood was flowing in torrents from the wounded head but tukilakila was deadstonedead forever  hot tears of relief welled up into felixs eyes he touched the body cautiously with a reverent hand no life no motion  just as he did so the woman ula came forward barelimbed and beautiful all triumph in her walk a proud insensitive savage one second she gazed at the great corpse disdainfully then she lifted her dainty foot and gave it a contemptuous kick the body of lavita the son of sami she said with a gesture of hatred he had a bad heart we will cook it and eat it next turning to felix oh tukilakila she cried clapping her hands three times and bowing low to the ground you are a very great god we will serve you and salute you am not i ula one of your wives your meat do with me as you will toko you are henceforth the great gods shadow  felix gazed at the beautiful heartless creature all horrified even on boupari that cannibal island he was hardly prepared for quite so low a depth of savage insensibility but all the people around now a hundred or more standing naked before their new god took up the shout in concert the body of lavita the son of sami they cried a carrion corpse the god has deserted it the great soul of the world has entered the heart of the whitefaced stranger from the disk of the sun the king of the rain the great tukilakila we will cook and eat the body of lavita the son of sami he was a bad man he is a wornout shell nothing remains of him now the great god has left him  they clapped their hands in a set measure as they recited this hymn the king of fire retreated into the temple ula stood by and whispered low with toko there was a ceremonial pause of some fifteen minutes presently from the inner recesses of the temple itself a low noise issued forth as of a rising wind for some seconds it buzzed and hummed droningly but at the very first note of that holy sound ula dropped her lovers hand as one drops a redhot coal and darted wildly off at full speed like some frightened wild beast into the thick jungle every other woman near began to rush away with equally instantaneous signs of haste and fear the men on the other hand erect and naked with their hands on their foreheads crossed the tabooline at once it was the summons to all who had been initiated at the mysteriesthe sacred bullroarer was calling the assembly of the men of boupari  for several minutes it buzzed and droned that mystic implement growing louder and louder till it roared like thunder one after another the men of the island rushed in as if mad or in flight for their lives before some fierce beast pursuing them they ran up panting and dripping with sweat their hands clapped to their foreheads their eyes starting wildly from their staring sockets torn and bleeding and lacerated by the thorns and branches of the jungle for each man ran straight across country from the spot where he lay asleep in the direction of the sound and never paused or drew breath for dear lifes sake till he stood beside the corpse of the dead tukilakila  and every moment the cry pealed louder and louder still lavita the son of sami is dead praise heaven the king of the rain has slain him and is now the true tukilakila  felix bent irresolute over the fallen savages bloodstained corpse what next was expected of him he hardly knew or cared his one desire now was to return to murielto muriel whom he had rescued from something worse than death at the hateful hands of that accursed creature who lay breathless forever on the ground beside him  somebody came up just then and seized his hand warmly felix looked up with a start it was their friend the frenchman ah my captain you have done well m peyron cried admiring him what courage what coolness what pluck what soldiership i couldnt see all but i was in at the death and oh mon dieu how i admired and envied you  by this time the bullroarer had ceased to bellow among the rocks the king of fire stood forth in his hands he held a length of bamboostick with a lighted coal in it bring wood and palmleaves he said in a tone of command let me light myself up that i may blaze before tukilakila  he turned and bowed thrice very low before felix the accepted of heaven he cried holding his hands above him the very high god the king of all things he sends down his showers upon our crops and our fields he causes his sun to shine brightly over us he makes our pigs and our slaves bring forth their increase all we are but his meat we his people praise him  and all the men of boupari naked and bleeding bent low in response tukilakila is great they chanted as they clapped their hands we thank him that he has chosen a fresh incarnation the sun will not fade in the heavens overhead nor the breadfruits wither and cease to bear fruit on earth tukilakila our god is great he springs ever young and fresh like the herbs of the field he is a most high god we his people praise him  four temple attendants brought sticks and leaves while felix stood still half dazed with the newness of these strange preparations the king of fire with his torch set light to the pile it blazed merrily on high i fire salute you he cried bending over it toward felix  now cut up the body of lavita the son of sami he went on turning toward it contemptuously i will cook it in my flame that tukilakila the great may eat of it  felix drew back with a face all aglow with horror and disgust dont touch that body he cried authoritatively putting his foot down firm leave it alone at once i refuse to allow you then he turned to m peyron the king of the birds and i he said with calm resolve we two will bury it  the king of fire drew back at these strange words nonplussed this was indeed an illomened break in the ceremony of initiation of a new tukilakila to which he had never before in his life been accustomed he hardly knew how to comport himself under such singular circumstances it was as though the sovereign of england on coronationday should refuse to be crowned and intimate to the archbishop in his full canonicals a confirmed preference for the republican form of government it was a contingency that law and custom in boupari had neither in their wisdom foreseen nor provided for  the king of water whispered low in the new gods ear you must eat of his body my lord he said that is absolutely necessary every one of us must eat of the flesh of the god but you above all must eat his heart his divine nature otherwise you can never be full tukilakila  i dont care a straw for that felix cried now aroused to a full sense of the break in methuselahs story and trembling with apprehension you may kill me if you like we can die only once but human flesh i can never taste nor will i while i live allow you to touch this dead mans body we will bury it ourselves the king of the birds and i you may tell your people so that is my last word he raised his voice to the customary ceremonial pitch i the new tukilakila he said have spoken it  the king of fire and the king of water taken aback at his boldness conferred together for some seconds privately the people meanwhile looked on and wondered what could this strange hitch in the divine proceedings mean was the god himself recalcitrant never in their lives had the oldest men among them known anything like it  and as they whispered and debated awestruck but discordant a shout arose once more from the outer circlea mighty shout of mingled surprise alarm and terror taboo taboo fence the mysteries beware oh great god we warn you the mysteries are in danger cut her down kill her a woman a woman  at the words felix was aware of somebody bursting through the dense crowd and rushing wildly toward him next moment muriel hung and sobbed on his shoulder while mali just behind her stood crying and moaning  felix held the poor startled girl in his arms and soothed her and all around another great cry arose from five hundred lips two women have profaned the mysteries of the god they are tukilakilas trespassoffering let us kill them and eat them     chapter xxx  suspense   in a moment felixs mind was fully made up there was no time to think it was the hour for action he saw how he must comport himself toward this strange wild people seating muriel gently on the ground mali beside her and stepping forward himself with peyrons hand in his he beckoned to the vast and surging crowd to bespeak respectful silence  a mighty hush fell at once upon the people the king of fire and the king of water stood back obedient to his nod they waited for the upshot of this strange new development  men of boupari felix began speaking with a marvellous fluency in their own tongue for the excitement itself supplied him with eloquence i have killed your late god in the prescribed way i have plucked the sacred bough and fought in single combat by the established rules of your own religion fire and water you guardians of this holy island is it not so you saw all things done did you not after the precepts of your ancestors  the king of fire bowed low and answered tukilakila speaks indeed the truth water and i with our own eyes have seen it  and now felix went on i am myself by your own laws tukilakila  the king of fire made a gesture of dissent oh great god pardon me he murmured if i say aught now to contradict you but you are not a full tukilakila yet till you have eaten of the heart of the god your predecessor  then where is now the spirit of tukilakila the very high god if i am not he felix asked abruptly thus puzzling them with a hard problem in their own savage theology  the king of fire gave a start and pondered this was a detail of his creed that had never before so much as occurred to him all faiths have their cruces i do not well know he answered whether it is in the heart of lavita the son of sami or in your own body but i feel sure it must now be certainly somewhere though just where our fathers have never told us  felix recognized at once that he had gained a point then look to it well he said austerely be careful how you act do nothing rash for either the soul of the god is in the heart of lavita the son of sami and then since i refuse to eat it it will decay away as lavitas body decays and the world will shrivel up and all things will perish because the god is dead and crumbled to dust forever or else it is in my body who am god in his place and then if anybody does me harm or hurt he will be an impious wretch and will have broken taboo and heaven knows what evils and misfortunes may not therefore fall on each and all of you  a very old chief rose from the ranks outside his hair was white and his eyes bleared tukilakila speaks well he cried in a loud but mumbling voice his words are wise he argues to the point he is very cunning i advise you my people to be careful how you anger the whitefaced stranger for you know what he is he is cruel he is powerful there was never any storm in my timeand i am an old manso great in boupari as the storm that rose when the king of the rain ate the stormapple our yams and our taros even now are suffering from it he is a mighty strong god beware how you tamper with him  he sat down trembling a younger chief rose from a nearer rank and said his say in turn i do not agree with our father he cried pointing to the chief who had just spoken his word is evil he is much mistaken i have another thought my thought is this let us kill and eat the whitefaced stranger at once by wager of battle and let whosoever fights and overcomes him receive his honors and take to wife the fair woman the queen of the clouds the sunfaced korong whom he brought from the sun with him  but who will then be tukilakila felix asked turning round upon him quickly habituation to danger had made him unnaturally alert in such utmost extremities  why the man who slays you the young chief answered pointedly grasping his heavy tomahawk with profound expression  i think not felix answered your reasoning is bad for if i am not tukilakila how can any man become tukilakila by killing me and if i am tukilakila how dare you not being yourself korong and not having broken off the sacred bough as i did venture to attack me you wish to set aside all the customs of boupari are you not ashamed of such gross impiety  tukilakila speaks well the king of fire put in for he had no cause to love the aggressive young chief and he thought better of his chances in life as felixs minister besides now i think of it he must be tukilakila because he has taken the life of the last great god whom he slew with his hands and therefore the life is now hishe holds it  felix was emboldened by this favorable opinion to strike out a fresh line in a further direction he stood forward once more and beckoned again for silence yes my people he said calmly with slow articulation by the custom of your race and the creed you profess i am now indeed and in every truth the abode of your great god tukilakila but furthermore i have a new revelation to make to you i am going to instruct you in a fresh way this creed that you hold is full of errors as tukilakila i mean to take my own course no islander hindering me if you try to depose me what great gods have you now got left none save only fire and water my ministers king of the rain there is none for i who was he am now tukilakila tukilakila there is none save only me for the other that was i have fought and conquered the queen of the clouds is with me the king of the birds is with me consider then o friends that if you kill us all you will have nowhere to turn you will be left quite godless  it is true the people murmured looking about them half puzzled he is wise he speaks well he is indeed a tukilakila  felix pressed his advantage home at once now listen he said lifting up one solemn forefinger i come from a country very far away where the customs are better by many yams than those of boupari and now that i am indeed tukilakilayour god your masteri will change and alter some of your customs that seem to me here and now most undesirable in the first placehear thisi will put down all cannibalism no man shall eat of human flesh on pain of death and to begin with no man shall cook or eat the body of lavita the son of sami on that i am determinedi tukilakila the king of the birds and i we will dig a pit and we will bury in it the corpse of this man that was once your god and whom his own wickedness compelled me to fight and slay in order to prevent more cruelty and bloodshed  the young chief stood up all red in his wrath and interrupted him brandishing a coralstone hatchet this is blasphemy he said this is sheer rank blasphemy these are not good words they are very bad medicine the whitefaced korong is no true tukilakila his advice is eviland illluck would follow it he wishes to change the sacred customs of boupari now that is not well my counsel is this let us eat him now unless he changes his heart and amends his ways and partakes as is right of the body of lavita the son of sami  the assembly swayed visibly this way and that some inclining to the conservative view of the rash young chief and others to the cautious liberalism of the grayhaired warrior felix noted their division and spoke once more this time still more authoritatively than ever  furthermore he said my people hear me as i came in a ship propelled by fire over the high waves of the sea so i go away in one we watch for such a ship to pass by boupari when it comes the queen of the cloudsupon whose life i place a great taboo let no man dare to touch her at his peril if he does i will rush upon him and kill him as i killed lavita the son of sami when it comes the queen of the clouds the king of the birds and i we will go away back in it to the land whence we came and be quit of boupari but we will not leave it fireless or godless when i return back home again to my own far land i will send out messengers very good men who will tell you of a god more powerful by much than any you ever knew and very righteous they will teach you great things you never dreamed of therefore i ask you now to disperse to your own homes while the king of birds and i bury the body of lavita the son of sami  all this time muriel had been seated on the ground listening with profound interest but scarcely understanding a word though here and there after her six months stay in the island a single phrase was dimly intelligible to her but now at this critical moment she rose and standing upright by felixs side in her spotless english purity among those assembled savages she pointed just once with her uplifted finger to the calm vault of heaven and then across the moonlit horizon of the sea and last of all to the clustering huts and villages of boupari tell them she said to felix with blanched lips but without one sign of a tremor in her fearless voice i will pray for them to heaven when i go across the sea and will think of the children that i loved to pat and play with and will send out messengers from our home beyond the waves to make them wiser and happier and better  felix translated her simple message to them in its pure womanly goodness even the natives were touched they whispered and hesitated then after a time of much murmured debate the king of fire stood forward as a mediator there is an oracle o korong he said not to prejudge the matter which decides all these thingsa great conchshell at a sacred grove in the neighboring island of aloa mauna it is the holiest oracle of all our holy religion we gods and men of boupari have taken counsel together and have come to a conclusion we will put forth a canoe and send men with blood on their faces to inquire at aloa mauna of the very great oracle till then you are neither tukilakila nor not tukilakila it behooves us to be very careful how we deal with gods our people will stand round your precinct in a row and guard you with their spears you shall not cross the taboo line to them nor they to you all shall be neutral food shall be laid by the line as always morn noon and night and your shadows shall take it in but you shall not come out neither shall you bury the body of lavita the son of sami till the canoe comes back it shall lie in the sun and rot there  he clapped his hands twice  in a moment a tomtom began to beat from behind and the people all crowded without the circle the king of fire came forward ostentatiously and made taboo if any man cross this line he said in a droning singsong till the canoe return from the great oracle of our faith on aloa mauna i fire will scorch him into cinder and ashes if any woman transgress i will pitch her with palm oil and light her up for a lamp on a moonless night to lighten this temple  the king of water distributed sharkstooth spears at once a great serried wall hemmed in the europeans all round and they sat down to wait the three whites together for the upshot of the mission to aloa mauna  and the dawn now gleamed red on the eastern horizon     chapter xxxi  at sea off boupari   thirteen days out from sydney the good ship australasian was nearing the equator  it was four of the clock in the afternoon and the captain off duty paced the deck puffing a cigar and talking idly with a passenger on former experiences  eight bells went on the quarterdeck time to change watches  this is only our second trip through this channel the captain said gazing across with a casual glance at the palmtrees that stood dark against the blue horizon we used to go a hundred miles to eastward here to avoid the reefs but last voyage i came through this way quite safelythough we had a nasty accident on the roadunavoidableunavoidable big sea was running free over the sunken shoals caught the ship aft unawares and stove in better than half a dozen portholes lady passenger on deck happened to be leaning over the weather gunwale big sea caught her up on its crest in a jiffy lifted her like a baby and laid her down again gently just so on the bed of the ocean by george sir i was annoyed it was quite a romance poor thing quite a romance we all felt so put out about it the rest of that voyage young fellow on board nephew of sir theodore thurstan of the colonial office was in love with miss ellisgirls name was ellisfathers a parson somewhere down in somersetshireand as soon as the big sea took her up on its crest what does thurstan go and do but he ups on the taffrail and before you could say jack robinson jumps over to save her  but he didnt succeed the passenger asked with languid interest  succeed my dear sir and with a sea running twelve feet high like that why it was pitch dark and such a surf on that the gig could hardly go through it the captain smiled and puffed away pensively drowned he said after a brief pause with complacent composure drowned drowned drowned went to the bottom both of em davy joness locker but unavoidable quite these accidents will happen even on the bestregulated liners why there was my brother tom in the cunard servicesame that boast they never lost a passenger there was my brother tom he was out one day off the newfoundland banks heavy swell setting in from the nornoreast icebergs ahead passengers battened downbless my soul how that light seems to come and go dont it  it was a reflected light flashing from the island straight in the captains eyes small and insignificant as to size but strong for all that in the full tropical sunshine and glittering like a diamond from a vague elevation near the centre of the island  seems to come and go in regular order the passenger observed reflectively withdrawing his cigar looks for all the world just like naval signalling  the captain paused and shaded his eyes a moment hanged if that isnt just what it is he answered slowly its a riggedup heliograph and theyre using the morse code dash my eyes if they arent well this is civilization what the dickens can have come to the island of boupari there isnt a darned european soul in the place nor ever has been anchorage unsafe no harbor bad reef too small for missionaries to make a living and natives got nothing worth speaking of to trade in  what do they say the passenger asked with suddenly quickened interest  how the devil should i tell you yet sir the captain retorted with choleric grumpiness dont you see im spelling it out letter by letter o r e s c u e u s c o m e w e l l a r m e dyes yes i twig it and the captain jotted it down in his notebook for some seconds silently  run up the flag there he shouted a moment later rushing hastily forward stop her at once walker easy easy get ready the gig well upon my soul there is a rum start anyway  what does the message say the passenger inquired with intense surprise  say well theres what i make it out the captain answered handing him the scrap of paper on which he had jotted down the letters i missed the beginning but the ends all right look alive there boys will you bring out the winchester take cutlasses all hands ill go along myself in her  the passenger took the piece of paper on which he read and send a boat to rescue us come well armed savages on guard thurstan ellis  in less than three minutes the boat was lowered and manned and the captain with the winchester sixshooter by his side seated grim in the stern took command of the tiller  on the island it was the first day of felix and muriels imprisonment in the dusty precinct of tukilakilas temple all the morning through they had sat under the shade of a smaller banyan in the outer corner for muriel could neither enter the noisome hut nor go near the great tree with the skeletons on its branches nor could she sit where the dead savages body still festering in the sun attracted the buzzing blue flies by thousands to drink up the blood that lay thick on the earth in a pool around it hard by the natives sat keen as lynxes in a great circle just outside the white tabooline where with serried spears they kept watch and ward over the persons of their doubtful gods or victims m peyron alone preserving his equanimity under these adverse circumstances hummed low to himself in very dubious tones even he felt his french gayety had somewhat forsaken him this revolution in boupari failed to excite his parisian ardor  about one oclock in the day however looking casually seawardwhat was this that m peyron to his great surprise descried far away on the dim southern horizon a low black line lying close to the water no no not a steamer  too prudent to excite the natives attention unnecessarily the cautious frenchman whispered in the most commonplace voice on earth to felix dont look at once and when you do look mind you dont exhibit any agitation in your tone or manner but what do you make that out to bethat long black haze on the horizon to southward  felix looked disregarding the friendly injunction at once at the same moment muriel turned her eyes quickly in the selfsame direction neither made the faintest sign of outer emotion but muriel clenched her white hands hard till the nails dug into the palm in her effort to restrain herself as she murmured very low in an agitated voice un vapeur un vapeur  so i think m peyron answered very low and calm it is indeed a steamer  for three long hours those anxious souls waited and watched it draw nearer and nearer slowly the natives too began to perceive the unaccustomed object as it drew abreast of the island and the decisive moment arrived for prompt action felix rose in his place once more and cried aloud my people i told you a ship propelled by fire would come from the far land across the sea to take us the ship has come you can see for yourselves the thick black smoke that issues in huge puffs from the mouth of the monster now listen to me and dare not to disobey me my word is law let all men see to it i am going to send a message of fire from the sun to the great canoe that walks upon the water if any man ventures to stop me from doing it the people from the great canoe will land on this isle and take vengeance for his act and kill with the thunder which the sailing gods carry ever about with them  by this time the island was alive with commotion hundreds of natives with their long hair falling unkempt about their keen brown faces were gazing with open eyes at the big black ship that ploughed her way so fast against wind and tide over the surface of the waters some of them shouted and gesticulated with panic fear others seemed half inclined to waste no time on preparation or doubt but to rush on at once and immolate their captives before a rescue was possible but felix keeping ever his cool head undisturbed stood on the dusty mound by tukilakilas house and taking in his hand the little mirror he had made from the matchbox flashed the light from the sun full in their eyes for a moment to the astonishment and discomfiture of all those gaping savages then he focussed it on the australasian across the surf and the waves and with a throbbing heart began to make his last faint bid for life and freedom  for four or five minutes he went flashing on uncertain of the effect whether they saw or saw not then a cry from muriel burst at once upon his ears she clasped her hands convulsively in an agony of joy they see us they see us  and sure enough scarcely half a minute later a british flag ran gayly up the mainmast and a boat seemed to drop down over the side of the vessel  as for the natives they watched these proceedings with considerable surprise and no little discomfiturefire and water in particular whispering together much alarmed with many superstitious nods and taboos in the corner of the enclosure  gradually as the boat drew nearer and nearer divided counsels prevailed among the savages with no certainly recognized tukilakila to marshal their movements each man stood in doubt from whom to take his orders at last the king of fire in a hesitating voice gave the word of command half the warriors to the shore to repel the enemy half to watch round the tabooline lest the korongs escape us let breathless fear our wargod go before the face of our troops invisible  and quick as thought at his word the warriors had paired off two and two in long lines some running hastily down to the beach to man the warcanoes while others remained with sharks tooth spears still set in a looser circle round the great templeenclosure of tukilakila  for muriel this suspense was positively terrible to feel one was so close to the hope of rescue and yet to know that before that help arrived or even as it came up those savages might any moment run their ghastly spears through them  but felix made the best of his position still remember he cried at the top of his voice as the warriors started at a run for the waters edge your tukilakila tells you these newcomers are his friends whoever hurts them does so at his peril this is a great taboo i bid you receive them beware for your lives i tukilakila the great have said it     chapter xxxii  the downfall of a pantheon   the australasians gig entered the lagoon through the fringing reef by its narrow seaward mouth and rowed steadily for the landing place on the main island  a little way out from shore amid loud screams and yells the natives came up with it in their laden warcanoes shouting and gesticulating and brandishing their spears with the sharks tooth tips they endeavored to stop its progress landward by pure noise and bravado  we must be careful what we do boys the captain observed in a quiet voice of seamanlike resolution to his armed companions we mustnt frighten the savages too much or show too hostile a front for fear they should retaliate on our friends on the island he held up his hand with the gold braid on the wrist to command silence and the natives gazing openmouthed looked and wondered at the gesture these sailing gods were certainly arrayed in most gorgeous vestments and their canoe though devoid of a grinning figurehead was provided with a most admirable and welluniformed equipment  a coral rock jutted high out of the sea to the left hard by its summit was crowded with a basking population of seagulls and pelicans the captain gave the word to easy all in a second the gig stopped short as those stout arms held her he rose in his place and lifted the sixshooter then he pointed it ostentatiously at the rock away from the native canoes and held up his hand yet again for silence well give em a taste of what we can do boys he said just to show em not to hurt em at that he drew the trigger twice his first two chambers were loaded on purpose with duckshot cartridges twice the big gun roared twice the fire flashed red from its smoking mouth as the smoke cleared away the natives dumb with surprise and perfectly cowed with terror saw ten or a dozen torn and bleeding birds float mangled upon the water  now for the dynamite the captain said cheerily proceeding to lower a small object overboard by a single wire while he held up his hand a third time to bespeak silence and attention  the natives looked again with eyes starting from their heads the captain gave a little click and pointed with his finger to a spot on the waters top a little way in front of him instantly a loud report and a column of water spurted up into the air some ten or twelve feet in a boisterous fountain as it subsided again a hundred or so of the brightcolored fish that browse among the submerged coralgroves of these still lagoons rose dead or dying to the seething boiling surface  the captain smiled instantly the natives set up a terrified shout it is even as he said they cried these gods are his ministers the whitefaced korong is a very great deity he is indeed the true tukilakila these gods have come for him they are very mighty thunder and lightning and waterspouts are theirs the waves do as they bid the sea obeys them they are here to take away our tukilakila from our midst and what will then become of the island of boupari will it not sink in the waves of the sea and disappear will not the sun in heaven grow dark and the moon cease to shed its benign light on the earth when tukilakila the great returns at last to his own far country  that lotll do for em i expect the captain said cheerily with a confident smile now forward all boys i fancy weve astonished the natives a trifle  they rowed on steadily but cautiously toward the white bank of sand which formed the usual landingplace the captain holding the sixshooter in readiness all the time and keeping an eye firmly fixed on every movement of the savages but the warriors in the canoes thoroughly cowed and overawed by this singular exhibition of the strangers prowess paddled on in whispering silence nearly abreast of the gig but at a safe distance as they thought and eyed the advancing europeans with quiet looks of unmixed suspicion  at last the adventurous young chief who had advised killing felix offhand on the island mustered up courage to paddle his own canoe a little nearer and flung his spear madly in the direction of the gig it fell short by ten yards he stood eying it angrily but the captain grimly quiet raising his winchester to his shoulder without one seconds delay and marking his man fired at the young chief as he stood still half in the attitude of throwing on the prow of his canoe an easy aim for firearms the ball went clean through the savages breast and then ricochetted three times on the water afar off the young chief fell stone dead into the sea like a log and sank instantly to the bottom  it was a critical moment the captain felt uncertain whether the natives would close round them in force or not it is always dangerous to fire a shot at savages but the boupari men were too utterly awed to venture on defence he was tukilakilas enemy they cried in astonished tones he raised his voice against the very high god therefore the very high gods friends have smitten him with their lightning their thunderbolt went through him and hit the water beyond how strong is their hand they can kill from afar they are mighty gods let no man strive to fight against the friends of tukilakila  the sailors rowed on and reached the landingplace there half of them headed by the captain disembarked in good order with drawn cutlasses while the other half remained behind to guard the gig under the third officer the natives also disembarked a little way off and making humble signs of submission with knee and arm endeavored by pantomime to express the idea of their willingness to guide the strangers to their friends quarters  the captain waved them on with his hand the natives reassured led the way at some distance ahead along the paths through the jungle the captain had his finger on his sixshooter the while every sailor grasped his cutlass and kept his revolver ready for action i dont half like the look of it the captain observed partly to himself they seem to be leading us into an ambuscade or something keep a sharp lookout against surprise from the jungle boys and if any native shows fight shoot him down instantly  at last they emerged upon a clear space in the front where a great group of savages stood in a circle with serried spears round a large wattled hut that occupied the elevated centre of the clearing  for a minute or two the action of the savages was uncertain half of the defenders turned round to face the invaders angrily the other half stood irresolute with their spears still held inward guarding a white line of sand with inflexible devotion  the warriors who had preceded them from the shore called aloud to their friends by the temple in startled tones the captain and sailors had no idea what their words meant but just then from the midst of the circle an english voice cried out in haste dont fire do nothing rash were safe dont be frightened the natives are disposed to parley and palaver take care how you act theyre terribly afraid of you  just outside the tabooline the captain halted the grayheaded old chief who had accompanied his fellows to the shore spoke out in polynesian do not resist them he said my people if you do you will be blasted by their lightning like a bare bamboo in a mighty cyclone they carry thunder in their hands they are mighty mighty gods the whitefaced korong spoke no more than the truth let them do as they will with us we are but their meat we are as dust beneath their sole and as driven mulberryleaves before the breath of the tempest  the defenders hesitated still a little then suddenly losing heart they broke rank at last at a point close by where the captain of the australasian stood one man after another falling aside slowly and shamefacedly a pace or two the captain unhesitatingly overstepped the white tabooline next instant felix and muriel were grasping his hand hard and m peyron was bowing a polite parisian reception  forthwith the sailors crowded round them in a hollow square muriel and felix half faint with relief from their long and anxious suspense staggered slowly down the seaward path between them but there was no need now for further show of defence the islanders pressing near and flinging away their weapons followed the procession close with tears and lamentations as they went on the women rushing out of their huts while the fugitives passed tore their hair on their heads and beat their breasts in terror the warriors who had come from the shore recounted with their own exaggerative additions the miracle of the sixshooter and the dynamite cartridge gradually they approached the landingplace on the beach there the third officer sat waiting in the gig to receive them the lamentations of the islanders now became positively poignant oh my father they cried aloud my brother my revered one you are indeed the true tukilakila do not go away like this and desert us oh our mother great queen mighty goddess stop with us take not away your sun from the heavens nor your rain from the crops we acknowledge we have sinned we have done very wrong but the chief sinner is dead the wrongdoer has paid spare us who remain spare us great deity do not make the bright lights of heaven become dark over us stay with your worshippers and we will give you choice young girls to eat every day we will sacrifice the tenderest of our children to feed you  it is an awful thing for any race or nation when its taboos fail all at once and die out entirely to the men of boupari the tukilakila of the moment represented both the moral order and the regular sequence of the physical universe anarchy and chaos might rule when he was gone the sun might be quenched and the people run riot no wonder they shrank from the fearful consequence that might next ensue king and priest god and religion all at one fell blow were to be taken away from them  felix turned round on the shore and spoke to them again my people he said in a kindly tonefor after all he pitied themyou need have no fear when i am gone the sun will still shine and the trees will still bear fruit every year as formerly i will send the messengers i promised from my own land to teach you until they come i leave you this as a great taboo tukilakila enjoins it shed no human blood eat no human flesh those who do will be punished when another firecanoe comes from the far land to bring my messengers  the king of fire bent low at the words oh tukilakila he said it shall be done as you say till your messengers come every man shall live at peace with all his neighbors  they stepped into the gig mali and toko followed before m peyron as naturally as they had always followed their masters on the island before  who are these the captain asked smiling  our shadows felix answered let them come i will pay their passage when i reach san francisco they have been very faithful to us and they are afraid to remain lest the islanders should kill them for letting us go or for not accompanying us  very well the captain answered forward all there boys now ahead for the ship and thank god were well out of it  but the islanders still stood on the shore and wept stretching their hands in vain after the departing boat and crying aloud in piteous tones oh my father return oh my mother come back oh very great gods do not fly and desert us  seven weeks later mr and mrs felix thurstan who had been married in the cathedral at honolulu the very morning the australasian arrived there sat in an eminently respectable drawingroom in a london square where mrs ellis muriels aunt by marriage was acting as their hostess  but how dreadful it is to think dear mrs ellis remarked for the twentieth time since their arrival with a deepdrawn sigh how dreadful to think that you and felix should have been all those months alone on the island together without being married  muriel looked up with a quiet smile toward felix i think aunt mary she said dreamily if youd been there yourself and suffered all those fears and passed through all those horrors that we did together youd have troubled your head very little indeed about such conventionalities as whether or not you happened to be married besides she added after a pause with a fine perception of the inexorable stringency of mrs grundys law we werent quite without chaperons either dont you know for our shadows of course were always with us  whereat felix smiled an equally quiet smile and terrible as it all was he put in i shall never regret it because it made muriel know how profoundly i loved her and it made me know how brave and trustful and pure a woman could be under such awful conditions  but mrs ellis sat still in her chair and smiled uncomfortably it affected her spirits taboos after all are much the same in england as in boupari
