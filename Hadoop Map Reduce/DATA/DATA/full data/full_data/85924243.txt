85924243	to the last man   by  zane grey      foreword  it was inevitable that in my efforts to write romantic history of the great west i should at length come to the story of a feud  for long i have steered clear of this rock  but at last i have reached it and must go over it driven by my desire to chronicle the stirring events of pioneer days  even today it is not possible to travel into the remote corners of the west without seeing the lives of people still affected by a fighting past  how can the truth be told about the pioneering of the west if the struggle the fight the blood be left out  it cannot be done how can a novel be stirring and thrilling as were those times unless it be full of sensation  my long labors have been devoted to making stories resemble the times they depict  i have loved the west for its vastness its contrast its beauty and color and life for its wildness and violence and for the fact that i have seen how it developed great men and women who died unknown and unsung  in this materialistic age this hard practical swift greedy age of realism it seems there is no place for writers of romance no place for romance itself  for many years all the events leading up to the great war were realistic and the war itself was horribly realistic and the aftermath is likewise  romance is only another name for idealism and i contend that life without ideals is not worth living never in the history of the world were ideals needed so terribly as now  walter scott wrote romance so did victor hugo and likewise kipling hawthorne stevenson  it was stevenson particularly who wielded a bludgeon against the realists  people live for the dream in their hearts  and i have yet to know anyone who has not some secret dream some hope however dim some storied wall to look at in the dusk some painted window leading to the soul how strange indeed to find that the realists have ideals and dreams to read them one would think their lives held nothing significant but they love they hope they dream they sacrifice they struggle on with that dream in their hearts just the same as others  we all are dreamers if not in the heavylidded wasting of time then in the meaning of life that makes us work on  it was wordsworth who wrote the world is too much with us and if i could give the secret of my ambition as a novelist in a few words it would be contained in that quotation  my inspiration to write has always come from nature  character and action are subordinated to setting  in all that i have done i have tried to make people see how the world is too much with them  getting and spending they lay waste their powers with never a breath of the free and wonderful life of the open  so i come back to the main point of this foreword in which i am trying to tell why and how i came to write the story of a feud notorious in arizona as the pleasant valley war  some years ago mr harry adams a cattleman of vermajo park new mexico told me he had been in the tonto basin of arizona and thought i might find interesting material there concerning this pleasant valley war his version of the war between cattlemen and sheepmen certainly determined me to look over the ground  my old guide al doyle of flagstaff had led me over half of arizona but never down into that wonderful wild and rugged basin between the mogollon mesa and the mazatzal mountains  doyle had long lived on the frontier and his version of the pleasant valley war differed markedly from that of mr adams  i asked other old timers about it and their remarks further excited my curiosity  once down there doyle and i found the wildest most rugged roughest and most remarkable country either of us had visited and the few inhabitants were like the country  i went in ostensibly to hunt bear and lion and turkey but what i really was hunting for was the story of that pleasant valley war  i engaged the services of a bear hunter who had three strapping sons as reserved and strange and aloof as he was no wheel tracks of any kind had ever come within miles of their cabin i spent two wonderful months hunting game and reveling in the beauty and grandeur of that rim rock country but i came out knowing no more about the pleasant valley war  these texans and their few neighbors likewise from texas did not talk  but all i saw and felt only inspired me the more  this trip was in the fall of 1918  the next year i went again with the best horses outfit and men the doyles could provide  and this time i did not ask any questions but i rode horsessome of them too wild for meand packed a rifle many a hundred miles riding sometimes thirty and forty miles a day and i climbed in and out of the deep canyons desperately staying at the heels of one of those longlegged texans  i learned the life of those backwoodsmen but i did not get the story of the pleasant valley war i had however won the friendship of that hardy people  in 1920 i went back with a still larger outfit equipped to stay as long as i liked  and this time without my asking it different natives of the tonto came to tell me about the pleasant valley war no two of them agreed on anything concerning it except that only one of the active participants survived the fighting  whence comes my title to the last man  thus i was swamped in a mass of material out of which i could only flounder to my own conclusion  some of the stories told me are singularly tempting to a novelist  but though i believe them myself i cannot risk their improbability to those who have no idea of the wildness of wild men at a wild time  there really was a terrible and bloody feud perhaps the most deadly and least known in all the annals of the west  i saw the ground the cabins the graves all so darkly suggestive of what must have happened  i never learned the truth of the cause of the pleasant valley war or if i did hear it i had no means of recognizing it  all the given causes were plausible and convincing  strange to state there is still secrecy and reticence all over the tonto basin as to the facts of this feud  many descendents of those killed are living there now but no one likes to talk about it  assuredly many of the incidents told me really occurred as for example the terrible one of the two women in the face of relentless enemies saving the bodies of their dead husbands from being devoured by wild hogs  suffice it to say that this romance is true to my conception of the war and i base it upon the setting i learned to know and love so well upon the strange passions of primitive people and upon my instinctive reaction to the facts and rumors that i gathered  zane grey   avalon california     april 1921    chapter i  at the end of a dry uphill ride over barren country jean isbel unpacked to camp at the edge of the cedars where a little rocky canyon green with willow and cottonwood promised water and grass  his animals were tired especially the pack mule that had carried a heavy load and with slow heave of relief they knelt and rolled in the dust  jean experienced something of relief himself as he threw off his chaps  he had not been used to hot dusty glaring days on the barren lands  stretching his long length beside a tiny rill of clear water that tinkled over the red stones he drank thirstily the water was cool but it had an acrid tastean alkali bite that he did not like not since he had left oregon had he tasted clear sweet cold water and he missed it just as he longed for the stately shady forests he had loved  this wild endless arizona land bade fair to earn his hatred  by the time he had leisurely completed his tasks twilight had fallen and coyotes had begun their barking  jean listened to the yelps and to the moan of the cool wind in the cedars with a sense of satisfaction that these lonely sounds were familiar  this cedar wood burned into a pretty fire and the smell of its smoke was newly pleasant  reckon maybe ill learn to like arizona he mused half aloud but ive a hankerin for waterfalls an darkgreen forests must be the indian in me anyway dad needs me bad an i reckon im here for keeps  jean threw some cedar branches on the fire in the light of which he opened his fathers letter hoping by repeated reading to grasp more of its strange portent  it had been two months in reaching him coming by traveler by stage and train and then by boat and finally by stage again  written in lead pencil on a leaf torn from an old ledger it would have been hard to read even if the writing had been more legible  dads writin was always bad but i never saw it so shaky said jean thinking aloud      grass vally arizona     son jeancome home  here is your home and here your needed    when we left oregon we all reckoned you would not be long behind    but its years now  i am growing old son and you was always my    steadiest boy  not that you ever was so dam steady  only your    wildness seemed more for the woods  you take after mother and    your brothers bill and guy take after me  that is the red and    white of it  your part indian jean and that indian i reckon    i am going to need bad  i am rich in cattle and horses  and my    range here is the best i ever seen  lately we have been losing    stock  but that is not all nor so bad  sheepmen have moved into    the tonto and are grazing down on grass vally  cattlemen and    sheepmen can never bide in this country  we have bad times ahead    reckon i have more reasons to worry and need you but you must wait    to hear that by word of mouth  whatever your doing chuck it and    rustle for grass vally so to make here by spring  i am asking you    to take pains to pack in some guns and a lot of shells  and hide    them in your outfit  if you meet anyone when your coming down into    the tonto listen more than you talk  and last son dont let    anything keep you in oregon  reckon you have a sweetheart and    if so fetch her along  with love from your dad     gaston isbel   jean pondered over this letter  judged by memory of his father who had always been selfsufficient it had been a surprise and somewhat of a shock  weeks of travel and reflection had not helped him to grasp the meaning between the lines  yes dads growin old mused jean feeling a warmth and a sadness stir in him  he must be way over sixty  but he never looked old so hes rich now an losin stock an goin to be sheeped off his range  dad could stand a lot of rustlin but not much from sheepmen  the softness that stirred in jean merged into a cold thoughtful earnestness which had followed every perusal of his fathers letter a dark full current seemed flowing in his veins and at times he felt it swell and heat  it troubled him making him conscious of a deeper stronger self opposed to his careless free and dreamy nature  no ties had bound him in oregon except love for the great still forests and the thundering rivers and this love came from his softer side  it had cost him a wrench to leave  and all the way by ship down the coast to san diego and across the sierra madres by stage and so on to this last overland travel by horseback he had felt a retreating of the self that was tranquil and happy and a dominating of this unknown somber self with its menacing possibilities  yet despite a nameless regret and a loyalty to oregon when he lay in his blankets he had to confess a keen interest in his adventurous future a keen enjoyment of this stark wild arizona  it appeared to be a different sky stretching in dark starspangled dome over himcloser vaster bluer  the strong fragrance of sage and cedar floated over him with the campfire smoke and all seemed drowsily to subdue his thoughts  at dawn he rolled out of his blankets and pulling on his boots began the day with a zest for the work that must bring closer his calling future  white crackling frost and cold nipping air were the same keen spurs to action that he had known in the uplands of oregon yet they were not wholly the same  he sensed an exhilaration similar to the effect of a strong sweet wine  his horse and mule had fared well during the night having been much refreshed by the grass and water of the little canyon  jean mounted and rode into the cedars with gladness that at last he had put the endless leagues of barren land behind him  the trail he followed appeared to be seldom traveled  it led according to the meager information obtainable at the last settlement directly to what was called the rim and from there grass valley could be seen down in the basin  the ascent of the ground was so gradual that only in long open stretches could it be seen  but the nature of the vegetation showed jean how he was climbing  scant low scraggy cedars gave place to more numerous darker greener bushier ones and these to high fullfoliaged greenberried trees  sage and grass in the open flats grew more luxuriously  then came the pinyons and presently among them the checkerbarked junipers  jean hailed the first pine tree with a hearty slap on the brown rugged bark  it was a small dwarf pine struggling to live  the next one was larger and after that came several and beyond them pines stood up everywhere above the lower trees  odor of pine needles mingled with the other dry smells that made the wind pleasant to jean  in an hour from the first line of pines he had ridden beyond the cedars and pinyons into a slowly thickening and deepening forest  underbrush appeared scarce except in ravines and the ground in open patches held a bleached grass jeans eye roved for sight of squirrels birds deer or any moving creature it appeared to be a dry uninhabited forest  about midday jean halted at a pond of surface water evidently melted snow and gave his animals a drink  he saw a few old deer tracks in the mud and several huge bird tracks new to him which he concluded must have been made by wild turkeys  the trail divided at this pond  jean had no idea which branch he ought to take  reckon it doesnt matter he muttered as he was about to remount  his horse was standing with ears up looking back along the trail  then jean heard a clipclop of trotting hoofs and presently espied a horseman  jean made a pretense of tightening his saddle girths while he peered over his horse at the approaching rider  all men in this country were going to be of exceeding interest to jean isbel  this man at a distance rode and looked like all the arizonians jean had seen he had a superb seat in the saddle and he was long and lean  he wore a huge black sombrero and a soiled red scarf  his vest was open and he was without a coat  the rider came trotting up and halted several paces from jean  hullo stranger he said gruffly  howdy yourself replied jean  he felt an instinctive importance in the meeting with the man  never had sharper eyes flashed over jean and his outfit  he had a dustcolored sunburned face long lean and hard a huge sandy mustache that hid his mouth and eyes of piercing light intensity  not very much hard western experience had passed by this man yet he was not old measured by years when he dismounted jean saw he was tall even for an arizonian  seen your tracks back a ways he said as he slipped the bit to let his horse drink  where bound  reckon im lost all right replied jean  new country for me  shore  i seen thet from your tracks an your last camp  wal where was you headin for before you got lost  the query was deliberately cool with a dry crisp ring  jean felt the lack of friendliness or kindliness in it  grass valley  my names isbel he replied shortly  the rider attended to his drinking horse and presently rebridled him then with long swing of leg he appeared to step into the saddle  shore i knowed you was jean isbel he said  everybody in the tonto has heerd old gass isbel sent fer his boy  well then why did you ask inquired jean bluntly  reckon i wanted to see what youd say  so  all right  but im not carin very much for what you say  their glances locked steadily then and each measured the other by the intangible conflict of spirit  shore thets natural replied the rider  his speech was slow and the motions of his long brown hands as he took a cigarette from his vest kept time with his words  but seein youre one of the isbels ill hev my say whether you want it or not  my names colter an im one of the sheepmen gass isbels riled with  colter  glad to meet you replied jean  an i reckon who riled my father is goin to rile me  shore  if thet wasnt so youd not be an isbel returned colter with a grim little laugh  its easy to see you aint run into any tonto basin fellers yet  wal im goin to tell you thet your old man gabbed like a woman down at greavess store  bragged aboot you an how you could fight an how you could shoot an how you could track a hoss or a man  bragged how youd chase every sheep herder back up on the rim im tellin you because we want you to git our stand right were goin to run sheep down in grass valley  ahuh  well whos we queried jean curtly  whatat  wei mean the sheepmen rangin this rim from black butte to the apache country  colter im a stranger in arizona said jean slowly  i know little about ranchers or sheepmen  its true my father sent for me  its true i dare say that he bragged for he was given to bluster an blow an hes old now  i cant help it if he bragged about me  but if he has an if hes justified in his stand against you sheepmen im goin to do my best to live up to his brag  i get your hunch  shore we understand each other an thets a powerful help  you take my hunch to your old man replied colter as he turned his horse away toward the left  thet trail leadin south is yours  when you come to the rim youll see a bare spot down in the basin  thet ll be grass valley  he rode away out of sight into the woods  jean leaned against his horse and pondered  it seemed difficult to be just to this colter not because of his claims but because of a subtle hostility that emanated from him  colter had the hard face the masked intent the turn of speech that jean had come to associate with dishonest men even if jean had not been prejudiced if he had known nothing of his fathers trouble with these sheepmen and if colter had met him only to exchange glances and greetings still jean would never have had a favorable impression  colter grated upon him roused an antagonism seldom felt  heigho sighed the young man goodby to huntin an fishing dads given me a mans job  with that he mounted his horse and started the pack mule into the righthand trail  walking and trotting he traveled all afternoon toward sunset getting into heavy forest of pine  more than one snow bank showed white through the green sheltered on the north slopes of shady ravines  and it was upon entering this zone of richer deeper forestland that jean sloughed off his gloomy forebodings  these stately pines were not the giant firs of oregon but any lover of the woods could be happy under them  higher still he climbed until the forest spread before and around him like a level park with thicketed ravines here and there on each side  and presently that deceitful level led to a higher bench upon which the pines towered and were matched by beautiful trees he took for spruce  heavily barked with regular spreading branches these conifers rose in symmetrical shape to spear the sky with silver plumes  a graceful graygreen moss waved like veils from the branches  the air was not so dry and it was colder with a scent and touch of snow  jean made camp at the first likely site taking the precaution to unroll his bed some little distance from his fire  under the softly moaning pines he felt comfortable having lost the sense of an immeasurable open space falling away from all around him  the gobbling of wild turkeys awakened jean chugalug chugalug chugalugchug  there was not a great difference between the gobble of a wild turkey and that of a tame one  jean got up and taking his rifle went out into the gray obscurity of dawn to try to locate the turkeys  but it was too dark and finally when daylight came they appeared to be gone  the mule had strayed and what with finding it and cooking breakfast and packing jean did not make a very early start  on this last lap of his long journey he had slowed down he was weary of hurrying the change from weeks in the glaring sun and dustladen wind to this sweet coot darkly green and brown forest was very welcome he wanted to linger along the shaded trail  this day he made sure would see him reach the rim  by and by he lost the trail it had just worn out from lack of use  every now and then jean would cross an old trail and as he penetrated deeper into the forest every damp or dusty spot showed tracks of turkey deer and bear  the amount of bear sign surprised him  presently his keen nostrils were assailed by a smell of sheep and soon he rode into a broad sheep trail  from the tracks jean calculated that the sheep had passed there the day before  an unreasonable antipathy seemed born in him  to be sure he had been prepared to dislike sheep and that was why he was unreasonable  but on the other hand this band of sheep had left a broad bare swath weedless grassless flowerless in their wake  where sheep grazed they destroyed  that was what jean had against them  an hour later he rode to the crest of a long parklike slope where new green grass was sprouting and flowers peeped everywhere  the pines appeared far apart gnarled oak trees showed rugged and gray against the green wall of woods  a white strip of snow gleamed like a moving stream away down in the woods  jean heard the musical tinkle of bells and the baabaa of sheep and the faint sweet bleating of lambs  as he road toward these sounds a dog ran out from an oak thicket and barked at him  next jean smelled a camp fire and soon he caught sight of a curling blue column of smoke and then a small peaked tent  beyond the clump of oaks jean encountered a mexican lad carrying a carbine  the boy had a swarthy pleasant face and to jeans greeting he replied buenas dias  jean understood little spanish and about all he gathered by his simple queries was that the lad was not aloneand that it was lambing time  this latter circumstance grew noisily manifest  the forest seemed shrilly full of incessant baas and plaintive bleats  all about the camp on the slope in the glades and everywhere were sheep  a few were grazing many were lying down most of them were ewes suckling white fleecy little lambs that staggered on their feet  everywhere jean saw tiny lambs just born  their pinpointed bleats pierced the heavier baabaa of their mothers  jean dismounted and led his horse down toward the camp where he rather expected to see another and older mexican from whom he might get information  the lad walked with him  down this way the plaintive uproar made by the sheep was not so loud  hello there called jean cheerfully as he approached the tent no answer was forthcoming  dropping his bridle he went on rather slowly looking for some one to appear  then a voice from one side startled him  mawnin stranger  a girl stepped out from beside a pine  she carried a rifle  her face flashed richly brown but she was not mexican  this fact and the sudden conviction that she had been watching him somewhat disconcerted jean  beg pardonmiss he floundered  didnt expect to see agirl im sort of lostlookin for the riman thought id find a sheep herder whod show me  i cant savvy this boys lingo  while he spoke it seemed to him an intentness of expression a strain relaxed from her face  a faint suggestion of hostility likewise disappeared  jean was not even sure that he had caught it but there had been something that now was gone  shore ill be glad to show yu she said  thanks miss  reckon i can breathe easy now he replied  its a long ride from san diego  hot an dusty  im pretty tired an maybe this woods isnt good medicine to achin eyes  san diego  yure from the coast  yes  jean had doffed his sombrero at sight of her and he still held it rather deferentially perhaps  it seemed to attract her attention  put on yur hat stranger shore i cant recollect when any man bared his haid to me  she uttered a little laugh in which surprise and frankness mingled with a tint of bitterness  jean sat down with his back to a pine and laying the sombrero by his side he looked full at her conscious of a singular eagerness as if he wanted to verify by close scrutiny a first hasty impression if there had been an instinct in his meeting with colter there was more in this  the girl half sat half leaned against a log with the shiny little carbine across her knees  she had a level curious gaze upon him and jean had never met one just like it  her eyes were rather a wide oval in shape clear and steady with shadows of thought in their amberbrown depths  they seemed to look through jean and his gaze dropped first  then it was he saw her ragged homespun skirt and a few inches of brown bare ankles strong and round and crude wornout moccasins that failed to hide the shapeliness of her feet suddenly she drew back her stockingless ankles and illshod little feet when jean lifted his gaze again he found her face half averted and a stain of red in the gold tan of her cheek  that touch of embarrassment somehow removed her from this strong raw wild woodland setting  it changed her poise  it detracted from the curious unabashed almost bold look that he had encountered in her eyes  reckon youre from texas said jean presently  shore am she drawled  she had a lazy southern voice pleasant to hear  howd yuall guess that  anybody can tell a texan  where i came from there were a good many pioneers an ranchers from the old lone star state  ive worked for several  an come to think of it id rather hear a texas girl talk than anybody  did yu know many texas girls she inquired turning again to face him  reckon i didquite a good many  did yu go with them  go with them  reckon you mean keep company  why yes i guess i dida little laughed jean  sometimes on a sunday or a dance once in a blue moon an occasionally a ride  shore that accounts said the girl wistfully  for what asked jean  yur bein a gentleman she replied with force  oh ive not forgotten  i had friends when we lived in texas three years ago shore it seems longer  three miserable years in this damned country  then she bit her lip evidently to keep back further unwitting utterance to a total stranger  and it was that biting of her lip that drew jeans attention to her mouth  it held beauty of curve and fullness and color that could not hide a certain sadness and bitterness  then the whole flashing brown face changed for jean he saw that it was young full of passion and restraint possessing a power which grew on him  this with her shame and pathos and the fact that she craved respect gave a leap to jeans interest  well i reckon you flatter me he said hoping to put her at her ease again  im only a rough hunter an fishermanwoodchopper an horse tracker  never had all the school i needednor near enough company of nice girls like you  am i nice she asked quickly  you sure are he replied smiling  in these rags she demanded with a sudden flash of passion that thrilled him  look at the holes  she showed rips and wornout places in the sleeves of her buckskin blouse through which gleamed a round brown arm  i sew when i have anythin to sew with look at my skirta dirty rag  an i have only one other to my name look again a color tinged her cheeks most becoming and giving the lie to her action  but shame could not check her violence now  a dammedup resentment seemed to have broken out in flood  she lifted the ragged skirt almost to her knees  no stockings  no shoes  how can a girl be nice when she has no clean decent womans clothes to wear  howhow can a girl began jean  see here miss im beggin your pardon forsort of stirrin you to forget yourself a little reckon i understand  you dont meet many strangers an i sort of hit you wrongmakin you feel too muchan talk too much  who an what you are is none of my business  but we met an i reckon somethin has happenedperhaps more to me than to you now let me put you straight about clothes an women  reckon i know most women love nice things to wear an think because clothes make them look pretty that theyre nicer or better  but theyre wrong  youre wrong maybe it d be too much for a girl like you to be happy without clothes  but you can beyou axe just as nice anan finean for all you know a good deal more appealin to some men  stranger yu shore must excuse my temper an the show i made of myself replied the girl with composure  that to say the least was not nice  an i dont want anyone thinkin better of me than i deserve  my mother died in texas an ive lived out heah in this wild countrya girl alone among rough men  meetin yu today makes me see what a hard lot they arean what its done to me  jean smothered his curiosity and tried to put out of his mind a growing sense that he pitied her liked her  are you a sheep herder he asked  shore i am now an then  my father lives back heah in a canyon hes a sheepman  lately theres been herders shot at  just now were short an i have to fill in  but i like shepherdin an i love the woods and the rim rock an all the tonto  if they were all id shore be happy  herders shot at exclaimed jean thoughtfully  by whom an what for  trouble brewin between the cattlemen down in the basin an the sheepmen up on the rim  dad says therell shore be hell to pay i tell him i hope the cattlemen chase him back to texas  then  are you on the ranchers side queried jean trying to pretend casual interest  no  ill always be on my fathers side she replied with spirit but im bound to admit i think the cattlemen have the fair side of the argument  how so  because theres grass everywhere  i see no sense in a sheepman goin out of his way to surround a cattleman an sheep off his range  that started the row  lord knows how itll end  for most all of them heah are from texas  so i was told replied jean  an i heard most all these texans got run out of texas  any truth in that  shore i reckon there is she replied seriously  but stranger it might not be healthy for yu to say that anywhere  my dad for one was not run out of texas  shore i never can see why he came heah hes accumulated stock but hes not rich nor so well off as he was back home  are you goin to stay here always queried jean suddenly  if i do so it ll be in my grave she answered darkly  but whats the use of thinkin  people stay places until they drift away  yu can never tell well stranger this talk is keepin yu  she seemed moody now and a note of detachment crept into her voice jean rose at once and went for his horse  if this girl did not desire to talk further he certainly had no wish to annoy her  his mule had strayed off among the bleating sheep  jean drove it back and then led his horse up to where the girl stood  she appeared taller and though not of robust build she was vigorous and lithe with something about her that fitted the place  jean was loath to bid her goodby  which way is the rim he asked turning to his saddle girths  south she replied pointing  its only a mile or so  ill walk down with yu suppose yure on the way to grass valley  yes ive relatives there he returned  he dreaded her next question which he suspected would concern his name  but she did not ask  taking up her rifle she turned away  jean strode ahead to her side  reckon if you walk i wont ride  so he found himself beside a girl with the free step of a mountaineer her bare brown head came up nearly to his shoulder  it was a small pretty head graceful well held and the thick hair on it was a shiny soft brown  she wore it in a braid rather untidily and tangled he thought and it was tied with a string of buckskin  altogether her apparel proclaimed poverty  jean let the conversation languish for a little  he wanted to think what to say presently and then he felt a rather vague pleasure in stalking beside her  her profile was straight cut and exquisite in line  from this side view the soft curve of lips could not be seen  she made several attempts to start conversation all of which jean ignored manifestly to her growing constraint  presently jean having decided what he wanted to say suddenly began i like this adventure do you  adventure meetin me in the woods  and she laughed the laugh of youth  shore you must be hard up for adventure stranger  do you like it he persisted and his eyes searched the halfaverted face  i might like it she answered frankly ifif my temper had not made a fool of me  i never meet anyone i care to talk to  why should it not be pleasant to run across some one newsome one strange in this heah wild country  we are as we are said jean simply  i didnt think you made a fool of yourself  if i thought so would i want to see you again  do yu  the brown face flashed on him with surprise with a light he took for gladness  and because he wanted to appear calm and friendly not too eager he had to deny himself the thrill of meeting those changing eyes  sure i do  reckon im overbold on such short acquaintance  but i might not have another chance to tell you so please dont hold it against me  this declaration over jean felt relief and something of exultation he had been afraid he might not have the courage to make it  she walked on as before only with her head bowed a little and her eyes downcast no color but the goldbrown tan and the blue tracery of veins showed in her cheeks  he noticed then a slight swelling quiver of her throat and he became alive to its graceful contour and to how full and pulsating it was how nobly it set into the curve of her shoulder here in her quivering throat was the weakness of her the evidence of her sex the womanliness that belied the mountaineer stride and the grasp of strong brown hands on a rifle  it had an effect on jean totally inexplicable to him both in the strange warmth that stole over him and in the utterance he could not hold back  girl were strangers but what of that  weve met an i tell you it means somethin to me  ive known girls for months an never felt this way  i dont know who you are an i dont care  you betrayed a good deal to me  youre not happy  youre lonely  an if i didnt want to see you again for my own sake i would for yours  some things you said ill not forget soon  ive got a sister an i know you have no brother  an i reckon   at this juncture jean in his earnestness and quite without thought grasped her hand  the contact checked the flow of his speech and suddenly made him aghast at his temerity  but the girl did not make any effort to withdraw it  so jean inhaling a deep breath and trying to see through his bewilderment held on bravely  he imagined he felt a faint warm returning pressure  she was young she was friendless she was human  by this hand in his jean felt more than ever the loneliness of her  then just as he was about to speak again she pulled her hand free  heahs the rim she said in her quaint southern drawl an theres yur tonto basin  jean had been intent only upon the girl  he had kept step beside her without taking note of what was ahead of him  at her words he looked up expectantly to be struck mute  he felt a sheer force a downward drawing of an immense abyss beneath him as he looked afar he saw a black basin of timbered country the darkest and wildest he had ever gazed upon a hundred miles of blue distance across to an unflung mountain range hazy purple against the sky it seemed to be a stupendous gulf surrounded on three sides by bold undulating lines of peaks and on his side by a wall so high that he felt lifted aloft on the run of the sky  southeast yu see the sierra anchas said the girl pointing that notch in the range is the pass where sheep are driven to phoenix an maricopa  those big rough mountains to the south are the mazatzals round to the west is the four peaks range  an yure standin on the rim  jean could not see at first just what the rim was but by shifting his gaze westward he grasped this remarkable phenomenon of nature for leagues and leagues a colossal red and yellow wall a rampart a mountainfaced cliff seemed to zigzag westward  grand and bold were the promontories reaching out over the void  they ran toward the westering sun  sweeping and impressive were the long lines slanting away from them sloping darkly spotted down to merge into the black timber  jean had never seen such a wild and rugged manifestation of natures depths and upheavals  he was held mute  stranger look down said the girl  jeans sight was educated to judge heights and depths and distances this wall upon which he stood sheered precipitously down so far that it made him dizzy to look and then the craggy broken cliffs merged into redslided cedargreened slopes running down and down into gorges choked with forests and from which soared up a roar of rushing waters slope after slope ridge beyond ridge canyon merging into canyonso the tremendous bowl sunk away to its black deceiving depths a wilderness across which travel seemed impossible  wonderful exclaimed jean  indeed it is murmured the girl  shore that is arizona  i reckon i love this  the heights an depthsthe awfulness of its wilderness  an you want to leave it  yes an no  i dont deny the peace that comes to me heah  but not often do i see the basin an for that matter one doesnt live on grand scenery  child even once in a whilethis sight would cure any misery if you only see  im glad i came  im glad you showed it to me first  she too seemed under the spell of a vastness and loneliness and beauty and grandeur that could not but strike the heart  jean took her hand again  girl say you will meet me here he said his voice ringing deep in his ears  shore i will she replied softly and turned to him  it seemed then that jean saw her face for the first time  she was beautiful as he had never known beauty  limned against that scene she gave it lifewild sweet young lifethe poignant meaning of which haunted yet eluded him  but she belonged there  her eyes were again searching his as if for some lost part of herself unrealized never known before wondering wistful hopeful gladthey were eyes that seemed surprised to reveal part of her soul  then her red lips parted  their tremulous movement was a magnet to jean an invisible and mighty force pulled him down to kiss them whatever the spell had been that rude unconscious action broke it  he jerked away as if he expected to be struck girliihe gasped in amaze and suddendawning contritioni kissed youbut i swear it wasnt intentionali never thought  the anger that jean anticipated failed to materialize  he stood breathing hard with a hand held out in unconscious appeal  by the same magic perhaps that had transfigured her a moment past she was now invested again by the older character  shore i reckon my callin yu a gentleman was a little previous she said with a rather dry bitterness  but stranger yure sudden  youre not insulted asked jean hurriedly  oh ive been kissed before  shore men are all alike  theyre not he replied hotly with a subtle rush of disillusion a dulling of enchantment  dont you class me with other men whove kissed you  i wasnt myself when i did it an id have gone on my knees to ask your forgiveness but now i wouldntan i wouldnt kiss you again eithereven if youyou wanted it  jean read in her strange gaze what seemed to him a vague doubt as if she was questioning him  miss i take that back added jean shortly  im sorry  i didnt mean to be rude  it was a mean trick for me to kiss you  a girl alone in the woods whos gone out of her way to be kind to me  i dont know why i forgot my manners  an i ask your pardon  she looked away then and presently pointed far out and down into the basin  theres grass valley  that long gray spot in the black  its about fifteen miles  ride along the rim that way till yu cross a trail shore yu cant miss it  then go down  im much obliged to you replied jean reluctantly accepting what he regarded as his dismissal  turning his horse he put his foot in the stirrup then hesitating he looked across the saddle at the girl her abstraction as she gazed away over the purple depths suggested loneliness and wistfulness  she was not thinking of that scene spread so wondrously before her  it struck jean she might be pondering a subtle change in his feeling and attitude something he was conscious of yet could not define  reckon this is goodby he said with hesitation  adios senor she replied facing him again  she lifted the little carbine to the hollow of her elbow and half turning appeared ready to depart  adios means goodby he queried  yes goodby till tomorrow or goodby forever  take it as yu like  then youll meet me here day after tomorrow  how eagerly he spoke on impulse without a consideration of the intangible thing that had changed him  did i say i wouldnt  no  but i reckoned youd not care to after he replied breaking off in some confusion  shore ill be glad to meet yu  day after tomorrow about midafternoon  right heah  fetch all the news from grass valley  all right  thanks  thatll befine replied jean and as he spoke he experienced a buoyant thrill a pleasant lightness of enthusiasm such as always stirred boyishly in him at a prospect of adventure before it passed he wondered at it and felt unsure of himself he needed to think  stranger shore im not recollectin that yu told me who yu are she said  no reckon i didnt tell he returned  what difference does that make  i said i didnt care who or what you are  cant you feel the same about me  shorei felt that way she replied somewhat nonplussed with the level brown gaze steadily on his face  but now yu make me think  lets meet without knowin any more about each other than we do now  shore  id like that  in this big wild arizona a girlan i reckon a manfeels so insignificant  whats a name anyhow  still people an things have to be distinguished  ill call yu stranger an be satisfiedif yu say its fair for yu not to tell who yu are  fair  no its not declared jean forced to confession  my names jeanjean isbel  isbel she exclaimed with a violent start  shore yu cant be son of old gass isbel ive seen both his sons  he has three replied jean with relief now the secret was out im the youngest  im twentyfour  never been out of oregon till now  on my way  the brown color slowly faded out of her face leaving her quite pale with eyes that began to blaze  the suppleness of her seemed to stiffen  my names ellen jorth she burst out passionately  does it mean anythin to yu  never heard it in my life protested jean  sure i reckoned you belonged to the sheep raisers who re on the outs with my father thats why i had to tell you im jean isbel ellen jorth its strange an pretty reckon i can be just as good aa friend to you  no isbel can ever be a friend to me she said with bitter coldness stripped of her ease and her soft wistfulness she stood before him one instant entirely another girl a hostile enemy  then she wheeled and strode off into the woods  jean in amaze in consternation watched her swiftly draw away with her lithe free step wanting to follow her wanting to call to her but the resentment roused by her suddenly avowed hostility held him mute in his tracks  he watched her disappear and when the brownandgreen wall of forest swallowed the slender gray form he fought against the insistent desire to follow her and fought in vain    chapter ii  but ellen jorths moccasined feet did not leave a distinguishable trail on the springy pine needle covering of the ground and jean could not find any trace of her  a little futile searching to and fro cooled his impulse and called pride to his rescue  returning to his horse he mounted rode out behind the pack mule to start it along and soon felt the relief of decision and action  clumps of small pines grew thickly in spots on the rim making it necessary for him to skirt them at which times he lost sight of the purple basin  every time he came back to an opening through which he could see the wild ruggedness and colors and distances his appreciation of their nature grew on him arizona from yuma to the little colorado had been to him an endless waste of windscoured sunblasted barrenness  this blackforested rockrimmed land of untrodden ways was a world that in itself would satisfy him some instinct in jean called for a lonely wild land into the fastnesses of which he could roam at will and be the other strange self that he had always yearned to be but had never been  every few moments there intruded into his flowing consciousness the flashing face of ellen jorth the way she had looked at him the things she had said  reckon i was a fool he soliloquized with an acute sense of humiliation  she never saw how much in earnest i was  and jean began to remember the circumstances with a vividness that disturbed and perplexed him  the accident of running across such a girl in that lonely place might be out of the ordinarybut it had happened  surprise had made him dull the charm of her appearance the appeal of her manner must have drawn him at the very first but he had not recognized that  only at her words oh ive been kissed before had his feelings been checked in their heedless progress  and the utterance of them had made a difference he now sought to analyze  some personality in him some voice some idea had begun to defend her even before he was conscious that he had arraigned her before the bar of his judgment  such defense seemed clamoring in him now and he forced himself to listen  he wanted in his hurt pride to justify his amazing surrender to a sweet and sentimental impulse  he realized now that at first glance he should have recognized in her look her poise her voice the quality he called thoroughbred  ragged and stained apparel did not prove her of a common sort  jean had known a number of fine and wholesome girls of good family and he remembered his sister  this ellen jorth was that kind of a girl irrespective of her present environment  jean championed her loyally even after he had gratified his selfish pride  it was thencontending with an intangible and stealing glamour unreal and fanciful like the dream of a forbidden enchantmentthat jean arrived at the part in the little woodland drama where he had kissed ellen jorth and had been unrebuked  why had she not resented his action  dispelled was the illusion he had been dreamily and nobly constructing  oh ive been kissed before  the shock to him now exceeded his first dismay  half bitterly she had spoken and wholly scornful of herself or of him or of all men  for she had said all men were alike  jean chafed under the smart of that a taunt every decent man hated  naturally every happy and healthy young man would want to kiss such red sweet lips  but if those lips had been for othersnever for him  jean reflected that not since childish games had he kissed a girluntil this brownfaced ellen jorth came his way he wondered at it  moreover he wondered at the significance he placed upon it  after all was it not merely an accident  why should he remember  why should he ponder  what was the faint deep growing thrill that accompanied some of his thoughts  riding along with busy mind jean almost crossed a wellbeaten trail leading through a pine thicket and down over the rim  jeans pack mule led the way without being driven  and when jean reached the edge of the bluff one look down was enough to fetch him off his horse that trail was steep narrow clogged with stones and as full of sharp corners as a crosscut saw  once on the descent with a packed mule and a spirited horse jean had no time for mind wanderings and very little for occasional glimpses out over the cedar tops to the vast blue hollow asleep under a westering sun  the stones rattled the dust rose the cedar twigs snapped the little avalanches of red earth slid down the ironshod hoofs rang on the rocks this slope had been narrow at the apex in the rim where the trail led down a crack and it widened in fan shape as jean descended he zigzagged down a thousand feet before the slope benched into dividing ridges  here the cedars and junipers failed and pines once more hid the sun  deep ravines were black with brush  from somewhere rose a roar of running water most pleasant to jeans ears  fresh deer and bear tracks covered old ones made in the trail  those timbered ridges were but billows of that tremendous slope that now sheered above jean ending in a magnificent yellow wall of rock greened in niches stained by weather rust carved and cracked and caverned  as jean descended farther the hum of bees made melody the roar of rapid water and the murmur of a rising breeze filled him with the content of the wild  sheepmen like colter and wild girls like ellen jorth and all that seemed promising or menacing in his fathers letter could never change the indian in jean  so he thought  hard upon that conclusion rushed anotherone which troubled with its stinging revelation  surely these influences he had defied were just the ones to bring out in him the indian he had sensed but had never known  the eventful day had brought new and bitter food for jean to reflect upon  the trail landed him in the bowlderstrewn bed of a wide canyon where the huge trees stretched a canopy of foliage which denied the sunlight and where a beautiful brook rushed and foamed  here at last jean tasted water that rivaled his oregon springs  ah he cried that sure is good  dark and shaded and ferny and mossy was this streamway and everywhere were tracks of game from the giant spread of a grizzly bear to the tiny birdlike imprints of a squirrel  jean heard familiar sounds of deer crackling the dead twigs and the chatter of squirrels was incessant  this fragrant cool retreat under the rim brought back to him the dim recesses of oregon forests  after all jean felt that he would not miss anything that he had loved in the cascades  but what was the vague sense of all not being well with himthe essence of a faint regretthe insistence of a hovering shadow  and then flashed again etched more vividly by the repetition in memory a picture of eyes of lipsof something he had to forget  wild and broken as this rolling basin floor had appeared from the rim the reality of traveling over it made that first impression a deceit of distance  down here all was on a big rough broken scale  jean did not find even a few rods of level ground  bowlders as huge as houses obstructed the stream bed spruce trees eight feet thick tried to lord it over the brawny pines the ravine was a veritable canyon from which occasional glimpses through the foliage showed the rim as a lofty redtipped mountain peak  jeans pack mule became frightened at scent of a bear or lion and ran off down the rough trail imperiling jeans outfit  it was not an easy task to head him off nor when that was accomplished to keep him to a trot  but his fright and succeeding skittishness at least made for fast traveling  jean calculated that he covered ten miles under the rim before the character of ground and forest began to change  the trail had turned southeast  instead of gorge after gorge redwalled and choked with forest there began to be rolling ridges some high others were knolls and a thick cedar growth made up for a falling off of pine  the spruce had long disappeared  juniper thickets gave way more and more to the beautiful manzanita and soon on the south slopes appeared cactus and a scrubby live oak  but for the wellbroken trail jean would have fared ill through this tough brush  jean espied several deer and again a coyote and what he took to be a small herd of wild horses  no more turkey tracks showed in the dusty patches  he crossed a number of tiny brooklets and at length came to a place where the trail ended or merged in a rough road that showed evidence of considerable travel  horses sheep and cattle had passed along there that day  this road turned southward and jean began to have pleasurable expectations  the road like the trail led down grade but no longer at such steep angles and was bordered by cedar and pinyon jackpine and juniper mescal and manzanita  quite sharply going around a ridge the road led jeans eye down to a small open flat of marshy or at least grassy ground  this green oasis in the wilderness of red and timbered ridges marked another change in the character of the basin  beyond that the country began to spread out and roll gracefully its darkgreen forest interspersed with grassy parks until jean headed into a long wide graygreen valley surrounded by blackfringed hills  his pulses quickened here  he saw cattle dotting the expanse and here and there along the edge log cabins and corrals  as a village grass valley could not boast of much apparently in the way of population  cabins and houses were widely scattered as if the inhabitants did not care to encroach upon one another  but the one store built of stone and stamped also with the characteristic isolation seemed to jean to be a rather remarkable edifice  not exactly like a fort did it strike him but if it had not been designed for defense it certainly gave that impression especially from the long low side with its dark eyelike windows about the height of a mans shoulder  some rather fine horses were tied to a hitching rail otherwise dust and dirt and age and long use stamped this grass valley store and its immediate environment  jean threw his bridle and getting down mounted the low porch and stepped into the wide open door  a face gray against the background of gloom inside passed out of sight just as jean entered  he knew he had been seen  in front of the long rather lowceiled store were four men all absorbed apparently in a game of checkers  two were playing and two were looking on  one of these a gauntfaced man past middle age casually looked up as jean entered  but the moment of that casual glance afforded jean time enough to meet eyes he instinctively distrusted they masked their penetration  they seemed neither curious nor friendly they saw him as if he had been merely thin air  good evenin said jean  after what appeared to jean a lapse of time sufficient to impress him with a possible deafness of these men the gauntfaced one said howdy isbel  the tone was impersonal dry easy cool laconic and yet it could not have been more pregnant with meaning  jeans sharp sensibilities absorbed much  none of the slouchsombreroed longmustached texansfor so jean at once classed themhad ever seen jean but they knew him and knew that he was expected in grass valley  all but the one who had spoken happened to have their faces in shadow under the widebrimmed black hats  motleygarbed gunbelted dustybooted they gave jean the same impression of latent force that he had encountered in colter  will somebody please tell me where to find my father gaston isbel inquired jean with as civil a tongue as he could command  nobody paid the slightest attention  it was the same as if jean had not spoken  waiting half amused half irritated jean shot a rapid glance around the store  the place had felt bare and jean peering back through gloomy space saw that it did not contain much  dry goods and sacks littered a long rude counter long rough shelves divided their length into stacks of canned foods and empty sections a low shelf back of the counter held a generous burden of cartridge boxes and next to it stood a rack of rifles  on the counter lay open cases of plug tobacco the odor of which was second in strength only to that of rum  jeans swiftroving eye reverted to the men three of whom were absorbed in the greasy checkerboard  the fourth man was the one who had spoken and he now deigned to look at jean  not much flesh was there stretched over his bony powerful physiognomy  he stroked a lean chin with a big mobile hand that suggested more of bridle holding than familiarity with a bucksaw and plow handle  it was a lazy hand  the man looked lazy  if he spoke at all it would be with lazy speech yet jean had not encountered many men to whom he would have accorded more potency to stir in him the instinct of selfpreservation  shore drawled this gauntfaced texan old gass lives aboot a mile down heah  with slow sweep of the big hand he indicated a general direction to the south then appearing to forget his questioner he turned his attention to the game  jean muttered his thanks and striding out he mounted again and drove the pack mule down the road  reckon ive ran into the wrong folds today he said  if i remember dad right he was a man to make an keep friends  somehow ill bet theres goin to be hell  beyond the store were some rather pretty and comfortable homes little ranch houses back in the coves of the hills  the road turned west and jean saw his first sunset in the tonto basin  it was a pageant of purple clouds with silver edges and background of deep rich gold  presently jean met a lad driving a cow  hello johnny he said genially and with a double purpose  my names jean isbel  by golly im lost in grass valley  will you tell me where my dad lives  yep  keep right on an yu caint miss him replied the lad with a bright smile  hes lookin fer yu  how do you know boy queried jean warmed by that smile  aw i know  its all over the valley thet yud ride in terday shore i wus the one thet tole yer dad an he give me a dollar  was he glad to hear it asked jean with a queer sensation in his throat  wal he plumb was  an who told you i was goin to ride in today  i heerd it at the store replied the lad with an air of confidence some sheepmen was talkin to greaves  hes the storekeeper  i was settin outside but i heerd  a mexican come down off the rim terday an he fetched the news  here the lad looked furtively around then whispered  an thet greaser was sent by somebody  i never heerd no more but them sheepmen looked pretty plumb sour  an one of them comin out give me a kick darn him  it shore is the luckedest day fer us cowmen  hows that johnny  wal thats shore a big fight comin to grass valley  my dad says so an he rides fer yer dad  an if

caint fool  aint yu a plumb dead shot  aint yu wussern a grizzly bear in a roughantumble  now aint yu shore  jean bade the flattering lad a rather sober good day and rode on his way  manifestly a reputation somewhat difficult to live up to had preceded his entry into grass valley  jeans first sight of his future home thrilled him through  it was a big low rambling log structure standing well out from a wooded knoll at the edge of the valley  corrals and barns and sheds lay off at the back  to the fore stretched broad pastures where numberless cattle and horses grazed  at sunset the scene was one of rich color prosperity and abundance and peace seemed attendant upon that ranch lusty voices of burros braying and cows bawling seemed welcoming jean a hound bayed  the first cool touch of wind fanned jeans cheek and brought a fragrance of wood smoke and frying ham  horses in the pasture romped to the fence and whistled at these newcomers  jean espied a whitefaced black horse that gladdened his sight  hello whiteface  ill sure straddle you called jean then up the gentle slope he saw the tall figure of his fatherthe same as he had seen him thousands of times bareheaded shirt sleeved striding with long step  jean waved and called to him  hi you prodigal came the answer  yes the voice of his fatherand jeans boyhood memories flashed  he hurried his horse those last few rods  nodad was not the same  his hair shone gray  here i am dad called jean and then he was dismounting  a deep quiet emotion settled over him stilling the hurry the eagerness the pang in his breast  son i shore am glad to see you said his father and wrung his hand wal wal the size of you  shore youve grown any how you favor your mother  jean felt in the iron clasp of hand in the uplifting of the handsome head in the strong fine light of piercing eyes that there was no difference in the spirit of his father  but the old smile could not hide lines and shades strange to jean  dad im as glad as you replied jean heartily  it seems long weve been parted now i see you  are you well dad an all right  not complainin son i can ride all day same as ever he said come  never mind your hosses  theyll be looked after come meet the folks wal wal you got heah at last  on the porch of the house a group awaited jeans coming rather silently he thought  wideeyed children were there very shy and watchful  the dark face of his sister corresponded with the image of her in his memory  she appeared taller more womanly as she embraced him  oh jean jean im glad youve come she cried and pressed him close  jean felt in her a womans anxiety for the present as well as affection for the past  he remembered his aunt mary though he had not seen her for years  his half brothers bill and guy had changed but little except perhaps to grow lean and rangy  bill resembled his father though his aspect was jocular rather than serious  guy was smaller wiry and hard as rock with snapping eyes in a brown still face and he had the bowlegs of a cattleman  both had married in arizona  bills wife kate was a stout comely little woman mother of three of the children  the other wife was young a strapping girl red headed and freckled with wonderful lines of pain and strength in her face  jean remembered as he looked at her that some one had written him about the tragedy in her life  when she was only a child the apaches had murdered all her family  then next to greet jean were the little children all shy yet all manifestly impressed by the occasion  a warmth and intimacy of forgotten home emotions flooded over jean  sweet it was to get home to these relatives who loved him and welcomed him with quiet gladness  but there seemed more  jean was quick to see the shadow in the eyes of the women in that household and to sense a strange reliance which his presence brought  son this heah tonto is a land of milk an honey said his father as jean gazed spellbound at the bounteous supper  jean certainly performed gastronomic feats on this occasion to the delight of aunt mary and the wonder of the children  oh hes starvved to death whispered one of the little boys to his sister they had begun to warm to this stranger uncle  jean had no chance to talk even had he been able to for the mealtime showed a relaxation of restraint and they all tried to tell him things at once  in the bright lamplight his father looked easier and happier as he beamed upon jean  after supper the men went into an adjoining room that appeared most comfortable and attractive  it was long and the width of the house with a huge stone fireplace low ceiling of hewn timbers and walls of the same small windows with inside shutters of wood and homemade table and chairs and rugs  wal jean do you recollect them shootinirons inquired the rancher pointing above the fireplace  two guns hung on the spreading deer antlers there  one was a musket jeans father had used in the war of the rebellion and the other was a long heavy muzzleloading flintlock kentucky rifle with which jean had learned to shoot  reckon i do dad replied jean and with reverent hands and a rush of memory he took the old gun down  jean you shore handle thet old arm some clumsy said guy isbel dryly  and bill added a remark to the effect that perhaps jean had been leading a luxurious and tame life back there in oregon and then added  but i reckon hes packin that sixshooter like a texan  say i fetched a gun or two along with me replied jean jocularly reckon i near broke my poor mules back with the load of shells an guns  dad what was the idea askin me to pack out an arsenal  son shore all shootin arms an such are at a premium in the tonto replied his father  an i was givin you a hunch to come loaded  his cool drawling voice seemed to put a damper upon the pleasantries right there jean sensed the charged atmosphere  his brothers were bursting with utterance about to break forth and his father suddenly wore a look that recalled to jean critical times of days long past but the entrance of the children and the women folk put an end to confidences  evidently the youngsters were laboring under subdued excitement  they preceded their mother the smallest boy in the lead for him this must have been both a dreadful and a wonderful experience for he seemed to be pushed forward by his sister and brother and mother and driven by yearnings of his own  there now lee  say uncle jean what did you fetch us  the lad hesitated for a shy frightened look at jean and then gaining something from his scrutiny of his uncle he toddled forward and bravely delivered the question of tremendous importance  what did i fetch you hey cried jean in delight as he took the lad up on his knee  wouldnt you like to know  i didnt forget lee i remembered you all  oh the job i had packin your bundle of presents now lee make a guess  i dess you fetched a dun replied lee  a dunill bet you mean a gun laughed jean  well you fouryearold texas gunman  make another guess  that appeared too momentous and entrancing for the other two youngsters and adding their shrill and joyous voices to lees they besieged jean  dad wheres my pack cried jean  these young apaches are after my scalp  reckon the boys fetched it onto the porch replied the rancher  guy isbel opened the door and went out  by golly heahs three packs he called  which one do you want jean  its a long heavy bundle all tied up replied jean  guy came staggering in under a burden that brought a whoop from the youngsters and bright gleams to the eyes of the women  jean lost nothing of this  how glad he was that he had tarried in san francisco because of a mental picture of this very reception in faroff wild arizona  when guy deposited the bundle on the floor it jarred the room it gave forth metallic and rattling and crackling sounds  everybody stand back an give me elbow room ordered jean majestically  my good folks i want you all to know this is somethin that doesnt happen often  the bundle you see here weighed about a hundred pounds when i packed it on my shoulder down market street in frisco  it was stolen from me on shipboard i got it back in san diego an licked the thief  it rode on a burro from san diego to yuma an once i thought the burro was lost for keeps it came up the colorado river from yuma to ehrenberg an there went on top of a stage  we got chased by bandits an once when the horses were gallopin hard it near rolled off  then it went on the back of a pack horse an helped wear him out  an i reckon it would be somewhere else now if i hadnt fallen in with a freighter goin north from phoenix to the santa fe trail  the last lap when it sagged the back of a mule was the riskiest an full of the narrowest escapes twice my mule bucked off his pack an left my outfit scattered worst of all my precious bundle made the mule top heavy comin down that place back here where the trail seems to drop off the earth there i was hard put to keep sight of my pack sometimes it was on top an other times the mule  but it got here at last an now ill open it  after this long and impressive harangue which at least augmented the suspense of the women and worked the children into a frenzy jean leisurely untied the many knots round the bundle and unrolled it he had packed that bundle for just such travel as it had sustained three clothbound rifles he laid aside and with them a long very heavy package tied between two thin wide boards  from this came the metallic clink  oo i know what dem is cried lee breaking the silence of suspense  then jean tearing open a long flat parcel spread before the mute rapteyed youngsters such magnificent things as they had never dreamed ofpicture books mouthharps dolls a toy gun and a toy pistol a wonderful whistle and a fox horn and last of all a box of candy  before these treasures on the floor too magical to be touched at first the two little boys and their sister simply knelt that was a sweet full moment for jean yet even that was clouded by the something which shadowed these innocent children fatefully born in a wild place at a wild time  next jean gave to his sister the presents he had brought herbeautiful cloth for a dress ribbons and a bit of lace handkerchiefs and buttons and yards of linen a sewing case and a whole box of spools of thread a comb and brush and mirror and lastly a spanish brooch inlaid with garnets  there ann said jean i confess i asked a girl friend in oregon to tell me some things my sister might like  manifestly there was not much difference in girls ann seemed stunned by this munificence and then awakening she hugged jean in a way that took his breath  she was not a child any more that was certain  aunt mary turned knowing eyes upon jean  reckon you couldnt have pleased ann more  shes engaged jean an where girls are in that state these things mean a heap ann youll be married in that  and she pointed to the beautiful folds of material that ann had spread out  whats this demanded jean  his sisters blushes were enough to convict her and they were mightily becoming too  here aunt mary went on jean heres yours an heres somethin for each of my new sisters  this distribution left the women as happy and occupied almost as the children  it left also another package the last one in the bundle  jean laid hold of it and lifting it he was about to speak when he sustained a little shock of memory quite distinctly he saw two little feet with bare toes peeping out of wornout moccasins and then round bare symmetrical ankles that had been scratched by brush  next he saw ellen jorths passionate face as she looked when she had made the violent action so disconcerting to him  in this happy moment the memory seemed farther off than a few hours  it had crystallized  it annoyed while it drew him  as a result he slowly laid this package aside and did not speak as he had intended to  dad i reckon i didnt fetch a lot for you an the boys continued jean  some knives some pipes an tobacco  an sure the guns  shore youre a regular santa claus jean replied his father wal wal look at the kids  an look at mary  an for the lands sake look at ann  wal wal im gettin old  id forgotten the pretty stuff an gimcracks that mean so much to women  were out of the world heah its just as well youve lived apart from us jean for comin back this way with all that stuff does us a lot of good  i caint say son how obliged i am  my mind has been set on the hard side of life an its shore good to forgetto see the smiles of the women an the joy of the kids  at this juncture a tall young man entered the open door  he looked a rider  all about him even his face except his eyes seemed old but his eyes were young fine soft and dark  how do yuall he said evenly  ann rose from her knees  then jean did not need to be told who this newcomer was  jean this is my friend andrew colmor  jean knew when he met colmors grip and the keen flash of his eyes that he was glad ann had set her heart upon one of their kind  and his second impression was something akin to the one given him in the road by the admiring lad  colmors estimate of him must have been a monument built of anns eulogies  jeans heart suffered misgivings could he live up to the character that somehow had forestalled his advent in grass valley  surely life was measured differently here in the tonto basin  the children bundling their treasures to their bosoms were dragged off to bed in some remote part of the house from which their laughter and voices came back with happy significance  jean forthwith had an interested audience  how eagerly these lonely pioneer people listened to news of the outside world  jean talked until he was hoarse in their turn his hearers told him much that had never found place in the few and short letters he had received since he had been left in oregon not a word about sheepmen or any hint of rustlers jean marked the omission and thought all the more seriously of probabilities because nothing was said  altogether the evening was a happy reunion of a family of which all living members were there present  jean grasped that this fact was one of significant satisfaction to his father  shore were all goin to live together heah he declared  i started this range  i call most of this valley mine  well run up a cabin for ann soon as she says the word  an you jean wheres your girl i shore told you to fetch her  dad i didnt have one replied jean  wal i wish you had returned the rancher  youll go courtin one of these tonto hussies that i might object to  why father theres not a girl in the valley jean would look twice at interposed ann isbel with spirit  jean laughed the matter aside but he had an uneasy memory  aunt mary averred after the manner of relatives that jean would play havoc among the women of the settlement  and jean retorted that at least one member of the isbels should hold out against folly and fight and love and marriage the agents which had reduced the family to these few present  ill be the last isbel to go under he concluded  son youre talkin wisdom said his father  an shore that reminds me of the uncle youre named after  jean isbel  wal he was my youngest brother an shore a fireeater  our mother was a french creole from louisiana an jean must have inherited some of his fightin nature from her  when the war of the rebellion started jean an i enlisted i was crippled before we ever got to the front  but jean went through three years before he was killed  his company had orders to fight to the last man  an jean fought an lived long enough just to be that last man  at length jean was left alone with his father  reckon youre used to bunkin outdoors queried the rancher rather abruptly  most of the time replied jean  wal theres room in the house but i want you to sleep out come get your beddin an gun ill show you  they went outside on the porch where jean shouldered his roll of tarpaulin and blankets  his rifle in its saddle sheath leaned against the door  his father took it up and half pulling it out looked at it by the starlight  fortyfour eh  wal wal theres shore no better if a man can hold straight  at the moment a big gray dog trotted up to sniff at jean  an heahs your bunkmate shepp hes part lofer jean  his mother was a favorite shepherd dog of mine his father was a big timber wolf that took us two years to kill  some bad wolf packs runnin this basin  the night was cold and still darkly bright under moon and stars the smell of hay seemed to mingle with that of cedar  jean followed his father round the house and up a gentle slope of grass to the edge of the cedar line  here several trees with lowsweeping thick branches formed a dense impenetrable shade  son your uncle jean was scout for liggett one of the greatest rebels the south had said the rancher  an youre goin to be scout for the isbels of tonto  reckon youll find it most as hot as your uncle did spread your bed inside  you can see out but no one can see you  reckon theres been some queer happenins round heah lately  if shepp could talk hed shore have lots to tell us  bill an guy have been sleepin out trailin strange hoss tracks an all that  but shore whoevers been prowlin around heah was too sharp for them  some bad crafty lightsteppin woodsmen round heah jean three mawnins ago just after daylight i stepped out the back door an some one of these sneaks im talkin aboot took a shot at me  missed my head a quarter of an inch tomorrow ill show you the bullet hole in the doorpost  an some of my gray hairs that re stickin in it  dad ejaculated jean with a hand outstretched  thats awful you frighten me  no time to be scared replied his father calmly  theyre shore goin to kill me  thats why i wanted you home in there with you now  go to sleep  you shore can trust shepp to wake you if he gets scent or sound an good night my son  im sayin that ill rest easy tonight  jean mumbled a good night and stood watching his fathers shining white head move away under the starlight  then the tall dark form vanished a door closed and all was still  the dog shepp licked jeans hand jean felt grateful for that warm touch  for a moment he sat on his roll of bedding his thought still locked on the shuddering revelation of his fathers words theyre shore goin to kill me  the shock of inaction passed  jean pushed his pack in the dark opening and crawling inside he unrolled it and made his bed  when at length he was comfortably settled for the night he breathed a long sigh of relief  what bliss to relax  a throbbing and burning of his muscles seemed to begin with his rest  the cool starlit night the smell of cedar the moan of wind the silencean were real to his senses  after long weeks of long arduous travel he was home  the warmth of the welcome still lingered but it seemed to have been pierced by an icy thrust  what lay before him  the shadow in the eyes of his aunt in the younger fresher eyes of his sisterjean connected that with the meaning of his fathers tragic words  far past was the morning that had been so keen the breaking of camp in the sunlit forest the riding down the brown aisles under the pines the music of bleating lambs that had called him not to pass by thought of ellen jorth recurred  had he met her only that morning she was up there in the forest asleep under the starlit pines who was she  what was her story  that savage fling of her skirt her bitter speech and passionate flaming facethey haunted jean they were crystallizing into simpler memories growing away from his bewilderment and therefore at once sweeter and more doubtful maybe she meant differently from what i thought jean soliloquized anyway she was honest  both shame and thrill possessed him at the recall of an insidious ideadare he go back and find her and give her the last package of gifts he had brought from the city  what might they mean to poor ragged untidy beautiful ellen jorth  the idea grew on jean it could not be dispelled  he resisted stubbornly it was bound to go to its fruition  deep into his mind had sunk an impression of her needa material need that brought spirit and pride to abasement  from one picture to another his memory wandered from one speech and act of hers to another choosing selecting casting aside until clear and sharp as the stars shone the words oh ive been kissed before that stung him now  by whom  not by one man but by several by many she had meant  pshaw he had only been sympathetic and drawn by a strange girl in the woods  tomorrow he would forget  work there was for him in grass valley  and he reverted uneasily to the remarks of his father until at last sleep claimed him  a cold nose against his cheek a low whine awakened jean  the big dog shepp was beside him keen wary intense  the night appeared far advanced toward dawn  far away a cock crowed the nearathand one answered in clarion voice  what is it shepp whispered jean and he sat up  the dog smelled or heard something suspicious to his nature but whether man or animal jean could not tell    chapter iii  the morning star large intensely bluewhite magnificent in its dominance of the clear night sky hung over the dim dark valley ramparts the moon had gone down and all the other stars were wan pale ghosts  presently the strained vacuum of jeans ears vibrated to a low roar of many hoofs  it came from the open valley along the slope to the south  shepp acted as if he wanted the word to run  jean laid a hand on the dog  hold on shepp he whispered  then hauling on his boots and slipping into his coat jean took his rifle and stole out into the open  shepp appeared to be well trained for it was evident that he had a strong natural tendency to run off and hunt for whatever had roused him  jean thought it more than likely that the dog scented an animal of some kind  if there were men prowling around the ranch shepp might have been just as vigilant but it seemed to jean that the dog would have shown less eagerness to leave him or none at all  in the stillness of the morning it took jean a moment to locate the direction of the wind which was very light and coming from the south in fact that little breeze had borne the low roar of trampling hoofs jean circled the ranch house to the right and kept along the slope at the edge of the cedars  it struck him suddenly how well fitted he was for work of this sort  all the work he had ever done except for his few years in school had been in the open  all the leisure he had ever been able to obtain had been given to his ruling passion for hunting and fishing  love of the wild had been born in jean  at this moment he experienced a grim assurance of what his instinct and his training might accomplish if directed to a stern and daring end  perhaps his father understood this perhaps the old texan had some little reason for his confidence  every few paces jean halted to listen  all objects of course were indistinguishable in the darkgray obscurity except when he came close upon them  shepp showed an increasing eagerness to bolt out into the void  when jean had traveled half a mile from the house he heard a scattered trampling of cattle on the run and farther out a low strangled bawl of a calf  ahuh muttered jean  cougar or some varmint pulled down that calf  then he discharged his rifle in the air and yelled with all his might  it was necessary then to yell again to hold shepp back  thereupon jean set forth down the valley and tramped out and across and around as much to scare away whatever had been after the stock as to look for the wounded calf  more than once he heard cattle moving away ahead of him but he could not see them  jean let shepp go hoping the dog would strike a trail  but shepp neither gave tongue nor came back  dawn began to break and in the growing light jean searched around until at last he stumbled over a dead calf lying in a little bare wash where water ran in wet seasons  big wolf tracks showed in the soft earth  lofers said jean as he knelt and just covered one track with his spread hand  we had wolves in oregon but not as big as these wonder where that halfwolf dog shepp went  wonder if he can be trusted where wolves are concerned ill bet not if theres a shewolf runnin around  jean found tracks of two wolves and he trailed them out of the wash then lost them in the grass  but guided by their direction he went on and climbed a slope to the cedar line where in the dusty patches he found the tracks again  not scared much he muttered as he noted the slow trotting tracks  well you old gray lofers were goin to clash  jean knew from many a futile hunt that wolves were the wariest and most intelligent of wild animals in the quest  from the top of a low foothill he watched the sun rise and then no longer wondered why his father waxed eloquent over the beauty and location and luxuriance of this grassy valley  but it was large enough to make rich a good many ranchers  jean tried to restrain any curiosity as to his fathers dealings in grass valley until the situation had been made clear  moreover jean wanted to love this wonderful country  he wanted to be free to ride and hunt and roam to his hearts content and therefore he dreaded hearing his fathers claims  but jean threw off forebodings nothing ever turned out so badly as it presaged  he would think the best until certain of the worst  the morning was gloriously bright and already the frost was glistening wet on the stones  grass valley shone like burnished silver dotted with innumerable black spots burros were braying their discordant messages to one another the colts were romping in the fields stallions were whistling cows were bawling  a cloud of blue smoke hung low over the ranch house slowly wafting away on the wind  far out in the valley a dark group of horsemen were riding toward the village  jean glanced thoughtfully at them and reflected that he seemed destined to harbor suspicion of all men new and strange to him  above the distant village stood the darkly green foothills leading up to the craggy slopes and these ending in the rim a red blackfringed mountain front beautiful in the morning sunlight lonely serene and mysterious against the level skyline  mountains ranges distances unknown to jean always called to himto come to seek to explore to find but no wild horizon ever before beckoned to him as this one  and the subtle vague emotion that had gone to sleep with him last night awoke now hauntingly it took effort to dispel the desire to think to wonder  upon his return to the house he went around on the valley side so as to see the place by light of day  his father had built for permanence and evidently there had been three constructive periods in the history of that long substantial picturesque log house but few nails and little sawed lumber and no glass had been used strong and skillful hands axes and a crosscut saw had been the prime factors in erecting this habitation of the isbels  good mawnin son called a cheery voice from the porch  shore weall heard you shoot an the crack of that fortyfour was as welcome as may flowers  bill isbel looked up from a task over a saddle girth and inquired pleasantly if jean ever slept of nights  guy isbel laughed and there was warm regard in the gaze he bent on jean  you old indian he drawled slowly  did you get a bead on anythin  no  i shot to scare away what i found to be some of your lofers replied jean  i heard them pullin down a calf  an i found tracks of two whoppin big wolves  i found the dead calf too  reckon the meat can be saved  dad you must lose a lot of stock here  wal son you shore hit the nail on the haid replied the rancher what with lions an bears an lofersan twofooted lofers of another breedive lost five thousand dollars in stock this last year  dad  you dont mean it exclaimed jean in astonishment to him that sum represented a small fortune  i shore do answered his father  jean shook his head as if he could not understand such an enormous loss where there were keen ablebodied men about  but thats awful dad how could it happen  where were your herders an cowboys an bill an guy  bill isbel shook a vehement fist at jean and retorted in earnest having manifestly been hit in a sore spot  where was me an guy huh wal my oregon brother we was heah all year sleepin more or less aboot three hours out of every twentyfourridin our boots offan we couldnt keep down that loss  jean youall have a mighty tumble comin to you out heah said guy complacently  listen son spoke up the rancher  you want to have some hunches before you figure on our troubles  theres two or three packs of lofers an in winter time they are hell to deal with  lions thick as bees an shore bad when the snows on  bears will kill a cow now an then  an whenever an old silvertip comes mozyin across from the mazatzals he kills stock  im in with half a dozen cattlemen we all work together an the whole outfit caint keep these vermints down then two years ago the hash knife gang come into the tonto  hash knife gang  what a pretty name replied jean  whore they  rustlers son  an shore the real old texas brand  the old lone star state got too hot for them an they followed the trail of a lot of other texans who needed a healthier climate  some two hundred texans around heah jean an maybe a matter of three hundred inhabitants in the tonto all told good an bad  reckon its aboot half an half  a cheery call from the kitchen interrupted the conversation of the men  you come to breakfast  during the meal the old rancher talked to bill and guy about the days order of work and from this jean gathered an idea of what a big cattle business his father conducted  after breakfast jeans brothers manifested keen interest in the new rifles  these were unwrapped and cleaned and taken out for testing  the three rifles were fortyfour calibre winchesters the kind of gun jean had found most effective he tried them out first and the shots he made were satisfactory to him and amazing to the others  bill had used an old henry rifle guy did not favor any particular rifle  the rancher pinned his faith to the famous old singleshot buffalo gun mostly called needle gun wal reckon id better stick to mine  shore you caint teach an old dog new tricks  but you boys may do well with the fortyfours pack em on your saddles an practice when you see a coyote  jean found it difficult to convince himself that this interest in guns and marksmanship had any sinister propulsion back of it  his father and brothers had always been this way  rifles were as important to pioneers as plows and their skillful use was an achievement every frontiersman tried to attain  friendly rivalry had always existed among the members of the isbel family even ann isbel was a good shot but such proficiency in the use of firearmsand life in the open that was correlative with ithad not dominated them as it had jean bill and guy isbel were born cattlemenchips of the old block jean began to hope that his fathers letter was an exaggeration and particularly that the fatalistic speech of last night they are goin to kill me was just a moody inclination to see the worst side still even as jean tried to persuade himself of this more hopeful view he recalled many references to the peculiar reputation of texans for gunthrowing for feuds for neverending hatreds  in oregon the isbels had lived among industrious and peaceful pioneers from all over the states to be sure the life had been rough and primitive and there had been fights on occasions though no isbel had ever killed a man  but now they had become fixed in a wilder and sparsely settled country among men of their own breed  jean was afraid his hopes had only sentiment to foster them  nevertheless be forced back a strange brooding mental state and resolutely held up the brighter side  whatever the evil conditions existing in grass valley they could be met with intelligence and courage with an absolute certainty that it was inevitable they must pass away  jean refused to consider the old fatal law that at certain wild times and wild places in the west certain men had to pass away to change evil conditions  wal jean ride around the range with the boys said the rancher meet some of my neighbors jim blaisdell in particular  take a look at the cattle  an pick out some hosses for yourself  ive seen one already declared jean quickly  a black with white face  ill take him  shore you know a hoss  to my eye hes my pick  but the boys dont agree  bill specially has degenerated into a fancier of pitchin hosses  ann can ride that black  you try him this mawnin an son enjoy yourself  true to his first impression jean named the black horse whiteface and fell in love with him before ever he swung a leg over him whiteface appeared spirited yet gentle  he had been trained instead of being broken  of hard hits and quirts and spurs he had no experience  he liked to do what his rider wanted him to do  a hundred or more horses grazed in the grassy meadow and as jean rode on among them it was a pleasure to see stallions throw heads and ears up and whistle or snort  whole troops of colts and twoyearolds raced with flying tails and manes  beyond these pastures stretched the range and jean saw the graygreen expanse speckled by thousands of cattle  the scene was inspiring jeans brothers led him all around meeting some of the herders and riders employed on the ranch one of whom was a burly grizzled man with eyes reddened and narrowed by much riding in wind and sun and dust his name was evans and he was father of the lad whom jean had met near the village  everts was busily skinning the calf that had been killed by the wolves  see heah yu jean isbel said everts it shore was aboot time yu come home  weall heahs yu hev an eye fer tracks wal mebbe yu can kill old gray the lofer thet did this job hes pulled down nine calves as yearlins this last two months thet i know of  an weve not hed the spring roundup  grass valley widened to the southeast  jean would have been backward about estimating the square miles in it  yet it was not vast acreage so much as rich pasture that made it such a wonderful range  several ranches lay along the western slope of this section  jean was informed that open parks and swales and little valleys nestling among the foothills wherever there was water and grass had been settled by ranchers  every summer a few new families ventured in  blaisdell struck jean as being a lionlike type of texan both in his broad bold face his huge head with its upstanding tawny hair like a mane and in the speech and force that betokened the nature of his heart  he was not as old as jeans father  he had a rolling voice with the same drawling intonation characteristic of all texans and blue eyes that still held the fire of youth  quite a marked contrast he presented to the lean rangy hardjawed intenteyed men jean had begun to accept as texans  blaisdell took time for a curious scrutiny and study of jean that frank and kindly as it was and evidently the adjustment of impressions gotten from hearsay yet bespoke the attention of one used to judging men for himself and in this particular case having reasons of his own for so doing  wal youre like your sister ann said blaisdell  which you may take as a compliment young man  both of you favor your mother but youre an isbel  back in texas there are men who never wear a glove on their right hands an shore i reckon if one of them met up with you sudden hed think some graves had opened an hed go for his gun  blaisdells laugh pealed out with deep pleasant roll  thus he planted in jeans sensitive mind a significant thoughtprovoking idea about the pastandgone isbels  his further remarks likewise were exceedingly interesting to jean the settling of the tonto basin by texans was a subject often in dispute  his own father had been in the first party of adventurous pioneers who had traveled up from the south to cross over the reno pass of the mazatzals into the basin  newcomers from outside get impressions of the tonto accordin to the first settlers they meet declared blaisdell  an shore its my belief these first impressions never change just so strong they are  wal ive heard my father say there were men in his wagon train that got run out of texas but he swore he wasnt one of them  so i reckon that sort of talk held good for twenty years an for all the texans who emigrated except of course such notorious rustlers as daggs an men of his ilk  shore weve got some bad men heah  theres no law  possession used to mean more than it does now  daggs an his hash knife gang have begun to hold forth with a high hand  no small rancher can keep enough stock to pay for his labor  at the time of which blaisdell spoke there were not many sheepmen and cattlemen in the tonto considering its vast area  but these on account of the extreme wildness of the broken country were limited to the comparatively open grass valley and its adjacent environs naturally as the inhabitants increased and stock raising grew in proportion the grazing and water rights became matters of extreme importance  sheepmen ran their flocks up on the rim in summer time and down into the basin in winter time  a sheepman could throw a few thousand sheep round a cattlemans ranch and ruin him  the range was free  it was as fair for sheepmen to graze their herds anywhere as it was for cattlemen  this of course did not apply to the few acres of cultivated ground that a rancher could call his own but very few cattle could have been raised on such limited area  blaisdell said that the sheepmen were unfair because they could have done just as well though perhaps at more labor by keeping to the ridges and leaving the open valley and little flats to the ranchers  formerly there had been room enough for all now the grazing ranges were being encroached upon by sheepmen newly come to the tonto  to blaisdells way of thinking the rustler menace was more serious than the sheepingoff of the range for the simple reason that no cattleman knew exactly who the rustlers were and for the more complex and significant reason that the rustlers did not steal sheep  texas was overstocked with bad men an fine steers concluded blaisdell  most of the first an some of the last have struck the tonto  the sheepmen have now got distributin points for wool an sheep at maricopa an phoenix  theyre shore waxin strong an bold  ahuh  an whats likely to come of this mess queried jean  ask your dad replied blaisdell  i will  but i reckon id be obliged for your opinion  wal short an sweet its this texas cattlemen will never allow the range they stocked to be overrun by sheepmen  whos this man greaves went on jean  never run into anyone like him  greaves is hard to figure  hes a snaky customer in deals  but he seems to be good to the poor people round heah  says hes from missouri  haha  hes as much texan as i am  he rode into the tonto without even a pack to his name  an presently he builds his stone house an freights supplies in from phoenix  appears to buy an sell a good deal of stock  for a while it looked like he was steerin a middle course between cattlemen an sheepmen  both sides made a rendezvous of his store where he heard the grievances of each laterly hes leanin to the sheepmen  nobody has accused him of that yet  but its time some cattleman called his bluff  of course there are honest an square sheepmen in the basin queried jean  yes an some of them are not unreasonable  but the new fellows that dropped in on us the last few yeartheyre the ones were goin to clash with  thissheepman jorth went on jean in slow hesitation as if compelled to ask what he would rather not learn  jorth must be the leader of this sheep faction thats harryin us ranchers  he doesnt make threats or roar around like some of them but he goes on raisin an buyin more an more sheep  an his herders have been grazin down all around us this winter  jorths got to be reckoned with  who is he  wal i dont know enough to talk aboot  your dad never said so but i think he an jorth knew each other in texas years ago  i never saw jorth but once  that was in greavess barroom  your dad an jorth met that day for the first time in this country  wal ive not known men for nothin  they just stood stiff an looked at each other your dad was aboot to draw  but jorth made no sign to throw a gun  jean saw the growing and weaving and thickening threads of a tangle that had already involved him  and the sudden pang of regret he sustained was not wholly because of sympathies with his own people  the other day back up in the woods on the rim i ran into a sheepman who said his name was colter  who is he  colter  shore hes a new one  whatd he look like  jean described colter with a readiness that spoke volumes for the vividness of his impressions  i dont know him replied blaisdell  but that only goes to prove my contentionany fellow runnin wild in the woods can say hes a sheepman  colter surprised me by callin me by my name continued jean our little talk wasnt exactly friendly  he said a lot about my bein sent for to run sheep herders out of the country  shore thats all over replied blaisdell seriously  youre a marked man already  what started such rumor  shore you caint prove it by me  but its not taken as rumor its got to the sheepmen as hard as bullets  ahuh  that accunts for colters seemin a little sore under the collar  well he said they were goin to run sheep over grass valley an for me to take that hunch to my dad  blaisdell had his chair tilted back and his heavy boots against a post of the porch  down he thumped  his neck corded with a sudden rush of blood and his eyes changed to blue fire  the hell he did he ejaculated in furious amaze  jean gauged the brooding rankling hurt of this old cattleman by his sudden break from the cool easy texan manner  blaisdell cursed under his breath swung his arms violently as if to throw a last doubt or hope aside and then relapsed to his former state  he laid a brown hand on jeans knee  two years ago i called the cards he said quietly  it means a grass valley war  not until late that afternoon did jeans father broach the subject uppermost in his mind  then at an opportune moment he drew jean away into the cedars out of sight  son i shore hate to make your homecomin unhappy he said with evidence of agitation but so help me god i have to do it  dad you called me prodigal an i reckon you were right  ive shirked my duty to you  im ready now to make up for it replied jean feelingly  wal wal shore thats finespoken my boy lets set down heah an have a long talk  first off what did jim blaisdell tell you  briefly jean outlined the neighbor ranchers conversation  then jean recounted his experience with colter and concluded with blaisdells reception of the sheepmans threat  if jean expected to see his father rise up like a lion in his wrath he made a huge mistake  this news of colter and his talk never struck even a spark from gaston isbel  wal he began thoughtfully reckon there are only two points in jims talk i need touch on  theres shore goin to be a grass valley war  an jims idea of the cause of it seems to be pretty much the same as that of all the other cattlemen  it ll go down a black blot on the history page of the tonto basin as a war between rival sheepmen an cattlemen  same old fight over water an grass  jean my son that is wrong  it ll not be a war between sheepmen an cattlemen but a war of honest ranchers against rustlers maskin as sheepraisers  mind you i dont belittle the trouble between sheepmen an cattlemen in arizona  its real an its vital an its serious it ll take law an order to straighten out the grazin question some day the government will keep sheep off of cattle ranges so get things right in your mind my son  you can trust your dad to tell the absolute truth  in this fight that ll wipe out some of the isbelsmaybe all of themyoure on the side of justice an right knowin that a man can fight a hundred times harder than he who knows he is a liar an a thief  the old rancher wiped his perspiring face and breathed slowly and deeply  jean sensed in him the rise of a tremendous emotional strain wonderingly he watched the keen lined face  more than material worries were at the root of brooding mounting thoughts in his fathers eyes  now next take what jim said aboot your comin to chase these sheepherders out of the valley jean i started that talk i had my tricky reasons  i know these greaser sheepherders an i know the respect texans have for a gunman  some say i bragged some say im an old fool in his dotage ravin aboot a favorite son but they are people who hate me an are afraid  true son i talked with a purpose but shore i was mighty cold an steady when i did it my feelin was that youd do what id do if i were thirty years younger no i reckoned youd do more  for i figured on your blood  jean youre indian an texas an french an youve trained yourself in the oregon woods  when you were only a boy few marksmen i ever knew could beat you an i never saw your equal for eye an ear for trackin a hoss for all the gifts that make a woodsman wal rememberin this an seein the trouble ahaid for the isbels i just broke out whenever i had a chance  i bragged before men id reason to believe would take my words deep  for instance not long ago i missed some stock an happenin into greavess place one saturday night i shore talked loud his barroom was full of men an some of them were in my black book greaves took my talk a little testy  he said wal gass mebbe youre right aboot some of these cattle thieves livin among us but aint they jest as liable to be some of your friends or relatives as ted meekers or mine or any one around heah  that was where greaves an me fell out  i yelled at him no by god theyre not my record heah an that of my people is open  the least i can say for you greaves an your crowd is that your records fade away on dim trails  then he said nastylike wal if you could work out all the dim trails in the tonto youd shore be surprised  an then i roared  shore that was the chance i was lookin for  i swore the trails he hinted of would be tracked to the holes of the rustlers who made them  i told him i had sent for you an when you got heah these slippery mysterious thieves whoever they were would shore have hell to pay  greaves said he hoped so but he was afraid i was partial to my indian son  then we had hot words  blaisdell got between us when i was leavin i took a partin fling at him  greaves you ought to know the isbels considerin youre from texas  maybe youve got reasons for throwin taunts at my claims for my son jean  yes hes got indian in him an that ll be the worse for the men who will have to meet him  im tellin you greaves jean isbel is the black sheep of the family  if you ride down his record youll find hes shore in line to be another poggin or reddy kingfisher or hardin or any of the texas gunmen you ought to remember greaves there are men rubbin elbows with you right heah that my indian son is goin to track down  jean bent his head in stunned cognizance of the notoriety with which his father had chosen to affront any and all tonto basin men who were under the ban of his suspicion  what a terrible reputation and trust to have saddled upon him  thrills and strange heated sensations seemed to rush together inside jean forming a hot ball of fire that threatened to explode  a retreating self made feeble protests he saw his own pale face going away from this older grimmer man  son if i could have looked forward to anythin but blood spillin id never have given you such a name to uphold continued the rancher what im goin to tell you now is my secret  my other sons an ann have never heard it  jim blaisdell suspects theres somethin strange but he doesnt know  ill shore never tell anyone else but you an you must promise to keep my secret now an after i am gone  i promise said jean  wal an now to get it out began his father breathing hard his face twitched and his hands clenched  the sheepman heah i have to reckon with is lee jorth a lifelong enemy of mine  we were born in the same town played together as children an fought with each other as boys  we never got along together  an we both fell in love with the same girl  it was nip an tuck for a while ellen sutton belonged to one of the old families of the south she was a beauty an much courted an i reckon it was hard for her to choose  but i won her an we became engaged  then the war broke out  i enlisted with my brother jean  he advised me to marry ellen before i left  but i would not that was the blunder of my life soon after our partin her letters ceased to come  but i didnt distrust her  that was a terrible time an all was confusion then i got crippled an put in a hospital  an in aboot a year i was sent back home  at this juncture jean refrained from further gaze at his fathers face  lee jorth had gotten out of goin to war went on the rancher in lower thicker voice  hed married my sweetheart ellen i knew the story long before i got well  he had run after her like a hound after a hare an ellen married him  wal when i was able to get aboot i went to see jorth an ellen  i confronted them i had to know why she had gone back on me  lee jorth hadnt changed any with all his good fortune  hed made ellen believe in my dishonor but i reckon lies or no lies ellen sutton was faithless  in my absence he had won her away from me  an i saw that she loved him as she never had me  i reckon that killed all my generosity  if shed been imposed upon an weaned away by his lies an had regretted me a little id have forgiven perhaps  but she worshiped him  she was his slave  an i wal i learned what hate was  the war ruined the suttons same as so many southerners  lee jorth went in for raisin cattle  hed gotten the sutton range an after a few years he began to accumulate stock  in those days every cattleman was a little bit of a thief  every cattleman drove in an branded calves he couldnt swear was his  wal the isbels were the strongest cattle raisers in that country  an i laid a trap for lee jorth caught him in the act of brandin calves of mine id marked an i proved him a thief  i made him a rustler  i ruined him  we met once but jorth was one texan not strong on the draw at least against an isbel  he left the country  he had friends an relatives an they started him at stock raisin again  but he began to gamble an he got in with a shady crowd  he went from bad to worse an then he came back home  when i saw the change in proud beautiful ellen sutton an how she still worshiped jorth it shore drove me near mad between pity an hate wal i reckon in a texan hate outlives any other feelin there came a strange turn of the wheel an my fortunes changed like most young bloods of the day i drank an gambled  an one night i run across jorth an a cardsharp friend  he fleeced me  we quarreled guns were thrown  i killed my man aboot that period the texas rangers had come into existence an son when i said i never was run out of texas i wasnt holdin to strict truth  i rode out on a hoss  i went to oregon  there i married soon an there bill an guy were born  their mother did not live long  an next i married your mother jean  she had some indian blood which for all i could see made her only the finer  she was a wonderful woman an gave me the only happiness i ever knew  you remember her of course an those home days in oregon  i reckon i made another great blunder when i moved to arizona  but the cattle country had always called me  i had heard of this wild tonto basin an how texans were settlin there  an jim blaisdell sent me word to comethat this shore was a garden spot of the west  wal it is  an your mother was gone  three years ago lee jorth drifted into the tonto  an strange to me along aboot a year or so after his comin the hash knife gang rode up from texas  jorth went in for raisin sheep  along with some other sheepmen he lives up in the rim canyons  somewhere back in the wild brakes is the hidin place of the hash knife gang  nobody but me i reckon associates colonel jorth as hes called with daggs an his gang  maybe blaisdell an a few others have a hunch  but thats no matter  as a sheepman jorth has a legitimate grievance with the cattlemen  but what could be settled by a square consideration for the good of all an the future jorth will never settle  hell never settle because he is now no longer an honest man  hes in with daggs i caint prove this son but i know it  i saw it in jorths face when i met him that day with greaves  i saw more  i shore saw what he is up to  hed never meet me at an even break  hes dead set on usin this sheep an cattle feud to ruin my family an me even as i ruined him but he means more jean  this will be a war between texans an a bloody war  there are bad men in this tontosome of the worst that didnt get shot in texas  jorth will have some of these fellows now are we goin to wait to be sheeped off our range an to be murdered from ambush  no we are not replied jean quietly  wal come down to the house said the rancher and led the way without speaking until he halted by the door  there he placed his finger on a small hole in the wood at about the height of a mans head jean saw it was a bullet hole and that a few gray hairs stuck to its edges  the rancher stepped closer to the doorpost so that his head was within an inch of the wood  then he looked at jean with eyes in which there glinted dancing specks of fire like wild sparks  son this sneakin shot at me was made three mawnins ago  i recollect movin my haid just when i heard the crack of a rifle  shore was surprised  but i got inside quick  jean scarcely heard the latter part of this speech  he seemed doubled up inwardly in hot and cold convulsions of changing emotion  a terrible hold upon his consciousness was about to break and let go the first shot had been fired and he was an isbel  indeed his father had made him ten times an isbel  blood was thick  his father did not speak to dull ears  this strife of rising tumult in him seemed the effect of years of calm of peace in the woods of dreamy waiting for he knew not what  it was the passionate primitive life in him that had awakened to the call of blood ties  thats aboot all son concluded the rancher  you understand now why i feel theyre goin to kill me  i feel it heah  with solemn gesture he placed his broad hand over his heart  an jean strange whispers come to me at night  it seems like your mother was callin or tryin to warn me  i caint explain these queer whispers  but i know what i know  jorth has his followers  you must have yours replied jean tensely  shore son an i can take my choice of the best men heah replied the rancher with pride  but ill not do that  ill lay the deal before them an let them choose  i reckon it ll not be a longwinded fight  it ll be short an bloody after the way of texans  im lookin to you jean to see that an isbel is the last man  my goddad is there no other way  think of my sister annof my brothers wivesofof other women  dad these damned texas feuds are cruel horrible burst out jean in passionate protest  jean would it be any easier for our women if we let these men shoot us down in cold blood  oh nono i see theres no hope ofof but dad i wasnt thinkin about myself  i dont care  once started illill be what you bragged i was  only its so hard toto give in  jean leaned an arm against the side of the cabin and bowing his face over it he surrendered to the irresistible contention within his breast  and as if with a wrench that strange inward hold broke he let down  he went back  something that was boyish and hopefuland in its place slowly rose the dark tide of his inheritance the savage instinct of selfpreservation bequeathed by his indian mother and the fierce feudal blood lust of his texan father  then as he raised himself gripped by a sickening coldness in his breast he remembered ellen jorths face as she had gazed dreamily down off the rimso soft so different with tremulous lips sad musing with farseeing stare of dark eyes peering into the unknown the instinct of life still unlived  with confused vision and nameless pain jean thought of her  dad its hard onthethe young folks he said bitterly  the sins of the father you know  an the other side  how about jorth has he any children  what a curious gleam of surprise and conjecture jean encountered in his fathers gaze  he has a daughter  ellen jorth  named after her mother  the first time i saw ellen jorth i thought she was a ghost of the girl i had loved an lost  sight of her was like a blade in my side  but the looks of her an what she isthey dont gibe  old as i am my heartbah ellen jorth is a damned hussy  jean isbel went off alone into the cedars  surrender and resignation to his fathers creed should have ended his perplexity and worry his instant and burning resolve to be as his father had represented him should have opened his mind to slow cunning to the craft of the indian to the development of hate  but there seemed to be an obstacle a cloud in the way of vision  a face limned on his memory  those damning words of his fathers had been a shockhow little or great he could not tell  was it only a day since he had met ellen jorth  what had made all the difference  suddenly like a breath the fragrance of her hair came back to him  then the sweet coolness of her lips  jean trembled  he looked around him as if he were pursued or surrounded by eyes by instincts by fears by incomprehensible things  ahuh  that must be what ails me he muttered  the look of heran that kisstheyve gone hard me  i should never have stopped to talk an im to kill her father an leave her to god knows what  something was wrong somewhere  jean absolutely forgot that within the hour he had pledged his manhood his life to a feud which could be blotted out only in blood  if he had understood himself he would have realized that the pledge was no more thrilling and unintelligible in its possibilities than this instinct which drew him irresistibly  ellen jorth  somy dad calls her a damned hussy  sothat explains thethe way she actedwhy she never hit me when i kissed her  an her words so easy an coollike  hussy  that means shes badbad scornful of memaybe disappointed because my kiss was innocent it was i swear  an all she said oh ive been kissed before  jean grew furious with himself for the spreading of a new sensation in his breast that seemed now to ache  had he become infatuated all in a day with this ellen jorth  was he jealous of the men who had the privilege of her kisses  no  but his reply was hot with shame with uncertainty  the thing that seemed wrong was outside of himself a blunder was no crime  to be attracted by a pretty girl in the woodsto yield to an impulse was no disgrace nor wrong  he had been foolish over a girl before though not to such a rash extent  ellen jorth had stuck in his consciousness and with her a sense of regret  then swiftly rang his fathers bitter words the revealing but the looks of her an what she isthey dont gibe  in the import of these words hid the meaning of the wrong that troubled him broodingly he pondered over them  the looks of her  yes she was pretty  but it didnt dawn on me at first  ii was sort of excited  i liked to look at her but didnt think  and now consciously her face was called up infinitely sweet and more impelling for the deliberate memory  flash of brown skin smooth and clear level gaze of dark wide eyes steady bold unseeing red curved lips sad and sweet her strong clean fine face rose before jean eager and wistful one moment softened by dreamy musing thought and the next stormily passionate full of hate full of longing but the more mysterious and beautiful  she looks like that but shes bad concluded jean with bitter finality  i might have fallen in love with ellen jorth ifif shed been different  but the conviction forced upon jean did not dispel the haunting memory of her face nor did it wholly silence the deep and stubborn voice of his consciousness  later that afternoon he sought a moment with his sister  ann did you ever meet ellen jorth he asked  yes but not lately replied ann  well i met her as i was ridin along yesterday  she was herdin sheep went on jean rapidly  i asked her to show me the way to the rim  an she walked with me a mile or so  i cant say the meetin was not interestin at least to me will you tell me what you know about her  sure jean replied his sister with her dark eyes fixed wonderingly and kindly on his troubled face  ive heard a great deal but in this tonto basin i dont believe all i hear  what i know ill tell you i first met ellen jorth two years ago  we didnt know each others names then  she was the prettiest girl i ever saw  i liked her she liked me  she seemed unhappy  the next time we met was at a roundup there were other girls with me and they snubbed her but i left them and went around with her  that snub cut her to the heart  she was lonely  she had no friends  she talked about herselfhow she hated the people but loved arizona  she had nothin fit to wear  i didnt need to be told that shed been used to better things  just when it looked as if we were goin to be friends she told me who she was and asked me my name  i told her  jean i couldnt have hurt her more if id slapped her face  she turned white  she gasped  and then she ran off  the last time i saw her was about a year ago  i was ridin a shortcut trail to the ranch where a friend lived  and i met ellen jorth ridin with a man id never seen  the trail was overgrown and shady  they were ridin close and didnt see me right off  the man had his arm round her she pushed him away  i saw her laugh  then he got hold of her again and was kissin her when his horse shied at sight of mine  they rode by me then  ellen jorth held her head high and never looked at me  ann do you think shes a bad girl demanded jean bluntly  bad  oh jean exclaimed ann in surprise and embarrassment  dad said she was a damned hussy  jean dad hates the jorths  sister im askin you what you think of ellen jorth  would you be friends with her if you could  yes  then you dont believe shes bad  no  ellen jorth is lonely unhappy  she has no mother  she lives alone among rough men  such a girl cant keep men from handlin her and kissin her  maybe shes too free  maybe shes wild  but shes honest jean  you can trust a woman to tell  when she rode past me that day her face was white and proud  she was a jorth and i was an isbel  she hated herselfshe hated me  but no bad girl could look like that  she knows whats said of her all around the valley but she doesnt care  shed encourage gossip  thank you ann replied jean huskily  please keep thisthis meetin of mine with her all to yourself wont you  why jean of course i will  jean wandered away again peculiarly grateful to ann for reviving and upholding something in him that seemed a wavering part of the best of hima chivalry that had demanded to be killed by judgment of a righteous woman  he was conscious of an uplift a gladdening of his spirit  yet the ache remained  more than that he found himself plunged deeper into conjecture doubt  had not the ellen jorth incident ended  he denied his fathers indictment of her and accepted the faith of his sister  reckon thats aboot all as dad says he soliloquized  yet was that all  he paced under the cedars he watched the sun set  he listened to the coyotes  he lingered there after the call for supper until out of the tumult of his conflicting emotions and ponderings there evolved the staggering consciousness that he must see ellen jorth again    chapter iv  ellen jorth hurried back into the forest hotly resentful of the accident that had thrown her in contact with an isbel  disgust filled herdisgust that she had been amiable to a member of the hated family that had ruined her father  the surprise of this meeting did not come to her while she was under the spell of stronger feeling  she walked under the trees swiftly with head erect looking straight before her and every step seemed a relief  upon reaching camp her attention was distracted from herself  pepe the mexican boy with the two shepherd dogs was trying to drive sheep into a closer bunch to save the lambs from coyotes  ellen loved the fleecy tottering little lambs and at this season she hated all the prowling beast of the forest  from this time on for weeks the flock would be besieged by wolves lions bears the last of which were often bold and dangerous  the old grizzlies that killed the ewes to eat only the milkbags were particularly dreaded by ellen  she was a good shot with a rifle but had orders from her father to let the bears alone fortunately such sheepkilling bears were but few and were left to be hunted by men from the ranch  mexican sheep herders could not be depended upon to protect their flocks from bears ellen helped pepe drive in the stragglers and she took several shots at coyotes skulking along the edge of the brush  the open glade in the forest was favorable for herding the sheep at night and the dogs could be depended upon to guard the flock and in most cases to drive predatory beasts away  after this task which brought the time to sunset ellen had supper to cook and eat  darkness came and a cool night wind set in here and there a lamb bleated plaintively  with her work done for the day ellen sat before a ruddy camp fire and found her thoughts again centering around the singular adventure that had befallen her disdainfully she strove to think of something else  but there was nothing that could dispel the interest of her meeting with jean isbel thereupon she impatiently surrendered to it and recalled every word and action which she could remember  and in the process of this meditation she came to an action of hers recollection of which brought the blood tingling to her neck and cheeks so unusually and burningly that she covered them with her hands  what did he think of me she mused doubtfully  it did not matter what he thought but she could not help wondering  and when she came to the memory of his kiss she suffered more than the sensation of throbbing scarlet cheeks scornfully and bitterly she burst out shore he couldnt have thought much good of me  the half hour following this reminiscence was far from being pleasant proud passionate strongwilled ellen jorth found herself a victim of conflicting emotions  the event of the day was too close  she could not understand it  disgust and disdain and scorn could not make this meeting with jean isbel as if it had never been  pride could not efface it from her mind  the more she reflected the harder she tried to forget the stronger grew a significance of interest  and when a hint of this dawned upon her consciousness she resented it so forcibly that she lost her temper scattered the camp fire and went into the little teepee tent to roll in her blankets  thus settled snug and warm for the night with a shepherd dog curled at the opening of her tent she shut her eyes and confidently bade sleep end her perplexities  but sleep did not come at her invitation she found herself wide awake keenly sensitive to the sputtering of the camp fire the tinkling of bells on the rams the bleating of lambs the sough of wind in the pines and the hungry sharp bark of coyotes off in the distance  darkness was no respecter of her pride  the lonesome night with its emphasis of solitude seemed to induce clamoring and strange thoughts a confusing ensemble of all those that had annoyed her during the daytime  not for long hours did sheer weariness bring her to slumber  ellen awakened late and failed of her usual alacrity  both pepe and the shepherd dog appeared to regard her with surprise and solicitude ellens spirit was low this morning her blood ran sluggishly she had to fight a mournful tendency to feel sorry for herself  and at first she was not very successful  there seemed to be some kind of pleasure in reveling in melancholy which her common sense told her had no reason for existence  but states of mind persisted in spite of common sense  pepe when is antonio comin back she asked  the boy could not give her a satisfactory answer  ellen had willingly taken the sheep herders place for a few days but now she was impatient to go home  she looked down the greenandbrown aisles of the forest until she was tired  antonio did not return  ellen spent the day with the sheep and in the manifold task of caring for a thousand newborn lambs she forgot herself  this day saw the end of lambingtime for that season  the forest resounded to a babel of baas and bleats  when night came she was glad to go to bed for what with loss of sleep and weariness she could scarcely keep her eyes open  the following morning she awakened early bright eager expectant full of bounding life strangely aware of the beauty and sweetness of the scented forest strangely conscious of some nameless stimulus to her feelings  not long was ellen in associating this new and delightful variety of sensations with the fact that jean isbel had set today for his ride up to the rim to see her  ellens joyousness fled her smiles faded the spring morning lost its magic radiance  shore theres no sense in my lyin to myself she soliloquized thoughtfully  its queer of mefeelin glad aboot himwithout knowin  lord  i must be lonesome  to be glad of seein an isbel even if he is different  soberly she accepted the astounding reality  her confidence died with her gayety her vanity began to suffer  and she caught at her admission that jean isbel was different she resented it in amaze she ridiculed it she laughed at her naive confession  she could arrive at no conclusion other than that she was a weakminded fluctuating inexplicable little fool  but for all that she found her mind had been made up for her without consent or desire before her will had been consulted and that inevitably and unalterably she meant to see jean isbel again long she battled with this strange decree  one moment she won a victory over this new curious self only to lose it the next and at last out of her conflict there emerged a few convictions that left her with some shreds of pride  she hated all isbels she hated any isbel and particularly she hated jean isbel  she was only curiousintensely curious to see if he would come back and if he did come what he would do  she wanted only to watch him from some covert  she would not go near him not let him see her or guess of her presence  thus she assuaged her hurt vanitythus she stifled her miserable doubts  long before the sun had begun to slant westward toward the midafternoon jean isbel had set as a meeting time ellen directed her steps through the forest to the rim  she felt ashamed of her eagerness  she had a guilty conscience that no strange thrills could silence  it would be fun to see him to watch him to let him wait for her to fool him  like an indian she chose the soft pineneedle mats to tread upon and her lightmoccasined feet left no trace  like an indian also she made a wide detour and reached the rim a quarter of a mile west of the spot where she had talked with jean isbel and here turning east she took care to step on the bare stones  this was an adventure seemingly the first she had ever had in her life  assuredly she had never before come directly to the rim without halting to look to wonder to worship this time she scarcely glanced into the blue abyss  all absorbed was she in hiding her tracks  not one chance in a thousand would she risk the jorth pride burned even while the feminine side of her dominated her actions  she had some difficult rocky points to cross then windfalls to round and at length reached the covert she desired a rugged yellow point of the rim stood somewhat higher than the spot ellen wanted to watch  a dense thicket of jack pines grew to the very edge  it afforded an ambush that even the indian eyes jean isbel was credited with could never penetrate  moreover if by accident she made a noise and excited suspicion she could retreat unobserved and hide in the huge rocks below the rim where a ferret could not locate her  with her plan decided upon ellen had nothing to do but wait so she repaired to the other side  of the pine thicket and to the edge of the rim where she could watch and listen  she knew that long before she saw isbel she would hear his horse  it was altogether unlikely that he would come on foot  shore ellen jorth yure a queer girl she mused  i reckon i wasnt well acquainted with yu  beneath her yawned a wonderful deep canyon rugged and rocky with but few pines on the north slope thick with dark green timber on the south slope  yellow and gray crags like turreted castles stood up out of the sloping forest on the side opposite her  the trees were all sharp spear pointed  patches of light green aspens showed strikingly against the dense black  the great slope beneath ellen was serrated with narrow deep gorges almost canyons in themselves shadows alternated with clear bright spaces  the milewide mouth of the canyon opened upon the basin down into a world of wild timbered ranges and ravines valleys and hills that rolled and tumbled in darkgreen waves to the sierra anchas  but for once ellen seemed singularly unresponsive to this panorama of wildness and grandeur  her ears were like those of a listening deer and her eyes continually reverted to the open places along the rim at first in her excitement time flew by  gradually however as the sun moved westward she began to be restless  the soft thud of dropping pine cones the rustling of squirrels up and down the shaggybarked spruces the cracking of weathered bits of rock these caught her keen ears many times and brought her up erect and thrilling  finally she heard a sound which resembled that of an unshod hoof on stone stealthily then she took her rifle and slipped back through the pine thicket to the spot she had chosen  the little pines were so close together that she had to crawl between their trunks the ground was covered with a soft bed of pine needles brown and fragrant  in her hurry she pricked her ungloved hand on a sharp pine cone and drew the blood  she sucked the tiny wound  shore im wonderin if thats a bad omen she muttered darkly thoughtful then she resumed her sinuous approach to the edge of the thicket and presently reached it  ellen lay flat a moment to recover her breath then raised herself on her elbows  through an opening in the fringe of buck brush she could plainly see the promontory where she had stood with jean isbel and also the approaches by which he might come  rather nervously she realized that her covert was hardly more than a hundred feet from the promontory  it was imperative that she be absolutely silent her eyes searched the openings along the rim  the gray form of a deer crossed one of these and she concluded it had made the sound she had heard then she lay down more comfortably and waited resolutely she held as much as possible to her sensorial perceptions the meaning of ellen jorth lying in ambush just to see an isbel was a conundrum she refused to ponder in the present  she was doing it and the physical act had its fascination  her ears attuned to all the sounds of the lonely forest caught them and arranged them according to her knowledge of woodcraft  a long hour passed by  the sun had slanted to a point halfway between the zenith and the horizon  suddenly a thought confronted ellen jorth hes not comin she whispered  the instant that idea presented itself she felt a blank sense of loss a vague regretsomething that must have been disappointment  unprepared for this she was held by surprise for a moment and then she was stunned  her spirit swift and rebellious had no time to rise in her defense  she was a lonely guilty miserable girl too weak for pride to uphold too fluctuating to know her real self  she stretched there burying her face in the pine needles digging her fingers into them wanting nothing so much as that they might hide her  the moment was incomprehensible to ellen and utterly intolerable  the sharp pine needles piercing her wrists and cheeks and her hot heaving breast seemed to give her exquisite relief  the shrill snort of a horse sounded near at hand  with a shock ellens body stiffened  then she  quivered a little and her feelings underwent swift change  cautiously and noiselessly she raised herself upon her elbows and peeped through the opening in the brush  she saw a man tying a horse to a bush somewhat back from the rim  drawing a rifle from its saddle sheath he threw it in the hollow of his arm and walked to the edge of the precipice  he gazed away across the basin and appeared lost in contemplation or thought  then he turned to look back into the forest as if he expected some one  ellen recognized the lithe figure the dark face so like an indians it was isbel  he had come  somehow his coming seemed wonderful and terrible  ellen shook as she leaned on her elbows  jean isbel true to his word in spite of her scorn had come back to see her  the fact seemed monstrous  he was an enemy of her father  long had range rumor been bandied from lip to lipold gass isbel had sent for his indian son to fight the jorths  jean isbelson of a texanunerring shotpeerless trackera bad and dangerous man  then there flashed over ellen a burning thoughtif it were true if he was an enemy of her fathers if a fight between jorth and isbel was inevitable she ought to kill this jean isbel right there in his tracks as he boldly and confidently waited for her  fool he was to think she would come ellen sank down and dropped her head until the strange tremor of her arms ceased  that dark and grim flash of thought retreated  she had not come to murder a man from ambush but only to watch him to try to see what he meant what he thought to allay a strange curiosity  after a while she looked again  isbel was sitting on an upheaved section of the rim in a comfortable position from which he could watch the openings in the forest and gaze as well across the west curve of the basin to the mazatzals  he had composed himself to wait he was clad in a buckskin suit rather new and it certainly showed off to advantage compared with the ragged and soiled apparel ellen remembered  he did not look so large  ellen was used to the long lean rangy arizonians and texans  this man was built differently he had the widest shoulders of any man she had ever seen and they made him appear rather short  but his lithe powerful limbs proved he was not short  whenever he moved the muscles rippled  his hands were clasped round a kneebrown sinewy hands very broad and fitting the thick muscular wrists  his collar was open and he did not wear a scarf as did the men ellen knew  then her intense curiosity at last brought her steady gaze to jean isbels head and face  he wore a cap evidently of some thin fur  his hair was straight and short and in color a dead raven black  his complexion was dark clear tan with no trace of red  he did not have the prominent cheek bones nor the highbridged nose usual with white men who were part indian  still he had the indian look  ellen caught that in the dark intent piercing eyes in the wide level thoughtful brows in the stern impassiveness of his smooth face  he had a straight sharpcut profile  ellen whispered to herself i saw him right the other day  only id not admit it the finestlookin man i ever saw in my life is a damned isbel  was that what i come out heah for  she lowered herself once more and folding her arms under her breast she reclined comfortably on them and searched out a smaller peephole from which she could spy upon isbel  and as she watched him the new and perplexing side of her mind waxed busier  why had he come back what did he want of her  acquaintance friendship was impossible for them  he had been respectful deferential toward her in a way that had strangely pleased until the surprising moment when he had kissed her  that had only disrupted her rather dreamy pleasure in a situation she had not experienced before  all the men she had met in this wild country were rough and bold most of them had wanted to marry her and failing that they had persisted in amorous attentions not particularly flattering or honorable  they were a bad lot  and contact with them had dulled some of her sensibilities  but this jean isbel had seemed a gentleman  she struggled to be fair trying to forget her antipathy as much to understand herself as to give him due credit  true he had kissed her crudely and forcibly  but that kiss had not been an insult  ellens finer feeling forced her to believe this  she remembered the honest amaze and shame and contrition with which he had faced her trying awkwardly to explain his bold act likewise she recalled the subtle swift change in him at her words  oh ive been kissed before  she was glad she had said that   stillwas she glad after all  she watched him  every little while he shifted his gaze from the blue gulf beneath him to the forest  when he turned thus the sun shone on his face and she caught the piercing gleam of his dark eyes she saw too that he was listening  watching and listening for her ellen had to still a tumult within her  it made her feel very young very shy very strange  all the while she hated him because he manifestly expected her to come  several times he rose and walked a little way into the woods  the last time he looked at the westering sun and shook his head  his confidence had gone  then he sat and gazed down into the void  but ellen knew he did not see anything there  he seemed an image carved in the stone of the rim and he gave ellen a singular impression of loneliness and sadness  was he thinking of the miserable battle his father had summoned him to leadof what it would costof its useless pain and hatred  ellen seemed to divine his thoughts  in that moment she softened toward him and in her soul quivered and stirred an intangible something that was like pain that was too deep for her understanding  but she felt sorry for an isbel until the old pride resurged  what if he admired her  she remembered his interest the wonder and admiration the growing light in his eyes  and it had not been repugnant to her until he disclosed his name  whats in a name she mused recalling poetry learned in her girlhood  a rose by any other name would smell as sweet hes an isbelyet he might be splendidnoble bah hes notand id hate him anyhow  all at once ellen felt cold shivers steal over her  isbels piercing gaze was directed straight at her hiding place  her heart stopped beating  if he discovered her there she felt that she would die of shame  then she became aware that a blue jay was screeching in a pine above her and a red squirrel somewhere near was chattering his shrill annoyance  these two denizens of the woods could be depended upon to espy the wariest hunter and make known his presence to their kind ellen had a moment of more than dread  this keeneyed keeneared indian might see right through her brushy covert might hear the throbbing of her heart  it relieved her immeasurably to see him turn away and take to pacing the promontory with his head bowed and his hands behind his back  he had stopped looking off into the forest presently he wheeled to the west and by the light upon his face ellen saw that the time was near sunset  turkeys were beginning to gobble back on the ridge  isbel walked to his horse and appeared to be untying something from the back of his saddle  when he came back ellen saw that he carried a small package apparently wrapped in paper  with this under his arm he strode off in the direction of ellens camp and soon disappeared in the forest  for a little while ellen lay there in bewilderment  if she had made conjectures before they were now multiplied  where was jean isbel going  ellen sat up suddenly  well shore this heah beats me she said  what did he have in that package  what was he goin to do with it  it took no little will power to hold her there when she wanted to steal after him through the woods and find out what he meant  but his reputation influenced even her and she refused to pit her cunning in the forest against his  it would be better to wait until he returned to his horse  thus decided she lay back again in her covert and gave her mind over to pondering curiosity  sooner than she expected she espied isbel approaching through the forest empty handed  he had not taken his rifle  ellen averted her glance a moment and thrilled to see the rifle leaning against a rock  verily jean isbel had been far removed from hostile intent that day  she watched him stride swiftly up to his horse untie the halter and mount  ellen had an impression of his arrowlike straight figure and sinuous grace and ease  then he looked back at the promontory as if to fix a picture of it in his mind and rode away along the rim  she watched him out of sight  what ailed her something was wrong with her but she recognized only relief  when isbel had been gone long enough to assure ellen that she might safely venture forth she crawled through the pine thicket to the rim on the other side of the point  the sun was setting behind the black range shedding a golden glory over the basin  westward the zigzag rim reached like a streamer of fire into the sun  the vast promontories jutted out with blazing beacon lights upon their stonewalled faces deep down the basin was turning shadowy dark blue going to sleep for the night  ellen bent swift steps toward her camp  long shafts of gold preceded her through the forest  then they paled and vanished  the tips of pines and spruces turned gold  a hoarsevoiced old turkey gobbler was booming his chugalug from the highest ground and the softer chick of hen turkeys answered him  ellen was almost breathless when she arrived two packs and a couple of lopeared burros attested to the fact of antonios return  this was good news for ellen  she heard the bleat of lambs and tinkle of bells coming nearer and nearer  and she was glad to feel that if isbel had visited her camp most probably it was during the absence of the herders  the instant she glanced into her tent she saw the package isbel had carried  it lay on her bed  ellen stared blankly  thethe impudence of him she ejaculated  then she kicked the package out of the tent words and action seemed to liberate a dammedup hot fury she kicked the package again and thought she would kick it into the smoldering campfire  but somehow she stopped short of that  she left the thing there on the ground  pepe and antonio hove in sight driving in the tumbling woolly flock ellen did not want them to see the package so with contempt for herself and somewhat lessening anger she kicked it back into the tent  what was in it  she peeped inside the tent devoured by curiosity  neat well wrapped and tied packages like that were not often seen in the tonto basin  ellen decided she would wait until after supper and at a favorable moment lay it unopened on the fire what did she care what it contained  manifestly it was a gift  she argued that she was highly incensed with this insolent isbel who had the effrontery to approach her with some sort of present  it developed that the usually cheerful antonio had returned taciturn and gloomy  all ellen could get out of him was that the job of sheep herder had taken on hazards inimical to peaceloving mexicans  he had heard something he would not tell  ellen helped prepare the supper and she ate in silence  she had her own brooding troubles  antonio presently told her that her father had said she was not to start back home after dark  after supper the herders repaired to their own tents leaving ellen the freedom of her campfire  wherewith she secured the package and brought it forth to burn  feminine curiosity rankled strong in her breast  yielding so far as to shake the parcel and press it and finally tear a comer off the paper she saw some words written in lead pencil  bending nearer the blaze she read  for my sister ann ellen gazed at the big bold handwriting quite legible and fairly well done  suddenly she tore the outside wrapper completely off  from printed words on the inside she gathered that the package had come from a store in san francisco  reckon he fetched home a lot of presents for his folksthe kidsand his sister muttered ellen that was nice of him  whatever this is he shore meant it for sister ann ann isbel  why she must be that blackeyed girl i met and liked so well before i knew she was an isbel his sister  whereupon for the second time ellen deposited the fascinating package in her tent  she could not burn it up just then  she had other emotions besides scorn and hate  and memory of that softvoiced kindhearted beautiful isbel girl checked her resentment  i wonder if he is like his sister she said thoughtfully  it appeared to be an unfortunate thought  jean isbel certainly resembled his sister too bad they belong to the family that ruined dad  ellen went to bed without opening the package or without burning it and to her annoyance whatever way she lay she appeared to touch this strange package  there was not much room in the little tent  first she put it at her head beside her rifle but when she turned over her cheek came in contact with it  then she felt as if she had been stung she moved it again only to touch it presently with her hand  next she flung it to the bottom of her bed where it fell upon her feet and whatever way she moved them she could not escape the pressure of this undesirable and mysterious gift  by and by she fell asleep only to dream that the package was a caressing hand stealing about her feeling for hers and holding it with soft strong clasp  when she awoke she had the strangest sensation in her right palm  it was moist throbbing hot and the feel of it on her cheek was strangely thrilling and comforting she lay awake then  the night was dark and still  only a low moan of wind in the pines and the faint tinkle of a sheep bell broke the serenity  she felt very small and lonely lying there in the deep forest and try how she would it was impossible to think the same then as she did in the clear light of day  resentment pride angerthese seemed abated now if the events of the day had not changed her they had at least brought up softer and kinder memories and emotions than she had known for long nothing hurt and saddened her so much as to remember the gay happy days of her childhood her sweet mother her old home  then her thought returned to isbel and his gift  it had been years since anyone had made her a gift what could this one be  it did not matter  the wonder was that jean isbel should bring it to her and that she could be perturbed by its presence  he meant it for his sister and so he thought well of me she said in finality  morning brought ellen further vacillation  at length she rolled the obnoxious package inside her blankets saying that she would wait until she got home and then consign it cheerfully to the flames antonio tied her pack on a burro  she did not have a horse and therefore had to walk the several miles to her fathers ranch  she set off at a brisk pace leading the burro and carrying her rifle and soon she was deep in the fragrant forest  the morning was clear and cool with just enough frost to make the sunlit grass sparkle as if with diamonds  ellen felt fresh buoyant singularly full of life her youth would not be denied  it was pulsing yearning  she hummed an old southern tune and every step seemed one of pleasure in action of advance toward some intangible future happiness  all the unknown of life before her called  her heart beat high in her breast and she walked as one in a dream  her thoughts were swiftchanging intimate deep and vague not of yesterday or today nor of reality  the big gray whitetailed squirrels crossed ahead of her on the trail scampered over the piny ground to hop on tree trunks and there they paused to watch her pass  the vociferous little red squirrels barked and chattered at her  from every thicket sounded the gobble of turkeys the blue jays squalled in the tree tops  a deer lifted its head from browsing and stood motionless with long ears erect watching her go by  thus happily and dreamily absorbed ellen covered the forest miles and soon reached the trail that led down into the wild brakes of chevelon canyon  it was rough going and less conducive to sweet wanderings of mind  ellen slowly lost them  and then a familiar feeling assailed her one she never failed to have upon returning to her fathers rancha reluctance a bitter dissatisfaction with her home a loyal struggle against the vague sense that all was not as it should be  at the head of this canyon in a little level grassy meadow stood a rude oneroom log shack with a leaning redstone chimney on the outside this was the abode of a strange old man who had long lived there  his name was john sprague and his occupation was raising burros  no sheep or cattle or horses did he own not even a dog rumor had said sprague was a prospector one of the many who had searched that country for the lost dutchman gold mine  sprague knew more about the basin and rim than any of the sheepmen or ranchers from black butte to the cibique and from chevelon butte to reno pass he knew every trail canyon ridge and spring and could find his way to them on the darkest night  his fame however depended mostly upon the fact that he did nothing but raise burros and would raise none but black burros with white faces these burros were the finest bred in ail the basin and were in great demand  sprague sold a few every year  he had made a present of one to ellen although he hated to part with them  this old man was ellens one and only friend  upon her trip out to the rim with the sheep uncle john as ellen called him had been away on one of his infrequent visits to grass valley  it pleased her now to see a blue column of smoke lazily lifting from the old chimney and to hear the discordant bray of burros as she entered the clearing sprague saw her from the door of his shack  hello uncle john she called  wal if it aint ellen he replied heartily  when i seen thet whitefaced jinny i knowed who was leadin her  where you been girl  sprague was a little stoopshouldered old man with grizzled head and face and shrewd gray eyes that beamed kindly on her over his ruddy cheeks  ellen did not like the tobacco stain on his grizzled beard nor the dirty motley ragged illsmelling garb he wore but she had ceased her useless attempts to make him more cleanly  ive been herdin sheep replied ellen  and where have yu been uncle  i missed yu on the way over  been packin in some grub  an i reckon i stayed longer in grass valley than i recollect  but thet was only natural considerin  what asked ellen bluntly as the old man paused  sprague took a black pipe out of his vest pocket and began rimming the bowl with his fingers  the glance he bent on ellen was thoughtful and earnest and so kind that she feared it was pity  ellen suddenly burned for news from the village  wal come in an set down wont you he asked  no thanks replied ellen and she took a seat on the chopping block tell me uncle whats goin on down in the valley  nothin much yetexcept talk  an theres a heap of thet  humph  there always was talk declared ellen contemptuously a nasty gossipy catty hole that grass valley  ellen thars goin to be wara bloody war in the ole tonto basin went on sprague seriously  war  between whom  the isbels an their enemies  i reckon most people down thar an sure all the cattlemen air on old gasss side  blaisdell gordon fredericks bluetheyll all be in it  who are they goin to fight queried ellen sharply  wal the open talk is thet the sheepmen are forcin this war  but thars talk not so open an i reckon not very healthy for any man to whisper hyarbouts  uncle john yu neednt be afraid to tell me anythin said ellen id never give yu away  yuve been a good friend to me  reckon i want to be ellen he returned nodding his shaggy head it aint easy to be fond of you as i am an keep my mouth shet id like to know somethin  hev you any relatives away from hyar thet you could go to till this fights over  no  all i have so far as i know are right heah  how aboot friends  uncle john i have none she said sadly with bowed head  wal wal im sorry  i was hopin you might git away  she lifted her face  shore yu dont think id run off if my dad got in a fight she flashed  i hope you will  im a jorth she said darkly and dropped her head again  sprague nodded gloomily  evidently he was perplexed and worried and strongly swayed by affection for her  would you go away with me he asked  we could pack over to the mazatzals an live thar till this blows over  thank yu uncle john  yure kind and good  but ill stay with my father  his troubles are mine  ahuh  wal i might hev reckoned so ellen how do you stand on this hyar sheep an cattle question  i think whats fair for one is fair for another  i dont like sheep as much as i like cattle  but thats not the point  the range is free suppose yu had cattle and i had sheep  id feel as free to run my sheep anywhere as yu were to ran your cattle  right  but what if you throwed your sheep round my range an sheeped off the grass so my cattle would hev to move or starve  shore i wouldnt throw my sheep round yur range she declared stoutly  wal youve answered half of the question  an now supposin a lot of my cattle was stolen by rustlers but not a single one of your sheep what d you think then  id shore think rustlers chose to steal cattle because there was no profit in stealin sheep  egzactly  but wouldnt you hev a queer idee aboot it  i dont know  why queer  what re yu drivin at uncle john  wal wouldnt you git kind of a hunch thet the rustlers wassay a leetle friendly toward the sheepmen  ellen felt a sudden vibrating shock  the blood rushed to her temples trembling all over she rose  uncle john she cried  now girl you neednt fire up thet way  set down an dont  dare yu insinuate my father has  ellen i aint insinuatin nothin interrupted the old man  im jest askin you to think  thets all  youre most grown into a young woman now  an youve got sense  thars bad times ahead ellen an i hate to see you mix in them  oh yu do make me think replied ellen with smarting tears in her eyes  yu make me unhappy  oh i know my dad is not liked in this cattle country  but its unjust  he happened to go in for sheep raising  i wish he hadnt  it was a mistake  dad always was a cattleman till we came heah  he made enemieswhowho ruined him and everywhere misfortune crossed his trail but oh uncle john my dad is an honest man  wal child ii didnt mean toto make you cry said the old man feelingly and he averted his troubled gaze  never mind what i said im an old meddler  i reckon nothin i could do or say would ever change whats goin to happen  if only you wasnt a girl  thar i go agin  ellen face your future an fight your way  all youngsters hev to do thet  an its the right kind of fight thet makes the right kind of man or woman  only you must be sure to find yourself  an by thet i mean to find the real true honesttogod best in you an stick to it an die fightin for it  youre a young woman almost an a blamed handsome one  which means youll hev more trouble an a harder fight  this country aint easy on a woman when once slander has marked her  what do i care for the talk down in that basin returned ellen i know they think im a hussy  ive let them think it ive helped them to  youre wrong child said sprague earnestly  pride an temper you must never let anyone think bad of you much less help them to  i hate everybody down there cried ellen passionately  i hate them so id glory in their thinkin me bad my mother belonged to the best blood in texas  i am her daughter  i know who and what i am that uplifts me whenever i meet the sneaky sly suspicions of these basin people  it shows me the difference between them and me thats what i glory in  ellen youre a wild headstrong child rejoined the old man in severe tones  word has been passed agin your good nameyour honor an hevnt you given cause fer thet  ellen felt her face blanch and all her blood rush back to her heart in sickening force  the shock of his words was like a stab from a cold blade  if their meaning and the stem just light of the old mans glance did not kill her pride and vanity they surely killed her girlishness  she stood mute staring at him with her brown trembling hands stealing up toward her bosom as if to ward off another and a mortal blow  ellen burst out sprague hoarsely  you mistook me  aw i didnt meanwhat you think i swear ellen im old an blunt  i aint used to wimmen  but ive love for you child an respect jest the same as if you was my own an i know youre good forgive me i meant only hevnt you been say sort ofcareless  careless queried ellen bitterly and low  an powerful thoughtless anan blindlettin men kiss you an fondle youwhen youre really a growedup woman now  yesi have whispered ellen  wal then why did you let them  ii dont know i didnt think  the men never let me alonenevernever  i got tired everlastingly pushin them away  and sometimeswhen they were kindand i was lonely for something ii didnt mind if one or another fooled round me  i never thought it never looked as yu have made it look thenthose few times ridin the trail to grass valleywhen people saw methen i guess i encouraged such attentions oh i must bei am a shameless little hussy  hush thet kind of talk said the old man as he took her hand ellen youre only young an lonely an bitter  no motherno friendsno one but a lot of rough men  its a wonder you hev kept yourself good  but now your eyes are open ellen  theyre brave an beautiful eyes girl an if you stand by the light in them you will come through any trouble  an youll be happy  dont ever forgit that  life is hard enough god knows but its unfailin true in the end to the man or woman who finds the best in them an stands by it  uncle john yu talk soso kindly  yu make me have hope  there seemed really so little for me to live forhope for but ill never be a coward againnor a thoughtless fool  ill find some good in meor make someand never fail it come what will  ill remember your words  ill believe the future holds wonderful things for me im only eighteen  shore all my life wont be lived heah  perhaps this threatened fight over sheep and cattle will blow over somewhere there must be some nice girl to be a frienda sister to me and maybe some man whod believe in spite of all they saythat im not a hussy  wal ellen you remind me of what i was wantin to tell you when you just got here yestiddy i heerd you called thet name in a barroom an thar was a fellar thar who raised hell  he near killed one man an made another plumb eat his words  an he scared thet crowd stiff  old john sprague shook his grizzled head and laughed beaming upon ellen as if the memory of what he had seen had warmed his heart  was ityu asked ellen tremulously  me  aw i wasnt nowhere  ellen this fellar was quick as a cat in his actions an his words was like lightnin  who she whispered  wal no one else but a stranger jest come to these partsan isbel too  jean isbel  oh exclaimed ellen faintly  in a barroom full of menalmost all of them in sympathy with the sheep crowdmost of them on the jorth sidethis jean isbel resented an insult to ellen jorth  no cried ellen  something terrible was happening to her mind or her heart  wal he sure did replied the old man an its goin to be good fer you to hear all about it    chapter v  old john sprague launched into his narrative with evident zest  i hung round greaves store most of two days  an i heerd a heap some of it was jest plain ole mens gab but i reckon i got the drift of things concernin grass valley  yestiddy mornin i was packin my burros in greaves back yard takin my time carryin out supplies from the store  an as last when i went in i seen a strange fellar was thar strappin young mannot so young eitheran he had on buckskin  hair black as my burros dark face sharp eyesyoud took him fer an injun he carried a rifleone of them new fortyfoursan also somethin wrapped in paper thet he seemed partickler careful about  he wore a belt round his middle an thar was a bowieknife in it carried like ive seen scouts an injun fighters hev on the frontier in the seventies  that looked queer to me an i reckon to the rest of the crowd thar  no one overlooked the big sixshooter he packed texas fashion  wal i didnt hev no idee this fellar was an isbel until i heard greaves call him thet  isbel said greaves reckon your moneys counterfeit hyar i caint sell you anythin  counterfeit  not much spoke up the young fellar an he flipped some gold twenties on the bar where they rung like bells  why not aint this a store  i want a cinch strap  greaves looked particular sour thet mornin  id been watchin him fer two days  he hednt hed much sleep fer i hed my bed back of the store an i heerd men come in the night an hev long confabs with him whatever was in the wind hednt pleased him none  an i calkilated thet young isbel wasnt a sight good fer greaves sore eyes anyway but he paid no more attention to isbel  acted jest as if he hednt heerd isbel say he wanted a cinch strap  i stayed inside the store then  thar was a lot of fellars id seen an some i knowed  couple of card games goin an drinkin of course i soon gathered thet the general atmosphere wasnt friendly to jean isbel  he seen thet quick enough but he didnt leave  between you an me i sort of took a likin to him  an i sure watched him as close as i could not seemin to you know  reckon they all did the same only you couldnt see it  it got jest about the same as if isbel hednt been in thar only you knowed it wasnt really the same  thet was how i got the hunch the crowd was all sheepmen or their friends the day before id heerd a lot of talk about this young isbel an what hed come to grass valley fer an what a bad hombre he was  an when i seen him i was bound to admit he looked his reputation  wal pretty soon in come two more fellars an i knowed both of them you know them too im sorry to say  fer im comin to facts now thet will shake you  the first fellar was your fathers mexican foreman lorenzo and the other was simm bruce  i reckon bruce wasnt drunk but hed sure been lookin on red licker  when he seen isbel darn me if he didnt swell an bustle all up like a mad ole turkey gobbler  greaves he said if thet fellars jean isbel i aint hankerin fer the company yu keep  an he made no bones of pointin right at isbel  greaves looked up dry an sour an he bit out spitefullike wal simm we aint hed a hell of a lot of choice in this heah matter thets jean isbel shore enough  mebbe you can persuade him thet his company an his custom aint wanted round heah  jean isbel set on the counter an took it all in but he didnt say nothin  the way he looked at bruce was sure enough fer me to see thet thar might be a surprise any minnit  ive looked at a lot of men in my day an can sure feel events comin  bruce got himself a stiff drink an then he straddles over the floor in front of isbel  air you jean isbel son of ole gass isbel asked bruce sort of lolling back an givin a hitch to his belt  yes sir youve identified me said isbel nice an polite  my names bruce  im rangin sheep heahaboots an i hev interest in kurnel lee jorths bizness  hod do mister bruce replied isbel very civil ant cool as you please  bruce hed an eye fer the crowd thet was now listenin an watchin  he swaggered closer to isbel  we heerd yu come into the tonto basin to run us sheepmen off the range  how aboot thet  wal you heerd wrong said isbel quietly  i came to work fer my father  thet work depends on what happens  bruce began to git redder of face an he shook a husky hand in front of isbel  ill tell yu this heah my nez perce isbel an when he sort of choked fer more wind greaves spoke up simm i shore reckon thet nez perce handle will stick  an the crowd hawhawed then bruce got goin agin  ill tell yu this heah nez perce thars been enough happen already to run yu out of arizona  wal you dont say  what fer instance asked isbel quick an sarcastic  thet made bruce bust out puffin an spittin whatt fer instance huh  why yu darn halfbreed yull git run out fer makin up to ellen jorth  thet wont go in this heah country  not fer any isbel  youre a liar called isbel an like a big cat he dropped off the counter  i heerd his moccasins pat soft on the floor  an i bet to myself thet he was as dangerous as he was quick  but his voice an his looks didnt change even a leetle  im not a liar yelled bruce  ill make yu eat thet  i can prove what i say yu was seen with ellen jorthup on the rimday before yestiddy  yu was watched  yu was with her  yu made up to her yu grabbed her an kissed her  an im heah to say nez perce thet yure a marked man on this range  who saw me asked isbel quiet an cold  i seen then thet hed turned white in the face  yu caint lie out of it hollered bruce wavin his hands we got yu daid to rights  lorenzo saw yufollered yuwatched yu bruce pointed at the grinnin greaser  lorenzo is kurnel jorths foreman  he seen yu maulin of ellen jorth  an when he tells the kurnel an tad jorth an jackson jorth  haw  haw haw  why hell d be a cooler place fer yu then this heah tonto  greaves an his gang hed come round sure tickled clean to thar gizzards at this mess  i noticed howsomever thet they was texans enough to keep back to one side in case this isbel started any action wal isbel took a look at lorenzo  then with one swift grab he jerked the little greaser off his feet an pulled him close lorenzo stopped grinnin  he began to look a leetle sick  but it was plain he hed right on his side  you say you saw me demanded isbel  si senor replied lorenzo  what did you see  i see senor an senorita  i hide by manzanita  i see senorita like grande senor ver mooch  she like senor keese  she  then isbel hit the little greaser a backhanded crack in the mouth sure it was a crack  lorenzo went over the counter backward an landed like a pack load of wood  an he didnt git up  mister bruce said isbel an you fellars who heerd thet lyin greaser i did meet ellen jorth  an i lost my head  i i kissed her but it was an accident  i meant no insult  i apologizedi tried to explain my crazy action thet was all  the greaser lied ellen jorth was kind enough to show me the trail  we talked a little theni supposebecause she was young an pretty an sweeti lost my head  she was absolutely innocent  thet damned greaser told a barefaced lie when he said she liked me  the fact was she despised me  she said so  an when she learned i was jean isbel she turned her back on me an walked away  at this point of his narrative the old man halted as if to impress ellen not only with what just had been told but particularly with what was to follow  the reciting of this tale had evidently given sprague an unconscious pleasure  he glowed  he seemed to carry the burden of a secret that he yearned to divulge  as for ellen she was deadlocked in breathless suspense  all her emotions waited for the end she begged sprague to hurry  wal i wish i could skip the next chapter an hev only the last to tell rejoined the old man and he put a heavy but solicitous hand upon hers simm bruce hawhawed loud an loud say nez perce he calls out most insolentlike we air too good sheepmen heah to hev the wool pulled over our eyes  we shore know what yu meant by ellen jorth  but yu wasnt smart when yu told her yu was jean isbel  hawhaw  isbel flashed a strange surprised look from the redfaced bruce to greaves and to the other men  i take it he was wonderin if hed heerd right or if theyd got the same hunch thet d come to him an i reckon he determined to make sure  why wasnt i smart he asked  shore yu wasnt smart if yu was aimin to be one of ellen jorths lovers said bruce with a leer  fer if yu hednt give yurself away yu could hev been easy enough  thar was no mistakin bruces meanin an when he got it out some of the men thar laughed  isbel kept lookin from one to another of them then facin greaves he said deliberately greaves this drunken bruce is excuse enough fer a showdown  i take it that you are sheepmen an youre goin on jorths side of the fence in the matter of this sheep rangin  wal nez perce i reckon you hit plumb center said greaves dryly he spread wide his big hands to the other men as if to say theyd might as well own the jig was up  all right  youre jorths backers  have any of you a word to say in ellen jorths defense  i tell you the mexican lied  believin me or not doesnt matter  but this vilemouthed bruce hinted against thet girls honor  agin some of the men laughed but not so noisy an there was a nervous shufflin of feet  isbel looked sort of queer  his neck had a bulge round his collar  an his eyes was like black coals of fire greaves spread his big hands again as if to wash them of this part of the dirty argument  when it comes to any wimmen i passmuch less play a hand fer a wildcat like jorths gurl said greaves sort of cold an thick bruce shore ought to know her  accordin to talk heahaboots an what he says ellen jorth has been his gurl fer two years  then isbel turned his attention to bruce an i fer one begun to shake in my boots  say thet to me he called  shore shes my gurl an thets why im agoin to hev yu run off this range  isbel jumped at bruce  you damned drunken cur  you vilemouthed liar  i may be an isbel but by god you caint slander thet girl to my face  then he moved so quick i couldnt see what he did but i heerd his fist hit bruce  it sounded like an ax agin a beef bruce fell clear across the room  an by jinny when he landed isbel was thar  as bruce staggered up all bloodyfaced bellowin an spittin out teeth isbel eyed greavess crowd an said if any of yu make a move it ll mean gunplay  nobody moved thets sure in fact none of greavess outfit was packin guns at least in sight when bruce got all the way uphes a tall fellarwhy isbel took a full swing at him an knocked him back across the room agin the counter  yu know when a fellars hurt by the way he yells  bruce got thet second smash right on his big red nose i never seen any one so quick as isbel  he vaulted over thet counter jest the second bruce fell back on it an then with greavess gang in front so he could catch any moves of theirs he jest slugged bruce right an left an banged his head on the counter  then as bruce sunk limp an slipped down lookin like a bloody sack isbel let him fall to the floor  then he vaulted back over the counter  wipin the blood off his hands he throwed his kerchief down in bruces face  bruce wasnt dead or bad hurt  hed jest been beaten bad he was moanin an slobberin  isbel kicked him not hard but jest sort of disgustful  then he faced thet crowd greaves thets what i think of your simm bruce  tell him next time he sees me to run or pull a gun  an then isbel grabbed his rifle an package off the counter an went out  he didnt even look back  i seen him nount his horse an ride away now girl what hev you to say  ellen could only say goodby and the word was so low as to be almost inaudible  she ran to her burro  she could not see very clearly through tearblurred eyes and her shaking fingers were all thumbs it seemed she had to rush awaysomewhere anywherenot to get away from old john sprague but from herselfthis palpitating bursting self whose feet stumbled down the trail  allall seemed ended for her that interminable story  it had taken so long  and every minute of it she had been helplessly torn asunder by feelings she had never known she possessed  this ellen jorth was an unknown creature  she sobbed now as she dragged the burro down the canyon trail  she sat down only to rise  she hurried only to stop  driven pursued barred she had no way to escape the flaying thoughts no time or will to repudiate them  the death of her girlhood the rending aside of a veil of maiden mystery only vaguely instinctively guessed the barren sordid truth of her life as seen by her enlightened eyes the bitter realization of the vileness of men of her clan in contrast to the manliness and chivalry of an enemy the hard facts of unalterable repute as created by slander and fostered by low minds all these were forces in a cataclysm that had suddenly caught her heart and whirled her through changes immense and agonizing to bring her face to face with reality to force upon her suspicion and doubt of all she had trusted to warn her of the dark impending horror of a tragic bloody feud and lastly to teach her the supreme truth at once so glorious and so terriblethat she could not escape the doom of womanhood  about noon that day ellen jorth arrived at the knoll which was the location of her fathers ranch  three canyons met there to form a larger one  the knoll was a symmetrical hill situated at the mouth of the three canyons  it was covered with brush and cedars with here and there lichened rocks showing above the bleached grass  below the knoll was a wide grassy flat or meadow through which a willowbordered stream cut its rugged boulderstrewn bed  water flowed abundantly at this season and the deep washes leading down from the slopes attested to the fact of cloudbursts and heavy storms  this meadow valley was dotted with horses and cattle and meandered away between the timbered slopes to lose itself in a green curve  a singular feature of this canyon was that a heavy growth of spruce trees covered the slope facing northwest and the opposite slope exposed to the sun and therefore less snowbound in winter held a sparse growth of yellow pines  the ranch house of colonel jorth stood round the rough comer of the largest of the three canyons and rather well hidden it did not obtrude its rude and brokendown log cabins its squalid surroundings its black mudholes of corrals upon the beautiful and serene meadow valley  ellen jorth approached her home slowly with dragging reluctant steps and never before in the three unhappy years of her existence there had the ranch seemed so bare so uncared for so repugnant to her  as she had seen herself with clarified eyes so now she saw her home  the cabin that ellen lived in with her father was a singleroom structure with one door and no windows  it was about twenty feet square  the huge ragged stone chimney had been built on the outside with the wide open fireplace set inside the logs  smoke was rising from the chimney  as ellen halted at the door and began unpacking her burro she heard the loud lazy laughter of men  an adjoining log cabin had been built in two sections with a wide roofed hall or space between them the door in each cabin faced the other and there was a tall man standing in one  ellen recognized daggs a neighbor sheepman who evidently spent more time with her father than at his own home wherever that was  ellen had never seen it  she heard this man drawl jorth heahs your kid come home  ellen carried her bed inside the cabin and unrolled it upon a couch built of boughs in the far corner  she had forgotten jean isbels package and now it fell out under her sight  quickly she covered it a mexican woman relative of antonio and the only servant about the place was squatting indian fashion before the fireplace stirring a pot of beans  she and ellen did not get along well together and few words ever passed between them  ellen had a canvas curtain stretched upon a wire across a small triangular comer and this afforded her a little privacy  her possessions were limited in number  the crude square table she had constructed herself  upon it was a little oldfashioned walnutframed mirror a brush and comb and a dilapidated ebony cabinet which contained odds and ends the sight of which always brought a smile of derisive selfpity to her lips  under the table stood an old leather trunk  it had come with her from texas and contained clothing and belongings of her mothers  above the couch on pegs hung her scant wardrobe  a tiny shelf held several wornout books  when her father slept indoors which was seldom except in winter he occupied a couch in the opposite corner  a rude cupboard had been built against the logs next to the fireplace  it contained supplies and utensils  toward the center somewhat closer to the door stood a crude table and two benches  the cabin was dark and smelled of smoke of the stale odors of past cooked meals of the mustiness of dry rotting timber  streaks of light showed through the roof where the roughhewn shingles had split or weathered  a strip of bacon hung upon one side of the cupboard and upon the other a haunch of venison ellen detested the mexican woman because she was dirty the inside of the cabin presented the same unkempt appearance usual to it after ellen had been away for a few days  whatever ellen had lost during the retrogression of the jorths she had kept her habits of cleanliness and straightway upon her return she set to work  the mexican woman sullenly slouched away to her own quarters outside and ellen was left to the satisfaction of labor  her mind was as busy as her hands  as she cleaned and swept and dusted she heard from time to time the voices of men the clipclop of shod horses the bellow of cattle  and a considerable time elapsed before she was disturbed  a tall shadow darkened the doorway  howdy little one said a lazy drawling voice  so yuall got home  ellen looked up  a superbly built man leaned against the doorpost like most texans he was light haired and light eyed  his face was lined and hard  his long sandy mustache hid his mouth and drooped with a curl  spurred booted belted packing a heavy gun low down on his hip he gave ellen an entirely new impression  indeed she was seeing everything strangely  hello daggs replied ellen wheres my dad  hes playin cairds with jackson an colter  shores playin bad too an its gone to his haid  gamblin queried ellen  mah child whend kurnel jorth ever play for fun said daggs with a lazy laugh  theres a stack of gold on the table  reckon yo uncle jackson will win it  colters shore out of luck  daggs stepped inside  he was graceful and slow  his long spurs clinked  he laid a rather compelling hand on ellens shoulder  heah mah gal give us a kiss he said  daggs im not your girl replied ellen as she slipped out from under his hand  then daggs put his arm round her not with violence or rudeness but with an indolent affectionate assurance at once bold and selfcontained  ellen however had to exert herself to get free of him and when she had placed the table between them she looked him square in the eyes  daggs yu keep your paws off me she said  aw now ellen i aint no bear he remonstrated  whats the matter kid  im not a kid  and theres nothin the matter  yure to keep your hands to yourself thats all  he tried to reach her across the table and his movements were lazy and slow like his smile  his tone was coaxing  mah dear shore you set on my knee just the other day now didnt you  ellen felt the blood sting her cheeks  i was a child she returned  wal listen to this heah grownup young woman  all in a few days  doont be in a temper ellen come give us a kiss  she deliberately gazed into his eyes  like the eyes of an eagle they were clear and hard just now warmed by the dalliance of the moment but there was no light no intelligence in them to prove he understood her  the instant separated ellen immeasurably from him and from all of his ilk  daggs i was a child she said  i was lonelyhungry for affectioni was innocent  then i was careless too and thoughtless when i should have known better  but i hardly understood yu men  i put such thoughts out of my mind  i know nowknow what yu meanwhat yu have made people believe i am  ahuh  shore i get your hunch he returned with a change of tone but i asked you to marry me  yes yu did  the first day yu got heah to my dads house  and yu asked me to marry yu after yu found yu couldnt have your way with me to yu the one didnt mean any more than the other  shore i did more than simm bruce an colter he retorted they never asked you to marry  no they didnt  and if i could respect them at all id do it because they didnt ask me  wal ill be doggoned ejaculated daggs thoughtfully as he stroked his long mustache  ill say to them what ive said to yu went on ellen  ill tell dad to make yu let me alone  i wouldnt marry one of yuyu loafers to save my life  ive my suspicions about yu  yure a bad lot  daggs changed subtly  the whole indolent nonchalance of the man vanished in an instant  wal miss jorth i reckon you mean were a bad lot of sheepmen he queried in the cool easy speech of a texan  no flashed ellen  shore i dont say sheepmen  i say yure a bad lot  oh the hell you say  daggs spoke as he might have spoken to a man then turning swiftly on his heel he left her  outside he encountered ellens father  she heard daggs speak lee your little wildcat is shore heah  an take mah hunch  somebody has been talkin to her  who has asked her father in his husky voice  ellen knew at once that he had been drinking  lord only knows replied daggs  but shore it wasnt any friends of ours  we caint stop peoples tongues said jorth resignedly  wal i aint so shore continued daggs with his slow cool laugh reckon i never yet heard any daid mens tongues wag  then the musical tinkle of his spurs sounded fainter  a moment later ellens father entered the cabin  his dark moody face brightened at sight of her  ellen knew she was the only person in the world left for him to love  and she was sure of his love  her very presence always made him different  and through the years the darker their misfortunes the farther he slipped away from better days the more she loved him  hello my ellen he said and he embraced her  when he had been drinking he never kissed her  shore im glad youre home  this heah hole is bad enough any time but when youre gone its black im hungry  ellen laid food and drink on the table and for a little while she did not look directly at him  she was concerned about this new searching power of her eyes  in relation to him she vaguely dreaded it  lee jorth had once been a singularly handsome man  he was tall but did not have the figure of a horseman  his dark hair was streaked with gray and was white over his ears  his face was sallow and thin with deep lines  under his round prominent brown eyes like deadened furnaces were blue swollen welts  he had a bitter mouth and weak chin not wholly concealed by gray mustache and pointed beard  he wore a long frock coat and a widebrimmed sombrero both black in color and so old and stained and frayed that along with the fashion of them they betrayed that they had come from texas with him  jorth always persisted in wearing a white linen shirt likewise a relic of his southern prosperity and today it was ragged and soiled as usual  ellen watched her father eat and waited for him to speak  it occured to her strangely that he never asked about the sheep or the newborn lambs  she divined with a subtle new womans intuition that he cared nothing for his sheep  ellen what riled daggs inquired her father presently  he shore had fire in his eye  long ago ellen had betrayed an indignity she had suffered at the hands of a man  her father had nearly killed him  since then she had taken care to keep her troubles to herself  if her father had not been blind and absorbed in his own brooding he would have seen a thousand things sufficient to inflame his southern pride and temper  daggs asked me to marry him again and i said he belonged to a bad lot she replied  jorth laughed in scorn  fool  my god ellen i must have dragged you lowthat every damned ruersheepmanwho comes along thinks he can marry you  at the break in his words the incompleted meaning ellen dropped her eyes  little things once never noted by her were now come to have a fascinating significance  never mind dad she replied  they caint marry me  daggs said somebody had been talkin to you  how aboot that  old john sprague has just gotten back from grass valley said ellen i stopped in to see him  shore he told me all the village gossip  anythin to interest me he queried darkly  yes dad im afraid a good deal she said hesitatingly  then in accordance with a decision ellen had made she told him of the rumored war between sheepmen and cattlemen that old isbel had blaisdell gordon fredericks blue and other wellknown ranchers on his side that his son jean isbel had come from oregon with a wonderful reputation as fighter and scout and tracker that it was no secret how colonel lee jorth was at the head of the sheepmen that a bloody war was sure to come  hah exclaimed jorth with a stain of red in his sallow cheek reckon none of that is news to me  i knew all that  ellen wondered if he had heard of her meeting with jean isbel  if not he would hear as soon as simm bruce and lorenzo came back  she decided to forestall them  dad i met jean isbel  he came into my camp  asked the way to the rim i showed him  wewe talked a little  and shore were gettin acquainted whenwhen he told me who he was  then i left himhurried back to camp  colter met isbel down in the woods replied jorth ponderingly said he looked like an indiana hard an slippery customer to reckon with  shore i guess i can indorse what colter said returned ellen dryly she could have laughed aloud at her deceit  still she had not lied  howd this heah young isbel strike you queried her father suddenly glancing up at her  ellen felt the slow sickening guilty rise of blood in her face she was helpless to stop it  but her father evidently never saw it he was looking at her without seeing her  hehe struck me as different from men heah she stammered  did sprague tell you aboot this halfindian isbelaboot his reputation  yes  did he look to you like a real woodsman  indeed he did  he wore buckskin  he stepped quick and soft  he acted at home in the woods  he had eyes black as night and sharp as lightnin they shore saw about all there was to see  jorth chewed at his mustache and lost himself in brooding thought  dad tell me is there goin to be a war asked ellen presently  what a red strange rolling flash blazed in his eyes  his body jerked  shore  you might as well know  between sheepmen and cattlemen  yes  with yu dad at the haid of one faction and gaston isbel the other  daughter you have it correct so far as you go  oh  dad cant this fight be avoided  you forget youre from texas he replied  caint it be helped she repeated stubbornly  no he declared with deep hoarse passion  why not  wal we sheepmen are goin to run sheep anywhere we like on the range an cattlemen wont stand for that  but dad its so foolish declared ellen earnestly  yu sheepmen do not have to run sheep over the cattle range  i reckon we do  dad that argument doesnt go with me  i know the country  for years to come there will be room for both sheep and cattle without overrunnin if some of the range is better in water and grass then whoever got there first should have it  that shore is only fair  its common sense too  ellen i reckon some cattle people have been prejudicin you said jorth bitterly  dad she cried hotly  this had grown to be an ordeal for jorth  he seemed a victim of contending tides of feeling  some will or struggle broke within him and the change was manifest  haggard shiftyeyed with wabbling chin he burst into speech  see heah girl  you listen  theres a clique of ranchers down in the basin all those you named with isbel at their haid  they have resented sheepmen comin down into the valley  they want it all to themselves  thats the reason  shore theres another  all the isbels are crooked  theyre cattle an horse thieveshave been for years gaston isbel always was a maverick rustler  hes gettin old now an rich so he wants to cover his tracks  he aims to blame this cattle rustlin an horse stealin on to us sheepmen an run us out of the country  gravely ellen jorth studied her fathers face and the newly found truthseeing power of her eyes did not fail her  in part perhaps in all he was telling lies  she shuddered a little loyally battling against the insidious convictions being brought to fruition  perhaps in his brooding over his failures and troubles he leaned toward false judgments  ellen could not attach dishonor to her fathers motives or speeches  for long however something about him had troubled her perplexed her  fearfully she believed she was coming to some revelation and despite her keen determination to know she found herself shrinking  dad mother told me before she died that the isbels had ruined you said ellen very low  it hurt her so to see her father cover his face that she could hardly go on  if they ruined you they ruined all of us  i know what we had oncewhat we lost again and againand i see what we are come to now  mother hated the isbels  she taught me to hate the very name  but i never knew how they ruined youor whyor when  and i want to know now  then it was not the face of a liar that jorth disclosed  the present was forgotten  he lived in the past  he even seemed younger in the revivifying flash of hate that made his face radiant  the lines burned out  hate gave him back the spirit of his youth  gaston isbel an i were boys together in weston texas began jorth in swift passionate voice  we went to school together  we loved the same girlyour mother  when the war broke out she was engaged to isbel  his family was rich  they influenced her people  but she loved me  when isbel went to war she married me  he came back an faced us  god  ill never forget that  your mother confessed her unfaithfulnessby heaven  she taunted him with it  isbel accused me of winnin her by lies  but she took the sting out of that  isbel never forgave her an he hounded me to ruin  he made me out a cardsharp cheatin my best friends  i was disgraced  later he tangled me in the courtshe beat me out of propertyan last by convictin me of rustlin cattle he run me out of texas  black and distorted now jorths face was a spectacle to make ellen sick with a terrible passion of despair and hate  the truth of her fathers ruin and her own were enough  what mattered all else jorth beat the table with fluttering nerveless hands that seemed all the more significant for their lack of physical force  an so help me god its got to be wiped out in blood he hissed  that was his answer to the wavering and nobility of ellen  and she in her turn had no answer to make  she crept away into the corner behind the curtain and there on her couch in the semidarkness she lay with strained heart and a resurging unconquerable tumult in her mind  and she lay there from the middle of that afternoon until the next morning  when she awakened she expected to be unable to riseshe hoped she could notbut life seemed multiplied in her and inaction was impossible  something young and sweet and hopeful that had been in her did not greet the sun this morning  in their place was a womans passion to learn for herself to watch events to meet what must come to survive  after breakfast at which she sat alone she decided to put isbels package out of the way so that it would not be subjecting her to continual annoyance  the moment she picked it up the old curiosity assailed her  shore ill see what it is anyway she muttered and with swift hands she opened the package  the action disclosed two pairs of fine soft shoes of a style she had never seen and four pairs of stockings two of strong serviceable wool and the others of a finer texture ellen looked at them in amaze  of all things in the world these would have been the last she expected to see  and strangely they were what she wanted and needed most  naturally then ellen made the mistake of taking them in her hands to feel their softness and warmth  shore  he saw my bare legs  and he brought me these presents hed intended for his sister he was ashamed for mesorry for me and i thought he looked at me boldlike as im used to be looked at heah isbel or not hes shore  but ellen jorth could not utter aloud the conviction her intelligence tried to force upon her  itd be a pity to burn them she mused  i caint do it sometime i might send them to ann isbel  whereupon she wrapped them up again and hid them in the bottom of the old trunk and slowly as she lowered the lid looking darkly blankly at the wall she whispered jean isbel  i hate him  later when ellen went outdoors she carried her rifle which was unusual for her unless she intended to go into the woods  the morning was sunny and warm  a group of shirtsleeved men lounged in the hall and before the porch of the double cabin  her father was pacing up and down talking forcibly  ellen heard his hoarse voice as she approached he ceased talking and his listeners relaxed their attention  ellens glance ran over them swiftlydaggs with his superb head like that of a hawk uncovered to the sun colter with his lowered secretive looks his sandgray lean face jackson jorth her uncle huge gaunt hulking with white in his black beard and hair and the fire of a ghoul in his hollow eyes tad jorth another brother of her fathers younger red of eye and nose a weakchinned drinker of rum  three other limberlegged texans lounged there partners of daggs and they were sunbrowned lighthaired blueeyed men singularly alike in appearance from their dusty highheeled boots to their broad black sombreros  they claimed to be sheepmen  all ellen could be sure of was that rock wells spent most of his time there doing nothing but look for a chance to waylay her springer was a gambler and the third who answered to the strange name of queen was a silent lazy watchfuleyed man who never wore a glove on his right hand and who never was seen without a gun within easy reach of that hand  howdy ellen  shore you aint goin to say good mawnin to this heah bad lot drawled daggs with goodnatured sarcasm  why shore  good morning yu hardworking industrious manana sheep raisers replied ellen coolly  daggs stared  the others appeared taken back by a greeting so foreign from any to which they were accustomed from her  jackson jorth let out a gruff hawhaw  some of them doffed their sombreros and rock wells managed a lazy polite good morning  ellens father seemed most significantly struck by her greeting and the least amused  ellen im not likin your talk he said with a frown  dad when yu play cards dont yu call a spade a spade  why shore i do  well im calling spades spades  ahuh grunted jorth furtively dropping his eyes  where you goin with your gun  id rather you hung round heah now  reckon i might as well get used to packing my gun all the time replied ellen  reckon ill be treated more like a man  then the event ellen had been expecting all morning took place simm bruce and lorenzo rode around the slope of the knoll and trotted toward the cabin  interest in ellen was relegated to the background  shore theyre bustin with news declared daggs  they been ridin some you bet remarked another  huh exclaimed jorth  bruce shore looks queer to me  red liquor said tad jorth sententiously  youall know the brand greaves hands out  naw simm aint drunk said jackson jorth  look at his bloody shirt  the cool indolent interest of the crowd vanished at the red color pointed out by jackson jorth  daggs rose in a single springy motion to his lofty height  the face bruce turned to jorth was swollen and bruised with unhealed cuts  where his right eye should have been showed a puffed dark purple bulge  his other eye however gleamed with hard and sullen light  he stretched a big shaking hand toward jorth  thet nez perce isbel beat me half to death he bellowed  jorth stared hard at the tragic almost grotesque figure at the battered face  but speech failed him  it was daggs who answered bruce  wal simm ill be damned if you dont look it  beat you  what with burst out jorth explosively  i thought he was swingin an ax but greaves swore it was his fists bawled bruce in misery and fury  where was your gun queried jorth sharply  gun hell exclaimed bruce flinging wide his arms  ask lorenzo he had a gun  an he got a biff in the jaw before my turn come ask him  attention thus directed to the mexican showed a heavy discolored swelling upon the side of his oliveskinned face  lorenzo looked only serious  hah  speak up shouted jorth impatiently  senor isbel heet me ver quick replied lorenzo with expressive gesture  i see thousand starsthen moocho blackall like night  at that some of daggss men lolled back with dry crisp laughter daggss hard face rippled with a smile  but there was no humor in anything for colonel jorth  tell us what come off  quick he ordered  where did it happen why  who saw it  what did you do  bruce lapsed into a sullen impressiveness  wal i happened in greavess store an run into jean isbel  shore was lookin fer him i had my mind made up what to do but i got to shootin off my gab instead of my gun  i called him nez percean i throwed all thet talk in his face about old gass isbel sendin fer himan i told him hed git run out of the tonto  reckon i was jest warmin up but then it all happened  he slugged lorenzo jest one  an lorenzo slid peacefullike to bed behind the counter  i hadnt time to think of throwin a gun before he whaled into me  he knocked out two of my teeth  an i swallered one of them  ellen stood in the background behind three of the men and in the shadow  she did not join in the laugh that followed bruces remarks she had known that he would lie  uncertain yet of her reaction to this but more bitter and furious as he revealed his utter baseness she waited for more to be said  wal ill be doggoned drawled daggs  what do you make of this kind of fightin queried jorth  darn if i know replied daggs in perplexity  shore an sartin its not the way of a texan  mebbe this young isbel really is what old gass swears he is  shore bruce aint nothin to give an edge to a real gun fighter  looks to me like isbel bluffed greaves an his gang an licked your men without throwin a gun  maybe isbel doesnt want the name of drawin first blood suggested jorth  that d be like gass spoke up rock wells quietly  i onct rode fer gass in texas  say bruce said daggs was this heah palaverin of yours an jean isbels aboot the old stock dispute  aboot his fathers range an water  an partickler aboot sheep  walii yelled a heap declared bruce haltingly but i dont recollect all i saidi was riled shore though it was the same old argyment thets been fetchin us closer an closer to trouble  daggs removed his keen hawklike gaze from bruce  wal jorth all ill say is this  if bruce is tellin the truth we aint got a hell of a lot to fear from this young isbel  ive known a heap of gun fighters in my day  an jean isbel dont ran true to class  shore there never was a gunman whod risk cripplin his right hand by sluggin anybody  wal broke in bruce sullenly  youall can take it daid straight or not  i dont give a damn  but youve shore got my hunch thet nez perce isbel is liable to handle any of you fellars jest as he did me an jest as easy  whats more hes got greaves figgered  an youall know thet greaves is as deep in  shut up that kind of gab demanded jorth stridently  an answer me was the row in greavess barroom aboot sheep  aw hell  i said so didnt i shouted bruce with a fierce uplift of his distorted face  ellen strode out from the shadow of the tall men who had obscured her  bruce yure a liar she said bitingly  the surprise of her sudden appearance seemed to root bruce to the spot all but the discolored places on his face turned white  he held his breath a moment then expelled it hard  his effort to recover from the shock was painfully obvious  he stammered incoherently  shore yure more than a liar too cried ellen facing him with blazing eyes  and the rifle gripped in both hands seemed to declare her intent of menace  that row was not about sheep jean isbel didnt beat yu for anythin about sheep old john sprague was in greavess store  he heard yu  he saw jean isbel beat yu as yu deserved an he told me  ellen saw bruce shrink in fear of his life and despite her fury she was filled with disgust that he could imagine she would have his blood on her hands  then she divined that bruce saw more in the gathering storm in her fathers eyes than he had to fear from her  girl what the hell are yu sayin hoarsely called jorth in dark amaze  dad yu leave this to me she retorted  daggs stepped beside jorth significantly on his right side  let her alone lee he advised coolly  shes shore got a hunch on bruce  simm bruce yu cast a dirty slur on my name cried ellen passionately  it was then that daggs grasped jorths right arm and held it tight jest what i thought he said  stand still lee  lets see the kid make him showdown  thats what jean isbel beat yu for went on ellen  for slandering a girl who wasnt there me  yu rotten liar  but ellen it wasnt all lies said bruce huskily  i was half drunkan horrible jealous you know lorenzo seen isbel kissin you  i can prove thet  ellen threw up her head and a scarlet wave of shame and wrath flooded her face  yes she cried ringingly  he saw jean isbel kiss me once  an it was the only decent kiss ive had in years  he meant no insult i didnt know who he was  an through his kiss i learned a difference between men yu made lorenzo lie  an if i had a shred of good name left in grass valley you dishonored it yu made him think i was your girl  damn yu  i ought to kill yu eat your words nowtake them backor ill cripple yu for life  ellen lowered the cocked rifle toward his feet  shore ellen i take backall i said gulped bruce  he gazed at the quivering rifle barrel and then into the face of ellens father instinct told him where his real peril lay  here the cool and tactful daggs showed himself master of the situation  heah listen he called  ellen i reckon bruce was drunk an out of his haid  hes shore ate his words  now we dont want any cripples in this camp  let him alone  your dad got me heah to lead the jorths an thats my say to you simm youre shore a lowdown lyin rascal  keep away from ellen after this or ill bore you myself jorth it wont be a bad idee for you to forget youre a texan till you cool off  let bruce stop some isbel lead  shore the jorthisbel war is aboot on an i reckon wed be smart to believe old gasss talk aboot his nez perce son    chapter vi  from this hour ellen jorth bent all of her lately awakened intelligence and will to the only end that seemed to hold possible salvation for her in the crisis sure to come she did not want to be blind or weak dreaming and indolence habits born in her which were often a comfort to one as lonely as she would ill fit her for the hard test she divined and dreaded  in the matter of her fathers fight she must stand by him whatever the issue or the outcome in what pertained to her own principles her womanhood and her soul she stood absolutely alone  therefore ellen put dreams aside and indolence of mind and body behind her  many tasks she found and when these were done for a day she kept active in other ways thus earning the poise and peace of labor  jorth rode off every day sometimes with one or two of the men often with a larger number  if he spoke of such trips to ellen it was to give an impression of visiting the ranches of his neighbors or the various sheep camps  often he did not return the day he left  when he did get back he smelled of rum and appeared heavy from need of sleep his horses were always dust and sweat covered  during his absences ellen fell victim to anxious dread until he returned  daily he grew darker and more haggard of face more obsessed by some impending fate often he stayed up late haranguing with the men in the dimlit cabin where they drank and smoked but seldom gambled any more  when the men did not gamble something immediate and perturbing was on their minds ellen had not yet lowered herself to the deceit and suspicion of eavesdropping but she realized that there was a climax approaching in which she would deliberately do so  in those closing may days ellen learned the significance of many things that previously she had taken as a matter of course  her father did not run a ranch  there was absolutely no ranching done and little work often ellen had to chop wood herself  jorth did not possess a plow ellen was bound to confess that the evidence of this lack dumfounded her even old john sprague raised some hay beets turnips jorths cattle and horses fared ill during the winter  ellen remembered how they used to clean up fourinch oak saplings and aspens many of them died in the snow  the flocks of sheep however were driven down into the basin in the fall and across the reno pass to phoenix and maricopa  ellen could not discover a fence post on the ranch nor a piece of salt for the horses and cattle nor a wagon nor any sign of a sheepshearing outfit  she had never seen any sheep sheared ellen could never keep track of the many and different horses running loose and hobbled round the ranch  there were droves of horses in the woods and some of them wild as deer  according to her longestablished understanding her father and her uncles were keen on horse trading and buying  then the many trails leading away from the jorth ranchthese grew to have a fascination for ellen and the time came when she rode out on them to see for herself where they led  the sheep ranch of daggs supposed to be only a few miles across the ridges down in bear canyon never materialized at all for ellen  this circumstance so interested her that she went up to see her friend sprague and got him to direct her to bear canyon so that she would be sure not to miss it  and she rode from the narrow maplethicketed head of it near the rim down all its length  she found no ranch no cabin not even a corral in bear canyon  sprague said there was only one canyon by that name  daggs had assured her of the exact location on his place and so had her father  had they lied  were they mistaken in the canyon  there were many canyons all heading up near the rim all running and widening down for miles through the wooded mountain and vastly different from the deep short yellowwalled gorges that cut into the rim from the basin side ellen investigated the canyons within six or eight miles of her home both to east and to west  all she discovered was a couple of old log cabins long deserted  still she did not follow out all the trails to their ends  several of them led far into the deepest roughest wildest brakes of gorge and thicket that she had seen  no cattle or sheep had ever been driven over these trails  this riding around of ellens at length got to her fathers ears ellen expected that a bitter quarrel would ensue for she certainly would refuse to be confined to the camp but her father only asked her to limit her riding to the meadow valley and straightway forgot all about it  in fact his abstraction one moment his intense nervousness the next his harder drinking and fiercer harangues with the men grew to be distressing for ellen  they presaged his further deterioration and the everpresent evil of the growing feud  one day jorth rode home in the early morning after an absence of two nights  ellen heard the clipclop of horses long before she saw them  hey ellen  come out heah called her father  ellen left her work and went outside  a stranger had ridden in with her father a young giant whose sharpfeatured face appeared marked by ferretlike eyes and a fine light fuzzy beard  he was long loose jointed not heavy of build and he had the largest hands and feet ellen bad ever seen  next ellen espied a black horse they had evidently brought with them  her father was holding a rope halter  at once the black horse struck ellen as being a beauty and a thoroughbred  ellen heahs a horse for you said jorth with something of pride i made a trade  reckon i wanted him myself but hes too gentle for me an maybe a little small for my weight  delight visited ellen for the first time in many days  seldom had she owned a good horse and never one like this  oh dad she exclaimed in her gratitude  shore hes yours on one condition said her father  whats that asked ellen as she laid caressing hands on the restless horse  youre not to ride him out of the canyon  agreed all daid black isnt he except that white face whats his name dad  i forgot to ask replied jorth as he began unsaddling his own horse slater whats this heah blacks name  the lanky giant grinned  i reckon it was spades  spades ejaculated ellen blankly  what a name  well i guess its as good as any  hes shore black  ellen keep him hobbled when youre not ridin him was her fathers parting advice as he walked off with the stranger  spades was wet and dusty and his satiny skin quivered  he had fine dark intelligent eyes that watched ellens every move  she knew how her father and his friends dragged and jammed horses through the woods and over the rough trails  it did not take her long to discover that this horse had been a pet  ellen cleaned his coat and brushed him and fed him  then she fitted her bridle to suit his head and saddled him his evident response to her kindness assured her that he was gentle so she mounted and rode him to discover he had the easiest gait she had ever experienced  he walked and trotted to suit her will but when left to choose his own gait he fell into a graceful little pace that was very easy for her  he appeared quite ready to break into a run at her slightest bidding but ellen satisfied herself on this first ride with his slower gaits  spades yuve shore cut out my burro jinny said ellen regretfully well i reckon women are fickle  next day she rode up the canyon to show spades to her friend john sprague  the old burro breeder was not at home  as his door was open however and a fire smoldering ellen concluded he would soon return so she waited  dismounting she left spades free to graze on the new green grass that carpeted the ground  the cabin and little level clearing accentuated the loneliness and wildness of the forest ellen always liked it here and had once been in the habit of visiting the old man often  but of late she had stayed away for the reason that spragues talk and his news and his poorly hidden pity depressed her  presently she heard hoof beats on the hard packed trail leading down the canyon in the direction from which she had come  scarcely likely was it that sprague should return from this direction  ellen thought her father had sent one of the herders for her  but when she caught a glimpse of the approaching horseman down in the aspens she failed to recognize him  after he had passed one of the openings she heard his horse stop  probably the man had seen her at least she could not otherwise account for his stopping  the glimpse she had of him had given her the impression that he was bending over peering ahead in the trail looking for tracks  then she heard the rider come on again more slowly this time  at length the horse trotted out into the opening to be hauled up short  ellen recognized the buckskinclad figure the broad shoulders the dark face of jean isbel  ellen felt prey to the strangest quaking sensation she had ever suffered it took violence of her newborn spirit to subdue that feeling  isbel rode slowly across the clearing toward her  for ellen his approach seemed singularly swiftso swift that her surprise dismay conjecture and anger obstructed her will  the outwardly calm and cold ellen jorth was a travesty that mocked herthat she felt he would discern  the moment isbel drew close enough for ellen to see his face she experienced a strong shuddering repetition of her first shock of recognition  he was not the same  the light the youth was gone this however did not cause her emotion  was it not a sudden transition of her nature to the dominance of hate  ellen seemed to feel the shadow of her unknown self standing with her  isbel halted his horse  ellen had been standing near the trunk of a fallen pine and she instinctively backed against it  how her legs trembled  isbel took off his cap and crushed it nervously in his bare brown hand  good mornin miss ellen he said  ellen did not return his greeting but queried almost breathlessly did yu come by our ranch  no i circled he replied  jean isbel  what do yu want heah she demanded  dont you know he returned  his eyes were intensely black and piercing  they seemed to search ellens very soul  to meet their gaze was an ordeal that only her rousing fury sustained  ellen felt on her lips a scornful allusion to his halfbreed indian traits and the reputation that had preceded him  but she could not utter it  no she replied  its hard to call a woman a liar he returned bitterly  but you must beseein youre a jorth  liar  not to yu jean isbel she retorted  id not lie to yu to save my life  he studied her with keen sober moody intent  the dark fire of his eyes thrilled her  if thats true im glad he said  shore its true  ive no idea why yu came heah  ellen did have a dawning idea that she could not force into oblivion but if she ever admitted it to her consciousness she must fail in the contempt and scorn and fearlessness she chose to throw in this mans face  does old sprague live here asked isbel  yes  i expect him back soon did yu come to see him  no did sprague tell you anythin about the row he saw me in  hedid not replied ellen lying with stiff lips  she who had sworn she could not lie  she felt the hot blood leaving her heart mounting in a wave  all her conscious will seemed impelled to deceive  what had she to hide from jean isbel  and a still small voice replied that she had to hide the ellen jorth who had waited for him that day who had spied upon him who had treasured a gift she could not destroy who had hugged to her miserable heart the fact that he had fought for her name  im glad of that isbel was saying thoughtfully  did you come heah to see me interrupted ellen  she felt that she could not endure this reiterated suggestion of fineness of consideration in him  she would betray herselfbetray what she did not even realize herself  she must force other footingand that should be the one of strife between the jorths and isbels  nohonest i didnt miss ellen he rejoined humbly  ill tell you presently why i came  but it wasnt to see you i dont deny i wanted  but thats no matter  you didnt meet me that day on the rim  meet yu she echoed coldly   shore yu never expected me  somehow i did he replied with those penetrating eyes on her i put somethin in your tent that day  did you find it  yes she replied with the same casual coldness  what did you do with it  i kicked it out of course she replied  she saw him flinch  and you never opened it  certainly not she retorted as if forced  doont yu know anythin aboutabout people  shore even if yu are an isbel yu never were born in texas  thank god i wasnt he replied  i was born in a beautiful country of green meadows and deep forests and white rivers not in a barren desert where men live dry and hard as the cactus  where i come from men dont live on hate  they can forgive  forgive  could yu forgive a jorth  yes i could  shore thats easy to saywith the wrongs all on your side she declared bitterly  ellen jorth the first wrong was on your side retorted jean his voice fall  your father stole my fathers sweetheartby lies by slander by dishonor by makin terrible love to her in his absence  its a lie cried ellen passionately  it is not he declared solemnly  jean isbel i say yu lie  no  i say youve been lied to he thundered  the tremendous force of his spirit seemed to fling truth at ellen it weakened her  butmother loved dadbest  yes afterward  no wonder poor woman  but it was the action of your father and your mother that ruined all these lives  youve got to know the truth ellen jorth all the years of hate have borne their fruit  god almighty can never save us now  blood must be spilled the jorths and the isbels cant live on the same earth and youve got to know the truth because the worst of this hell falls on you and me  the hate that he spoke of alone upheld her  never jean isbel she cried  ill never know truth from yu ill never share anythin with yunot even hell  isbel dismounted and stood before her still holding his bridle reins the bay horse champed his bit and tossed his head  why do you hate me so he asked  i just happen to be my fathers son i never harmed you or any of your people  i met you  fell in love with you in a flashthough i never knew it till after why do you hate me so terribly  ellen felt a heavy stifling pressure within her breast  yure an isbel doont speak of love to me  i didnt intend to  but youryour hate seems unnatural  and well probably never meet again i cant help it  i love you  love at first sight  jean isbel and ellen jorth  strange isnt it  it was all so strange  my meetin you so lonely and unhappy my seein you so sweet and beautiful my thinkin you so good in spite of  shore it was strange interrupted ellen with scornful laugh she had found her defense  in hurting him she could hide her own hurt thinking me so good in spite of  haha  and i said id been kissed before  yes in spite of everything he said  ellen could not look at him as he loomed over her  she felt a wild tumult in her heart  all that crowded to her lips for utterance was false  yeskissed before i met youand since she said mockingly and i laugh at what yu call love jean isbel  laugh if you wantbut believe it was sweet honorablethe best in me he replied in deep earnestness  bah cried ellen with all the force of her pain and shame and hate  by heaven you must be different from what i thought exclaimed isbel huskily  shore if i wasnt id make myself now mister jean isbel get on your horse an go  something of composure came to ellen with these words of dismissal and she glanced up at him with halfveiled eyes  his changed aspect prepared her for some blow  thats a pretty black horse  yes replied ellen blankly  do you like him  ii love him  all right ill give him to you then  hell have less work and kinder treatment than if i used him  ive got some pretty hard rides ahead of me  yuyu give whispered ellen slowly stiffening  yes  hes mine replied isbel  with that he turned to whistle  spades threw up his head snorted and started forward at a trot  he came faster the closer he got and if ever ellen saw the joy of a horse at sight of a beloved master she saw it then  isbel laid a hand on the animals neck and caressed him then turning back to ellen he went on speaking i picked him from a lot of fine horses of my fathers  we got along well  my sister ann rode him a good deal he was stolen from our pasture day before yesterday  i took his trail and tracked him up here  never lost his trail till i got to your ranch where i had to circle till i picked it up again  stolenpasturetracked him up heah echoed ellen without any evidence of emotion whatever  indeed she seemed to have been turned to stone  trackin him was easy  i wish for your sake it d been impossible he said bluntly  for my sake she echoed in precisely the same tone  manifestly that tone irritated isbel beyond control  he misunderstood it  with a hand far from gentle he pushed her bent head back so he could look into her face  yes for your sake he declared harshly  havent you sense enough to see that  what kind of a game do you think you can play with me  game i  game of what she asked  why aa game of ignoranceinnocenceany old game to fool a man whos tryin to be decent  this time ellen mutely looked her dull blank questioning  and it inflamed isbel  you know your fathers a horse thief he thundered  outwardly ellen remained the same  she had been prepared for an unknown and a terrible blow  it had fallen  and her face her body her hands locked with the supreme fortitude of pride and sustained by hate gave no betrayal of the crashing thundering ruin within her mind and soul  motionless she leaned there meeting the piercing fire of isbels eyes seeing in them a righteous and terrible scorn  in one flash the naked truth seemed blazed at her  the faith she had fostered died a sudden death  a thousand perplexing problems were solved in a second of whirling revealing thought  ellen jorth you know your fathers in with this hash knife gang of rustlers thundered isbel  shore she replied with the cool easy careless defiance of a texan  you know hes got this daggs to lead his faction against the isbels  shore  you know this talk of sheepmen buckin the cattlemen is all a blind  shore reiterated ellen  isbel gazed darkly down upon her  with his anger spent for the moment he appeared ready to end the interview  but he seemed fascinated by the strange look of her by the incomprehensible something she emanated havoc gleamed in his pale set face  he shook his dark head and his broad hand went to his breast  to think i fell in love with such as you he exclaimed and his other hand swept out in a tragic gesture of helpless pathos and impotence  the hell isbel had hinted at now possessed ellenbody mind and soul disgraced scorned by an isbel  yet loved by him  in that divination there flamed up a wild fierce passion to hurt to rend to flay to fling back upon him a stinging agony  her thought flew upon her like whips  pride of the jorths  pride of the old texan blue blood  it lay dead at her feet killed by the scornful words of the last of that family to whom she owed her degradation  daughter of a horse thief and rustler  dark and evil and grim set the forces within her accepting her fate damning her enemies true to the blood of the jorths  the sins of the father must be visited upon the daughter  shore yu might have had methat day on the rimif yu hadnt told your name she said mockingly and she gazed into his eyes with all the mystery of a womans nature  isbels powerful frame shook as with an ague  girl what do you mean  shore id have been plumb fond of havin yu make up to me she drawled  it possessed her now with irresistible power this fact of the love he could not help  some fiendish womans satisfaction dwelt in her consciousness of her power to kill the noble the faithful the good in him  ellen jorth you lie he burst out hoarsely  jean shore id been a toy and a rag for these rustlers long enough i was tired of them i wanted a new lover and if yu hadnt give yourself away  isbel moved so swiftly that she did not realize his intention until his hard hand smote her mouth  instantly she tasted the hot salty blood from a cut lip  shut up you hussy he ordered roughly  have you no shame  my sister ann spoke well of you  she made excusesshe pitied you  that for ellen seemed the culminating blow under which she almost sank but one moment longer could she maintain this unnatural and terrible poise  jean isbelgo along with yu she said impatiently  im waiting heah for simm bruce  at last it was as if she struck his heart  because of doubt of himself and a stubborn faith in her his passion and jealousy were not proof against this last stab  instinctive subtlety inherent in ellen had prompted the speech that tortured isbel  how the shock to him rebounded on her  she gasped as he lunged for her too swift for her to move a hand  one arm crushed round her like a steel band the other hard across her breast and neck forced her head back  then she tried to wrestle away  but she was utterly powerless  his dark face bent down closer and closer  suddenly ellen ceased trying to struggle she was like a stricken creature paralyzed by the piercing hypnotic eyes of a snake  yet in spite of her terror if he meant death by her she welcomed it  ellen jorth im thinkin yetyou lie he said low and tense between his teeth  no  no she screamed wildly  her nerve broke there  she could no longer meet those terrible black eyes  her passionate denial was not only the last of her shameful deceit it was the woman of her repudiating herself and him and all this sickening miserable situation  isbel took her literally  she had convinced him  and the instant held blank horror for ellen  by godthen ill have somethinof you anyway muttered isbel thickly  ellen saw the blood bulge in his powerful neck  she saw his dark hard face strange now fearful to behold come lower and lower till it blurred and obstructed her gaze  she felt the swell and ripple and stretchthen the bind of his muscles like huge coils of elastic rope then with savage rude force his mouth closed on hers  all ellens senses reeled as if she were swooning  she was suffocating  the spasm passed and a bursting spurt of blood revived her to acute and terrible consciousness  for the endless period of one moment he held her so that her breast seemed crushed  his kisses burned and braised her lips  and then shifting violently to her neck they pressed so hard that she choked under them  it was as if a huge bat had fastened upon her throat  suddenly the remorseless binding embracesthe hot and savage kissesfell away from her  isbel had let go  she saw him throw up his hands and stagger back a little all the while with his piercing gaze on her his face had been dark purple now it was white  noellen jorth he panted i dontwant any of youthat way and suddenly he sank on the log and covered his face with his hands what i loved in youwas what i thoughtyou were  like a wildcat ellen sprang upon him beating him with her fists tearing at his hair scratching his face in a blind fury  isbel made no move to stop her and her violence spent itself with her strength she swayed back from him shaking so that she could scarcely stand  yudamnedisbel she gasped with hoarse passion  yu insulted me  insulted you laughed isbel in bitter scorn  it couldnt be done  oh  ill kill yu she hissed  isbel stood up and wiped the red scratches on his face  go ahead theres my gun he said pointing to his saddle sheath  somebodys got to begin this jorthisbel feud  itll be a dirty business  im sick of it already kill me  first blood for ellen jorth  suddenly the dark grim tide that had seemed to engulf ellens very soul cooled and receded leaving her without its false  strength  she began to sag  she stared at isbels gun  kill him whispered the retreating voices of her hate  but she was as powerless as if she were still held in jean isbels giant embrace  ii want tokill yu she whispered but i caint leave me  youre no jorththe same as im no isbel  we oughtnt be mixed in this deal he said somberly  im sorrier for you than i am for myself youre a girl you once had a good mothera decent home and this life youve led heremean as its beenis nothin to what youll face now  damn the men that brought you to this  im goin to kill some of them  with that he mounted and turned away  ellen called out for him to take his horse  he did not stop nor look back  she called again but her voice was fainter and isbel was now leaving at a trot  slowly she sagged against the tree lower and lower  he headed into the trail leading up the canyon  how strange a relief ellen felt  she watched him ride into the aspens and start up the slope at last to disappear in the pines  it seemed at the moment that he took with him something which had been hers  a pain in her head dulled the thoughts that wavered to and fro  after he had gone she could not see so well her eyes were tired  what had happened to her  there was blood on her hands  isbels blood  she shuddered  was it an omen  lower she sank against the tree and closed her eyes  old john sprague did not return  hours dragged bydark hours for ellen jorth lying prostrate beside the tree hiding the blue sky and golden sunlight from her eyes  at length the lethargy of despair the black dull misery wore away and she gradually returned to a condition of coherent thought  what had she learned  sight of the black horse grazing near seemed to prompt the trenchant replies  spades belonged to jean isbel  he had been stolen by her father or by one of her fathers accomplices isbels vaunted cunning as a tracker had been no idle boast  her father was a horse thief a rustler a sheepman only as a blind a consort of daggs leader of the hash knife gang  ellen well remembered the ill repute of that gang way back in texas years ago her father had gotten in with this famous band of rustlers to serve his own endsthe extermination of the isbels  it was all very plain now to ellen  daughter of a horse thief an rustler she muttered  and her thoughts sped back to the days of her girlhood  only the very early stage of that time had been happy  in the light of isbels revelation the many changes of residence the sudden moves to unsettled parts of texas the periods of poverty and sudden prosperity all leading to the final journey to this godforsaken arizonathese were now seen in their true significance  as far back as she could remember her father had been a crooked man  and her mother had known it  he had dragged her to her ruin  that degradation had killed her ellen realized that with poignant sorrow with a sudden revolt against her father  had gaston isbel truly and dishonestly started her father on his downhill road  ellen wondered  she hated the isbels with unutterable and growing hate yet she had it in her to think to ponder to weigh judgments in their behalf  she owed it to something in herself to be fair  but what did it matter who was to blame for the jorthisbel feud  somehow ellen was forced to confess that deep in her soul it mattered terribly  to be true to herselfthe self that she alone knewshe must have right on her side  if the jorths were guilty and she clung to them and their creed then she would be one of them  but im not she mused aloud  my names jorth an i reckon i have bad blood but it never came out in me till today  ive been honest  ive been goodyes good as my mother taught me to bein spite of all shore my pride made me a fool an now have i any choice to make  im a jorth  i must stick to my father  all this summing up however did not wholly account for the pang in her breast  what had she done that day  and the answer beat in her ears like a great throbbing hammerstroke  in an agony of shame in the throes of hate she had perjured herself  she had sworn away her honor  she had basely made herself vile  she had struck ruthlessly at the great heart of a man who loved her  ah  that thrust had rebounded to leave this dreadful pang in her breast  loved her  yes the strange truth the insupportable truth  she had to contend now not with her father and her disgrace not with the baffling presence of jean isbel but with the mysteries of her own soul  wonder of all wonders was it that such love had been born for her shame worse than all other shame was it that she should kill it by a poisoned lie  by what monstrous motive had she done that  to sting isbel as he had stung her  but that had been base  never could she have stopped so low except in a moment of tremendous tumult  if she had done sore injury to isbel what bad she done to herself  how strange how tenacious had been his faith in her honor  could she ever forget  she must forget it  but she could never forget the way he had scorned those vile men in greavess storethe way he had beaten bruce for defiling her namethe way he had stubbornly denied her own insinuations  she was a woman now  she had learned something of the complexity of a womans heart  she could not change nature  and all her passionate being thrilled to the manhood of her defender  but even while she thrilled she acknowledged her hate it was the contention between the two that caused the pang in her breast  an now whats left for me murmured ellen  she did not analyze the significance of what had prompted that query  the most incalculable of the days disclosures was the wrong she had done herself  shore im done for one way or another i must stick to dad or kill myself  ellen rode spades back to the ranch  she rode like the wind  when she swung out of the trail into the open meadow in plain sight of the ranch her appearance created a commotion among the loungers before the cabin she rode spades at a full run  whos after you yelled her father as she pulled the black to a halt jorth held a rifle  daggs colter the other jorths were there likewise armed and all watchful strung with expectancy  shore nobodys after me replied ellen  caint i run a horse round heah without being chased  jorth appeared both incensed and relieved  hah  what you mean girl runnin like a streak right down on us youre actin queer these days an you look queer im not likin it  reckon these are queer timesfor the jorths replied ellen sarcastically  daggs found strange horse tracks crossin the meadow said her father an that worried us  some ones been snoopin round the ranch  an when we seen you runnin so wild we shore thought you was bein chased  no  i was only trying out spades to see how fast he could run returned ellen  reckon when we do get chased itll take some running to catch me  haw haw roared daggs  it shore will ellen  girl its not only your runnin an your looks thats queer declared jorth in dark perplexity  you talk queer  shore dad yure not used to hearing spades called spades said ellen as she dismounted  humph ejaculated her father as if convinced of the uselessness of trying to understand a woman  say did you see any strange horse tracks  i reckon i did  and i know who made them  jorth stiffened  all the men behind him showed a sudden intensity of suspense  who demanded jorth  shore it was jean isbel replied ellen coolly  he came up heah tracking his black horse  jeanisbeltrackinhisblack horse repeated her father  yes  hes not overrated as a tracker thats shore  blank silence ensued  ellen cast a slow glance over her father and the others then she began to loosen the cinches of her saddle presently jorth burst the silence with a curse and daggs followed with one of his sardonic laughs  wal boss what did i tell you he drawled  jorth strode to ellen and whirling her around with a strong hand he held her facing him  did yu see isbel  yes replied ellen just as sharply as her father had asked  did yu talk to him  yes  what did he want up heah  i told yu  he was tracking the black horse yu stole  jorths hand and arm dropped limply  his sallow face turned a livid hue amaze merged into discomfiture and that gave place to rage  he raised a hand as if to strike ellen  and suddenly daggss long arm shot out to clutch jorths wrist  wrestling to free himself jorth cursed under his breath  let go daggs he shouted stridently  am i drunk that you grab me  wal yu aint drunk i reckon replied the rustler with sarcasm but yure shore some things ill reserve for your private ear  jorth gained a semblance of composure  but it was evident that he labored under a shock  ellen did jean isbel see this black horse  yes  he asked me how i got spades an i told him  did he say spades belonged to him  shore i reckon he proved it  yu can always tell a horse that loves its master  did yu offer to give spades back  yes  but isbel wouldnt take him  hah  an why not  he said hed rather i kept him  he was about to engage in a dirty bloodspilling deal an he reckoned hed not be able to care for a fine horse i didnt want spades  i tried to make isbel take him but he rode off and thats all there is to that  maybe its not replied jorth chewing his mustache and eying ellen with dark intent gaze  yuve met this isbel twice  it wasnt any fault of mine retorted ellen  i heah hes sweet on yu  how aboot that  ellen smarted under the blaze of blood that swept to neck and cheek and temple  but it was only memory which fired this shame  what her father and his crowd might think were matters of supreme indifference yet she met his suspicious gaze with truthful blazing eyes  i heah talk from bruce an lorenzo went on her father  an daggs heah  daggs nothin interrupted that worthy  dont fetch me in  i said nothin an i think nothin  yes jean isbel was sweet on me dad  but he will never be again returned ellen in low tones  with that she pulled her saddle off spades and throwing it over her shoulder she walked off to her cabin  hardly had she gotten indoors when her father entered  ellen i didnt know that horse belonged to isbel he began in the swift hoarse persuasive voice so familiar to ellen  i swear i didnt i bought himtraded with slater for him honest to god i never had any idea he was stolen  why when yu said that horse yu stole  i felt as if yud knifed me  ellen sat at the table and listened while her father paced to and fro and by his restless action and passionate speech worked himself into a frenzy  he talked incessantly as if her silence was condemnatory and as if eloquence alone could convince her of his honesty  it seemed that ellen saw and heard with keener faculties than ever before he had a terrible thirst for her respect  not so much for her love she divined but that she would not see how he had fallen  she pitied him with all her heart  she was all he had as he was all the world to her  and so as she gave ear to his long illogical rigmarole of argument and defense she slowly found that her pity and her love were making vital decisions for her  as of old in poignant moments her father lapsed at last into a denunciation of the isbels and what they had brought him to  his sufferings were real at least in ellens presence  she was the only link that bound him to longpast happier times  she was her mother over againthe woman who had betrayed another man for him and gone with him to her ruin and death  dad dont go on so said ellen breaking in upon her fathers rant i will be true to yuas my mother was i am a jorth  your place is my placeyour fight is my fight never speak of the past to me again  if god spares us through this feud we will go away and begin all over again far off where no one ever heard of a jorth if were not spared well at least have had our whack at these damned isbels    chapter vii  during june jean isbel did not ride far away from grass valley  another attempt had been made upon gaston isbels life  another cowardly shot had been fired from ambush this time from a pine thicket bordering the trail that led to blaisdells ranch  blaisdell heard this shot so near his home was it fired  no trace of the hidden foe could be found  the ground all around that vicinity bore a carpet of pine needles which showed no trace of footprints  the supposition was that this cowardly attempt had been perpetrated or certainly instigated by the jorths  but there was no proof  and gaston isbel had other enemies in the tonto basin besides the sheep clan  the old man raged like a lion about this sneaking attack on him  and his friend blaisdell urged an immediate gathering of their kin and friends lets quit ranchin till this troubles settled he declared  lets arm an ride the trails an meet these men halfway it wont help our side any to wait till youre shot in the back  more than one of isbels supporters offered the same advice  no well wait till we know for shore was the stubborn cattlemans reply to all these promptings  know  wal hell  didnt jean find the black hoss up at jorths ranch demanded blaisdell  what more do we want  jean couldnt swear jorth stole the black  wal by thunder i can swear to it growled blaisdell  an were losin cattle all the time  whos stealin em  weve always lost cattle ever since we started ranchin heah  gas i reckon yu want jorth to start this fight in the open  itll start soon enough was isbels gloomy reply  jean had not failed altogether in his tracking of lost or stolen cattle circumstances had been against him and there was something baffling about this rustling  the summer storms set in early and it had been his luck to have heavy rains wash out fresh tracks that he might have followed  the range was large and cattle were everywhere sometimes a loss was not discovered for weeks  gaston isbels sons were now the only men left to ride the range  two of his riders had quit because of the threatened war and isbel had let another go  so that jean did not often learn that cattle had been stolen until their tracks were old added to that was the fact that this grass valley country was covered with horse tracks and cattle tracks  the rustlers whoever they were had long been at the game and now that there was reason for them to show their cunning they did it  early in july the hot weather came  down on the red ridges of the tonto it was hot desert  the nights were cool the early mornings were pleasant but the day was something to endure  when the white cumulus clouds rolled up out of the southwest growing larger and thicker and darker here and there coalescing into a black thundercloud jean welcomed them  he liked to see the gray streamers of rain hanging down from a canopy of black and the roar of rain on the trees as it approached like a trampling army was always welcome  the grassy flats the red ridges the rocky slopes the thickets of manzanita and scrub oak and cactus were dusty glaring throatparching places under the hot summer sun  jean longed for the cool heights of the rim the shady pines the dark sweet verdure under the silver spruces the tinkle and murmur of the clear rills  he often had another longing too which he bitterly stifled  jeans ally the keennosed shepherd clog had disappeared one day and had never returned  among men at the ranch there was a difference of opinion as to what had happened to shepp  the old rancher thought he had been poisoned or shot bill and guy isbel believed he had been stolen by sheep herders who were always stealing dogs and jean inclined to the conviction that shepp had gone off with the timber wolves  the fact was that shepp did not return and jean missed him  one morning at dawn jean heard the cattle bellowing and trampling out in the valley and upon hurrying to a vantage point he was amazed to see upward of five hundred steers chasing a lone wolf  jeans father had seen such a spectacle as this but it was a new one for jean  the wolf was a big gray and black fellow rangy and powerful and until he got the steers all behind him he was rather hard put to it to keep out of their way  probably he had dogged the herd trying to sneak in and pull down a yearling and finally the steers had charged him jean kept along the edge of the valley in the hope they would chase him within range of a rifle  but the wary wolf saw jean and sheered off gradually drawing away from his pursuers  jean returned to the house for his breakfast and then set off across the valley  his father owned one small flock of sheep that had not yet been driven up on the rim where all the sheep in the country were run during the hot dry summer down on the tonto  young evarts and a mexican boy named bernardino had charge of this flock  the regular mexican herder a man of experience had given up his job and these boys were not equal to the task of risking the sheep up in the enemies stronghold  this flock was known to be grazing in a side draw well up from grass valley where the brush afforded some protection from the sun and there was good water and a little feed  before jean reached his destination he heard a shot  it was not a rifle shot which fact caused jean a little concern  evarts and bernardino had rifles but to his knowledge no small arms  jean rode up on one of the blackbrushed conical hills that rose on the south side of grass valley and from there he took a sharp survey of the country  at first he made out only cattle and bare meadowland and the low encircling ridges and hills  but presently up toward the head of the valley he descried a bunch of horsemen riding toward the village  he could not tell their number  that dark moving mass seemed to jean to be instinct with life mystery menace  who were they  it was too far for him to recognize horses let alone riders  they were moving fast too  jean watched them out of sight then turned his horse downhill again and rode on his quest  a number of horsemen like that was a very unusual sight around grass valley at any time  what then did it portend now  jean experienced a little shock of uneasy dread that was a new sensation for him  brooding over this he proceeded on his way at length to turn into the draw where the camp of the sheepherders was located  upon coming in sight of it he heard a hoarse shout  young evarts appeared running frantically out of the brush  jean urged his horse into a run and soon covered the distance between them  evarts appeared beside himself with terror  boy whats the matter queried jean as he dismounted rifle in hand peering quickly from evartss white face to the camp and all around  bernardino  bernardino gasped the boy wringing his hands and pointing  jean ran the few remaining rods to the sheep camp  he saw the little teepee a burnedout fire a halffinished mealand then the mexican lad lying prone on the ground dead with a bullet hole in his ghastly face  near him lay an old sixshooter  whose gun is that demanded jean as he picked it up  bernardinos replied evarts huskily hehe jest got itthe other day  did he shoot himself accidentally  oh no  no  he didnt do itatall  who did then  the menthey rode upa gangthey did it panted evarts  did you know who they were  no i couldnt tell  i saw them comin an i was skeered bernardino had gone fer water  i run an hid in the brush  i wanted to yell but they come too close then i heerd them talkin  bernardino come back  they peared friendlylike  thet made me raise up to look an i couldnt see good  i heerd one of them ask bernardino to let him see his gun  an bernardino handed it over  he looked at the gun an hawhawed an flipped it up in the air an when it fell back in his hand itit went off bang  an bernardino dropped i hid down close  i was skeered stiff  i heerd them talk more but not what they said  then they rode away an i hid there till i seen yu comin  have you got a horse queried jean sharply  no but i can ride one of bernardinos burros  get one  hurry over to blaisdell  tell him to send word to blue and gordon and fredericks to ride like the devil to my fathers ranch hurry now  young evarts ran off without reply  jean stood looking down at the limp and pathetic figure of the mexican boy  by heaven he exclaimed grimly the jorthisbel war is on  deliberate coldblooded murder ill gamble daggs did this job  hes been given the leadership  hes started it bernardino greaser or not you were a faithful lad and you wont go long unavenged  jean had no time to spare  tearing a tarpaulin out of the teepee he covered the lad with it and then ran for his horse  mounting he galloped down the draw over the little red ridges out into the valley where he put his horse to a run  action changed the sickening horror that sight of bernardino had engendered  jean even felt a strange grim relief  the long dragging days of waiting were over  jorths gang had taken the initiative blood had begun to flow  and it would continue to flow now till the last man of one faction stood over the dead body of the last man of the other  would it be a jorth or an isbel  my instinct was right he muttered aloud  that bunch of horses gave me a queer feelin jean gazed all around the grassy cattledotted valley he was crossing so swiftly and toward the village but he did not see any sign of the dark group of riders  they had gone on to greavess store there no doubt to drink and to add more enemies of the isbels to their gang suddenly across jeans mind flashed a thought of ellen jorth  what ll become of her  what ll become of all the women  my sister  the little ones  no one was in sight around the ranch  never had it appeared more peaceful and pastoral to jean  the grazing cattle and horses in the foreground the haystack half eaten away the cows in the fenced pasture the column of blue smoke lazily ascending the cackle of hens the solid wellbuilt cabinsall these seemed to repudiate jeans haste and his darkness of mind  this place was his fathers farm there was not a cloud in the blue summer sky  as jean galloped up the lane some one saw him from the door and then bill and guy and their grayheaded father came out upon the porch jean saw how he waved the womenfolk back and then strode out into the lane  bill and guy reached his side as jean pulled his heaving horse to a halt  they all looked at jean swiftly and intently with a little hard fiery gleam strangely identical in the eyes of each probably before a word was spoken they knew what to expect  wal you shore was in a hurry remarked the father  what the hells up queried bill grimly  guy isbel remained silent and it was he who turned slightly pale jean leaped off his horse  bernardino has just been killedmurdered with his own gun  gaston isbel seemed to exhale a longdammed bursting breath that let his chest sag  a terrible deadly glint pale and cold as sunlight on ice grew slowly to dominate his clear eyes  ahuh ejaculated bill isbel hoarsely  not one of the three men asked who had done the killing  they were silent a moment motionless locked in the secret seclusion of their own minds  then they listened with absorption to jeans brief story  wal that lets us in said his father  i wish we had more time reckon id done better to listen to you boys an have my men close at hand  jacobs happened to ride over  that makes five of us besides the women  aw dad you dont reckon theyll round us up heah asked guy isbel  boys i always feared they might replied the old man  but i never really believed theyd have the nerve  shore i ought to have figgered daggs better  this heah secret bizness an shootin at us from ambush looked aboot jorths size to me  but i reckon now well have to fight without our friends  let them come said jean  i sent for blaisdell blue gordon and fredericks  maybe theyll get here in time  but if they dont it neednt worry us much  we can hold out here longer than jorths gang can hang around  well want plenty of water wood and meat in the house  wal ill see to that rejoined his father  jean you go out close by where you can see all around an keep watch  whos goin to tell the women asked guy isbel  the silence that momentarily ensued was an eloquent testimony to the hardest and saddest aspect of this strife between men  the inevitableness of it in no wise detracted from its sheer uselessness men from time immemorial had hated and killed one another always to the misery and degradation of their women  old gaston isbel showed this tragic realization in his lined face  wal boys ill tell the women he said  shore you neednt worry none aboot them  theyll be game  jean rode away to an open knoll a short distance from the house and here he stationed himself to watch all points  the cedared ridge back of the ranch was the one approach by which jorths gang might come close without being detected but even so jean could see them and ride to the house in time to prevent a surprise  the moments dragged by and at the end of an hour jean was in hopes that blaisdell would soon come  these hopes were well founded  presently he heard a clatter of hoofs on hard ground to the south and upon wheeling to look he saw the friendly neighbor coming fast along the road riding a big white horse blaisdell carried a rifle in his hand and the sight of him gave jean a glow of warmth  he was one of the texans who would stand by the isbels to the last man  jean watched him ride to the housewatched the meeting between him and his lifelong friend there floated out to jean old blaisdells roar of rage  then out on the green of grass valley where a long swelling plain swept away toward the village there appeared a moving dark patch a bunch of horses  jeans body gave a slight startthe shock of sudden propulsion of blood through all his veins  those horses bore riders they were coming straight down the open valley on the wagon road to isbels ranch  no subterfuge nor secrecy nor sneaking in that advance a hot thrill ran over jean  by heaven  they mean business he muttered  up to the last moment he had unconsciously hoped jorths gang would not come boldly like that the verifications of all a texans inherited instincts left no doubts no hopes no illusionsonly a grim certainty that this was not conjecture nor probability but fact  for a moment longer jean watched the slowly moving dark patch of horsemen against the green background then he hurried back to the ranch  his father saw him comingstrode out as before  dadjorth is comin said jean huskily  how he hated to be forced to tell his father that  the boyish love of old had flashed up  whar demanded the old man his eagle gaze sweeping the horizon  down the road from grass valley  you cant see from here  wal come in an lets get ready  isbels house had not been constructed with the idea of repelling an attack from a band of apaches  the long living room of the main cabin was the one selected for defense and protection  this room had two windows and a door facing the lane and a door at each end one of which opened into the kitchen and the other into an adjoining and laterbuilt cabin  the logs of this main cabin were of large size and the doors and window coverings were heavy affording safer protection from bullets than the other cabins  when jean went in he seemed to see a host of white faces lifted to him his sister ann his two sistersinlaw the children all mutely watched him with eyes that would haunt him  wal blaisdell jean says jorth an his precious gang of rustlers are on the way heah announced the rancher  damn me if its not a bad day fer lee jorth declared blaisdell  clear off that table ordered isbel an fetch out all the guns an shells we got  once laid upon the table these presented a formidable arsenal which consisted of the three new 44 winchesters that jean had brought with him from the coast the enormous buffalo or socalled needle gun that gaston isbel had used for years a henry rifle which blaisdell had brought and half a dozen sixshooters  piles and packages of ammunition littered the table  sort out these heah shells said isbel  everybody wants to get hold of his own  jacobs the neighbor who was present was a thickset bearded man rather jovial among those leanjawed texans  he carried a 44 rifle of an old pattern  wal boys if id knowed we was in fer some fun id hev fetched more shells  only got one magazine full  mebbe them new 44s will fit my gun  it was discovered that the ammunition jean had brought in quantity fitted jacobs rifle a fact which afforded peculiar satisfaction to all the men present  wal shore were lucky declared gaston isbel  the women sat apart in the comer toward the kitchen and there seemed to be a strange fascination for them in the talk and action of the men the wife of jacobs was a little woman with homely face and very bright eyes  jean thought she would be a help in that household during the next doubtful hours  every moment jean would go to the window and peer out down the road his companions evidently relied upon him for no one else looked out now that the suspense of days and weeks was over these texans faced the issue with talk and act not noticeably different from those of ordinary moments  at last jean espied the dark mass of horsemen out in the valley road they were close together walking their mounts and evidently in earnest conversation  after several ineffectual attempts jean counted eleven horses every one of which he was sure bore a rider  dad look out called jean  gaston isbel strode to the door and stood looking without a word  the other men crowded to the windows  blaisdell cursed under his breath  jacobs said by golly  come to pay us a call  the women sat motionless with dark strained eyes  the children ceased their play and looked fearfully to their mother  when just out of rifle shot of the cabins the band of horsemen halted and lined up in a half circle all facing the ranch  they were close enough for jean to see their gestures but he could not recognize any of their faces  it struck him singularly that not one of them wore a mask  jean do you know any of them asked his father  no not yet  theyre too far off  dad ill get your old telescope said guy isbel and he ran out toward the adjoining cabin  blaisdell shook his big hoary head and rumbled out of his bulllike neck wal now youre heah you sheep fellars what are you goin to do aboot it  guy isbel returned with a yardlong telescope which he passed to his father  the old man took it with shaking hands and leveled it suddenly it was as if he had been transfixed then he lowered the glass shaking violently and his face grew gray with an exceeding bitter wrath  jorth he swore harshly  jean had only to look at his father to know that recognition had been like a mortal shock  it passed  again the rancher leveled the glass  wal blaisdell theres our old texas friend daggs he drawled dryly an greaves our honest storekeeper of grass valley  an theres stonewall jackson jorth  an tad jorth with the same old red nose  an say damn if one of that gang isnt queen as bad a gun fighter as texas ever bred  shore i thought hed been killed in the big bend country  so i heard an theres craig another respectable sheepman of grass valley  hawhaw  an wal i dont recognize any more of them  jean forthwith took the glass and moved it slowly across the faces of that group of horsemen  simm bruce he said instantly  i see colter  and yes greaves is there  ive seen the man next to himface like a ham  shore that is craig interrupted his father  jean knew the dark face of lee jorth by the resemblance it bore to ellens and the recognition brought a twinge  he thought too that he could tell the other jorths  he asked his father to describe daggs and then queen  it was not likely that jean would fail to know these several men in the future  then blaisdell asked for the telescope and when he got through looking and cursing he passed it on to others who one by one took a long look until finally it came back to the old rancher  wal daggs is wavin his hand heah an there like a general aboot to send out scouts  hawhaw  an pears to me hes not overlookin our hosses  wal thats natural for a rustler  hed have to steal a hoss or a steer before goin into a fight or to dinner or to a funeral  it ll be his funeral if he goes to foolin round them hosses declared guy isbel peering anxiously out of the door  wal son shore it ll be somebodys funeral replied his father  jean paid but little heed to the conversation  with sharp eyes fixed upon the horsemen he tried to grasp at their intention  daggs pointed to the horses in the pasture lot that lay between him and the house these animals were the best on the range and belonged mostly to guy isbel who was the horse fancier and trader of the family  his horses were his passion  looks like theyd do some horse stealin said jean  lend me that glass demanded guy forcefully  he surveyed the band of men for a long moment then he handed the glass back to jean  im goin out there after my bosses he declared  no exclaimed his father  that gang come to steal an not to fight  cant you see that if they meant to fight theyd do it  theyre out there arguin about my hosses  guy picked up his rifle  he looked sullenly determined and the gleam in his eye was one of fearlessness  son i know daggs said his father  an i know jorth  theyve come to kill us  it ll be shore death for yu to go out there  im goin anyhow  they cant steal my hosses out from under my eyes an they aint in range  wal guy you aint goin alone spoke up jacobs cheerily as he came forward  the redhaired young wife of guy isbel showed no change of her grave face  she had been reared in a stern school  she knew men in times like these  but jacobss wife appealed to him  bill dont risk your life for a horse or two  jacobs laughed and answered  not much risk and went out with guy to jean their action seemed foolhardy  he kept a keen eye on them and saw instantly when the band became aware of guys and jacobss entrance into the pasture  it took only another second then to realize that daggs and jorth had deadly intent  jean saw daggs slip out of his saddle rifle in hand  others of the gang did likewise until half of them were dismounted  dad theyre goin to shoot called out jean sharply  yell for guy and jacobs  make them come back  the old man shouted bill isbel yelled blaisdell lifted his stentorian voice  jean screamed piercingly guy  run  run  but guy isbel and his companion strode on into the pasture as if they had not heard as if no menacing horse thieves were within miles  they had covered about a quarter of the distance across the pasture and were nearing the horses when jean saw red flashes and white puffs of smoke burst out from the front of that dark band of rustlers  then followed the sharp rattling crack of rifles  guy isbel stopped short and dropping his gun he threw up his arms and fell headlong  jacobs acted as if he had suddenly encountered an invisible blow  he had been hit  turning he began to run and ran fast for a few paces  there were more quick sharp shots  he let go of his rifle  his running broke  walking reeling staggering he kept on a hoarse cry came from him  then a single rifle shot pealed out  jean heard the bullet strike  jacobs fell to his knees then forward on his face  jean isbel felt himself turned to marble  the suddenness of this tragedy paralyzed him  his gaze remained riveted on those prostrate forms  a hand clutched his arma shaking womans hand slim and hard and tense  billskilled whispered a broken voice  i was watchin theyre both dead  the wives of jacobs and guy isbel had slipped up behind jean and from behind him they had seen the tragedy  i asked billnot togo faltered the jacobs woman and covering her face with her hands she groped back to the comer of the cabin where the other women shaking and white received her in their arms guy isbels wife stood at the window peering over jeans shoulder she had the nerve of a man  she had looked out upon death before  yes theyre dead she said bitterly  an how are we goin to get their bodies  at this gaston isbel seemed to rouse from the cold spell that had transfixed him  god this is hell for our women he cried out hoarsely  my sonmy son  murdered by the jorths  then he swore a terrible oath  jean saw the remainder of the mounted rustlers get off and then all of them leading their horses they began to move around to the left  dad theyre movin round said jean  up to some trick declared bill isbel  bill you make a hole through the back wall say aboot the fifth log up ordered the father  shore weve got to look out  the elder son grasped a tool and scattering the children who had been playing near the back corner he began to work at the point designated the little children backed away with fixed wondering grave eyes  the women moved their chairs and huddled together as if waiting and listening  jean watched the rustlers until they passed out of his sight  they had moved toward the sloping brushy ground to the north and west of the cabins  let me know when you get a hole in the back wall said jean and he went through the kitchen and cautiously out another door to slip into a lowroofed shedlike end of the rambling cabin  this small space was used to store winter firewood  the chinks between the walls had not been filled with adobe clay and he could see out on three sides the rustlers were going into the juniper brush  they moved out of sight and presently reappeared without their horses  it looked to jean as if they intended to attack the cabins  then they halted at the edge of the brush and held a long consultation  jean could see them distinctly though they were too far distant for him to recognize any particular man  one of them however stood and moved apart from the closely massed group  evidently from his strides and gestures he was exhorting his listeners  jean concluded this was either daggs or jorth  whoever it was had a loud coarse voice and this and his actions impressed jean with a suspicion that the man was under the influence of the bottle  presently bill isbel called jean in a low voice  jean i got the hole made but we cant see anyone  i see them jean replied  theyre havin a powwow   looks to me like either jorth or daggs is drunk  hes arguin to charge us an the rest of the gang are holdin back tell dad an all of you keep watchin  ill let you know when they make a move  jorths gang appeared to be in no hurry to expose their plan of battle gradually the group disintegrated a little some of them sat down others walked to and fro  presently two of them went into the brush probably back to the horses  in a few moments they reappeared carrying a pack  and when this was deposited on the ground all the rustlers sat down around it  they had brought food and drink  jean had to utter a grim laugh at their coolness and he was reminded of many daredevil deeds known to have been perpetrated by the hash knife gang  jean was glad of a reprieve  the longer the rustlers put off an attack the more time the allies of the isbels would have to get here rather hazardous however would it be now for anyone to attempt to get to the isbel cabins in the daytime  night would be more favorable  twice bill isbel came through the kitchen to whisper to jean  the strain in the large room from which the rustlers could not be seen must have been great  jean told him all he had seen and what he thought about it eatin an drinkin ejaculated bill  well ill be  that ll jar the old man  he wants to get the fight over  tell him i said itll be over too quickfor usunless are mighty careful replied jean sharply  bill went back muttering to himself  then followed a long wait fraught with suspense during which jean watched the rustlers regale themselves the day was hot and still  and the unnatural silence of the cabin was broken now and then by the gay laughter of the children the sound shocked and haunted jean  playing children  then another sound so faint he had to strain to hear it disturbed and saddened himhis fathers slow tread up and down the cabin floor to and fro to and fro what must be in his fathers heart this day  at length the rustlers rose and with rifles in hand they moved as one man down the slope  they came several hundred yards closer until jean grimly cocking his rifle muttered to himself that a few more rods closer would mean the end of several of that gang  they knew the range of a rifle well enough and once more sheered off at right angles with the cabin  when they got even with the line of corrals they stooped down and were lost to jeans sight  this fact caused him alarm they were of course crawling up on the cabins  at the end of that line of corrals ran a ditch the bank of which was high enough to afford cover  moreover it ran along in front of the cabins scarcely a hundred yards and it was covered with grass and little clumps of brush from behind which the rustlers could fire into the windows and through the clay chinks without any considerable risk to themselves as they did not come into sight again jean concluded he had discovered their plan  still he waited awhile longer until he saw faint little clouds of dust rising from behind the far end of the embankment  that discovery made him rush out and through the kitchen to the large cabin where his sudden appearance startled the men  get back out of sight he ordered sharply and with swift steps he reached the door and closed it  theyre behind the bank out there by the corrals  an theyre goin to crawl down the ditch closer to us it looks bad  theyll have grass an brush to shoot from weve got to be mighty careful how we peep out  ahuh  all right replied his father  you women keep the kids with you in that corner  an you all better lay down flat  blaisdell bill isbel and the old man crouched at the large window peeping through cracks in the rough edges of the logs  jean took his post beside the small window with his keen eyes vibrating like a compass needle  the movement of a blade of grass the flight of a grasshopper could not escape his trained sight  look sharp now he called to the other men  i see dust theyre workin along almost to that bare spot on the bank i saw the tip of a rifle  a black hat  more dust  theyre spreadin along behind the bank  loud voices and then thick clouds of yellow dust coming from behind the highest and brushiest line of the embankment attested to the truth of jeans observation and also to a reckless disregard of danger  suddenly jean caught a glint of moving color through the fringe of brush  instantly he was strung like a whipcord  then a tall hatless and coatless man stepped up in plain sight the sun shone on his fair ruffled hair  daggs  hey you   isbels he bawled in magnificent derisive boldness come out an fight  quick as lightning jean threw up his rifle and fired  he saw tufts of fair hair fly from daggss head  he saw the squirt of red blood then quick shots from his comrades rang out  they all hit the swaying body of the rustler  but jean knew with a terrible thrill that his bullet had killed daggs before the other three struck  daggs fell forward his arms and half his body resting over the embankment then the rustlers dragged him back out of sight  hoarse shouts rose a cloud of yellow dust drifted away from the spot  daggs burst out gaston isbel  jean you knocked off the top of his haid  i seen that when i was pullin trigger  shore we over heah wasted our shots  god he must have been crazy or drunkto pop up therean brace us that way said blaisdell breathing hard  arizona is bad for texans replied isbel sardonically  shore its been too peaceful heah  rustlers have no practice at fightin  an i reckon daggs forgot  daggs made as crazy a move as that of guy an jacobs spoke up jean they were overbold an he was drunk  let them be a lesson to us  jean had smelled whisky upon his entrance to this cabin  bill was a hard drinker and his father was not immune  blaisdell too drank heavily upon occasions  jean made a mental note that he would not permit their chances to become impaired by liquor  rifles began to crack and puffs of smoke rose all along the embankment for the space of a hundred feet  bullets whistled through the rude window casing and spattered on the heavy door and one split the clay between the logs before jean narrowly missing him  another volley followed then another  the rustlers had repeating rifles and they were emptying their magazines  jean changed his position  the other men profited by his wise move  the volleys had merged into one continuous rattling roar of rifle shots  then came a sudden cessation of reports with silence of relief  the cabin was full of dust mingled with the smoke from the shots of jean and his companions  jean heard the stifled breaths of the children  evidently they were terrorstricken but they did not cry out  the women uttered no sound  a loud voice pealed from behind the embankment  come out an fight  do you isbels want to be killed like sheep  this sally gained no reply jean returned to his post by the window and his comrades followed his example and they exercised extreme caution when they peeped out  boys dont shoot till you see one said gaston isbel  maybe after a while theyll get careless  but jorth will never show himself  the rustlers did not again resort to volleys  one by one from different angles they began to shoot and they were not firing at random  a few bullets came straight in at the windows to pat into the walls a few others ticked and splintered the edges of the windows and most of them broke through the clay chinks between the logs  it dawned upon jean that these dangerous shots were not accident  they were well aimed and most of them hit low down  the cunning rustlers had some unerring riflemen and they were picking out the vulnerable places all along the front of the cabin  if jean had not been lying flat he would have been hit twice  presently he conceived the idea of driving pegs between the logs high up and kneeling on these he managed to peep out from the upper edge of the window  but this position was awkward and difficult to hold for long  he heard a bullet hit one of his comrades  whoever had been struck never uttered a sound  jean turned to look  bill isbel was holding his shoulder where red splotches appeared on his shirt  he shook his head at jean evidently to make light of the wound  the women and children were lying face down and could not see what was happening plain is was that bill did not want them to know  blaisdell bound up the bloody shoulder with a scarf  steady firing from the rustlers went on at the rate of one shot every few minutes  the isbels did not return these  jean did not fire again that afternoon  toward sunset when the besiegers appeared to grow restless or careless blaisdell fired at something moving behind the brush and gaston isbels huge buffalo gun boomed out  wal what re they goin to do after dark an what re we goin to do grumbled blaisdell  reckon theyll never charge us said gaston  they might set fire to the cabins added bill isbel  he appeared to be the gloomiest of the isbel faction  there was something on his mind  wal the jorths are bad but i reckon theyd not burn us alive replied blaisdell  hah ejaculated gaston isbel  much you know aboot lee jorth he would skin me alive an throw redhot coals on my raw flesh  so they talked during the hour from sunset to dark  jean isbel had little to say  he was revolving possibilities in his mind  darkness brought a change in the attack of the rustlers  they stationed men at four points around the cabins and every few minutes one of these outposts would fire  these bullets embedded themselves in the logs causing but little anxiety to the isbels  jean what you make of it asked the old rancher  looks to me this way replied jean  theyre set for a long fight theyre shootin just to let us know theyre on the watch  ahuh  wal what re you goin to do aboot it  im goin out there presently  gaston isbel grunted his satisfaction at this intention of jeans  all was pitch dark inside the cabin  the women had water and food at hand  jean kept a sharp lookout from his window while he ate his supper of meat bread and milk  at last the children worn out by the long day fell asleep  the women whispered a little in their corner  about nine oclock jean signified his intention of going out to reconnoitre  dad theyve got the best of us in the daytime he said but not after dark  jean buckled on a belt that carried shells a bowie knife and revolver and with rifle in hand he went out through the kitchen to the yard the night was darker than usual as some of the stars were hidden by clouds  he leaned against the log cabin waiting for his eyes to become perfectly adjusted to the darkness  like an indian jean could see well at night  he knew every point around cabins and sheds and corrals every post log tree rock adjacent to the ranch  after perhaps a quarter of an hour watching during which time several shots were fired from behind the embankment and one each from the rustlers at the other locations jean slipped out on his quest  he kept in the shadow of the cabin walls then the line of orchard trees then a row of currant bushes  here crouching low he halted to look and listen  he was now at the edge of the open ground with the gently rising slope before him  he could see the dark patches of cedar and juniper trees  on the north side of the cabin a streak of fire flashed in the blackness and a shot rang out  jean heard the bullet bit the cabin  then silence enfolded the lonely ranch and the darkness lay like a black blanket  a low hum of insects pervaded the air  dull sheets of lightning illumined the dark horizon to the south once jean heard voices but could not tell from which direction they came  to the west of him then flared out another rifle shot  the bullet whistled down over jean to thud into the cabin  jean made a careful study of the obscure grayblack open before him and then the background to his rear  so long as he kept the dense shadows behind him he could not be seen  he slipped from behind his covert and gliding with absolutely noiseless footsteps he gained the first clump of junipers  here he waited patiently and motionlessly for another round of shots from the rustlers  after the second shot from the west side jean sheered off to the right  patches of brush clumps of juniper and isolated cedars covered this slope affording jean a perfect means for his purpose which was to make a detour and come up behind the rustler who was firing from that side  jean climbed to the top of the ridge descended the opposite slope made his turn to the left and slowly worked up behind the point near where he expected to locate the rustler  long habit in the open by day and night rendered his sense of direction almost as perfect as sight itself  the first flash of fire he saw from this side proved that he had come straight up toward his man  jeans intention was to crawl up on this one of the jorth gang and silently kill him with a knife  if the plan worked successfully jean meant to work round to the next rustler  laying aside his rifle he crawled forward on hands and knees making no more sound than a cat  his approach was slow  he had to pick his way be careful not to break twigs nor rattle stones  his buckskin garments made no sound against the brush  jean located the rustler sitting on the top of the ridge in the center of an open space he was alone jean saw the dullred end of the cigarette he was smoking  the ground on the ridge top was rocky and not well adapted for jeans purpose  he had to abandon the idea of crawling up on the rustler  whereupon jean turned back patiently and slowly to get his rifle  upon securing it he began to retrace his course this time more slowly than before as he was hampered by the rifle  but he did not make the slightest sound and at length he reached the edge of the open ridge top once more to espy the dark form of the rustler silhouetted against the sky  the distance was not more than fifty yards  as jean rose to his knee and carefully lifted his rifle round to avoid the twigs of a juniper he suddenly experienced another emotion besides the one of grim hard wrath at the jorths  it was an emotion that sickened him made him weak internally a cold shaking ungovernable sensation  suppose this man was ellen jorths father  jean lowered the rifle  he felt it shake over his knee  he was trembling all over the astounding discovery that he did not want to kill ellens fatherthat he could not do itawakened jean to the despairing nature of his love for her  in this grim moment of indecision when he knew his indian subtlety and ability gave him a great advantage over the jorths he fully realized his strange hopeless and irresistible love for the girl  he made no attempt to deny it any longer  like the night and the lonely wilderness around him like the inevitableness of this jorthisbel feud this love of his was a thing a fact a reality he breathed to his own inward ear to his soulhe could not kill ellen jorths father  feud or no feud isbel or not he could not deliberately do it  and why not  there was no answer  was he not faithless to his father  he had no hope of ever winning ellen jorth he did not want the love of a girl of her character  but he loved her and his struggle must be against the insidious and mysterious growth of that passion  it swayed him already  it made him a coward through his mind and heart swept the memory of ellen jorth her beauty and charm her boldness and pathos her shame and her degradation and the sweetness of her outweighed the boldness  and the mystery of her arrayed itself in unquenchable protest against her acknowledged shame jean lifted his face to the heavens to the pitiless white stars to the infinite depths of the darkblue sky  he could sense the fact of his being an atom in the universe of nature  what was he what was his revengeful father what were hate and passion and strife in comparison to the nameless something immense and everlasting that he sensed in this dark moment  but the rustlersdaggsthe jorthsthey had killed his brother guymurdered him brutally and ruthlessly  guy had been a playmate of jeansa favorite brother  bill had been secretive and selfish  jean had never loved him as he did guy  guy lay dead down there on the meadow this feud had begun to run its bloody course  jean steeled his nerve the hot blood crept back along his veins  the dark and masterful tide of revenge waved over him  the keen edge of his mind then cut out sharp and trenchant thoughts  he must kill when and where he could  this man could hardly be ellen jorths father  jorth would be with the main crowd directing hostilities  jean could shoot this rustler guard and his shot would be taken by the gang as the regular one from their comrade  then swiftly jean leveled his rifle covered the dark form grew cold and set and pressed the trigger  after the report he rose and wheeled away  he did not look nor listen for the result of his shot  a clammy sweat wet his face the hollow of his hands his breast a horrible leaden thick sensation oppressed his heart  nature had endowed him with indian gifts but the exercise of them to this end caused a revolt in his soul  nevertheless it was the isbel blood that dominated him  the wind blew cool on his face  the burden upon his shoulders seemed to lift  the clamoring whispers grew fainter in his ears  and by the time he had retraced his cautious steps back to the orchard all his physical being was strung to the task at hand  something had come between his reflective self and this man of action  crossing the lane he took to the west line of sheds and passed beyond them into the meadow  in the grass he crawled silently away to the right using the same precaution that had actuated him on the slope only here he did not pause so often nor move so slowly  jean aimed to go far enough to the right to pass the end of the embankment behind which the rustlers had found such efficient cover  this ditch had been made to keep water during spring thaws and summer storms from pouring off the slope to flood the corrals  jean miscalculated and found he had come upon the embankment somewhat to the left of the end which fact however caused him no uneasiness he lay there awhile to listen  again he heard voices  after a time a shot pealed out  he did not see the flash but he calculated that it had come from the north side of the cabins  the next quarter of an hour discovered to jean that the nearest guard was firing from the top of the embankment perhaps a hundred yards distant and a second one was performing the same office from a point apparently only a few yards farther on  two rustlers close together jean had not calculated upon that  for a little while he pondered on what was best to do and at length decided to crawl round behind them and as close as the situation made advisable  he found the ditch behind the embankment a favorable path by which to stalk these enemies  it was dry and sandy with borders of high weeds the only drawback was that it was almost impossible for him to keep from brushing against the dry invisible branches of the weeds  to offset this he wormed his way like a snail inch by inch taking a long time before he caught sight of the sitting figure of a man black against the darkblue sky  this rustler had fired his rifle three times during jeans slow approach  jean watched and listened a few moments then wormed himself closer and closer until the man was within twenty steps of him  jean smelled tobacco smoke but could see no light of pipe or cigarette because the fellows back was turned  say ben said this man to his companion sitting hunched up a few yards distant shore it strikes me queer thet somers aint shootin any over thar  jean recognized the dry drawling voice of greaves and the shock of it seemed to contract the muscles of his whole thrilling body like that of a panther about to spring    chapter viii  was shore thinkin thet same said the other man  an say didnt thet last shot sound too sharp fer somerss fortyfive  come to think of it i reckon it did replied greaves  wal ill go around over thar an see  the dark form of the rustler slipped out of sight over the embankment  better go slow an careful warned greaves  an only go close enough to call somers mebbe thet damn halfbreed isbel is comin some injun on us  jean heard the soft swish of footsteps through wet grass  then all was still  he lay flat with his cheek on the sand and he had to look ahead and upward to make out the dark figure of greaves on the bank one way or another he meant to kill greaves and he had the will power to resist the strongest gust of passion that had ever stormed his breast  if he arose and shot the rustler that act would defeat his plan of slipping on around upon the other outposts who were firing at the cabins  jean wanted to call softly to greaves youre right about the halfbreed and then as he wheeled aghast to kill him as he moved  but it suited jean to risk leaping upon the man  jean did not waste time in trying to understand the strange deadly instinct that gripped him at the moment  but he realized then he had chosen the most perilous plan to get rid of greaves  jean drew a long deep breath and held it  he let go of his rifle he rose silently as a lifting shadow  he drew the bowie knife then with light swift bounds he glided up the bank  greaves must have heard a rustlinga soft quick pad of moccasin for he turned with a start and that instant jeans left arm darted like a striking snake round greavess neck and closed tight and hard  with his right hand free holding the knife jean might have ended the deadly business in just one move  but when his bared arm felt the hot bulging neck something terrible burst out of the depths of him  to kill this enemy of his fathers was not enough  physical contact had unleashed the savage soul of the indian  yet there was more and as jean gave the straining body a tremendous jerk backward he felt the same strange thrill the dark joy that he had known when his fist had smashed the face of simm bruce  greaves had leeredhe had corroborated bruces vile insinuation about ellen jorth  so it was more than hate that actuated jean isbel  greaves was heavy and powerful  he whirled himself feet first over backward in a lunge like that of a lassoed steer  but jeans hold held  they rolled down the bank into the sandy ditch and jean landed uppermost with his body at right angles with that of his adversary  greaves your hunch was right hissed jean  its the halfbreed an im goin to cut youfirst for ellen jorthan then for gaston isbel  jean gazed down into the gleaming eyes  then his right arm whipped the big blade  it flashed  it fell  low down as far as jean could reach it entered greavess body  all the heavy muscular frame of greaves seemed to contract and burst his spring was that of an animal in terror and agony  it was so tremendous that it broke jeans hold  greaves let out a strangled yell that cleared swelling wildly with a hideous mortal note  he wrestled free  the big knife came out  supple and swift he got to his knees he had his gun out when jean reached him again  like a bear jean enveloped him  greaves shot but he could not raise the gun nor twist it far enough  then jean letting go with his right arm swung the bowie  greavess strength went out in an awful hoarse cry his gun boomed again then dropped from his hand  he swayed  jean let go and that enemy of the isbels sank limply in the ditch jeans eyes roved for his rifle and caught the starlit gleam of it snatching it up he leaped over the embankment and ran straight for the cabins from all around yells of the jorth faction attested to their excitement and fury  a fence loomed up gray in the obscurity  jean vaulted it darted across the lane into the shadow of the corral and soon gained the first cabin  here he leaned to regain his breath  his heart pounded high and seemed too large for his breast  the hot blood beat and surged all over his body  sweat poured off him  his teeth were clenched tight as a vise and it took effort on his part to open his mouth so he could breathe more freely and deeply  but these physical sensations were as nothing compared to the tumult of his mind then the instinct the spell let go its grip and he could think he had avenged guy he had depleted the ranks of the jorths he had made good the brag of his father all of which afforded him satisfaction but these thoughts were not accountable for all that he felt especially for the bittersweet sting of the fact that death to the defiler of ellen jorth could not efface the doubt the regret which seemed to grow with the hours  groping his way into the woodshed he entered the kitchen and calling low he went on into the main cabin  jean  jean came his fathers shaking voice  yes im back replied jean  areyouall right  yes  i think ive got a bullet crease on my leg  i didnt know i had it till now its bleedin a little  but its nothin  jean heard soft steps and some one reached shaking hands for him they belonged to his sister ann  she embraced him  jean felt the heave and throb of her breast  why ann im not hurt he said and held her close  now you lie down an try to sleep  in the black darkness of the cabin jean led her back to the corner and his heart was full  speech was difficult because the very touch of anns hands had made him divine that the success of his venture in no wise changed the plight of the women  wal what happened out there demanded blaisdell  i got two of them replied jean  that fellow who was shootin from the ridge west  an the other was greaves  hah exclaimed his father  shore then it was greaves yellin declared blaisdell  by god i never heard such yells  whad d you do jean  i knifed him  you see id planned to slip up on one after another an i didnt want to make noise  but i didnt get any farther than greaves  wal i reckon that ll end their shootin in the dark muttered gaston isbel  weve got to be on the lookout for somethin elsefire most likely  the old ranchers surmise proved to be partially correct  jorths faction ceased the shooting  nothing further was seen or heard from them  but this silence and apparent break in the siege were harder to bear than deliberate hostility  the long dark hours dragged by the men took turns watching and resting but none of them slept at last the blackness paled and gray dawn stole out of the east the sky turned rose over the distant range and daylight came  the children awoke hungry and noisy having slept away their fears the women took advantage of the quiet morning hour to get a hot breakfast  maybe theyve gone away suggested guy isbels wife peering out of the window  she had done that several times since daybreak  jean saw her somber gaze search the pasture until it rested upon the dark prone shape of her dead husband lying face down in the grass  her look worried jean  no esther theyve not gone yet replied jean  ive seen some of them out there at the edge of the brush  blaisdell was optimistic  he said jeans night work would have its effect and that the jorth contingent would not renew the siege very determinedly  it turned out however that blaisdell was wrong directly after sunrise they began to pour volleys from four sides and from closer range  during the night jorths gang had thrown earth banks and constructed log breastworks from behind which they were now firing  jean and his comrades could see the flashes of fire and streaks of smoke to such good advantage that they began to return the volleys  in half an hour the cabin was so full of smoke that jean could not see the womenfolk in their corner  the fierce attack then abated somewhat and the firing became more intermittent and therefore more carefully aimed  a glancing bullet cut a furrow in blaisdells hoary head making a painful though not serious wound  it was esther isbel who stopped the flow of blood and bound blaisdells head a task which she performed skillfully and without a tremor  the old texan could not sit still during this operation  sight of the blood on his hands which he tried to rub off appeared to inflame him to a great degree  isbel we got to go out thar he kept repeating an kill them all  no were goin to stay heah replied gaston isbel  shore im lookin for blue an fredericks an gordon to open up out there they ought to be heah an if they are yu shore can bet theyve got the fight sized up  isbels hopes did not materialize  the shooting continued without any lull until about midday  then the jorth faction stopped  wal now whats up queried isbel  boys hold your fire an lets wait  gradually the smoke wafted out of the windows and doors until the room was once more clear  and at this juncture esther isbel came over to take another gaze out upon the meadows  jean saw her suddenly start violently then stiffen with a trembling hand outstretched  look she cried  esther get back ordered the old rancher  keep away from that window  what the hell muttered blaisdell  she sees somethin or shes gone dotty  esther seemed turned to stone  look  the hogs have broken into the pasture  theyll eat guys body  everyone was frozen with horror at esthers statement  jean took a swift survey of the pasture  a bunch of big black hogs had indeed appeared on the scene and were rooting around in the grass not far from where lay the bodies of guy isbel and jacobs  this herd of hogs belonged to the rancher and was allowed to run wild  jane those hogs stammered esther isbel to the wife of jacobs come  look  do yu know anythin about hogs  the woman ran to the window and looked out  she stiffened as had esther  dad will those hogseat human flesh queried jean breathlessly  the old man stared out of the window  surprise seemed to hold him a completely unexpected situation had staggered him  jeancan youcan you shoot that far he asked huskily  to those hogs  no its out of range  then by god weve got to stay trapped in heah an watch an awful sight ejaculated the old man completely unnerved  see that break in the fence  jorths done that to let in the hogs  aw isbel its not so bad as all that remonstrated blaisdell wagging his bloody head  jorth wouldnt do such a hellbent trick  its shore done  wal mebbe the hogs wont find guy an jacobs returned blaisdell weakly  plain it was that he only hoped for such a contingency and certainly doubted it  look cried esther isbel piercingly  theyre workin straight up the pasture  indeed to jean it appeared to be the fatal truth  he looked blankly feeling a little sick  ann isbel came to peer out of the window and she uttered a cry  jacobss wife stood mute as if dazed  blaisdell swore a mighty oath      isbel we caint stand heah an watch them hogs eat our people  wal well have to  what else on earth can we do  esther turned to the men  she was white and cold except her eyes which resembled gray flames  somebody can run out there an bury our dead men she said  why child itd be shore death  yu saw what happened to guy an jacobs weve jest got to bear it  shore nobody neednt look outan see  jean wondered if it would be possible to keep from watching  the thing had a horrible fascination  the big hogs were rooting and tearing in the grass some of them lazy others nimble and all were gradually working closer and closer to the bodies  the leader a huge gaunt boar that had fared ill all his life in this barren country was scarcely fifty feet away from where guy isbel lay  ann get me some of your clothes an a sunbonnetquick said jean forced out of his lethargy  ill run out there disguised  maybe i can go through with it  no ordered his father positively and with dark face flaming guy an jacobs are dead  we caint help them now  but dad pleaded jean  he had been wrought to a pitch by esthers blaze of passion by the agony in the face of the other woman  i tell yu no thundered gaston isbel flinging his arms wide  i will go cried esther her voice ringing  you wont go alone instantly answered the wife of jacobs repeating unconsciously the words her husband had spoken  you stay right heah shouted gaston isbel hoarsely  im goin replied esther  youve no hold over me  my husband is dead  no one can stop me  im goin out there to drive those hogs away an bury him  esther for heavens sake listen replied isbel  if yu show yourself outside jorth an his gang will kin yu  they may be mean but no white men could be so low as that  then they pleaded with her to give up her purpose  but in vain she pushed them back and ran out through the kitchen with jacobss wife following her  jean turned to the window in time to see both women run out into the lane  jean looked fearfully and listened for shots  but only a loud haw  haw came from the watchers outside  that coarse laugh relieved the tension in jeans breast possibly the jorths were not as black as his father painted them the two women entered an open shed and came forth with a shovel and spade  shore theyve got to hurry burst out gaston isbel  shifting his gaze jean understood the import of his fathers speech the leader of the hogs had no doubt scented the bodies  suddenly he espied them and broke into a trot  run esther run yelled jean with all his might  that urged the women to flight  jean began to shoot  the hog reached the body of guy  jeans shots did not reach nor frighten the beast all the hogs now had caught a scent and went ambling toward their leader  esther and her companion passed swiftly out of sight behind a corral  loud and piercingly with some awful note rang out their screams  the hogs appeared frightened  the leader lifted his long snout looked and turned away  the others had halted  then they too wheeled and ran off  all was silent then in the cabin and also outside wherever the jorth faction lay concealed  all eyes manifestly were fixed upon the brave wives  they spaded up the sod and dug a grave for guy isbel  for a shroud esther wrapped him in her shawl  then they buried him  next they hurried to the side of jacobs who lay some yards away  they dug a grave for him  mrs jacobs took off her outer skirt to wrap round him  then the two women labored hard to lift him and lower him jacobs was a heavy man  when he had been covered his widow knelt beside his grave  esther went back to the other  but she remained standing and did not look as if she prayed  her aspect was tragicthat of a woman who had lost father mother sisters brother and now her husband in this bloody arizona land  the deed and the demeanor of these wives of the murdered men surely must have shamed jorth and his followers  they did not fire a shot during the ordeal nor give any sign of their presence  inside the cabin all were silent too jeans eyes blurred so that he continually had to wipe them  old isbel made no effort to hide his tears  blaisdell nodded his shaggy head and swallowed hard  the women sat staring into space  the children in roundeyed dismay gazed from one to the other of their elders  wal theyre comin back declared isbel in immense relief an so help mejorth let them bury their daid  the fact seemed to have been monstrously strange to gaston isbel when the women entered the old man said brokenly im shore glad an i reckon i was wrong to oppose you  an wrong to say what i did aboot jorth  no one had any chance to reply to isbel for the jorth gang as if to make up for lost time and surcharged feelings of shame renewed the attack with such a persistent and furious volleying that the defenders did not risk a return shot  they all had to lie flat next to the lowest log in order to keep from being hit  bullets rained in through the window  and all the clay between the logs low down was shot away this fusillade lasted for more than an hour then gradually the fire diminished on one side and then on the other until it became desultory and finally ceased  ahuh  shore theyve shot their bolt declared gaston isbel  wal i doont know aboot that returned blaisdell but theyve shot a hell of a lot of shells  listen suddenly called jean somebodys yellin  hey isbel came in loud hoarse voice  let your women fight for you  gaston isbel sat up with a start and his face turned livid  jean needed no more to prove that the derisive voice from outside had belonged to jorth  the old rancher lunged up to his full height and with reckless disregard of life he rushed to the window jorth he roared i dare you to meet meman to man  this elicited no answer  jean dragged his father away from the window after that a waiting silence ensued gradually less fraught with suspense  blaisdell started conversation by saying he believed the fight was over for that particular time  no one disputed him evidently gaston isbel was loath to believe it  jean however watching at the back of the kitchen eventually discovered that the jorth gang had lifted the siege  jean saw them congregate at the edge of the brush somewhat lower down than they had been the day before a team of mules drawing a wagon appeared on the road and turned toward the slope  saddled horses were led down out of the junipers jean saw bodies evidently of dead men lifted into the wagon to be hauled away toward the village  seven mounted men leading four riderless horses rode out into the valley and followed the wagon  dad theyve gone declared jean  we had the best of this fight if only guy an jacobs had listened  the old man nodded moodily  he had aged considerably during these two trying days  his hair was grayer  now that the blaze and glow of the fight had passed he showed a subtle change a fixed and morbid sadness a resignation to a fate he had accepted  the ordinary routine of ranch life did not return for the isbels blaisdell returned home to settle matters there so that he could devote all his time to this feud  gaston isbel sat down to wait for the members of his clan  the male members of the family kept guard in turn over the ranch that night  and another day dawned  it brought word from blaisdell that blue fredericks gordon and colmor were all at his house on the way to join the isbels  this news appeared greatly to rejuvenate gaston isbel  but his enthusiasm did not last long  impatient and moody by turns he paced or moped around the cabin always looking out sometimes toward blaisdells ranch but mostly toward grass valley  it struck jean as singular that neither esther isbel nor mrs jacobs suggested a reburial of their husbands  the two bereaved women did not ask for assistance but repaired to the pasture and there spent several hours working over the graves  they raised mounds which they sodded and then placed stones at the heads and feet  lastly they fenced in the graves  i reckon ill hitch up an drive back home said mrs jacobs when she returned to the cabin  ive much to do an plan  probably ill go to my mothers home  shes old an will be glad to have me  if i had any place to go to id sure go declared esther isbel bitterly  gaston isbel heard this remark  he raised his face from his hands evidently both nettled and hurt  esther shore thats not kind he said  the redhaired womanfor she did not appear to be a girl any morehalted before his chair and gazed down at him with a terrible flare of scorn in her gray eyes  gaston isbel all ive got to say to you is this she retorted with the voice of a man  seein that you an lee jorth hate each other why couldnt you act like men  you damned texans with your bloody feuds draggin in every relation every friend to murder each other thats not the way of arizona men weve all got to sufferan we women be ruined for lifebecause you had differences with jorth if you were half a man youd go out an kill him yourself an not leave a lot of widows an orphaned children  jean himself writhed under the lash of her scorn  gaston isbel turned a dead white  he could not answer her  he seemed stricken with merciless truth  slowly dropping his head he remained motionless a pathetic and tragic figure and he did not stir until the rapid beat of hoofs denoted the approach of horsemen  blaisdell appeared on his white charger leading a pack animal  and behind rode a group of men all heavily armed and likewise with packs  get down an come in was isbels greeting  billyou look after their packs  better leave the hosses saddled  the booted and spurred riders trooped in and their demeanor fitted their errand  jean was acquainted with all of them  fredericks was a lanky texan the color of dust and he had yellow clear eyes like those of a hawk  his mother had been an isbel  gordon too was related to jeans family though distantly  he resembled an industrious miner more than a prosperous cattleman  blue was the most striking of the visitors as he was the most noted  a little shrunken grayeyed man with years of cowboy written all over him he looked the quiet easy cool and deadly texan he was reputed to be  blues texas record was shady and was seldom alluded to as unfavorable comment had turned out to be hazardous  he was the only one of the group who did not carry a rifle  but he packed two guns a habit not often noted in texans and almost never in arizonians  colmor ann isbels fiance was the youngest member of the clan and the one closest to jean  his meeting with ann affected jean powerfully and brought to a climax an idea that had been developing in jeans mind his sister devotedly loved this leanfaced keeneyed arizonian and it took no great insight to discover that colmor reciprocated her affection they were young  they had long life before them  it seemed to jean a pity that colmor should be drawn into this war  jean watched them as they conversed apart and he saw anns hands creep up to colmors breast and he saw her dark eyes eloquent hungry fearful lifted with queries her lips did not speak  jean stepped beside them and laid an arm over both their shoulders  colmor for anns sake youd better back out of this jorthisbel fight he whispered  colmor looked insulted  but jean its anns father he said im almost one of the family  youre anns sweetheart an by heaven i say you oughtnt to go with us whispered jean  gowithyou faltered ann  yes  dad is goin straight after jorth  cant you tell that  an there ll be one hell of a fight  ann looked up into colmors face with all her soul in her eyes but she did not speak  her look was noble  she yearned to guide him right yet her lips were sealed  and colmor betrayed the trouble of his soul the code of men held him bound and he could not break from it though he divined in that moment how truly it was wrong  jean your dad started me in the cattle business said colmor earnestly  an im doin well now  an when i asked him for ann he said hed be glad to have me in the family well when this talk of fight come up i asked your dad to let me go in on his side he wouldnt hear of it  but after a while as the time passed an he made more enemies he finally consented  i reckon he needs me now an i cant back out not even for ann  i would if i were you replied jean and knew that he lied  jean im gamblin to come out of the fight said colmor with a smile he had no morbid fears nor presentiments such as troubled jean  why sureyou stand as good a chance as anyone rejoined jean it wasnt that i was worryin about so much  what was it then asked ann steadily  if andrew does come through alive hell have blood on his hands returned jean with passion  he cant come through without it ive begun to feel what it means to have killed my fellow men an id rather your husband an the father of your children never felt that  colmor did not take jean as subtly as ann did  she shrunk a little her dark eyes dilated  but colmor showed nothing of her spiritual reaction  he was young  he had wild blood  he was loyal to the isbels  jean never worry about my conscience he said with a keen look nothin would tickle me any more than to get a shot at every damn one of the jorths  that established colmors status in regard to the jorthisbel feud jean had no more to say  he respected anns friend and felt poignant sorrow for ann  gaston isbel called for meat and drink to be set on the table for his guests  when his wishes had been complied with the women took the children into the adjoining cabin and shut the door  hah  wal we can eat an talk now  first the newcomers wanted to hear particulars of what had happened blaisdell had told all he knew and had seen but that was not sufficient  they plied gaston isbel with questions  laboriously and ponderously he rehearsed the experiences of the fight at the ranch according to his impressions  bill isbel was exhorted to talk but he had of late manifested a sullen and taciturn disposition in spite of jeans vigilance bill had continued to imbibe red liquor then jean was called upon to relate all he had seen and done  it had been jeans intention to keep his mouth shut first for his own sake and secondly because he did not like to talk of his deeds  but when thus appealed to by these somberfaced intenteyed men he divined that the more carefully he described the cruelty and baseness of their enemies and the more vividly he presented his participation in the first fight of the feud the more strongly he would bind these friends to the isbel cause  so he talked for an hour beginning with his meeting with colter up on the rim and ending with an account of his killing greaves his listeners sat through this long narrative with unabated interest and at the close they were leaning forward breathless and tense  ah  so greaves got his desserts at last exclaimed gordon  all the men around the table made comments and the last from blue was the one that struck jean forcibly  shore thet was a strange an a hell of a way to kill greaves whyd you do thet jean  i told you  i wanted to avoid noise an i hoped to get more of them  blue nodded his lean eaglelike head and sat thoughtfully as if not convinced of anything save jeans prowess  after a moment blue spoke again  then goin back to jeans tellin aboot trackin rustled cattle ive got this to say  ive long suspected thet somebody livin right heah in the valley has been drivin off cattle an dealin with rustlers an now im shore of it  this speech did not elicit the amaze from gaston isbel that jean expected it would  you mean greaves or some of his friends  no  they wasnt none of them in the cattle business like we are shore we all knowed greaves was crooked  but what im figgerin is thet some socalled honest man in our settlement has been makin crooked deals  blue was a man of deeds rather than words and so much strong speech from him whom everybody knew to be remarkably reliable and keen made a profound impression upon most of the isbel faction  but to jeans surprise his father did not rave  it was blaisdell who supplied the rage and invective  bill isbel also was strangely indifferent to this new element in the condition of cattle dealing suddenly jean caught a vague flash of thought as if he had intercepted the thought of anothers mind and he wonderedcould his brother bill know anything about this crooked work alluded to by blue  dismissing the conjecture jean listened earnestly  an if its true it shore makes this differencewe caint blame all the rustlin on to jorth concluded blue  wal its not true declared gaston isbel roughly  jorth an his hash knife gang are at the bottom of all the rustlin in the valley for years back  an theyve got to be wiped out  isbel i reckon wed all feel better if we talk straight replied blue coolly  im heah to stand by the isbels  an yu know what thet means but im not heah to fight jorth because he may be a rustler  the others may have their own reasons but mine is thisyou once stood by me in texas when i was needin friends  wal im standin by yu now jorth is your enemy an so he is mine  gaston isbel bowed to this ultimatum scarcely less agitated than when esther isbel had denounced him  his rabid and morbid hate of jorth had eaten into his heart to take possession there like the parasite that battened upon the life of its victim  blues steely voice his cold gray eyes showed the unbiased truth of the man as well as his fidelity to his creed  here again but in a different manner  gaston isbel had the fact flung at him that other men must suffer perhaps die for his hate  and the very soul of the old rancher apparently rose in passionate revolt against the blind headlong elemental strength of his nature  so it seemed to jean who in love and pity that hourly grew saw through his father  was it too late alas gaston isbel could never be turned back  yet something was altering his brooding fixed mind  wal said blaisdell gruffly lets get down to business im for havin blue be foreman of this heah outfit an all of us to do as he says  gaston isbel opposed this selection and indeed resented it he intended to lead the isbel faction  all right then  give us a hunch what were goin to do replied blaisdell  were goin to ride off on jorths trailan one way or anotherkill himkill him  i reckon thatll end the fight  what did old isbel have in his mind  his listeners shook their heads  no asserted blaisdell  killin jorth might be the end of your desires isbel but it d never end our fight  well have gone too far if we take jorths trail from heah it means weve got to wipe out that rustier gang or stay to the last man  yes by god exclaimed fredericks  lets drink to thet said blue  strangely they turned to this texas gunman instinctively recognizing in him the brain and heart and the past deeds that fitted him for the leadership of such a clan  blue had all in life to lose and nothing to gain  yet his spirit was such that he could not lean to all the possible gain of the future and leave a debt unpaid  then his voice his look his influence were those of a fighter  they all drank with him even jean who hated liquor  and this act of drinking seemed the climax of the council preparations were at once begun for their departure on jorths trail  jean took but little time for his own needs  a horse a blanket a knapsack of meat and bread a canteen and his weapons with all the ammunition he could pack made up his outfit  he wore his buckskin suit leggings and moccasins  very soon the cavalcade was ready to depart  jean tried not to watch bill isbel say goodby to his children but it was impossible not to  whatever bill was as a man he was father of those children and he loved them  how strange that the little ones seemed to realize the meaning of this goodby  they were grave sombereyed pale up to the last moment then they broke down and wept  did they sense that their father would never come back jean caught that dark fatalistic presentiment  bill isbels convulsed face showed that he also caught it  jean did not see bill say goodby to his wife  but he heard her  old gaston isbel forgot to speak to the children or else could not  he never looked at them  and his goodby to ann was as if he were only riding to the village for a day jean saw womans love womans intuition womans grief in her eyes he could not escape her  oh jean oh brother she whispered as she enfolded him  its awful  its wrong  wrong  wrong  goodby  if killing must besee that yu kill the jorths  goodby  even in ann gentle and mild the isbel blood spoke at the last jean gave ann over to the palefaced colmor who took her in his arms then jean fled out to his horse  this coldblooded devastation of a home was almost more than he could bear  there was love here what would be left  colmor was the last one to come out to the horses  he did not walk erect nor as one whose sight was clear  then as the silent tense grim men mounted their horses  bill isbels eldest child the boy appeared in the door  his little form seemed instinct with a force vastly different from grief  his face was the face of an isbel  daddykill em all he shouted with a passion all the fiercer for its incongruity to the treble voice  so the poison had spread from father to son    chapter ix  half a mile from the isbel ranch the cavalcade passed the log cabin of evarts father of the boy who had tended sheep with bernardino  it suited gaston isbel to halt here  no need to call  evarts and his son appeared so quickly as to convince observers that they had been watching  howdy jake said isbel  im wantin a word with yu alone  shore boss git down an come in replied evarts  isbel led him aside and said something forcible that jean divined from the very gesture which accompanied it  his father was telling evarts that he was not to join in the isbeljorth war  evarts had worked for the isbels a long time and his faithfulness along with something stronger and darker showed in his rugged face as he stubbornly opposed isbel  the old man raised his voice no i tell you  an that settles it  they returned to the horses and before mounting isbel as if he remembered something directed his somber gaze on young evarts  son did you bury bernardino  dad an me went over yestiddy replied the lad  i shore was glad the coyotes hadnt been round  how aboot the sheep  i left them there  i was goin to stay but bein all alonei got skeered the sheep was doin fine  good water an some grass an this aint time fer varmints to hang round  jake keep your eye on that flock returned isbel  an if i shouldnt happen to come back yu can call them sheep yours id like your boy to ride up to the village  not with us so anybody would see him  but afterward  well be at abel meekers  again jean was confronted with an uneasy premonition as to some idea or plan his father had not shared with his followers  when the cavalcade started on again jean rode to his fathers side and asked him why he had wanted the evarts boy to come to grass valley  and the old man replied that as the boy could run to and fro in the village without danger he might be useful in reporting what was going on at greavess store where undoubtedly the jorth gang would hold forth this appeared reasonable enough therefore jean smothered the objection he had meant to make  the valley road was deserted  when a mile farther on the riders passed a group of cabins just on the outskirts of the village jeans quick eye caught sight of curious and evidently frightened people trying to see while they avoided being seen  no doubt the whole settlement was in a state of suspense and terror  not unlikely this dark closely grouped band of horsemen appeared to them as jorths gang had looked to jean  it was an orderly trotting march that manifested neither hurry nor excitement  but any western eye could have caught the singular aspect of such a group as if the intent of the riders was a visible thing  soon they reached the outskirts of the village  here their approach bad been watched for or had been already reported  jean saw men women children peeping from behind cabins and from halfopened doors farther on jean espied the dark figures of men slipping out the back way through orchards and gardens and running north toward the center of the village  could these be friends of the jorth crowd on the way with warnings of the approach of the isbels  jean felt convinced of it he was learning that his father had not been absolutely correct in his estimation of the way jorth and his followers were regarded by their neighbors  not improbably there were really many villagers who being more interested in sheep raising than in cattle had an honest leaning toward the jorths  some too no doubt had leanings that were dishonest in deed if not in sincerity  gaston isbel led his clan straight down the middle of the wide road of grass valley until he reached a point opposite abel meekers cabin jean espied the same curiosity from behind meekers door and windows as had been shown all along the road  but presently at isbels call the door opened and a short swarthy man appeared  he carried a rifle  howdy gass he said  whats the good word  wal abel its not good but bad  an its shore started replied isbel  im askin yu to let me have your cabin  youre welcome  ill send the folks round to jims returned meeker an if yu want me im with yu isbel  thanks abel but im not leadin any more kin an friends into this heah deal  wal jest as yu say  but id like damn bad to jine with yu my brother ted was shot last night  ted  is he daid

he shore wasnt interrupted isbel with a dark smile an he never will be there again  meeker nodded with slow comprehension and a shade crossed his face  wal campbell claimed hed heerd from some one who was thar  anyway the jorths were drinkin hard an they raised a row with tedsame old sheep talk an somebody shot him  campbell said ted was thrown out back an he was shore he wasnt killed  ahuh  wal im sorry abel your family had to lose in this  maybe teds not bad hurt  i shore hope so an yu an jim keep out of the fight anyway  all right isbel  but i reckon ill give yu a hunch  if this heah fight lasts long the whole damn basin will be in it on one side or tother  abe youre talkin sense broke in blaisdell  an thats why were up heah for quick action  i heerd yu got daggs whispered meeker as he peered all around  wal yu heerd correct drawled blaisdell  meeker muttered strong words into his beard  say was daggs in thet jorth outfit  he was  but he walked right into jeans fortyfour an i reckon his carcass would show some more  an whars guy isbel demanded meeker  daid an buried abel replied gaston isbel  an now id be obliged if yu ll hurry your folks away an let us have your cabin an corral have yu got any hay for the hosses  shore  the barns half full replied meeker as he turned away come on in  no  well wait till youve gone  when meeker had gone isbel and his men sat their horses and looked about them and spoke low  their advent had been expected and the little town awoke to the imminence of the impending battle  inside meekers house there was the sound of indistinct voices of women and the bustle incident to a hurried vacating  across the wide road people were peering out on all sides some hiding others walking to and fro from fence to fence whispering in little groups  down the wide road at the point where it turned stood greavess fortlike stone house  low flat isolated with its dark eyelike windows it presented a forbidding and sinister aspect jean distinctly saw the forms of men some dark others in shirt sleeves come to the wide door and look down the road  wal i reckon only aboot five hundred good hoss steps are separatin us from that outfit drawled blaisdell  no one replied to his jocularity  gaston isbels eyes narrowed to a slit in his furrowed face and he kept them fastened upon greavess store blue likewise had a somber cast of countenance not perhaps any darker nor grimmer than those of his comrades but more representative of intense preoccupation of mind  the look of him thrilled jean who could sense its deadliness yet could not grasp any more  altogether the manner of the villagers and the watchful pacing to and fro of the jorth followers and the silent boding front of isbel and his men summed up for jean the menace of the moment that must very soon change to a terrible reality  at a call from meeker who stood at the back of the cabin gaston isbel rode into the yard followed by the others of his party  somebody look after the hosses ordered isbel as he dismounted and took his rifle and pack  better leave the saddles on leastways till we see whats comin off  jean and bill isbel led the horses back to the corral  while watering and feeding them jean somehow received the impression that bill was trying to speak to confide in him to unburden himself of some load this peculiarity of bills had become marked when he was perfectly sober yet he had never spoken or even begun anything unusual  upon the present occasion however jean believed that his brother might have gotten rid of his emotion or whatever it was had they not been interrupted by colmor  boys the old mans orders are for us to sneak round on three sides of greavess store keepin out of gunshot till we find good cover an then crawl closer an to pick off any of jorths gang who shows himself  bill isbel strode off without a reply to colmor  well i dont think so much of that said jean ponderingly jorth has lots of friends here  somebody might pick us off  i kicked but the old man shut me up  hes not to be bucked agin now  struck me as powerful queer  but no wonder  maybe he knows best  did he say anythin about what he an the rest of them are goin to do  nope  blue taxed him with that an got the same as me  i reckon wed better try it out for a while anyway  looks like he wants us to keep out of the fight replied jean thoughtfully  maybe though  dads no fool  colmor you wait here till i get out of sight  ill go round an come up as close as advisable behind greavess store  you take the right side an keep hid  with that jean strode off going around the barn straight out the orchard lane to the open flat and then climbing a fence to the north of the village  presently he reached a line of sheds and corrals to which he held until he arrived at the road  this point was about a quarter of a mile from greavess store and around the bend  jean sighted no one  the road the fields the yards the backs of the cabins all looked deserted  a blight had settled down upon the peaceful activities of grass valley  crossing the road jean began to circle until he came close to several cabins around which he made a wide detour  this took him to the edge of the slope where brush and thickets afforded him a safe passage to a line directly back of greavess store  then he turned toward it  soon he was again approaching a cabin of that side and some of its inmates descried him their actions attested to their alarm  jean half expected a shot from this quarter such were his growing doubts but he was mistaken  a man unknown to jean closely watched his guarded movements and then waved a hand as if to signify to jean that he had nothing to fear after this act he disappeared  jean believed that he had been recognized by some one not antagonistic to the isbels  therefore he passed the cabin and coming to a thick scruboak tree that offered shelter he hid there to watch  from this spot he could see the back of greavess store at a distance probably too far for a rifle bullet to reach  before him as far as the store and on each side extended the village common in front of the store ran the road  jeans position was such that he could not command sight of this road down toward meekers house a fact that disturbed him  not satisfied with this stand he studied his surroundings in the hope of espying a better  and he discovered what he thought would be a more favorable position although he could not see much farther down the road  jean went back around the cabin and coming out into the open to the right he got the corner of greavess barn between him and the window of the store  then he boldly hurried into the open and soon reached an old wagon from behind which he proposed to watch  he could not see either window or door of the store but if any of the jorth contingent came out the back way they would be within reach of his rifle  jean took the risk of being shot at from either side  so sharp and roving was his sight that he soon espied colmor slipping along behind the trees some hundred yards to the left  all his efforts to catch a glimpse of bill however were fruitless  and this appeared strange to jean for there were several good places on the right from which bill could have commanded the front of greavess store and the whole west side  colmor disappeared among some shrubbery and jean seemed left alone to watch a deserted silent village  watching and listening he felt that the time dragged  yet the shadows cast by the sun showed him that no matter how tense he felt and how the moments seemed hours they were really flying  suddenly jeans ears rang with the vibrant shock of a rifle report he jerked up strung and thrilling  it came from in front of the store it was followed by revolver shots heavy booming  three he counted and the rest were too close together to enumerate  a single hoarse yell pealed out somehow trenchant and triumphant  other yells not so wild and strange muffled the first one  then silence clapped down on the store and the open square  jean was deadly certain that some of the jorth clan would show themselves  he strained to still the trembling those sudden shots and that significant yell had caused him  no man appeared  no more sounds caught jeans ears  the suspense then grew unbearable it was not that he could not wait for an enemy to appear but that he could not wait to learn what had happened  every moment that he stayed there with hands like steel on his rifle with eyes of a falcon but added to a dreadful dark certainty of disaster  a rifle shot swiftly followed by revolver shots  what could they mean  revolver shots of different caliber surely fired by different men  what could they mean it was not these shots that accounted for jeans dread but the yell which had followed  all his intelligence and all his nerve were not sufficient to fight down the feeling of calamity  and at last yielding to it he left his post and ran like a deer across the open through the cabin yard and around the edge of the slope to the road  here his caution brought him to a halt  not a living thing crossed his vision breaking into a run he soon reached the back of meekers place and entered to hurry forward to the cabin  colmor was there in the yard breathing hard his face working and in front of him crouched several of the men with rifles ready  the road to jeans flashing glance was apparently deserted  blue sat on the doorstep lighting a cigarette  then on the moment blaisdell strode to the door of the cabin  jean had never seen him look like that  jeanlookdown the road he said brokenly and with big hand shaking he pointed down toward greavess store  like lightning jeans glance shot downdowndownuntil it stopped to fix upon the prostrate form of a man lying in the middle of the road a man of lengthy build shirtsleeved arms flung wide white head in the dustdead  jeans recognition was as swift as his sight  his father they had killed him  the jorths  it was done  his fathers premonition of death had not been false  and then after these flashing thoughts came a sense of blankness momentarily almost oblivion that gave place to a rending of the heart  that pain jean had known only at the death of his mother  it passed this agonizing pang and its icy pressure yielded to a rushing gust of blood fiery as hell  whodid it whispered jean  jorth replied blaisdell huskily  son we couldnt hold your dad back we couldnt  he was like a lion an he throwed his life away oh if it hadnt been for that it d not be so awful  shore we come heah to shoot an be shot  but not like that by god it was murdermurder  jeans mute lips framed a query easily read  tell him blue  i caint  continued blaisdell and he tramped back into the cabin  set down jean an take things easy said blue calmly  you know we all reckoned wed git plugged one way or another in this deal an shore it doesnt matter much how a fellar gits it  all thet ought to bother us is to make shore the other outfit bites the dustsame as your dad had to  under this mans tranquil presence all the more quieting because it seemed to be so deadly sure and cool jean felt the uplift of his dark spirit the acceptance of fatality the mounting control of faculties that must wait  the little gunman seemed to have about his inert presence something that suggested a rattlesnakes inherent knowledge of its destructiveness  jean sat down and wiped his clammy face  jean your dad reckoned to square accounts with jorth an save us all began blue puffing out a cloud of smoke  but he reckoned too late mebbe years agoor even not long agoif hed called jorth out man to man thered never been any jorthisbel war  gaston isbels conscience woke too late  thats how i figger it  hurry  tell mehow ithappen panted jean  wal a little while after yu left i seen your dad writin on a leaf he tore out of a bookmeekers bible as yu can see  i thought thet was funny  an blaisdell gave me a hunch  pretty soon along comes young evarts  the old man calls him out of our hearin an talks to him then i seen him give the boy somethin which i afterward figgered was what he wrote on the leaf out of the bible  me an blaisdell both tried to git out of him what thet meant  but not a word  i kept watchin an after a while i seen young evarts slip out the back way mebbe half an hour i seen a barelegged kid cross the road an go into greavess store then shore i tumbled to your dad  hed sent a note to jorth to come out an meet him face to face man to man  shore it was like readin what your dad had wrote  but i didnt say nothin to blaisdell  i jest watched  blue drawled these last words as if he enjoyed remembrance of his keen reasoning  a smile wreathed his thin lips  he drew twice on the cigarette and emitted another cloud of smoke   quite suddenly then he changed  he made a rapid gesturethe whip of a hand significant and passionate  and swift words followed  colonel lee jorth stalked out of the storeout into the roadmebbe a hundred steps  then he halted  he wore his long black coat an his wide black hat an he stood like a stone  what the hell burst out blaisdell comin out of his trance  the rest of us jest looked  id forgot your dad for the minnit so had all of us  but we remembered soon enough when we seen him stalk out  everybody had a hunch then  i called him  blaisdell begged him to come back  all the fellars had a say  no use then i shore cussed him an told him it was plain as day thet jorth didnt hit me like an honest man  i can sense such things  i knew jorth had trick up his sleeve  ive not been a gun fighter fer nothin  your dad had no rifle  he packed his gun at his hip  he jest stalked down thet road like a giant goin faster an faster holdin his head high  it shore was fine to see him  but i was sick  i heerd blaisdell groan an fredericks thar cussed somethin fierce when your dad haltedi reckon aboot fifty steps from jorththen we all went numb i heerd your dads voicethen jorths  they cut like knives yu could shore heah the hate they hed fer each other  blue had become a little husky  his speech had grown gradually to denote his feeling  underneath his serenity there was a different order of man  i reckon both your dad an jorth went fer their guns at the same timean even break  but jest as they drew some one shot a rifle from the store  must hev been a fortyfive seventy  a big gun  the bullet must have hit your dad low down aboot the middle  he acted thet way sinkin to his knees  an he was wild in shootinso wild thet he must hev missed  then he wabbledan jorth run in a dozen steps shootin fast till your dad fell over jorth run closer bent over him an then straightened up with an apache yell if i ever heerd one an then jorth backed slowlookin all the timebacked to the store an went in  blues voice ceased  jean seemed suddenly released from an impelling magnet that now dropped him to some numb dizzy depth  blues lean face grew hazy  then jean bowed his head in his hands and sat there while a slight tremor shook all his muscles at once  he grew deathly cold and deathly sick  this paroxysm slowly wore away and jean grew conscious of a dull amaze at the apparent deadness of his spirit blaisdell placed a huge kindly hand on his shoulder  brace up son he said with voice now clear and resonant  shore its what your dad expectedan what we all must look for if yu was goin to kill jorth beforethink how   shore yure goin to kill him now  blaisdells talkin put in blue and his voice had a cold ring lee jorth will never see the sun rise agin  these calls to the primitive in jean to the indian were not in vain but even so when the dark tide rose in him there was still a haunting consciousness of the cruelty of this singular doom imposed upon him strangely ellen jorths face floated back in the depths of his vision pale fading like the face of a spirit floating by  blue said blaisdell lets get isbels body soon as we dare an bury it  reckon we can right after dark  shore replied blue  but yu fellars figger thet out  im thinkin hard  ive got somethin on my mind  jean grew fascinated by the looks and speech and action of the little gunman  blue indeed had something on his mind  and it boded ill to the men in that dark square stone house down the road  he paced to and fro in the yard back and forth on the path to the gate and then he entered the cabin to stalk up and down faster and faster until all at once he halted as if struck to upfling his right arm in a singular fierce gesture  jean call the men in he said tersely  they all filed in sinister and silent with eager faces turned to the little texan  his dominance showed markedly  gordon yu stand in the door an keep your eye peeled went on blue  now boys listen  ive thought it all out  this game of man huntin is the same to me as cattle raisin is to yu  an my life in texas all comes back to me i reckon in good stead fer us now  im goin to kill lee jorth  him first an mebbe his brothers  i had to think of a good many ways before i hit on one i reckon will be shore its got to be shore  jorth has got to die  wal heahs my plan thet jorth outfit is drinkin some we can gamble on it  theyre not goin to leave thet store  an of course theyll be expectin us to start a fight  i reckon theyll look fer some such siege as they held round isbels ranch  but we shore aint goin to do thet  im goin to surprise thet outfit  theres only one man among them who is dangerous an thets queen  i know queen  but he doesnt know me an im goin to finish my job before he gets acquainted with me after thet all right  blue paused a moment his eyes narrowing down his whole face setting in hard cast of intense preoccupation as if he visualized a scene of extraordinary nature  wal whats your trick demanded blaisdell  yu all know greavess store continued blue  how them winders have wooden shutters thet keep a light from showin outside  wal im gamblin thet as soon as its dark jorths gang will be celebratin theyll be drinkin an theyll have a light an the winders will be shut  theyre not goin to worry none aboot us  thet store is like a fort  it wont

he lays till this fights over  mebbe yu ll have more n him to bury well crawl behind them bushes in front of colemans yard  an heahs where jean comes in  hell take an ax an his guns of course an do some of his injun sneakin round to the back of greavess store an jean yu must do a slick job of this but i reckon it ll be easy fer you  back there it ll be dark as pitch fer anyone lookin out of the store  an im figgerin yu can take your time an crawl right up now if yu dont remember how greavess back yard looks ill tell yu  here blue dropped on one knee to the floor and with a finger he traced a map of greavess barn and fence the back door and window and especially a break in the stone foundation which led into a kind of cellar where greaves stored wood and other things that could be left outdoors  jean i take particular pains to show yu where this hole is said blue because if the gang runs out yu could duck in there an hide an if they run out into the yardwal yud make it a sorry run fer them wal when yuve crawled up close to greavess back door an waited long enough to see an listenthen youre to run fast an swing your ax smash agin the winder  take a quick peep in if yu want to it might help  then jump quick an take a swing at the door yu ll be standin to one side so if the gang shoots through the door they wont hit yu  bang thet door good an hard wal nows where i come in  when yu swing thet ax ill shore run fer the front of the store  jorth an his outfit will be some attentive to thet poundin of yours on the back door  so i reckon  an theyll be lookin thet way ill run inyellan throw my guns on jorth  humph  is that all ejaculated blaisdell  i reckon thets all an im figgerin its a hell of a lot responded blue dryly  thets what jorth will think  where do we come in  wal yu all can back me up replied blue dubiously  yu see my plan goes as far as killin jorthan mebbe his brothers  mebbe ill get a crack at queen  but ill be shore of jorth  after thet all depends  mebbe it ll be easy fer me to get out  an if i do yu fellars will know it an can fill thet storeroom full of bullets  wal blue with all due respect to yu i shore dont like your plan declared blaisdell  success depends upon too many little things any one of which might go wrong  blaisdell i reckon i know this heah game better than yu replied blue  a gun fighter goes by instinct  this trick will work  but suppose that front door of greavess store is barred protested blaisdell  it hasnt got any bar said blue  yure shore  yes i reckon replied blue  hell man arent yu takin a terrible chance queried blaisdell  blues answer to that was a look that brought the blood to blaisdells face  only then did the rancher really comprehend how the little gunman had taken such desperate chances before and meant to take them now not with any hope or assurance of escaping with his life but to live up to his peculiar code of honor  blaisdell did yu ever heah of me in texas he queried dryly  wal no blue i caint swear i did replied the rancher apologetically  an isbel was always sort of mysterious aboot his acquaintance with you  my names not blue  ahuh  wal what is it thenif im safe to ask returned blaisdell gruffly  its king fisher replied blue  the shock that stiffened blaisdell must have been communicated to the others  jean certainly felt amaze and some other emotion not fully realized when he found himself face to face with one of the most notorious characters ever known in texasan outlaw long supposed to be dead  men i reckon id kept my secret if id any idee of comin out of this isbeljorth war alive said blue  but im goin to cash  i feel it heah isbel was my friend  he saved me from bein lynched in texas an so im goin to kill jorth  now ill take it kind of yuif any of yu come out of this aliveto tell who i was an why i was on the isbel side  because this sheep an cattle warthis talk of jorth an the hash knife gangit makes me sick  i know theres been crooked work on isbels side too  an i never want it on record thet i killed jorth because he was a rustler  by god blue its late in the day for such talk burst out blaisdell in rage and amaze  but i reckon yu know what yure talkin aboot wal i shore dont want to heah it  at this juncture bill isbel quietly entered the cabin too late to hear any of blues statement  jean was positive of that for as blue was speaking those last revealing words bills heavy boots had resounded on the gravel path outside  yet something in bills look or in the way blue averted his lean face or in the entrance of bill at that particular moment or all these together seemed to jean to add further mystery to the long secret causes leading up to the jorthisbel war did bill know what blue knew  jean had an inkling that he did  and on the moment so perplexing and bitter jean gazed out the door down the deserted road to where his dead father lay whitehaired and ghastly in the sunlight  blue you could have kept that to yourself as well as your real name interposed jean with bitterness  its too late now for either to do any good but i appreciate your friendship for dad an im ready to help carry out your plan  that decision of jeans appeared to put an end to protest or argument from blaisdell or any of the others  blues fleeting dark smile was one of satisfaction  then upon most of this group of men seemed to settle a grim restraint  they went out and walked and watched they came in again restless and somber  jean thought that he must have bent his gaze a thousand times down the road to the tragic figure of his father  that sight roused all emotions in his breast and the one that stirred there most was pity  the pity of it  gaston isbel lying face down in the dust of the village street  patches of blood showed on the back of his vest and one whitesleeved shoulder  he had been shot through  every time jean saw this blood he had to stifle a gathering of wild savage impulses  meanwhile the afternoon hours dragged by and the village remained as if its inhabitants had abandoned it  not even a dog showed on the side road  jorth and some of his men came out in front of the store and sat on the steps in close convening groups  every move they made seemed significant of their confidence and importance  about sunset they went back into the store closing  door and window shutters  then blaisdell called the isbel faction to have food and drink  jean felt no hunger and blue who had kept apart from the others showed no desire to eat neither did he smoke though early in the day he had never been without a cigarette between his lips  twilight fell and darkness came  not a light showed anywhere in the blackness  wal i reckon its aboot time said blue and he led the way out of the cabin to the back of the lot  jean strode behind him carrying his rifle and an ax  silently the other men followed  blue turned to the left and led through the field until he came within sight of a dark line of trees  thets where the road turns off he said to jean  an heahs the back of colemans place wal jean good luck  jean felt the grip of a steellike hand and in the darkness he caught the gleam of blues eyes  jean had no response in words for the laconic blue but he wrung the hard thin hand and hurried away in the darkness  once alone his part of the business at hand rushed him into eager thrilling action  this was the sort of work he was fitted to do in this instance it was important but it seemed to him that blue had coolly taken the perilous part  and this cowboy with gray in his thin hair was in reality the great king fisher  jean marveled at the fact and he shivered all over for jorth  in ten minutesfifteen more or less jorth would lie gasping bloody froth and sinking down something in the dark lonely silent oppressive summer night told jean this he strode on swiftly  crossing the road at a run he kept on over the ground he had traversed during the afternoon and in a few moments he stood breathing hard at the edge of the common behind greavess store  a pin point of light penetrated the blackness  it made jeans heart leap  the jorth contingent were burning the big lamp that hung in the center of greavess store  jean listened  loud voices and coarse laughter sounded discord on the melancholy silence of the night  what blue had called his instinct had surely guided him aright  death of gaston isbel was being celebrated by revel  in a few moments jean had regained his breath  then all his faculties set intensely to the action at hand  he seemed to magnify his hearing and his sight  his movements made no sound  he gained the wagon where he crouched a moment  the ground seemed a pale obscure medium hardly more real than the gloom above it  through this gloom of night which looked thick like a cloud but was really clear shone the thin bright point of light accentuating the black square that was greavess store  above this stood a gray line of tree foliage and then the intensely darkblue sky studded with white cold stars  a hound bayed lonesomely somewhere in the distance  voices of men sounded more distinctly some deep and low others loud unguarded with the vacant note of thoughtlessness  jean gathered all his forces until sense of sight and hearing were in exquisite accord with the suppleness and lightness of his movements he glided on about ten short swift steps before he halted  that was as far as his piercing eyes could penetrate  if there had been a guard stationed outside the store jean would have seen him before being seen he saw the fence reached it entered the yard glided in the dense shadow of the barn until the black square began to loom graythe color of stone at night  jean peered through the obscurity  no dark figure of a man showed against that gray wallonly a black patch which must be the hole in the foundation mentioned  a ray of light now streaked out from the little black window  to the right showed the wide black door  farther on jean glided silently  then he halted  there was no guard outside  jean heard the clink of a cap the lazy drawl of a texan and then a strong harsh voicejorths  it strung jeans whole being tight and vibrating  inside he was on fire while cold thrills rippled over his skin  it took tremendous effort of will to hold himself back another instant to listen to look to feel to make sure  and that instant charged him with a mighty current of hot blood straining throbbing damming  when jean leaped this current burst  in a few swift bounds he gained his point halfway between door and window  he leaned his rifle against the stone wall  then he swung the ax  crash  the window shutter split and rattled to the floor inside  the silence then broke with a hoarse whats thet  with all his might jean swung the heavy ax on the door  smash  the lower half caved in and banged to the floor  bright light flared out the hole  look out yelled a man in loud alarm  theyre batterin the back door  jean swung again high on the splintered door  crash  pieces flew inside  theyve got axes hoarsely shouted another voice  shove the counter agin the door  no thundered a voice of authority that denoted terror as well let them come in  pull your guns an take to cover  they aint comin in was the hoarse reply  theyll shoot in on us from the dark  put out the lamp yelled another  jeans third heavy swing caved in part of the upper half of the door shouts and curses intermingled with the sliding of benches across the floor and the hard shuffle of boots  this confusion seemed to be split and silenced by a piercing yell of different caliber of terrible meaning  it stayed jeans swingcaused him to drop the ax and snatch up his rifle  dont anybody move  like a steel whip this voice cut the silence  it belonged to blue jean swiftly bent to put his eye to a crack in the door  most of those visible seemed to have been frozen into unnatural positions  jorth stood rather in front of his men hatless and coatless one arm outstretched and his dark profile set toward a little man just inside the door  this man was blue  jean needed only one flashing look at blues face at his leveled quivering guns to understand why he had chosen this trick  whoreyou demanded jorth in husky pants  reckon im isbels righthand man came the biting reply once tolerable well known in texas king fisher  the name must have been a guarantee of death  jorth recognized this outlaw and realized his own fate  in the lamplight his face turned a pale greenish white  his outstretched hand began to quiver down  blues left gun seemed to leap up and flash red and explode  several heavy reports merged almost as one  jorths arm jerked limply flinging his gun  and his body sagged in the middle  his hands fluttered like crippled wings and found their way to his abdomen  his deathpale face never changed its set look nor position toward blue but his gasping utterance was one of horrible mortal fury and terror then he began to sway still with that strange rigid set of his face toward his slayer until he fell  his fall broke the spell  even blue like the gunman he was had paused to watch jorth in his last mortal action  jorths followers began to draw and shoot  jean saw blues return fire bring down a huge man who fell across jorths body  then jean quick as the thought that actuated him raised his rifle and shot at the big lamp  it burst in a flare  it crashed to the floor  darkness followeda blank thick enveloping mantle  then red flashes of guns emphasized the blackness inside the store there broke loose a pandemonium of shots yells curses and thudding boots  jean shoved his rifle barrel inside the door and holding it low down he moved it to and fro while he worked lever and trigger until the magazine was empty  then drawing his sixshooter he emptied that  a roar of rifles from the front of the store told jean that his comrades had entered the fray  bullets zipped through the door he had broken  jean ran swiftly round the corner taking care to sheer off a little to the left and when he got clear of the building he saw a line of flashes in the middle of the road  blaisdell and the others were firing into the door of the store with nimble fingers jean reloaded his rifle  then swiftly he ran across the road and down to get behind his comrades  their shooting had slackened  jean saw dark forms coming his way  hello blaisdell he called warningly  that yu jean returned the rancher looming up  wal we wasnt worried aboot yu  blue queried jean sharply  a little dark figure shuffled past jean  howdy jean said blue dryly  yu shore did your part  reckon ill need to be tied up but i aint hurt much  colmors hit called the voice of gordon a few yards distant help me somebody  jean ran to help gordon uphold the swaying colmor  are you hurtbad asked jean anxiously  the young mans head rolled and hung  he was breathing hard and did not reply  they had almost to carry him  come on men called blaisdell turning back toward the others who were still firing  well let well enough alone fredericks yu an bill help me find the body of the old man  its heah somewhere  farther on down the road the searchers stumbled over gaston isbel they picked him up and followed jean and gordon who were supporting the wounded colmor  jean looked back to see blue dragging himself along in the rear  it was too dark to see distinctly nevertheless jean got the impression that blue was more severely wounded than he had claimed to be  the distance to meekers cabin was not far but it took what jean felt to be a long and anxious time to get there colmor apparently rallied somewhat  when this procession entered meekers yard blue was lagging behind  blue how air yu called blaisdell with concern  wal i gotmy bootsonanyhow replied blue huskily  he lurched into the yard and slid down on the grass and stretched out  man  yure hurt bad exclaimed blaisdell  the others halted in their slow march and as if by tacit unspoken word lowered the body of isbel to the ground  then blaisdell knelt beside blue  jean left colmor to gordon and hurried to peer down into blues dim face  no i ainthurt said blue in a much weaker voice  imjest killed  it was queen  yu all heerd mequeen wasonly bad man in that lot  i knowed it i couldhev killed him but i wasafter lee jorth an his brothers  blues voice failed

receiving no answer he bent lower in the starlight and placed a hand upon the mans breast  wal hes gone i wonder if he really was the old texas king fisher  no one would ever believe it but if he killed the jorths ill shore believe him    chapter x  two weeks of lonely solitude in the forest had worked incalculable change in ellen jorth  late in june her father and her two uncles had packed and ridden off with daggs colter and six other men all heavily armed some somber with drink others hard and grim with a foretaste of fight  ellen had not been given any orders  her father had forgotten to bid her goodby or had avoided it  their dark mission was stamped on their faces  they had gone and keen as had been ellens pang nevertheless their departure was a relief  she had heard them bluster and brag so often that she had her doubts of any great jorthisbel war  barking dogs did not bite  somebody perhaps on each side would be badly wounded possibly killed and then the feud would go on as before mostly talk many of her former impressions had faded  development had been so rapid and continuous in her that she could look back to a daybyday transformation  at night she had hated the sight of herself and when the dawn came she would rise singing  jorth had left ellen at home with the mexican woman and antonio ellen saw them only at meal times and often not then for she frequently visited old john sprague or came home late to do her own cooking  it was but a short distance up to spragues cabin and since she had stopped riding the black horse spades she walked  spades was accustomed to having grain and in the mornings he would come down to the ranch and whistle  ellen had vowed she would never feed the horse and bade antonio do it  but one morning antonio was absent she fed spades herself  when she laid a hand on him and when he rubbed his nose against her shoulder she was not quite so sure she hated him why should i she queried  a horse caint help it if he belongs toto  ellen was not sure of anything except that more and more it grew good to be alone  a whole day in the lonely forest passed swiftly yet it left a feeling of long time  she lived by her thoughts  always the morning was bright sunny sweet and fragrant and colorful and her mood was pensive wistful dreamy  and always just as surely as the hours passed thought intruded upon her happiness and thought brought memory and memory brought shame and shame brought fight  sunset after sunset she had dragged herself back to the ranch sullen and sick and beaten  yet she never ceased to struggle  the july storms came and the forest floor that had been so sear and brown and dry and dusty changed as if by magic  the green grass shot up the flowers bloomed and along the canyon beds of lacy ferns swayed in the wind and bent their graceful tips over the ambercolored water ellen haunted these cool dells these pineshaded mossyrocked ravines where the brooks tinkled and the deer came down to drink  she wandered alone  but there grew to be company in the aspens and the music of the little waterfalls  if she could have lived in that solitude always never returning to the ranch home that reminded her of her name she could have forgotten and have been happy  she loved the storms  it was a dry country and she had learned through years to welcome the creamy clouds that rolled from the southwest they came sailing and clustering and darkening at last to form a great purple angry mass that appeared to lodge against the mountain rim and burst into dazzling streaks of lightning and gray palls of rain lightning seldom struck near the ranch but up on the rim there was never a storm that did not splinter and crash some of the noble pines during the storm season sheep herders and woodsmen generally did not camp under the pines fear of lightning was inborn in the natives but for ellen the dazzling white streaks or the tremendous splitting crackling shock or the thunderous boom and rumble along the battlements of the rim had no terrors  a storm eased her breast  deep in her heart was a hidden gathering storm  and somehow to be out when the elements were warring when the earth trembled and the heavens seemed to burst asunder afforded her strange relief  the summer days became weeks and farther and farther they carried ellen on the wings of solitude and loneliness until she seemed to look back years at the self she had hated  and always when the dark memory impinged upon peace she fought and fought until she seemed to be fighting hatred itself  scorn of scorn and hate of hate  yet even her battles grew to be dreams  for when the inevitable retrospect brought back jean isbel and his love and her cowardly falsehood she would shudder a little and put an unconscious hand to her breast and utterly fail in her fight and drift off down to vague and wistful dreams the clean and healing forest with its whispering wind and imperious solitude had come between ellen and the meaning of the squalid sheep ranch with its travesty of home its tragic owner  and it was coming between her two selves the one that she had been forced to be and the other that she did not knowthe thinker the dreamer the romancer the one who lived in fancy the life she loved  the summer morning dawned that brought ellen strange tidings  they must have been created in her sleep and now were realized in the glorious burst of golden sun in the sweep of creamy clouds across the blue in the solemn music of the wind in the pines in the wild screech of the blue jays and the noble bugle of a stag  these heralded the day as no ordinary day  something was going to happen to her she divined it  she felt it  and she trembled  nothing beautiful hopeful wonderful could ever happen to ellen jorth  she had been born to disaster to suffer to be forgotten and die alone  yet all nature about her seemed a magnificent rebuke to her morbidness  the same spirit that came out there with the thick amber light was in her  she lived and something in her was stronger than mind  ellen went to the door of her cabin where she flung out her arms driven to embrace this nameless purport of the morning  and a wellknown voice broke in upon her rapture  wal lass i like to see you happy an i hate myself fer comin because ive been to grass valley fer two days an ive got news  old john sprague stood there with a smile that did not hide a troubled look  oh  uncle john  you startled me exclaimed ellen shocked back to reality  and slowly she added grass valley  news  she put out an appealing hand which sprague quickly took in his own as if to reassure her  yes an not bad so far as you jorths are concerned he replied the first jorthisbel fight has come off reckon you remember makin me promise to tell you if i heerd anythin  wal i didnt wait fer you to come up  so ellen heard her voice calmly saying  what was this lying calm when there seemed to be a stone hammer at her heart  the first fightnot so bad for the jorths  then it had been bad for the isbels a sudden cold stillness fell upon her senses  lets sit downoutdoors sprague was saying  nice an sunny thismornin  i declareim out of breath  not used to walkin an besides i left grass valley in the nightan im tired  but excoose me from hangin round thet village last night  there was shore  whowho was killed interrupted ellen her voice breaking low and deep  guy isbel an bill jacobs on the isbel side an daggs craig an greaves on your fathers side stated sprague with something of awed haste  ah breathed ellen and she relaxed to sink back against the cabin wall  sprague seated himself on the log beside her turning to face her and he seemed burdened with grave and important matters  i heerd a good many conflictin stories he said earnestly  the village folks is all skeered an theres no believin their gossip but i got what happened straight from jake evarts  the fight come off day before yestiddy  your fathers gang rode down to isbels ranch daggs was seen to be wantin some of the isbel hosses so evarts says an guy isbel an jacobs ran out in the pasture  daggs an some others shot them down  killed themthat way put in ellen sharply  so evarts says  he was on the ridge an swears he seen it all  they killed guy an jacobs in cold blood  no chance fer their livesnot even to fight  wall hen they surrounded the isbel cabin  the fight last all thet day an all night an the next day  evarts says guy an jacobs laid out thar all this time  an a herd of hogs broke in the pasture an was eatin the dead bodies   my god burst out ellen  uncle john yu shore caint mean my father wouldnt stop fightin long enough to drive the hogs off an bury those daid men  evarts says they stopped fightin all right but it was to watch the hogs declared sprague  an then what d ye think  the wimminfolks come outthe  redheaded one guys wife an jacobss wifethey drove the hogs away an buried their husbands right there in the pasture  evarts says he seen the graves  it is the women who can teach these bloody texans a lesson declared ellen forcibly  wal daggs was drunk an he got up from behind where the gang was hidin an dared the isbels to come out  they shot him to pieces an thet night some one of the isbels shot craig who was alone on guard an lastthis heres what i come to tell youjean isbel slipped up in the dark on greaves an knifed him  why did yu want to tell me that particularly asked ellen slowly  because i reckon the facts in the case are queeran because ellen your name was mentioned announced sprague positively  my namementioned echoed ellen  her horror and disgust gave way to a quickening process of thought a mounting astonishment  by whom  jean isbel replied sprague as if the name and the fact were momentous  ellen sat still as a stone her hands between her knees  slowly she felt the blood recede from her face prickling her kin down below her neck  that name locked her thought  ellen its a mighty queer storytoo queer to be a lie went on sprague  now you listen  evarts got this from ted meeker  an ted meeker heerd it from greaves who didnt die till the next day after jean isbel knifed him  an your dad shot ted fer tellin what he heerd no greaves wasnt killed outright  he was cut somethin turriblein two places  they wrapped him all up an next day packed him in a wagon back to grass valley  evarts says ted meeker was friendly with greaves an went to see him as he was layin in his room next to the store  wal accordin to meekers story greaves came to an talked he said he was sittin there in the dark shootin occasionally at isbels cabin when he heerd a rustle behind him in the grass  he knowed some one was crawlin on him  but before he could get his gun around he was jumped by what he thought was a grizzly bear but it was a man  he shut off greavess wind an dragged him back in the ditch an he said greaves its the halfbreed  an hes goin to cut youfirst for ellen jorth an then for gaston isbel  greaves said jean ripped him with a bowie knife an thet was all greaves remembered  he died soon after tellin this story  he must hev fought awful hard  thet second cut isbel gave him went clear through him some of the gang was thar when greaves talked an naturally they wondered why jean isbel had said first for ellen jorth  somebody remembered thet greaves had cast a slur on your good name ellen  an then they had jean isbels reason fer sayin thet to greaves  it caused a lot of talk  an when simm bruce busted in some of the gang hawhawed him an said as how hed get the third cut from jean isbels bowie bruce was half drunk an he began to cuss an rave about jean isbel bein in love with his girl as bad luck would have it a couple of more fellars come in an asked meeker questions  he jest got to thet part greaves its the halfbreed an hes goin to cut youfirst for ellen jorth when in walked your father  then it all had to come outwhat jean isbel had said an donean why how greaves had backed simm bruce in slurrin you  sprague paused to look hard at ellen  oh  thenwhat did dad do whispered ellen  he said by god halfbreed or not theres one isbel whos a man an he killed bruce on the spot an gave meeker a nasty wound somebody grabbed him before he could shoot meeker again  they threw meeker out an he crawled to a neighbors house where he was when evarts seen him  ellen felt spragues rough but kindly hand shaking her  an now what do you think of jean isbel he queried  a great unsurmountable wall seemed to obstruct ellens thought it seemed gray in color  it moved toward her  it was inside her brain  i tell you ellen jorth declared the old man thet jean isbel loves youloves you turriblyan he believes youre good  oh nohe doesnt faltered ellen  wal he jest does  oh uncle john he caint believe that she cried  of course he can  he does  you are goodgood as gold ellen an he knows it what a queer deal it all is  poor devil  to love you thet turribly an hev to fight your people  ellen your dad had it correct  isbel or not hes a man an i say what a shame you two are divided by hate  hate thet you hed nothin to do with sprague patted her head and rose to go  mebbe thet fight will end the trouble  i reckon it will  dont cross bridges till you come to them ellen i must hurry back now  i didnt take time to unpack my burros  come up soon an say ellen dont think hard any more of thet jean isbel  sprague strode away and ellen neither heard nor saw him go  she sat perfectly motionless yet had a strange sensation of being lifted by invisible and mighty power  it was like movement felt in a dream she was being impelled upward when her body seemed immovable as stone when her blood beat down this deadlock of an her physical being and rushed on and on through her veins it gave her an irresistible impulse to fly to sail through space to ran and run and ran  and on the moment the black horse spades coming from the meadow whinnied at sight of her  ellen leaped up and ran swiftly but her feet seemed to be stumbling  she hugged the horse and buried her hot face in his mane and clung to him  then just as violently she rushed for her saddle and bridle and carried the heavy weight as easily as if it had been an empty sack  throwing them upon him she buckled and strapped with strong eager hands  it never occurred to her that she was not dressed to ride  up she flung herself  and the horse sensing her spirit plunged into strong free gait down the canyon trail  the ride the action the thrill the sensations of violence were not all she needed  solitude the empty aisles of the forest the far miles of lonely wildernesswere these the added all  spades took a swinging rhythmic lope up the winding trail  the wind fanned her hot face  the sting of whipping aspen branches was pleasant  a deep rumble of thunder shook the sultry air  up beyond the green slope of the canyon massed the creamy clouds shading darker and darker  spades loped on the levels leaped the washes trotted over the rocky ground and took to a walk up the long slope  ellen dropped the reins over the pommel her hands could not stay set on anything  they pressed her breast and flew out to caress the white aspens and to tear at the maple leaves and gather the lavender juniper berries and came back again to her heart her heart that was going to burst or break  as it had swelled so now it labored it could not keep pace with her needs  all that was physical all that was living in her had to be unleashed  spades gained the level forest  how the great browngreen pines seemed to bend their lofty branches over her protectively understandingly patches of azureblue sky flashed between the trees the great white clouds sailed along with her and shafts of golden sunlight flecked with gleams of falling pine needles shone down through the canopy overhead  away in front of her up the slow heave of forest land boomed the heavy thunderbolts along the battlements of the rim  was she riding to escape from herself  for no gait suited her until spades was running hard and fast through the glades  then the pressure of dry wind the thick odor of pine the flashes of brown and green and gold and blue the soft rhythmic thuds of hoofs the feel of the powerful horse under her the whip of spruce branches on her muscles contracting and expanding in hard actionall these sensations seemed to quell for the time the mounting cataclysm in her heart  the oak swales the maple thickets the aspen groves the pineshaded aisles and the miles of silver spruce all sped by her as if she had ridden the wind and through the forest ahead shone the vast open of the basin gloomed by purple and silver cloud shadowed by gray storm and in the west brightened by golden sky  straight to the rim she had ridden and to the point where she had watched jean isbel that unforgetable day  she rode to the promontory behind the pine thicket and beheld a scene which stayed her restless hands upon her heaving breast  the world of sky and cloud and earthly abyss seemed one of stormsundered grandeur  the air was sultry and still and smelled of the peculiar burntwood odor caused by lightning striking trees  a few heavy drops of rain were pattering down from the thin gray edge of clouds overhead to the east hung the storma black cloud lodged against the rim from which long misty veils of rain streamed down into the gulf  the roar of rain sounded like the steady roar of the rapids of a river  then a bluewhite piercingly bright ragged streak of lightning shot down out of the black cloud  it struck with a splitting report that shocked the very wall of rock under ellen  then the heavens seemed to burst open with thundering crash and close with mighty thundering boom  long roar and longer rumble rolled away to the eastward  the rain poured down in roaring cataracts  the south held a panorama of purpleshrouded range and canyon canyon and range on across the rolling leagues to the dim lofty peaks all canopied over with angry dusky lowdrifting clouds horizonwide smoky and sulphurous  and as ellen watched hands pressed to her breast feeling incalculable relief in sight of this tempest and gulf that resembled her soul the sun burst out from behind the long bank of purple cloud in the west and flooded the world there with golden lightning  it is for me cried ellen my mindmy heartmy very soul oh i know  i know now  i love himlove himlove him  she cried it out to the elements  oh i love jean isbelan my heart will burst or break  the might of her passion was like the blaze of the sun  before it all else retreated diminished  the suddenness of the truth dimmed her sight but she saw clearly enough to crawl into the pine thicket through the clutching dry twigs over the mats of fragrant needles to the covert where she had once spied upon jean isbel  and here she lay face down for a while hands clutching the needles breast pressed hard upon the ground stricken and spent  but vitality was exceeding strong in her it passed that weakness of realization and she awakened to the consciousness of love  but in the beginning it was not consciousness of the man  it was new sensorial life elemental primitive a liberation of a million inherited instincts quivering and physical over which ellen had no more control than she had over the glory of the sun  if she thought at all it was of her need to be hidden like an animal low down near the earth covered by green thicket lost in the wildness of nature  she went to nature unconsciously seeking a mother  and love was a birth from the depths of her like a rushing spring of pure water long underground and at last propelled to the surface by a convulsion  ellen gradually lost her tense rigidity and relaxed  her body softened she rolled over until her face caught the lacy golden shadows cast by sun and bough  scattered drops of rain pattered around her  the air was hot and its odor was that of dry pine and spruce fragrance penetrated by brimstone from the lightning  the nest where she lay was warm and sweet  no eye save that of nature saw her in her abandonment  an ineffable and exquisite smile wreathed her lips dreamy sad sensuous the supremity of unconscious happiness  over her dark and eloquent eyes as ellen gazed upward spread a luminous film a veil  she was looking intensely yet she did not see  the wilderness enveloped her with its secretive elemental sheaths of rock of tree of cloud of sunlight through her thrilling skin poured the multiple and nameless sensations of the living organism stirred to supreme sensitiveness  she could not lie still but all her movements were gentle involuntary  the slow reaching out of her hand to grasp at nothing visible was similar to the lazy stretching of her limbs to the heave of her breast to the ripple of muscle  ellen knew not what she felt  to live that sublime hour was beyond thought  such happiness was like the first dawn of the world to the sight of man  it had to do with bygone ages  her heart her blood her flesh her very bones were filled with instincts and emotions common to the race before intellect developed when the savage lived only with his sensorial perceptions  of all happiness joy bliss rapture to which man was heir that of intense and exquisite preoccupation of the senses unhindered and unburdened by thought was the greatest  ellen felt that which life meant with its inscrutable design  love was only the realization of her mission on the earth  the dark storm cloud with its white ragged ropes of lightning and downstreaming gray veils of rain the purple gulf rolling like a colored sea to the dim mountains the glorious golden light of the sunthese had enchanted her eyes with her beauty of the universe they had burst the windows of her blindness  when she crawled into the greenbrown covert it was to escape too great perception  she needed to be encompassed by close tangible things  and there her body paid the tribute to the realization of life  shock convulsion pain relaxation and then unutterable and insupportable sensing of her environment and the heart  in one way she was a wild animal alone in the woods forced into the mating that meant reproduction of its kind in another she was an infinitely higher being shot through and through with the most resistless and mysterious transport that life could give to flesh  and when that spell slackened its hold there wedged into her mind a consciousness of the man she lovedjean isbel  then emotion and thought strove for mastery over her  it was not herself or love that she loved but a living man  suddenly he existed so clearly for her that she could see him hear him almost feel him  her whole soul her very life cried out to him for protection for salvation for love for fulfillment  no denial no doubt marred the white blaze of her realization  from the instant that she had looked up into jean isbels dark face she had loved him  only she had not known  she bowed now and bent and humbly quivered under the mastery of something beyond her ken  thought clung to the beginnings of her romanceto the three times she had seen him  every look every word every act of his returned to her now in the light of the truth  love at first sight he had sworn it bitterly eloquently scornful of her doubts  and now a blind sweet shuddering ecstasy swayed her  how weak and frail seemed her bodytoo small too slight for this monstrous and terrible engine of fire and lightning and fury and gloryher heart  it must burst or break  relentlessly memory pursued ellen and her thoughts whirled and emotion conquered her  at last she quivered up to her knees as if lashed to action  it seemed that first kiss of isbels cool and gentle and timid was on her lips  and her eyes closed and hot tears welled from under her lids  her groping hands found only the dead twigs and the pine boughs of the trees  had she reached out to clasp him  then hard and violent on her mouth and cheek and neck burned those other kisses of isbels and with the flashing stinging memory came the truth that now she would have bartered her soul for them utterly she surrendered to the resistlessness of this love  her loss of mother and friends her wandering from one wild place to another her lonely life among bold and rough men had developed her for violent love  it overthrew all pride it engendered humility it killed hate ellen wiped the tears from her eyes and as she knelt there she swept to her breast a fragrant spreading bough of pine needles  ill go to him she whispered  ill tell him ofof mymy love  ill tell him to take me awayaway to the end of the worldaway from heahbefore its too late  it was a solemn beautiful moment  but the last spoken words lingered hauntingly  too late she whispered  and suddenly it seemed that death itself shuddered in her soul too late  it was too late  she had killed his love  that jorth blood in herthat poisonous hatehad chosen the only way to strike this noble isbel to the heart  basely with an abandonment of womanhood she had mockingly perjured her soul with a vile lie  she writhed she shook under the whip of this inconceivable fact  lost  lost  she wailed her misery  she might as well be what she had made jean isbel think she was  if she had been shamed before she was now abased degraded lost in her own sight  and if she would have given her soul for his kisses she now would have killed herself to earn back his respect jean isbel had given her at sight the deference that she had unconsciously craved and the love that would have been her salvation what a horrible mistake she had made of her life  not her mothers blood but her fathersthe jorth bloodhad been her ruin  again ellen fell upon the soft pineneedle mat face down and she groveled and burrowed there in an agony that could not bear the sense of light  all she had suffered was as nothing to this  to have awakened to a splendid and uplifting love for a man whom she had imagined she hated who had fought for her name and had killed in revenge for the dishonor she had avowedto have lost his love and what was infinitely more precious to her now in her ignominyhis faith in her puritythis broke her heart    chapter xi  when ellen utterly spent in body and mind reached home that day a melancholy sultry twilight was falling  fitful flares of sheet lightning swept across the dark horizon to the east  the cabins were deserted  antonio and the mexican woman were gone  the circumstances made ellen wonder but she was too tired and too sunken in spirit to think long about it or to care  she fed and watered her horse and left him in the corral  then supperless and without removing her clothes she threw herself upon the bed and at once sank into heavy slumber  sometime during the night she awoke  coyotes were yelping and from that sound she concluded it was near dawn  her body ached her mind seemed dull  drowsily she was sinking into slumber again when she heard the rapid clipclop of trotting horses  startled she raised her head to listen  the men were coming back  relief and dread seemed to clear her stupor  the trotting horses stopped across the lane from her cabin evidently at the corral where she had left spades  she heard him whistle  from the sound of hoofs she judged the number of horses to be six or eight  low voices of men mingled with thuds and cracking of straps and flopping of saddles on the ground  after that the heavy tread of boots sounded on the porch of the cabin opposite  a door creaked on its hinges  next a slow footstep accompanied by clinking of spurs approached ellens door and a heavy hand banged upon it  she knew this person could not be her father  hullo ellen  she recognized the voice as belonging to colter  somehow its tone or something about it sent a little shiver clown her spine  it acted like a revivifying current  ellen lost her dragging lethargy  hey ellen are yu there added colter louder voice  yes  of course im heah she replied  what do yu want  walim shore glad yure home he replied  antonios gone with his squaw  an i was some worried aboot yu  whos with yu colter queried ellen sitting up  rock wells an springer  tad jorth was with us but we had to leave him over heah in a cabin  whats the matter with him  wal hes hurt tolerable bad was the slow reply  ellen heard colters spurs jangle as if he had uneasily shifted his feet  wheres dad an uncle jackson asked ellen  a silence pregnant enough to augment ellens dread finally broke to colters voice somehow different  shore theyre back on the trail an were to meet them where we left tad  are yu goin away again  i reckon an ellen yure goin with us  i am not she retorted  wal yu are if i have to pack yu he replied forcibly  its not safe heah any more  that damned halfbreed isbel with his gang are on our trail  that name seemed like a redhot blade at ellens leaden heart she wanted to fling a hundred queries on colter but she could not utter one  ellen weve got to hit the trail an hide continued colter anxiously  yu mustnt stay heah alone  suppose them isbels would trap yu  theyd tear your clothes off an rope yu to a tree ellen shore yure goin yu heah me  yesill go she replied as if forced  walthats good he said quickly  an rustle tolerable lively weve got to pack  the slow jangle of colters spurs and his slow steps moved away out of ellens hearing  throwing off the blankets she put her feet to the floor and sat there a moment staring at the blank nothingness of the cabin interior in the obscure gray of dawn  cold gray dreary obscurelike her life her future  and she was compelled to do what was hateful to her  as a jorth she must take to the unfrequented trails and hide like a rabbit in the thickets  but the interest of the moment a premonition of events to be quickened her into action  ellen unbarred the door to let in the light  day was breaking with an intense clear steely light in the east through which the morning star still shone white  a ruddy flare betokened the advent of the sun ellen unbraided her tangled hair and brushed and combed it  a queer still pang came to her at sight of pine needles tangled in her brown locks  then she washed her hands and face  breakfast was a matter of considerable work and she was hungry  the sun rose and changed the gray world of forest  for the first time in her life ellen hated the golden brightness the wonderful blue of sky the scream of the eagle and the screech of the jay and the squirrels she had always loved to feed were neglected that morning  colter came in  either ellen had never before looked attentively at him or else he had changed  her scrutiny of his lean hard features accorded him more texan attributes than formerly  his gray eyes were as light as clear as fierce as those of an eagle  and the sand gray of his face the long drooping fair mustache hid the secrets of his mind but not its strength  the instant ellen met his gaze she sensed a power in him that she instinctively opposed  colter had not been so bold nor so rude as daggs but he was the same kind of man perhaps the more dangerous for his secretiveness his cool waiting inscrutableness  mawnin ellen he drawled  yu shore look good for sore eyes  dont pay me compliments colter replied ellen  an your eyes are not sore  wal im shore sore from fightin an ridin an layin out he said bluntly  tell mewhats happened returned ellen  girl its a tolerable long story replied colter  an weve no time now  wait till we get to camp  am i to pack my belongins or leave them heah asked ellen  reckon yud better leavethem heah  but if we did not come back  wal i reckon its not likely well comesoon he said rather evasively  colter ill not go off into the woods with just the clothes i have on my back  ellen we shore got to pack all the grab we can  this shore aint goin to be a visit to neighbors  were shy pack hosses  but yu make up a bundle of belongins yu care for an the things yull need bad well throw it on somewhere  colter stalked away across the lane and ellen found herself dubiously staring at his tall figure  was it the situation that struck her with a foreboding perplexity or was her intuition steeling her against this man  ellen could not decide  but she had to go with him  her prejudice was unreasonable at this portentous moment  and she could not yet feel that she was solely responsible to herself  when it came to making a small bundle of her belongings she was in a quandary  she discarded this and put in that and then reversed the order  next in preciousness to her mothers things were the longhidden gifts of jean isbel  she could part with neither  while she was selecting and packing this bundle colter again entered and without speaking began to rummage in the corner where her father kept his possessions  this irritated ellen  what do yu want there she demanded  wal i reckon your dad wants his papersan the gold he left heahan a change of clothes  now doesnt he returned colter coolly  of course  but i supposed yu would have me pack them  colter vouchsafed no reply to this but deliberately went on rummaging with little regard for how he scattered things  ellen turned her back on him  at length when he left she went to her fathers corner and found that as far as she was able to see colter had taken neither papers nor clothes but only the gold  perhaps however she had been mistaken for she had not observed colters departure closely enough to know whether or not he carried a package  she missed only the gold her fathers papers old and musty were scattered about and these she gathered up to slip in her own bundle  colter or one of the men had saddled spades and he was now tied to the corral fence champing his bit and pounding the sand  ellen wrapped bread and meat inside her coat and after tying this behind her saddle she was ready to go  but evidently she would have to wait and preferring to remain outdoors she stayed by her horse  presently while watching the men pack she noticed that springer wore a bandage round his head under the brim of his sombrero  his motions were slow and lacked energy  shuddering at the sight ellen refused to conjecture all too soon she would learn what had happened and all too soon perhaps she herself would be in the midst of another fight  she watched the men  they were making a hurried slipshod job of packing food supplies from both cabins  more than once she caught colters gray gleam of gaze on her and she did not like it  ill ride up an say goodby to sprague she called to colter  shore yu wont do nothin of the kind he called back  there was authority in his tone that angered ellen and something else which inhibited her anger  what was there about colter with which she must reckon  the other two texans laughed aloud to be suddenly silenced by colters harsh and lowered curses  ellen walked out of hearing and sat upon a log where she remained until colter hailed her  get up an ride he called  ellen complied with this order and riding up behind the three mounted men she soon found herself leaving what for years had been her home not once did she look back  she hoped she would never see the squalid bare pretension of a ranch again  colter and the other riders drove the pack horses across the meadow off of the trails and up the slope into the forest  not very long did it take ellen to see that colters object was to hide their tracks he zigzagged through the forest avoiding the bare spots of dust the dry sunbaked flats of clay where water lay in spring and he chose the grassy open glades the long pineneedle matted aisles  ellen rode at their heels and it pleased her to watch for their tracks  colter manifestly had been long practiced in this game of hiding his trail and he showed the skill of a rustler  but ellen was not convinced that he could ever elude a real woodsman  not improbably however colter was only aiming to leave a trail difficult to follow and which would allow him and his confederates ample time to forge ahead of pursuers ellen could not accept a certainty of pursuit  yet colter must have expected it and springer and wells also for they had a dark sinister furtive demeanor that strangely contrasted with the cool easy manner habitual to them  they were not seeking the level routes of the forest land that was sure they rode straight across the thicktimbered ridge down into another canyon up out of that and across rough rocky bluffs and down again these riders headed a little to the northwest and every mile brought them into wilder more rugged country until ellen losing count of canyons and ridges had no idea where she was  no stop was made at noon to rest the laboring sweating pack animals  under circumstances where pleasure might have been possible ellen would have reveled in this hard ride into a wonderful forest ever thickening and darkening  but the wild beauty of glade and the spruce slopes and the deep bronzewalled canyons left her cold  she saw and felt but had no thrill except now and then a thrill of alarm when spades slid to his haunches down some steep damp piny declivity  all the woodland up and down appeared to be richer greener as they traveled farther west  grass grew thick and heavy  water ran in all ravines  the rocks were bronze and copper and russet and some had green patches of lichen  ellen felt the sun now on her left cheek and knew that the day was waning and that colter was swinging farther to the northwest  she had never before ridden through such heavy forest and down and up such wild canyons  toward sunset the deepest and ruggedest canyon halted their advance  colter rode to the right searching for a place to get down through a spruce thicket that stood on end  presently he dismounted and the others followed suit  ellen found she could not lead spades because he slid down upon her heels so she looped the end of her reins over the pommel and left him free  she herself managed to descend by holding to branches and sliding all the way down that slope she heard the horses cracking the brush snorting and heaving  one pack slipped and had to be removed from the horse and rolled down  at the bottom of this deep greenwalled notch roared a stream of water shadowed cool mossy damp this narrow gulch seemed the wildest place ellen had ever seen  she could just see the sunsetflushed goldtipped spruces far above her  the men repacked the horse that had slipped his burden and once more resumed their progress ahead now turning up this canyon there was no horse trail but deer and bear trails were numerous  the sun sank and the sky darkened but still the men rode on and the farther they traveled the wilder grew the aspect of the canyon  at length colter broke a way through a heavy thicket of willows and entered a side canyon the mouth of which ellen had not even descried it turned and widened and at length opened out into a round pocket apparently inclosed and as lonely and isolated a place as even pursued rustlers could desire  hidden by jutting wall and thicket of spruce were two old log cabins joined together by roof and attic floor the same as the double cabin at the jorth ranch  ellen smelled wood smoke and presently on going round the cabins saw a bright fire  one man stood beside it gazing at colters party which evidently he had heard approaching  hullo queen said colter  hows tad  hes holdin on fine replied queen bending over the fire where he turned pieces of meat  wheres father suddenly asked ellen addressing colter  as if he had not heard her he went on wearily loosening a pack  queen looked at her  the light of the fire only partially shone on his face  ellen could not see its expression  but from the fact that queen did not answer her question she got further intimation of an impending catastrophe  the long wild ride had helped prepare her for the secrecy and taciturnity of men who had resorted to flight  perhaps her father had been delayed or was still off on the deadly mission that had obsessed him or there might and probably was darker reason for his absence  ellen shut her teeth and turned to the needs of her horse and presently returning to the fire she thought of her uncle  queen is my uncle tad heah she asked  shore  hes in there replied queen pointing at the nearer cabin  ellen hurried toward the dark doorway  she could see how the logs of the cabin had moved awry and what a big dilapidated hovel it was as she looked in colter loomed over herplaced a familiar and somehow masterful hand upon her  ellen let it rest on her shoulder a moment must she forever be repulsing these rude men among whom her lot was cast did colter mean what daggs had always meant  ellen felt herself weary weak in body and her spent spirit had not rallied  yet whatever colter meant by his familiarity she could not bear it  so she slipped out from under his hand  uncle tad are yu heah she called into the blackness  she heard the mice scamper and rustle and she smelled the musty old woody odor of a longunused cabin  hello ellen came a voice she recognized as her uncles yet it was strange  yes  im heahbad luck to me  how re yu buckin up girl  im all right uncle tadonly tired an worried  i  tad hows your hurt interrupted colter  reckon im easier replied jorth wearily but shore im in bad shape im still spittin blood  i keep tellin queen that bullet lodged in my lungsbut he says it went through  wal hang on tad replied colter with a cheerfulness ellen sensed was really indifferent  oh what the hells the use exclaimed jorth its allup with uscolter  wal shut up then tersely returned colter  it aint doin yu or us any good to holler  tad jorth did not reply to this  ellen heard his breathing and it did not seem natural  it rasped a littlecame hurriedlythen caught in his throat  then he spat  ellen shrunk back against the door he was breathing through blood  uncle are yu in pain she asked  yes ellenit burns like hell he said  oh im sorry isnt there something i can do  i reckon not  queen did all anybody could do for menowunless its pray  colter laughed at thisthe slow easy drawling laugh of a texan but ellen felt pity for this wounded uncle  she had always hated him he had been a drunkard a gambler a waster of her fathers property and now he was a rustler and a fugitive lying in pain perhaps mortally hurt  yes unclei will pray for yu she said softly  the change in his voice held a note of sadness that she had been quick to catch  ellen yure the only good jorthin the whole damned lot he said god  i see it all now weve dragged yu to hell  yes uncle tad ive shore been dragged somebut not yetto hell she responded with a break in her voice  yu will beellenunless  aw shut up that kind of gab will yu broke in colter harshly  it amazed ellen that colter should dominate her uncle even though he was wounded  tad jorth had been the last man to take orders from anyone much less a rustler of the hash knife gang  this colter began to loom up in ellens estimate as he loomed physically over her a lofty figure dark motionless somehow menacing  ellen has colter told yu yetabootaboot lee an jackson inquired the wounded man  the pitchblack darkness of the cabin seemed to help fortify ellen to bear further trouble  colter told me dad an uncle jackson would meet us heah she rejoined hurriedly  jorth could be heard breathing in difficulty and he coughed and spat again and seemed to hiss  ellen he lied to yu  theyll never meet usheah  why not whispered ellen  becauseellen he replied in husky pants your dad anuncle jacksonare daidan buried  if ellen suffered a terrible shock it was a blankness a deadness and a slow creeping failure of sense in her knees  they gave way under her and she sank on the grass against the cabin wall  she did not faint nor grow dizzy nor lose her sight but for a while there was no process of thought in her mind  suddenly then it was therethe quick spiritual rending of her heartfollowed by a profound emotion of intimate and irretrievable lossand after that grief and bitter realization  an hour later ellen found strength to go to the fire and partake of the food and drink her body sorely needed  colter and the men waited on her solicitously and in silence now and then stealing furtive glances at her from under the shadow of their black sombreros  the dark night settled down like a blanket  there were no stars  the wind moaned fitfully among the pines and all about that lonely hidden recess was in harmony with ellens thoughts  girl yure shore game said colter admiringly  an i reckon yu never got it from the jorths  tad in therehes game said queen in mild protest  not to my notion replied colter  any man can be game when hes croakin with somebody around but lee jorth an jacksonthey always was yellow clear to their gizzards  they was born in louisiananot texas shore theyre no more texans than i am  ellen heah she must have got another strain in her blood  to ellen their words had no meaning  she rose and asked where can i sleep  ill fetch a light presently an yu can make your bed in there by tad replied colter  yes id like that  wal if yu reckon yu can coax him to talk youre shore wrong declared colter with that cold timbre of voice that struck like steel on ellens nerves  i cussed him good an told him hed keep his mouth shut  talkin makes him cough an that fetches up the blood besides i reckon im the one to tell yu how your dad an uncle got killed  tad didnt see it done an he was bad hurt when it happened shore all the fellars left have their idee aboot it but ive got it straight  coltertell me now cried ellen  wal all right  come over heah he replied and drew her away from the camp fire out in the shadow of gloom  poor kid  i shore feel bad aboot it  he put a long arm around her waist and drew her against him  ellen felt it yet did not offer any resistance  all her faculties seemed absorbed in a morbid and sad anticipation  ellen yu shore know i always loved yunow dont y u he asked with suppressed breath  no colter  its news to mean not what i want to heah  wal yu may as well heah it right now he said  its true an whats moreyour dad gave yu to me before he died  what colter yu must be a liar  ellen i swear im not lyin he returned in eager passion  i was with your dad last an heard him last  he shore knew id loved yu for years  an he said hed rather yu be left in my care than anybodys  my father gave me to yu in marriage ejaculated ellen in bewilderment  colters ready assurance did not carry him over this point  it was evident that her words somewhat surprised and disconcerted him for the moment  to let me marry a rustlerone of the hash knife gang exclaimed ellen with weary incredulity  wal your dad belonged to daggss gang same as i do replied colter recovering his cool ardor  no cried ellen  yes he shore did for years declared colter positively back in texas  an it was your dad that got daggs to come to arizona  ellen tried to fling herself away  but her strength and her spirit were ebbing and colter increased the pressure of his arm  all at once she sank limp  could she escape her fate  nothing seemed left to fight with or for  all rightdont hold meso tight she panted  now tell me how dad was killed  an whowho  colter bent over so he could peer into her face  in the darkness ellen just caught the gleam of his eyes  she felt the virile force of the man in the strain of his body as he pressed her close  it all seemed unreala hideous dreamthe gloom the moan of the wind the weird solitude and this rustler with hand and will like cold steel  wed come back to greavess store colter began  an as greaves was daid we all got free with his liquor  shore some of us got drunk bruce was drunk an tad in therehe was drunk  your dad put away more n i ever seen him  but shore he wasnt exactly drunk  he got one of them weak an shaky spells  he cried an he wanted some of us to get the isbels to call off the fightin he shore was ready to call it quits  i reckon the killin of daggsan then the awful way greaves was cut up by jean isbeltook all the fight out of your dad he said to me colter well take ellen an leave this heah countryan begin life all over againwhere no one knows us  oh did he really say that  did hereally mean it murmured ellen with a sob  ill swear it by the memory of my daid mother protested colter wal when night come the isbels rode down on us in the dark an began to shoot  they smashed in the doortried to burn us outan hollered around for a while  then they left an we reckoned thered be no more trouble that night  all the same we kept watch  i was the soberest one an i bossed the gang  we had some quarrels aboot the drinkin your dad said if we kept it up it d be the end of the jorths  an he planned to send word to the isbels next mawnin that he was ready for a truce an i was to go fix it up with gaston isbel  wal your dad went to bed in greavess room an a little while later your uncle jackson went in there too  some of the men laid down in the store an went to sleep i kept guard till aboot three in the mawnin  an i got so sleepy i couldnt hold my eyes open  so i waked up wells an slater an set them on guard one at each end of the store  then i laid down on the counter to take a nap  colters low voice the strain and breathlessness of him the agitation with which he appeared to be laboring and especially the simple matteroffact detail of his story carried absolute conviction to ellen jorth  her vague doubt of him had been created by his attitude toward her  emotion dominated her intelligence  the images the scenes called up by colters words were as true as the gloom of the wild gulch and the loneliness of the night solitudeas true as the strange fact that she lay passive in the arm of a rustler  wall after a while i woke up went on colter clearing his throat it was gray dawn  all was as still as death an somethin shore was wrong  wells an slater had got to drinkin again an now laid daid drunk or asleep  anyways when i kicked them they never moved then i heard a moan  it came from the room where your dad an uncle was  i went in  it was just light enough to see  your uncle jackson was layin on the floorcut half in twodaid as a door nail your dad lay on the bed  he was alive breathin his last he says that halfbreed isbelknifed uswhile we slept  the winder shutter was open  i seen where jean isbel had come in an gone out  i seen his moccasin tracks in the dirt outside an i seen where hed stepped in jacksons blood an tracked it to the winder  yu shore can see them bloody tracks yourself if yu go back to greavess store your dad was goin fast he said coltertake care of ellen an i reckon he meant a lot by that  he kept sayin my god if id only seen gaston isbel before it was too late an then he raved a little whisperin out of his haid an after that he died i woke up the men an aboot sunup we carried your dad an uncle out of town an buried them an them isbels shot at us while we were buryin our daid  thats where tad got his hurt then we hit the trail for jorths ranch an now ellen thats all my story your dad was ready to bury the hatchet with his old enemy  an that nez perce jean isbel like the sneakin savage he is murdered your uncle an your dad cut him horriblemade him suffer tortures of hellall for isbel revenge  when colters husky voice ceased ellen whispered through lips as cold and still as ice let me go  leave meheahalone  why shore  i reckon i understand replied colter  i hated to tell yu  but yu had to heah the truth aboot that halfbreed ill carry your pack in the cabin an unroll your blankets  releasing her colter strode off in the gloom  like a dead weight ellen began to slide until she slipped down full length beside the log and then she lay in the cool damp shadow inert and lifeless so far as outward physical movement was concerned  she saw nothing and felt nothing of the night the wind the cold the falling dew  for the moment or hour she was crushed by despair and seemed to see herself sinking down and down into a black bottomless pit into an abyss where murky tides of blood and furious gusts of passion contended between her body and her soul  into the stormy blast of hell  in her despair she longed she ached for death  born of infidelity cursed by a taint of evil blood further cursed by higher instinct for good and happy life dragged from one lonely and wild and sordid spot to another never knowing love or peace or joy or home left to the companionship of violent and vile men driven by a strange fate to love with unquenchable and insupportable love a halfbreed a savage an isbel the hereditary enemy of her people and at last the ruthless murderer of her fatherwhat in the name of god had she left to live for revenge  an eye for an eye  a life for a life  but she could not kill jean isbel womans love could turn to hate but not the love of ellen jorth he could drag her by the hair in the dust beat her and make her a thing to loathe and cut her mortally in his savage and implacable thirst for revengebut with her last gasp she would whisper she loved him and that she had lied to him to kill his faith  it was thathis strange faith in her puritywhich had won her love  of all men that he should be the one to recognize the truth of her the womanhood yet unsulliedhow strange how terrible how overpowering false indeed was she to the jorths  false as her mother had been to an isbel this agony and destruction of her soul was the bitter dead sea fruitthe sins of her parents visited upon her  ill end it all she whispered to the night shadows that hovered over her  no coward was sheno fear of pain or mangled flesh or death or the mysterious hereafter could ever stay her  it would be easy it would be a last thrill a transport of selfabasement and supreme selfproof of her love for jean isbel to kiss the rim rock where his feet had trod and then fling herself down into the depths  she was the last jorth  so the wronged isbels would be avenged  but he would never knownever knowi lied to him she wailed to the night wind  she was lostlost on earth and to hope of heaven  she had right neither to live nor to die  she was nothing but a little weed along the trail of life trampled upon buried in the mud  she was nothing but a single rotten thread in a tangled web of love and hate and revenge and she had broken  lower and lower she seemed to sink  was there no end to this gulf of despair  if colter had returned he would have found her a rag and a toya creature degraded fit for his vile embrace  to be thrust deeper into the mireto be punished fittingly for her betrayal of a mans noble love and her own womanhoodto be made an end of body mind and soul  but colter did not return  the wind mourned the owls hooted the leaves rustled the insects whispered their melancholy night song the campfire flickered and faded then the wild forestland seemed to close imponderably over ellen  all that she wailed in her despair all that she confessed in her abasement was true and hard as life could bebut she belonged to nature  if nature had not failed her had god failed her  it was therethe lonely land of tree and fern and flower and brook full of wild birds and beasts where the mossy rocks could speak and the solitude had ears where she had always felt herself unutterably a part of creation  thus a wavering spark of hope quivered through the blackness of her soul and gathered light  the gloom of the sky the shifting clouds of dull shade split asunder to show a glimpse of a radiant star piercingly white cold pure a steadfast eye of the universe beyond all understanding and illimitable with its meaning of the past and the present and the future  ellen watched it until the drifting clouds once more hid it from her strained sight  what had that star to do with hell  she might be crushed and destroyed by life but was there not something beyond  just to be born just to suffer just to diecould that be all  despair did not loose its hold on ellen the strife and pang of her breast did not subside  but with the long hours and the strange closing in of the forest around her and the fleeting glimpse of that wonderful star with a subtle divination of the meaning of her beating heart and throbbing mind and lastly with a voice thundering at her conscience that a mans faith in a woman must not be greater nobler than her faith in god and eternitywith these she checked the dark flight of her soul toward destruction    chapter xii  a chill gray somber dawn was breaking when ellen dragged herself into the cabin and crept under her blankets there to sleep the sleep of exhaustion  when she awoke the hour appeared to be late afternoon  sun and sky shone through the sunken and decayed roof of the old cabin  her uncle tad jorth lay upon a blanket bed upheld by a crude couch of boughs the light fell upon his face pale lined cast in a still mold of suffering  he was not dead for she heard his respiration  the floor underneath ellens blankets was bare clay  she and jorth were alone in this cabin  it contained nothing besides their beds and a rank growth of weeds along the decayed lower logs  half of the cabin had a rude ceiling of roughhewn boards which formed a kind of loft this attic extended through to the adjoining cabin forming the ceiling of the porchlike space between the two structures  there was no partition  a ladder of two aspen saplings pegged to the logs and with braces between for steps led up to the attic  ellen smelled wood smoke and the odor of frying meat and she heard the voices of men  she looked out to see that slater and somers had joined their partyan addition that might have strengthened it for defense but did not lend her own situation anything favorable  somers had always appeared the one best to avoid  colter espied her and called her to come an feed your pale face his comrades laughed not loudly but guardedly as if noise was something to avoid  nevertheless they awoke tad jorth who began to toss and moan on the bed  ellen hurried to his side and at once ascertained that he had a high fever and was in a critical condition  every time he tossed he opened a wound in his right breast rather high up  for all she could see nothing had been done for him except the binding of a scarf round his neck and under his arm  this scant bandage had worked loose  going to the door she called out  fetch me some water  when colter brought it ellen was rummaging in her pack for some clothing or towel that she could use for bandages  werent any of yu decent enough to look after my uncle she queried  huh  wal what the hell rejoined colter  we shore did all we could i reckon yu think it wasnt a tough job to pack him up the rim he was done for then an i said so  ill do all i can for him said ellen  shore  go ahaid  when i get plugged or knifed by that halfbreed i shore hope yull be round to nurse me  yu seem to be pretty shore of your fate colter  shore as hell he bit out darkly  somers saw isbel an his gang trailin us to the jorth ranch  are yu goin to stay heahan wait for them  shore ive been quarrelin with the fellars out there over that very question  im for leavin the country  but queen the damn gun fighter is daid set to kill that cowman blue who swore he was king fisher the old texas outlaw  none but queen are spoilin for another fight all the same they wont leave tad jorth heah alone  then colter leaned in at the door and whispered ellen i caint boss this outfit  so lets yu an me shake em  ive got your dads gold lets ride off tonight an shake this country  colter muttering under his breath left the door and returned to his comrades  ellen had received her first intimation of his cowardice and his mention of her fathers gold started a train of thought that persisted in spite of her efforts to put all her mind to attending her uncle  he grew conscious enough to recognize her working over him and thanked her with a look that touched ellen deeply  it changed the direction of her mind  his suffering and imminent death which she was able to alleviate and retard somewhat worked upon her pity and compassion so that she forgot her own plight  half the night she was tending him cooling his fever holding him quiet  well she realized that but for her ministrations he would have died  at length he went to sleep  and ellen sitting beside him in the lonely silent darkness of that late hour received again the intimation of nature those vague and nameless stirrings of her innermost being those whisperings out of the night and the forest and the sky  something great would not let go of her soul  she pondered  attention to the wounded man occupied ellen and soon she redoubled her activities in this regard finding in them something of protection against colter  he had waylaid her as she went to a spring for water and with a lunge like that of a bear he had tried to embrace her  but ellen had been too quick  wal are yu goin away with me he demanded  no  ill stick by my uncle she replied  that motive of hers seemed to obstruct his will  ellen was keen to see that colter and his comrades were at a last stand and disintegrating under a severe strain  nerve and courage of the open and the wild they possessed but only in a limited degree  colter seemed obsessed by his passion for her and though ellen in her stubborn pride did not yet fear him she realized she ought to  after that incident she watched closely never leaving her uncles bedside except when colter was absent  one or more of the men kept constant lookout somewhere down the canyon  day after day passed on the wings of suspense of watching of ministering to her uncle of waiting for some hour that seemed fixed  colter was like a hound upon her trail  at every turn he was there to importune her to run off with him to frighten her with the menace of the isbels to beg her to give herself to him  it came to pass that the only relief she had was when she ate with the men or barred the cabin door at night  not much relief however was there in the shut and barred door  with one thrust of his powerful arm colter could have caved it in  he knew this as well as ellen  still she did not have the fear she should have had  there was her rifle beside her and though she did not allow her mind to run darkly on its possible use still the fact of its being there at hand somehow strengthened her colter was a cat playing with a mouse but not yet sure of his quarry  ellen came to know hours when she was weakweak physically mentally spiritually morallywhen under the sheer weight of this frightful and growing burden of suspense she was not capable of fighting her misery her abasement her low ebb of vitality and at the same time wholly withstanding colters advances  he would come into the cabin and utterly indifferent to tad jorth he would try to make bold and unrestrained love to ellen  when he caught her in one of her unresisting moments and was able to hold her in his arms and kiss her he seemed to be beside himself with the wonder of her  at such moments if he had any softness or gentleness in him they expressed themselves in his sooner or later letting her go when apparently she was about to faint  so it must have become fascinatingly fixed in colters mind that at times ellen repulsed him with scorn and at others could not resist him  ellen had escaped two crises in her relation with this man and as a morbid doubt like a poisonous fungus began to strangle her mind she instinctively divined that there was an approaching and final crisis no uplift of her spirit came this timeno intimationsno whisperings how horrible it all was  to long to be good and nobleto realize that she was neitherto sink lower day by day  must she decay there like one of these rotting logs  worst of all then was the insinuating and evergrowing hopelessness  what was the use what did it matter  who would ever think of ellen jorth  o god she whispered in her distraction is there nothing leftnothing at all  a period of several days of less torment to ellen followed  her uncle apparently took a turn for the better and colter let her alone  this last circumstance nonplused ellen  she was at a loss to understand it unless the isbel menace now encroached upon colter so formidably that he had forgotten her for the present  then one bright august morning when she had just begun to relax her eternal vigilance and breathe without oppression colter encountered her and darkly silent and fierce he grasped her and drew her off her feet  ellen struggled violently but the total surprise had deprived her of strength  and that paralyzing weakness assailed her as never before  without apparent effort colter carried her striding rapidly away from the cabins into the border of spruce trees at the foot of the canyon wall  colterwhereoh where are yu takin me she found voice to cry out  by god  i dont know he replied with strong vibrant passion i was a fool not to carry yu off long ago  but i waited  i was hopin yud love me  an now that isbel gang has corralled us somers seen the halfbreed up on the rocks  an springer seen the rest of them sneakin around  i run back after my horse an yu  but uncle tad  we mustnt leave him alone cried ellen  weve got to replied colter grimly  tad shore wont worry yu no moresoon as jean isbel gets to him  oh let me stay implored ellen  i will save him  colter laughed at the utter absurdity of her appeal and claim suddenly he set her down upon her feet  stand still he ordered ellen saw his big bay horse saddled with pack and blanket tied there in the shade of a spruce  with swift hands colter untied him and mounted him scarcely moving his piercing gaze from ellen  he reached to grasp her up with yu  put your foot in the stirrup his will like his powerful arm was irresistible for ellen at that moment  she found herself swung up behind him  then the horse plunged away  what with the hard motion and colters iron grasp on her ellen was in a painful position  her knees and feet came into violent contact with branches and snags  he galloped the horse tearing through the dense thicket of willows that served to hide the entrance to the side canyon and when out in the larger and more open canyon he urged him to a run presently when colter put the horse to a slow rise of ground thereby bringing him to a walk it was just in time to save ellen a serious bruising  again the sunlight appeared to shade over they were in the pines  suddenly with backward lunge colter halted the horse  ellen heard a yell  she recognized queens voice  turn back colter  turn back  with an oath colter wheeled his mount  if i didnt run plump into them he ejaculated harshly  and scarcely had the goaded horse gotten a start when a shot rang out  ellen felt a violent shock as if her momentum had suddenly met with a check and then she felt herself wrenched from colter from the saddle and propelled into the air she alighted on soft ground and thick grass and was unhurt save for the violent wrench and shaking that had rendered her breathless  before she could rise colter was pulling at her lifting her to her feet  she saw the horse lying with bloody head  tall pines loomed all around another rifle cracked  run hissed colter and he bounded off dragging her by the hand  another yell pealed out  here we are colter  again it was queens shrill voice  ellen ran with all her might her heart in her throat her sight failing to record more than a blur of passing pines and a blank green wall of spruce  then she lost her balance was falling yet could not fall because of that steel grip on her hand and was dragged and finally carried into a dense shade she was blinded  the trees whirled and faded  voices and shots sounded far away  then something black seemed to be wiped across her feeling  it turned to gray to moving blankness to dim hazy objects spectral and tall like blanketed trees and when ellen fully recovered consciousness she was being carried through the forest  wal little one that was a close shave for yu said colters hard voice growing clearer  reckon your keelin over was natural enough  he held her lightly in both arms her head resting above his left elbow ellen saw his face as a gray blur then taking sharper outline until it stood out distinctly pale and clammy with eyes cold and wonderful in their intense flare  as she gazed upward colter turned his head to look back through the woods and his motion betrayed a keen wild vigilance  the veins of his lean brown neck stood out like whipcords two comrades were stalking beside him  ellen heard their stealthy steps and she felt colter sheer from one side or the other they were proceeding cautiously fearful of the rear but not wholly trusting to the fore  reckon wed better go slow an look before we leap said one whose voice ellen recognized as springers  shore  that open slope aint to my likin with our nez perce friend prowlin round drawled colter as he set ellen down on her feet  another of the rustlers laughed  say cant he twinkle through the forest  i had four shots at him  harder to hit than a turkey runnin crossways  this facetious speaker was the evilvisaged sardonic somers he carried two rifles and wore two belts of cartridges  ellen shore yu aint so daid white as yu was observed colter and he chucked her under the chin with familiar hand  set down heah i dont want yu stoppin any bullets  an theres no tellin  ellen was glad to comply with his wish  she had begun to recover wits and strength yet she still felt shaky  she observed that their position then was on the edge of a wellwooded slope from which she could see the grassy canyon floor below  they were on a level bench projecting out from the main canyon wall that loomed gray and rugged and pine fringed somers and cotter and springer gave careful attention to all points of the compass especially in the direction from which they had come they evidently anticipated being trailed or circled or headed off but did not manifest much concern  somers lit a cigarette springer wiped his face with a grimy hand and counted the shells in his belt which appeared to be half empty  colter stretched his long neck like a vulture and peered down the slope and through the aisles of the forest up toward the canyon rim  listen he said tersely and bent his head a little to one side ear to the slight breeze  they all listened  ellen heard the beating of her heart the rustle of leaves the tapping of a woodpecker and faint remote sounds that she could not name  deer i reckon spoke up somers  ahuh  wal i reckon they aint trailin us yet replied colter we gave them a shade better n they sent us  short an sweet

 wal mebbe but dont you fergit itthet blue was no wouldbe declared somers  he was the genuine article  i should smile affirmed springer  the subject irritated colter and he dismissed it with another forcible gesture and a counter question  how many left in that isbel outfit  no tellin  there shore was enough of them replied somers anyhow the woods was full of flyin bullets springer did you account for any of them  nopenot thet i noticed responded springer dryly  i had my chance at the halfbreed reckon i was nervous  was slater near you when he yelled out  no  he was lyin beside somers  wasnt thet a queer way fer a man to act broke in somers  a bullet hit slater cut him down the back as he was lyin flat  reckon it wasnt bad  but it hurt him so thet he jumped right up an staggered around he made a target big as a tree  an mebbe them isbels didnt riddle him  that was when i got my crack at bill isbel declared colter with grim satisfaction  when they shot my horse out from under me i had ellen to think of an couldnt get my rifle  shore had to run as yu seen  wal as i only had my sixshooter there was nothin for me to do but lay low an listen to the sping of lead  wells was standin up behind a tree about thirty yards off  he got plugged an fallin over he began to crawl my way still holdin to his rifle  i crawled along the log to meet him  but he dropped aboot halfway  i went on an took his rifle an belt  when i peeped out from behind a spruce bush then i seen bill isbel  he was shootin fast an all of them was shootin fast  that war when they had the open shot at slater wal i bored bill isbel right through his middle  he dropped his rifle an all bent double he fooled around in a circle till he flopped over the rim  i reckon hes layin right up there somewhere below that daid spruce  id shore like to see him  i wal youd be as crazy as queen if you tried thet declared somers were not out of the woods yet  i reckon not replied colter  an ive lost my horse  whered yu leave yours  theyre down the canyon below thet willow brake  an saddled an none of them tied  reckon well have to look them up before dark  colter what re we goin to do demanded springer  wait heah a whilethen cross the canyon an work round up under the bluff back to the cabin  an then what queried somers doubtfully eying colter  weve got to eatweve got to have blankets rejoined colter testily  an i reckon we can hide there an stand a better show in a fight than runnin for it in the woods  wal im givin you a hunch thet it looked like you was runnin fer it retorted somers  yes an packin the girl added springer looks funny to me  both rustlers eyed colter with dark and distrustful glances  what he might have replied never transpired for the reason that his gaze always shifting around had suddenly fixed on something  is that a wolf he asked pointing to the rim  both his comrades moved to get in line with his finger  ellen could not see from her position  shore thets a big lofer declared somers  reckon he scented us  there he goes along the rim observed colter  he doesnt act leary looks like a good sign to me  mebbe the isbels have gone the other way  looks bad to me rejoined springer gloomily  an why demanded colter  i seen thet animal  fust time i reckoned it was a lofer  second time it was right near them isbels  an im damned now if i dont believe its thet halflofer sheep dog of gass isbels  wal what if it is  ha  shore we neednt worry about hidin out replied springer sententiously  with thet dog jean isbel could trail a grasshopper  the hell yu say muttered colter  manifestly such a possibility put a different light upon the present situation  the men grew silent and watchful occupied by brooding thoughts and vigilant surveillance of all points  somers slipped off into the brush soon to return with intent look of importance  i heerd somethin he whispered jerking his thumb backward rollin gravelcrackin of twigs  no deer  reckon itd be a good idee for us to slip round acrost this bench  wal yu fellars go an ill watch heah returned colter  not much said somers while springer leered knowingly  colter became incensed but he did not give way to it  pondering a moment he finally turned to ellen  yu wait heah till i come back an if i dont come in reasonable time yu slip across the canyon an through the willows to the cabins  wait till aboot dark  with that he possessed himself of one of the extra rifles and belts and silently joined his comrades  together they noiselessly stole into the brush  ellen had no other thought than to comply with colters wishes there was her wounded uncle who had been left unattended and she was anxious to get back to him  besides if she had wanted to run off from colter where could she go  alone in the woods she would get lost and die of starvation  her lot must be cast with the jorth faction until the end that did not seem far away  her strained attention and suspense made the moments fly  by and by several shots pealed out far across the side canyon on her right and they were answered by reports sounding closer to her  the fight was on again  but these shots were not repeated  the flies buzzed the hot sun beat down and sloped to the west the soft warm breeze stirred the aspens the ravens croaked the red squirrels and blue jays chattered  suddenly a quick short yelp electrified ellen brought her upright with sharp listening rigidity  surely it was not a wolf and hardly could it be a coyote  again she heard it  the yelp of a sheep dog she had heard that often enough to know  and she rose to change her position so she could command a view of the rocky bluff above presently she espied what really appeared to be a big timber wolf  but another yelp satisfied her that it really was a dog  she watched him soon it became evident that he wanted to get down over the bluff  he ran to and fro and then out of sight  in a few moments his yelp sounded from lower down at the base of the bluff and it was now the cry of an intelligent dog that was trying to call some one to his aid ellen grew convinced that the dog was near where colter had said bill isbel had plunged over the declivity  would the dog yelp that way if the man was dead  ellen thought not  no one came and the continuous yelping of the dog got on ellens nerves it was a call for help  and finally she surrendered to it since her natural terror when colters horse was shot from under her and she had been dragged away she had not recovered from fear of the isbels  but calm consideration now convinced her that she could hardly be in a worse plight in their hands than if she remained in colters so she started out to find the dog  the wooded bench was level for a few hundred yards and then it began to heave in rugged rocky bulges up toward the rim  it did not appear far to where the dog was barking but the latter part of the distance proved to be a hard climb over jumbled rocks and through thick brush panting and hot she at length reached the base of the bluff to find that it was not very high  the dog espied her before she saw him for he was coming toward her when she discovered him  big shaggy grayish white and black with wild keen face and eyes he assuredly looked the reputation springer had accorded him  but sagacious guarded as was his approach he appeared friendly  hellodoggie panted ellen whatswrongup heah  he yelped his ears lost their stiffness his body sank a little and his bushy tail wagged to and fro  what a gray clear intelligent look he gave her  then he trotted back  ellen followed him around a corner of bluff to see the body of a man lying on his back  fresh earth and gravel lay about him attesting to his fall from above  he had on neither coat nor hat and the position of his body and limbs suggested broken bones  as ellen hurried to his side she saw that the front of his shirt low down was a bloody blotch but he could lift his head his eyes were open he was perfectly conscious  ellen did not recognize the dusty skinned face yet the mold of features the look of the eyes seemed strangely familiar  yourejorthsgirl he said in faint voice of surprise  yes im ellen jorth she replied  an are yu bill isbel  all thets left of me  but im thankin god somebody comeeven a jorth  ellen knelt beside him and examined the wound in his abdomen a heavy bullet had indeed as colter had avowed torn clear through his middle even if he had not sustained other serious injury from the fall over the cliff that terrible bullet wound meant death very shortly  ellen shuddered  how inexplicable were men  how cruel bloody mindless  isbel im sorrytheres no hope she said low voiced  yuve not long to live  i caint help yu  god knows id do so if i could  all over he sighed with his eyes looking beyond her i reckonim glad but yu cando somethin for or me  will yu  indeed yes  tell me she replied lifting his dusty head on her knee her hands trembled as she brushed his wet hair back from his clammy brow  ive somethinon my conscience he whispered  the woman the sensitive in ellen understood and pitied him then  yes she encouraged him  i stole cattlemy dads an blaisdellsan made dealswith daggs all the crookednesswasnt onjorths side i wantmy brother jeanto know  ill tryto tell him whispered ellen out of her great amaze  we were alla bad lotexcept jean went

your brother murdered my dad  what whispered bill isbel  shore yuve gotit wrong  i reckon jeancould have killedyour father but he didnt  queer we all thought  ah  who did kill my father burst out ellen and her voice rang like great hammers at her ears  it was blue  he went in the storealonefaced the whole gang alone bluffed themtaunted themtold them he was king fisher then he killedyour dadan jackson jorth jean was outback of the store  we were outfront  there was shootin  colmor was hit then blue ran outbad hurt both of themdied in meekers yard  an so jean isbel has not killed a jorth said ellen in strange deep voice  no replied isbel earnestly  i reckon this feudwas hardest on jean  he never lived heah an my sister ann saidhe got sweet on yu now did he  slow stinging tears filled ellens eyes and her head sank low and lower  yeshe did she murmured tremulously  ahuh  wal thet accounts replied isbel wonderingly  too bad  it might have been a man always seesdifferent whenhes dyin if i hadmy lifeto live over again  my poor kidsdeserted in their babyhoodruined for life  all for nothin may god forgive  then he choked and whispered for water  ellen laid his head back and rising she took his sombrero and started hurriedly down the slope making dust fly and rocks roll  her mind was a seething ferment  leaping bounding sliding down the weathered slope she gained the bench to run across that and so on down into the open canyon to the willowbordered brook  here she filled the sombrero with water and started back forced now to walk slowly and carefully  it was then with the violence and fury of intense muscular activity denied her that the tremendous import of bill isbels revelation burst upon her very flesh and blood and transfiguring the very world of golden light and azure sky and speaking forestland that encompassed her  not a drop of the precious water did she spill  not a misstep did she make  yet so great was the spell upon her that she was not aware she had climbed the steep slope until the dog yelped his welcome  then with all the flood of her emotion surging and resurging she knelt to allay the parching thirst of this dying enemy whose words had changed frailty to strength hate to love and the gloomy hell of despair to something unutterable  but she had returned too late  bill isbel was dead    chapter xiii  jean isbel holding the wolfdog shepp in leash was on the trail of the most dangerous of jorths gang the gunman queen  dark drops of blood on the stones and plain tracks of a riders sharpheeled boots behind coverts indicated the trail of a wounded slowtraveling fugitive  therefore jean isbel held in the dog and proceeded with the wary eye and watchful caution of an indian  queen true to his class and emulating blue with the same magnificent effrontery and with the same paralyzing suddenness of surprise had appeared as if by magic at the last night camp of the isbel faction jean had seen him first in time to leap like a panther into the shadow but he carried in his shoulder queens first bullet of that terrible encounter  upon gordon and fredericks fell the brunt of queens fusillade  and they shot to pieces staggering and falling held passionate grip on life long enough to draw and still queens guns and send him reeling off into the darkness of the forest  unarmed and hindered by a painful wound jean had kept a vigil near camp all that silent and menacing night  morning disclosed gordon and fredericks stark and ghastly beside the burnedout campfire their guns clutched immovably in stiffened hands  jean buried them as best he could and when they were under ground with flat stones on their graves he knew himself to be indeed the last of the isbel clan  and all that was wild and savage in his blood and desperate in his spirit rose to make him more than man and less than human  then for the third time during these tragic last days the wolfdog shepp came to him  jean washed the wound queen had given him and bound it tightly the keen pang and burn of the lead was a constant and allpowerful reminder of the grim work left for him to do  the whole world was no longer large enough for him and whoever was left of the jorths  the heritage of blood his father had bequeathed him the unshakable love for a worthless girl who had so dwarfed and obstructed his will and so bitterly defeated and reviled his poor romantic boyish faith the killing of hostile men so strange in its after effects the pursuits and fights and loss of one by one of his confederatesthese had finally engendered in jean isbel a wild unslakable thirst these had been the cause of his retrogression these had unalterably and ruthlessly fixed in his darkened mind one fierce passionto live and die the last man of that jorthisbel feud  at sunrise jean left this camp taking with him only a small knapsack of meat and bread and with the eager wild shepp in leash he set out on queens bloody trail  black drops of blood on the stones and an irregular trail of footprints proved to jean that the gunman was hard hit  here he had fallen or knelt or sat down evidently to bind his wounds  jean found strips of scarf red and discarded  and the blood drops failed to show on more rocks  in a deep forest of spruce under silvertipped spreading branches queen had rested perhaps slept  then laboring with dragging steps not improbably with a lame leg he had gone on up out of the darkgreen ravine to the open dry pinetipped ridge  here he had rested perhaps waited to see if he were pursued  from that point his trail spoke an easy language for jeans keen eye  the gunman knew he was pursued  he had seen his enemy  therefore jean proceeded with a slow caution never getting within revolver range of ambush using all his woodcraft to trail this man and yet save himself  queen traveled slowly either because he was wounded or else because he tried to ambush his pursuer and jean accommodated his pace to that of queen from noon of that day they were never far apart never out of hearing of a rifle shot  the contrast of the beauty and peace and loneliness of the surroundings to the nature of queens flight often obtruded its strange truth into the somber turbulence of jeans mind into that fixed columnar idea around which fleeting thoughts hovered and gathered like shadows  early frost had touched the heights with its magic wand  and the forest seemed a temple in which man might worship nature and life rather than steal through the dells and under the arched aisles like a beast of prey the greenandgold leaves of aspens quivered in the glades maples in the ravines fluttered their redandpurple leaves the needlematted carpet under the pines vied with the long lanes of silvery grass alike enticing to the eye of man and beast  sunny rays of light flecked with dust and flying insects slanted down from the overhanging brownlimbed greenmassed foliage  roar of wind in the distant forest alternated with soft breeze close at hand  small dovegray squirrels ran all over the woodland very curious about jean and his dog rustling the twigs scratching the bark of trees chattering and barking frisky saucy and brighteyed  a plaintive twitter of wild canaries came from the region above the treetopsfirst voices of birds in their pilgrimage toward the south  pine cones dropped with soft thuds  the blue jays followed these intruders in the forest screeching their displeasure like rain pattered the dropping seeds from the spruces  a woody earthy leafy fragrance damp with the current of life mingled with a cool dry sweet smell of withered grass and rotting pines  solitude and lonesomeness peace and rest wild life and nature reigned there  it was a goldengreen region enchanting to the gaze of man  an indian would have walked there with his spirits  and even as jean felt all this elevating beauty and inscrutable spirit his keen eye once more fastened upon the bloodred drops queen had again left on the gray moss and rock  his wound had reopened jean felt the thrill of the scenting panther  the sun set twilight gathered night fell  jean crawled under a dense lowspreading spruce ate some bread and meat fed the dog and lay down to rest and sleep  his thoughts burdened him heavy and black as the mantle of night  a wolf mourned a hungry cry for a mate  shepp quivered under jeans hand  that was the call which had lured him from the ranch the wolf blood in him yearned for the wild  jean tied the cowhide leash to his wrist  when this dark business was at an end shepp could be free to join the lonely mate mourning out there in the forest  then jean slept  dawn broke cold clear frosty with silvered grass sparkling with a soft faint rustling of falling aspen leaves  when the sun rose red jean was again on the trail of queen  by a frostyferned brook where water tinkled and ran clear as air and cold as ice jean quenched his thirst leaning on a stone that showed drops of blood  queen too had to quench his thirst  what good what help jean wondered could the cold sweet granite water so dear to woodsmen and wild creatures do this wounded hunted rustler  why did he not wait in the open to fight and face the death he had meted  where was that splendid and terrible daring of the gunman  queens love of life dragged him on and on hour by hour through the pine groves and spruce woods through the oak swales and aspen glades up and down the rocky gorges around the windfalls and over the rotting logs  the time came when queen tried no more ambush  he gave up trying to trap his pursuer by lying in wait  he gave up trying to conceal his tracks  he grew stronger or in desperation increased his energy so that he redoubled his progress through the wilderness  that at best would count only a few miles a day  and he began to circle to the northwest back toward the deep canyon where blaisdell and bill isbel had reached the end of their trails  queen had evidently left his comrades had lonehanded it in his last fight but was now trying to get back to them  somewhere in these wild deep forest brakes the rest of the jorth faction had found a hiding place  jean let queen lead him there  ellen jorth would be with them  jean had seen her  it had been his shot that killed colters horse  and he had withheld further fire because colter had dragged the girl behind him protecting his body with hers  sooner or later jean would come upon their camp  she would be there  the thought of her dark beauty wasted in wantonness upon these rustlers added a deadly rage to the blood lust and righteous wrath of his vengeance  let her again flaunt her degradation in his face and by the god she had forsaken he would kill her and so end the race of jorths  another night fell dark and cold without starlight  the wind moaned in the forest  shepp was restless  he sniffed the air  there was a step on his trail  again a mournful eager wild and hungry wolf cry broke the silence  it was deep and low like that of a baying hound but infinitely wilder  shepp strained to get away  during the night while jean slept he managed to chew the cowhide leash apart and run off  next day no dog was needed to trail queen  fog and lowdrifting clouds in the forest and a misty rain had put the rustler off his bearings he was lost and showed that he realized it  strange how a matured man fighter of a hundred battles steeped in bloodshed and on his last stand should grow panicstricken upon being lost  so jean isbel read the signs of the trail  queen circled and wandered through the foggy dripping forest until he headed down into a canyon  it was one that notched the rim and led down and down mile after mile into the basin  not soon had queen discovered his mistake  when he did do so night overtook him  the weather cleared before morning  red and bright the sun burst out of the east to flood that low basin land with light  jean found that queen had traveled on and on hoping no doubt to regain what he had lost  but in the darkness he had climbed to the manzanita slopes instead of back up the canyon  and here he had fought the hold of that strange brush of spanish name until he fell exhausted  surely queen would make his stand and wait somewhere in this devilish thicket for jean to catch up with him  many and many a place jean would have chosen had he been in queens place  many a rock and dense thicket jean circled or approached with extreme care  manzanita grew in patches that were impenetrable except for a small animal  the brush was a few feet high seldom so high that jean could not look over it and of a beautiful appearance having glossy small leaves a golden berry and branches of darkred color  these branches were tough and unbendable every bush almost had low branches that were dead hard as steel sharp as thorns as clutching as cactus  progress was possible only by endless detours to find the halfclosed aisles between patches or else by crashing through with main strength or walking right over the tops  jean preferred this last method not because it was the easiest but for the reason that he could see ahead so much farther so he literally walked across the tips of the manzanita brush often he fell through and had to step up again many a branch broke with him letting him down but for the most part he stepped from fork to fork on branch after branch with balance of an indian and the patience of a man whose purpose was sustaining and immutable  on that south slope under the rim the sun beat down hot  there was no breeze to temper the dry air  and before midday jean was laboring wet with sweat parching with thirst dusty and hot and tiring it amazed him the doggedness and tenacity of life shown by this wounded rustler the time came when under the burning rays of the sun he was compelled to abandon the walk across the tips of the manzanita bushes and take to the winding open threads that ran between  it would have been poor sight indeed that could not have followed queens labyrinthine and broken passage through the brush  then the time came when jean espied queen far ahead and above crawling like a black bug along the brightgreen slope  sight then acted upon jean as upon a hound in the chase  but he governed his actions if he could not govern his instincts  slowly but surely he followed the dusty hot trail and never a patch of blood failed to send a thrill along his veins  queen headed up toward the rim finally vanished from sight  had he fallen  was he hiding  but the hour disclosed that he was crawling jeans keen eye caught the slow moving of the brush and enabled him to keep just so close to the rustler out of range of the sixshooters he carried  and so all the interminable hours of the hot afternoon that snailpace flight and pursuit kept on  halfway up the rim the growth of manzanita gave place to open yellow rocky slope dotted with cedars  queen took to a slowascending ridge and left his bloody tracks all the way to the top where in the gathering darkness the weary pursuer lost them  another night passed  daylight was relentless to the rustler  he could not hide his trail  but somehow in a desperate last rally of strength he reached a point on the heavily timbered ridge that jean recognized as being near the scene of the fight in the canyon  queen was nearing the rendezvous of the rustlers  jean crossed tracks of horses and then more tracks that he was certain had been made days past by his own party to the left of this ridge must be the deep canyon that had frustrated his efforts to catch up with the rustlers on the day blaisdell lost his life and probably bill isbel too something warned jean that he was nearing the end of the trail and an unaccountable sense of imminent catastrophe seemed foreshadowed by vague dreads and doubts in his gloomy mind  jean felt the need of rest of food of ease from the strain of the last weeks  but his spirit drove him implacably  queens rally of strength ended at the edge of an open bald ridge that was bare of brush or grass and was surrounded by a line of forest on three sides and on the fourth by a low bluff which raised its gray head above the pines  across this dusty open queen had crawled leaving unmistakable signs of his condition  jean took long survey of the circle of trees and of the low rocky eminence neither of which he liked  it might be wiser to keep to cover jean thought and work around to where queens trail entered the forest again  but he was tired gloomy and his eternal vigilance was failing  nevertheless he stilled for the thousandth time that bold prompting of his vengeance and taking to the edge of the forest he went to considerable pains to circle the open ground  and suddenly sight of a man sitting back against a tree halted jean  he stared to make sure his eyes did not deceive him  many times stumps and snags and rocks had taken on strange resemblance to a standing or crouching man  this was only another suggestive blunder of the mind behind his eyeswhat he wanted to see he imagined he saw  jean glided on from tree to tree until he made sure that this sitting image indeed was that of a man  he sat bolt upright facing back across the open hands resting on his kneesand closer scrutiny showed jean that he held a gun in each hand  queen  at the last his nerve had revived  he could not crawl any farther he could never escape so with the courage of fatality he chose the open to face his foe and die  jean had a thrill of admiration for the rustler  then he stalked out from under the pines and strode forward with his rifle ready  a watching man could not have failed to espy jean  but queen never made the slightest move  moreover his stiff unnatural position struck jean so singularly that he halted with a muttered exclamation he was now about fifty paces from queen within range of those small guns  jean called sharply queen still the figure never relaxed in the slightest  jean advanced a few more paces rifle up ready to fire the instant queen lifted a gun  the mans immobility brought the cold sweat to jeans brow  he stopped to bend the full intense power of his gaze upon this inert figure  suddenly over jean flashed its meaning queen was dead  he had backed up against the pine ready to face his foe and he had died there  not a shadow of a doubt entered jeans mind as he started forward again  he knew  after all queens blood would not be on his hands  gordon and fredericks in their death throes had given the rustler mortal wounds  jean kept on marveling the while how ghastly thin and hard  those four days of flight had been hell for queen  jean reached himlooked down with staring eyes  the guns were tied to his hands  jean started violently as the whole direction of his mind shifted  a lightning glance showed that queen had been propped against the treeanother showed boot tracks in the dust  by heaven theyve fooled me hissed jean and quickly as he leaped behind the pine he was not quick enough to escape the cunning rustlers who had waylaid him thus  he felt the shock the bite and burn of lead before he heard a rifle crack  a bullet had ripped through his left forearm  from behind the tree he saw a puff of white smoke along the face of the bluffthe very spot his keen and gloomy vigilance had descried as one of menace  then several puffs of white smoke and ringing reports betrayed the ambush of the tricksters  bullets barked the pine and whistled by  jean saw a man dart from behind a rock and leaning over run for another  jeans swift shot stopped him midway he fell got up and floundered behind a bush scarcely large enough to conceal him  into that bush jean shot again and again  he had no pain in his wounded arm but the sense of the shock clung in his consciousness and this with the tremendous surprise of the deceit and sudden release of longdammed overmastering passion caused him to empty the magazine of his winchester in a terrible haste to kill the man he had hit  these were all the loads he had for his rifle  blood passion had made him blunder  jean cursed himself and his hand moved to his belt  his sixshooter was gone  the sheath had been loose  he had tied the gun fast  but the strings had been torn apart  the rustlers were shooting again  bullets thudded into the pine and whistled by  bending carefully jean reached one of queens guns and jerked it from his hand the weapon was empty  both of his guns were empty  jean peeped out again to get the line in which the bullets were coming and marking a course from his position to the cover of the forest he ran with all his might  he gained the shelter  shrill yells behind warned him that he had been seen that his reason for flight had been guessed  looking back he saw two or three men scrambling down the bluff  then the loud neigh of a frightened horse pealed out  jean discarded his useless rifle and headed down the ridge slope keeping to the thickest line of pines and sheering around the clumps of spruce  as he ran his mind whirled with grim thoughts of escape of his necessity to find the camp where gordon and fredericks were buried there to procure another rifle and ammunition  he felt the wet blood dripping down his arm yet no pain  the forest was too open for good cover  he dared not run uphill  his only course was ahead and that soon ended in an abrupt declivity too precipitous to descend as he halted panting for breath he heard the ring of hoofs on stone then the thudding beat of running horses on soft ground  the rustlers had sighted the direction he had taken  jean did not waste time to look indeed there was no need for as he bounded along the cliff to the right a rifle cracked and a bullet whizzed over his head  it lent wings to his feet  like a deer he sped along leaping cracks and logs and rocks his ears filled by the rush of wind until his quick eye caught sight of thickgrowing spruce foliage close to the precipice he sprang down into the green mass  his weight precipitated him through the upper branches  but lower down his spread arms broke his fall then retarded it until he caught  a long swaying limb let him down and down where he grasped another and a stiffer one that held his weight hand over hand he worked toward the trunk of this spruce and gaining it he found other branches close together down which he hastened hold by hold and step by step until all above him was black dense foliage and beneath him the brown shady slope  sure of being unseen from above he glided noiselessly down under the trees slowly regaining freedom from that constriction of his breast  passing on to a graylichened cliff overhanging and gloomy he paused there to rest and to listen  a faint crack of hoof on stone came to him from above apparently farther on to the right  eventually his pursuers would discover that he had taken to the canyon  but for the moment he felt safe  the wound in his forearm drew his attention the bullet had gone clear through without breaking either bone his shirt sleeve was soaked  with blood  jean rolled it back and tightly wrapped his scarf around the wound yet still the darkred blood oozed out and dripped down into his hand  he became aware of a dull throbbing pain  not much time did jean waste in arriving at what was best to do for the time being he had escaped and whatever had been his peril it was past  in dense rugged country like this he could not be caught by rustlers  but he had only a knife left for a weapon and there was very little meat in the pocket of his coat  salt and matches he possessed  therefore the imperative need was for him to find the last camp where he could get rifle and ammunition bake bread and rest up before taking again the trail of the rustlers  he had reason to believe that this canyon was the one where the fight on the rim and later on a bench of woodland below had taken place  thereupon he arose and glided down under the spruces toward the level grassy open he could see between the trees  and as he proceeded with the slow step and wary eye of an indian his mind was busy  queen had in his flight unerringly worked in the direction of this canyon until he became lost in the fog and upon regaining his bearings he had made a wonderful and heroic effort to surmount the manzanita slope and the rim and find the rendezvous of his comrades  but he had failed up there on the ridge  in thinking it over jean arrived at a conclusion that queen finding he could go no farther had waited guns in hands for his pursuer  and he had died in this position then by strange coincidence his comrades had happened to come across him and recognizing the situation they had taken the shells from his guns and propped him up with the idea of luring jean on  they had arranged a cunning trick and ambush which had all but snuffed out the last of the isbels  colter probably had been at the bottom of this crafty plan since the fight at the isbel ranch now seemingly far back in the past this man colter had loomed up more and more as a stronger and more dangerous antagonist then either jorth or daggs before that he had been little known to any of the isbel faction and it was colter now who controlled the remnant of the gang and who had ellen jorth in his possession  the canyon wall above jean on the right grew more rugged and loftier and the one on the left began to show wooded slopes and brakes and at last a wide expanse with a winding willow border on the west and a long low pinedotted bench on the east  it took several moments of study for jean to recognize the rugged bluff above this bench  on up that canyon several miles was the site where queen had surprised jean and his comrades at their campfire  somewhere in this vicinity was the hiding place of the rustlers  thereupon jean proceeded with the utmost stealth absolutely certain that he would miss no sound movement sign or anything unnatural to the wild peace of the canyon  and his first sense to register something was his keen smell  sheep  he was amazed to smell sheep there must be a flock not far away  then from where he glided along under the trees he saw down to open places in the willow brake and noticed sheep tracks in the dark muddy bank of the brook  next he heard faint tinkle of bells and at length when he could see farther into the open enlargement of the canyon his surprised gaze fell upon an immense gray woolly patch that blotted out acres and acres of grass  thousands of sheep were grazing there  jean knew there were several flocks of jorths sheep on the mountain in the care of herders but he had never thought of them being so far west more than twenty miles from chevelon canyon  his roving eyes could not descry any herders or dogs but he knew there must be dogs close to that immense flock  and whatever his cunning he could not hope to elude the scent and sight of shepherd dogs  it would be best to go back the way he had come wait for darkness then cross the canyon and climb out and work around to his objective point  turning at once he started to glide back but almost immediately he was brought stockstill and thrilling by the sound of hoofs  horses were coming in the direction he wished to take  they were close his swift conclusion was that the men who had pursued him up on the rim had worked down into the canyon  one circling glance showed him that he had no sure covert near at hand  it would not do to risk their passing him there  the border of woodland was narrow and not dense enough for close inspection  he was forced to turn back up the canyon in the hope of soon finding a hiding place or a break in the wall where he could climb up  hugging the base of the wall he slipped on passing the point where he had espied the sheep and gliding on until he was stopped by a bend in the dense line of willows  it sheered to the west there and ran close to the high wall  jean kept on until he was stooping under a curling border of willow thicket with branches slim and yellow and masses of green foliage that brushed against the wall  suddenly he encountered an abrupt corner of rock  he rounded it to discover that it ran at right angles with the one he had just passed  peering up through the willows he ascertained that there was a narrow crack in the main wall of the canyon  it had been concealed by willows low down and leaning spruces above  a wild hidden retreat  along the base of the wall there were tracks of small animals  the place was odorous like all dense thickets but it was not dry  water ran through there somewhere jean drew easier breath  all sounds except the rustling of birds or mice in the willows had ceased  the brake was pervaded by a dreamy emptiness  jean decided to steal on a little farther then wait till he felt he might safely dare go back  the goldengreen gloom suddenly brightened  light showed ahead and parting the willows he looked out into a narrow winding canyon with an open grassy willowstreaked lane in the center and on each side a thin strip of woodland  his surprise was short lived  a crashing of horses back of him in the willows gave him a shock  he ran out along the base of the wall back of the trees  like the strip of woodland in the main canyon this one was scant and had but little underbrush  there were young spruces growing with thick branches clear to the grass and under these he could have concealed himself  but with a certainty of sheep dogs in the vicinity he would not think of hiding except as a last resource these horsemen whoever they were were as likely to be sheep herders as not  jean slackened his pace to look back  he could not see any moving objects but he still heard horses though not so close now ahead of him this narrow gorge opened out like the neck of a bottle he would run on to the head of it and find a place to climb to the top  hurried and anxious as jean was he yet received an impression of singular wild nature of this side gorge  it was a hidden pinefringed crack in the rockribbed and canyoncut tableland  above him the sky seemed a winding stream of blue  the walls were red and bulged out in sprucegreened shelves  from wall to wall was scarcely a distance of a hundred feet  jumbles of rock obstructed his close holding to the wall he had to walk at the edge of the timber  as he progressed the gorge widened into wilder ruggeder aspect  through the trees ahead he saw where the wall circled to meet the cliff on the left forming an oval depression the nature of which he could not ascertain  but it appeared to be a small opening surrounded by dense thickets and the overhanging walls  anxiety augmented to alarm  he might not be able to find a place to scale those rough cliffs breathing hard jean halted again the situation was growing critical again  his physical condition was worse  loss of sleep and rest lack of food the long pursuit of queen the wound in his arm and the desperate run for his lifethese had weakened him to the extent that if he undertook any strenuous effort he would fail  his cunning weighed all chances  the shade of wall and foliage above and another jumble of ruined cliff hindered his survey of the ground ahead and he almost stumbled upon a cabin hidden on three sides with a small bare clearing in front it was an old ramshackle structure like others he had run across in the canons  cautiously he approached and peeped around the corner at first swift glance it had all the appearance of long disuse but jean had no time for another look  a clipclop of trotting horses on hard ground brought the same pellmell rush of sensations that had driven him to wild flight scarcely an hour past  his body jerked with its instinctive impulse then quivered with his restraint  to turn back would be risky to run ahead would be fatal to hide was his one hope  no covert behind  and the clipclop of hoofs sounded closer one moment longer jean held mastery over his instincts of selfpreservation  to keep from running was almost impossible it was the sheer primitive animal sense to escape  he drove it back and glided along the front of the cabin  here he saw that the cabin adjoined another  reaching the door he was about to peep in when the thud of hoofs and voices close at hand transfixed him with a grim certainty that he had not an instant to lose through the thin blackstreaked line of trees he saw moving red objects horses  he must run  passing the door his keen nose caught a musty woody odor and the tail of his eye saw bare dirt floor  this cabin was unused  he haltedgave a quick look back  and the first thing his eye fell upon was a ladder right inside the door against the wall he looked up  it led to a loft that dark and gloomy stretched halfway across the cabin  an irresistible impulse drove jean  slipping inside he climbed up the ladder to the loft  it was like night up there  but he crawled on the roughhewn rafters and turning with his head toward the opening he stretched out and lay still  what seemed an interminable moment ended with a trample of hoofs outside the cabin  it ceased  jeans vibrating ears caught the jingle of spurs and a thud of boots striking the ground  wal sweetheart heah we are home again drawled a slow cool mocking texas voice  home  i wonder colterdid yu ever have a homea mothera sistermuch less a sweetheart was the reply bitter and caustic  jeans palpitating hot body suddenly stretched still and cold with intensity of shock  his very bones seemed to quiver and stiffen into ice during the instant of realization his heart stopped  and a slow contracting pressure enveloped his breast and moved up to constrict his throat   that womans voice belonged to ellen jorth  the sound of it had lingered in his dreams  he had stumbled upon the rendezvous of the jorth faction  hard indeed had been the fates meted out to those of the isbels and jorths who had passed to their deaths  but no ordeal not even queens could compare with this desperate one jean must endure he had loved ellen jorth strangely wonderfully and he had scorned repute to believe her good  he had spared her father and her uncle he had weakened or lost the cause of the isbels  he loved her now desperately deathlessly knowing from her own lips that she was worthlessloved her the more because he had felt her terrible shame and to himthe last of the isbelshad come the cruelest of doomsto be caught like a crippled rat in a trap to be compelled to lie helpless wounded without a gun to listen and perhaps to see ellen jorth enact the very truth of her mocking insinuation  his will his promise his creed his blood must hold him to the stem decree that he should be the last man of the jorthisbel war  but could he lie there to hearto seewhen he had a knife and an arm    chapter xiv  then followed the leathery flop of saddles to the soft turf and the stamp of loosened horses  jean heard a noise at the cabin door a rustle and then a knock of something hard against wood  silently he moved his head to look down through a crack between the rafters  he saw the glint of a rifle leaning against the sill  then the doorstep was darkened  ellen jorth sat down with a long tired sigh  she took off her sombrero and the light shone on the rippling darkbrown hair hanging in a tangled braid the curved nape of her neck showed a warm tint of golden tan she wore a gray blouse soiled and torn that clung to her lissome shoulders  colter what are yu goin to do she asked suddenly  her voice carried something jean did not remember  it thrilled into the icy fixity of his senses  well stay heah was the response and it was followed by a clinking step of spurred boot  shore i wont stay heah declared ellen  it makes me sick when i think of how uncle tad died in there alonehelplesssufferin the place seems haunted  wal ill agree that its tough on yu  but what the hell can we do  a long silence ensued which ellen did not break  somethin has come off round heah since early mawnin declared colter somers an springer havent got back  an antonios gone now honest ellen didnt yu heah rifle shots off somewhere  i reckon i did she responded gloomily  an which way  sounded to me up on the bluff back pretty far  wal shore thats my idee  an it makes me think hard  yu know somers come across the last camp of the isbels  an he dug into a grave to find the bodies of jim gordon an another man he didnt know queen kept good his brag  he braced that isbel gang an killed those fellars  but either him or jean isbel went off leavin bloody tracks if it was queens yu can bet isbel was after him  an if it was isbels tracks why shore queen would stick to them  somers an springer couldnt follow the trail  theyre shore not much good at trackin  but for days theyve been ridin the woods hopin to run across queen wal now mebbe they run across isbel instead  an if they did an got away from him theyll be heah sooner or later  if isbel was too many for them hed hunt for my trail  im gamblin that either queen or jean isbel is daid  im hopin its isbel  because if he aint daid hes the last of the isbels an mebbe im the last of jorths gang shore im not hankerin to meet the halfbreed thats why i say well stay heah  this is as good a hidin place as there is in the country  weve grub  theres water an grass  mestay heah with yualone  the tone seemed a contradiction to the apparently accepted sense of her words  jean held his breath  but he could not still the slowly mounting and accelerating faculties within that were involuntarily rising to meet some strange nameless import  he felt it  he imagined it would be the catastrophe of ellen jorths calm acceptance of colters proposition  but down in jeans miserable heart lived something that would not die  no mere words could kill it  how poignant that moment of her silence  how terribly he realized that if his intelligence and his emotion had believed her betraying words his soul had not  but ellen jorth did not speak  her brown head hung thoughtfully her supple shoulders sagged a little  ellen whats happened to yu went on colter  all the misery possible to a woman she replied dejectedly  shore i dont mean that way he continued persuasively  i aint gainsayin the hard facts of your life  its been bad  your dad was no good but i mean i cant figger the change in yu  no i reckon yu caint she said  whoever was responsible for your makeup left out a mindnot to say feeling  colter drawled a low laugh  wal have that your own way  but how much longer are yu goin to be like this heah  like what she rejoined sharply  wal this standoffishness of yours  colter i told yu to let me alone she said sullenly  shore  an yu did that before  but this time yure different an wal im gettin tired of it  here the cool slow voice of the texan sounded an inflexibility before absent a timber that hinted of illimitable power  ellen jorth shrugged her lithe shoulders and slowly rising she picked up the little rifle and turned to step into the cabin  colter she said fetch my pack an my blankets in heah  shore he returned with good nature  jean saw ellen jorth lay the rifle lengthwise in a chink between two logs and then slowly turn back to the wall  jean knew her then yet did not know her  the brown flash of her face seemed that of an older graver woman  his strained gaze like his waiting mind had expected something he knew not whata hardened face a ghost of beauty a recklessness a distorted bitter lost expression in keeping with her fortunes  but he had reckoned falsely  she did not look like that there was incalculable change but the beauty remained somehow different  her red lips were parted  her brooding eyes looking out straight from under the level dark brows seemed sloe black and wonderful with their steady passionate light  jean in his eager hungry devouring of the beloved face did not on the first instant grasp the significance of its expression  he was seeing the features that had haunted him  but quickly he interpreted her expression as the somber hunted look of a woman who would bear no more  under the torn blouse her full breast heaved  she held her hands clenched at her sides  she was listening waiting for that jangling slow step  it came and with the sound she subtly changed she was a woman hiding her true feelings  she relaxed and that strong dark look of fury seemed to fade back into her eyes  colter appeared at the door carrying a roll of blankets and a pack  throw them heah she said  i reckon yu neednt bother coming in  that angered the man  with one long stride he stepped over the doorsill down into the cabin and flung the blankets at her feet and then the pack after it  whereupon he deliberately sat down in the door facing her with one hand he slid off his sombrero which fell outside and with the other he reached in his upper vest pocket for the little bag of tobacco that showed there  all the time he looked at her  by the light now unobstructed jean descried colters face and sight of it then sounded the roll and drum of his passions  wal ellen i reckon well have it out right now an heah he said and with tobacco in one hand paper in the other he began the operations of making a cigarette  however he scarcely removed his glance from her  yes queried ellen jorth  im goin to have things the way they were beforean more he declared  the cigarette paper shook in his fingers  what do yu mean she demanded  yu know what i mean he retorted  voice and action were subtly unhinging this mans control over himself  maybe i dont  i reckon yud better talk plain  the rustler had clear grayyellow eyes flawless like crystal and suddenly they danced with little fiery flecks  the last time i laid my hand on yu i got hit for my pains an shore thats been ranklin  colter yull get hit again if yu put your hands on me she said dark straight glance on him  a frown wrinkled the level brows  yu mean that he asked thickly  i shore do  manifestly he accepted her assertion  something of incredulity and bewilderment that had vied with his resentment utterly disappeared from his face  heah ive been waitin for yu to love me he declared with a gesture not without dignified emotion  your givin in without that wasnt so much to me  and at these words of the rustlers jean isbel felt an icy sickening shudder creep into his soul  he shut his eyes  the end of his dream had been long in coming but at last it had arrived  a mocking voice like a hollow wind echoed through that regionthat lonely and ghostlike hall of his heart which had harbored faith  she burst into speech louder and sharper the first words of which jeans strangely throbbing ears did not distinguish    you  i never gave in to yu an i never will  but girli kissed yuhugged yuhandled yu he expostulated and the making of the cigarette ceased  yes yu didyu brutewhen i was so downhearted and weak i couldnt lift my hand she flashed  ahuh  yu mean i couldnt do that now  i should smile i do jim colter she replied  wal mebbeill seepresently he went on straining with words but im shore curious daggs thenhe was nothin to yu  no more than yu she said morbidly  he used to run after melong ago it seems i was only a girl theninnocentan id not known any but rough men  i couldnt all the timeevery day every hourkeep him at arms length  sometimes before i knewi didnt care i was a child  a kiss meant nothing to me  but after i knew  ellen dropped her head in brooding silence  say do yu expect me to believe that he queried with a derisive leer  bah  what do i care what yu believe she cried with lifting head  how aboot simm brace  that coyote  he lied aboot me jim colter  and any man half a man would have known he lied  wal simm always bragged aboot yu bein his girl asserted colter an he wasnt overparticular aboot details of your lovemakin  ellen gazed out of the door over colters head as if the forest out there was a refuge  she evidently sensed more about the man than appeared in his slow talk in his slouching position  her lips shut in a firm line as if to hide their trembling and to still her passionate tongue  jean in his absorption magnified his perceptions not yet was ellen jorth afraid of this man but she feared the situation jeans heart was at bursting pitch  all within him seemed chaosa wreck of beliefs and convictions  nothing was true  he would wake presently out of a nightmare  yet as surely as he quivered there he felt the imminence of a great momenta lightning flasha thunderbolta balance struck  colter attended to the forgotten cigarette  he rolled it lighted it all the time with lowered pondering head and when he had puffed a cloud of smoke he suddenly looked up with face as hard as flint eyes as fiery as molten steel  wal ellenhow aboot jean isbelour halfbreed nez perce friendwho was shore seen handlin yu familiar he drawled  ellen jorth quivered as under a lash and her brown face turned a dusty scarlet that slowly receding left her pale  damn yu jim colter she burst out furiously  i wish jean isbel would jump in that dooror down out of that loft  he killed greaves for defiling my name  hed kill yu for your dirty insult and id like to watch him do it yu coldblooded texan yu thieving rustler  yu liar  yu lied aboot my fathers death and i know why  yu stole my fathers gold an now yu want meyu expect me to fall into your arms my heaven caint yu tell a decent woman

yu an all your rottenness caint make me bad  colter lounged to his tall height and the laxity of the man vanished  vanished also was jean isbels suspended icy dread the cold clogging of his fevered mindvanished in a white living leaping flame  silently he drew his knife and lay there watching with the eyes of a wildcat  the instant colter stepped far enough over toward the edge of the loft jean meant to bound erect and plunge down upon him  but jean could wait now  colter had a gun at his hip  he must never have a chance to draw it  ahuh  so yu wish jean isbel would hop in heah do yu queried colter wal if i had any pity on yu thats done for it  a sweep of his long arm so swift ellen had no time to move brought his hand in clutching contact with her  and the force of it flung her half across the cabin room leaving the sleeve of her blouse in his grasp pantingly she put out that bared arm and her other to ward him off as he took long slow strides toward her  jean rose half to his feet dragged by almost ungovernable passion to risk all on one leap  but the distance was too great  colter blind as he was to all outward things would hear would see in time to make jeans effort futile  shaking like a leaf jean sank back eye again to the crack between the rafters  ellen did not retreat nor scream nor move  every line of her body was instinct with fight and the magnificent blaze of her eyes would have checked a less callous brute  colters big hand darted between ellens arms and fastened in the front of her blouse  he did not try to hold her or draw her close  the unleashed passion of the man required violence  in one savage pull he tore off her blouse exposing her white rounded shoulders and heaving bosom where instantly a wave of red burned upward  overcome by the tremendous violence and spirit of the rustler ellen sank to her knees with blanched face and dilating eyes trying with folded arms and trembling hand to hide her nudity  at that moment the rapid beat of hoofs on the hard trail outside halted colter in his tracks  hell he exclaimed  an whos that  with a fierce action he flung the remnants of ellens blouse in her face and turned to leap out the door  jean saw ellen catch the blouse and try to wrap it around her while she sagged against the wall and stared at the door  the hoof beats pounded to a solid thumping halt just outside  jimthars hell to pay rasped out a panting voice  wal springer i reckon i wished yud paid it without spoilin my deals retorted colter cool and sharp  deals  ha  yull be forgettinyour lady love in a minnit replied springer  when i catchmy breath  wheres somers demanded colter  i reckon hes all shot upif my eyes didnt fool me  where is he yelled colter  jimhes layin up in the bushes round thet bluff  i didnt wait to see how he was hurt  but he shore stopped some lead  an he flopped like a chicken with itshaid cut off  wheres antonio  he run like the greaser he is declared springer disgustedly  ahuh  an wheres queen queried colter after a significant pause  dead  the silence ensuing was fraught with a suspense that held jean in cold bonds  he saw the girl below rise from her knees one hand holding the blouse to her breast the other extended and with strange repressed almost frantic look she swayed toward the door  wal talk ordered colter harshly  jim there aint a hell of a lot replied springer drawing a deep breath but what there is is shore interestin me an somers took antonio with us  he left his woman with the sheep  an we rode up the canyon clumb out on top an made a circle back on the ridge thats the way weve been huntin fer tracks  up thar in a bare spot we run plump into queen sittin against a tree right out in the open queerest sight yu ever seen  the damn gunfighter had set down to wait for isbel who was trailin him as we suspectedan he died thar he wasnt cold when we found him somers was quick to see a trick so he propped queen up an tied the guns to his handsan jim the queerest thing aboot that deal was thisqueens guns was empty  not a shell left  it beat us holler we left him thar an hid up high on the bluff mebbe a hundred yards off  the hosses we left back of a thicket  an we waited thar a long time  but sure enough the halfbreed come  he was too smart  too much injun  he would not cross the open but went around  an then he seen queen  it was great to watch him  after a little he shoved his rifle out an went right fer queen  this is when i wanted to shoot  i could have plugged him but somers says wait an make it sure  when isbel got up to queen he was sort of half hid by the tree  an i couldnt wait no longer so i shot  i hit him too  we all begun to shoot  somers showed himself an thats when isbel opened up  he used up a whole magazine on somers an then suddenlike he quit  it didnt take me long to figger mebbe he was out of shells  when i seen him run i was certain of it  then we made for the hosses an rode after isbel  pretty soon i seen him runnin like a deer down the ridge  i yelled an spurred after him there is where antonio quit me  but i kept on  an i got a shot at isbel  he ran out of sight  i follered him by spots of blood on the stones an grass until i couldnt trail him no more  he must have gone down over the cliffs  he couldnt have done nothin else without me seein him  i found his rifle an here it is to prove what i say  i had to go back to climb down off the rim an i rode fast down the canyon  hes somewhere along that west wall hidin in the brush hard hit if i know anythin aboot the color

oughter let thet jorth hussy alone long enough to  springer i reckon ive got to hawgtie her  his voice became indistinguishable and footfalls attested to a slow moving away of the men  jean had listened with ears acutely strung to catch every syllable while his gaze rested upon ellen who stood beside the door  every line of her body denoted a listening intensity  her back was toward jean so that he could not see her face  and he did not want to see but could not help seeing her naked shoulders  she put her head out of the door  suddenly she drew it in quickly and half turned her face slowly raising her white arm  this was the left one and bore the marks of colters hard fingers  she gave a little gasp  her eyes became large and staring  they were bent on the hand that she had removed from a step on the ladder  on hand and wrist showed a brightred smear of blood  jean with a convulsive leap of his heart realized that he had left his bloody tracks on the ladder as he had climbed  that moment seemed the supremely terrible one of his life  ellen jorths face blanched and her eyes darkened and dilated with exceeding amaze and flashing thought to become fixed with horror that instant was the one in which her reason connected the blood on the ladder with the escape of jean isbel  one moment she leaned there still as a stone except for her heaving breast and then her fixed gaze changed to a swift dark blaze comprehending yet inscrutable as she flashed it up the ladder to the loft  she could see nothing yet she knew and jean knew that she knew he was there  a marvelous transformation passed over her features and even over her form  jean choked with the ache in his throat slowly she put the bloody hand behind her while with the other she still held the torn blouse to her breast  colters slouching musical step sounded outside  and it might have been a strange breath of infinitely vitalizing and passionate life blown into the wellsprings of ellen jorths being  isbel had no name for her then  the spirit of a woman had been to him a thing unknown  she swayed back from the door against the wall in singular softened poise as if all the steel had melted out of her body  and as colters tall shadow fell across the threshold jean isbel felt himself staring with eyeballs that achedstraining incredulous sight at this woman who in a few seconds had bewildered his senses with her transfiguration he saw but could not comprehend  jimi heardall springer told yu she said  the look of her dumfounded colter and her voice seemed to shake him visibly  suppose yu did  what then he demanded harshly as he halted with one booted foot over the threshold  malignant and forceful he eyed her darkly doubtfully  im afraid she whispered  what of me  no ofof jean isbel  he might kill yu andthen where would i be  wal im damned ejaculated the rustler  whats got into yu he moved to enter but a sort of fascination bound him  jim i hated yu a moment ago she burst out  but nowwith that jean isbel somewhere nearhidinwatchin to kill yuan maybe me tooii dont hate yu any more take me away  girl have yu lost your nerve he demanded  my god coltercaint yu see she implored  wont yu take me away  i shore willpresently he replied grimly  but yull wait till ive shot the lights out of this isbel  no she cried  take me away now an ill give inill be what yuwant yu can do with meas yu like  colters lofty frame leaped as if at the release of bursting blood with a lunge he cleared the threshold to loom over her  am i out of my haid or are yu he asked in low hoarse voice his darkly corded face expressed extremest amaze  jim i mean it she whispered edging an inch nearer him her white face uplifted her dark eyes unreadable in their eloquence and mystery ive no friend but yu  ill beyours im lost what does it matter  if yu want metake me nowbefore i kill myself  ellen jorth theres somethin wrong aboot yu he responded did yu tell the truthwhen yu denied ever bein a sweetheart of simm bruce  yes i told yu the truth  ahuh  an how do yu account for layin me out with every dirty name yu could give tongue to  oh it was temper i wanted to be let alone  temper  wal i reckon yuve got one he retorted grimly  an im not shore yure not crazy or lyin  an hour ago i couldnt touch yu  yu may nowif yu promise to take me awayat once  this place has got on my nerves  i couldnt sleep heah with that isbel hidin around could yu  wal i reckon id not sleep very deep  then let us go  he shook his lean eaglelike head in slow doubtful vehemence and his piercing gaze studied her distrustfully  yet all the while there was manifest in his strung frame an almost irrepressible violence held in abeyance to his will  that aboot your bein so good he inquired with a return of the mocking drawl  never mind whats past she flashed with passion dark as his ive made my offer  shore theres a lie aboot yu somewhere he muttered thickly  man could i do more she demanded in scorn  no  but its a lie he returned  yull get me to take yu away an then fool merun offgod knows what  women are all liars  manifestly he could not believe in her strange transformation  memory of her wild and passionate denunciation of him and his kind must have seared even his calloused soul  but the ruthless nature of him had not weakened nor softened in the least as to his intentions  this weathervane veering of hers bewildered him obsessed him with its possibilities  he had the look of a man who was divided between love of her and hate whose love demanded a return but whose hate required a proof of her abasement  not proof of surrender but proof of her shame the ignominy of him thirsted for its like  he could grind her beauty under his heel but he could not soften to this feminine inscrutableness  and whatever was the truth of ellen jorth in this moment beyond colters gloomy and stunted intelligence beyond even the love of jean isbel it was something that held the balance of mastery  she read colters mind  she dropped the torn blouse from her hand and stood there unashamed with the wave of her white breast pulsing eyes black as night and full of hell her face white tragic terrible yet strangely lovely  take me away she whispered stretching one white arm toward him then the other  colter even as she moved had leaped with inarticulate cry and radiant face to meet her embrace  but it seemed just as her left arm flashed up toward his neck that he saw her bloody hand and wrist  strange how that checked his ardorthrew up his lean head like that striking bird of prey  blood  what the hell he ejaculated and in one sweep he grasped her howd yu do that  are yu cut  hold still  ellen could not release her hand  i scratched myself she said  where all that blood  and suddenly he flung her hand back with fierce gesture and the gleams of his yellow eyes were like the points of leaping flames  they pierced herread the secret falsity of her slowly he stepped backward guardedly his hand moved to his gun and his glance circled and swept the interior of the cabin  as if he had the nose of a hound and sight to follow scent his eyes bent to the dust of the ground before the door  he quivered grew rigid as stone and then moved his head with exceeding slowness as if searching through a microscope in the dustfarther to the leftto the foot of the ladderand up one stepanothera thirdall the way up to the loft then he whipped out his gun and wheeled to face the girl  ellen yuve got your halfbreed heah he said with a terrible smile  she neither moved nor spoke  there was a suggestion of collapse but it was only a change where the alluring softness of her hardened into a strange rapt glow  and in it seemed the same mastery that had characterized her former aspect  herein the treachery of her was revealed  she had known what she meant to do in any case  colter standing at the door reached a long arm toward the ladder where he laid his hand on a rung  taking it away he held it palm outward for her to see the dark splotch of blood  see  yes i see she said ringingly  passion wrenched him transformed him  all thataboot leavin heahwith meaboot
