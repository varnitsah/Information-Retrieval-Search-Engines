32229287	the patchwork girl of oz   by  l frank baum       affectionately dedicated to my young friend   sumner hamilton britton of chicago     prologue  through the kindness of dorothy gale of kansas afterward princess dorothy of oz an humble writer in the united states of america was once appointed royal historian of oz with the privilege of writing the chronicle of that wonderful fairyland but after making six books about the adventures of those interesting but queer people who live in the land of oz the historian learned with sorrow that by an edict of the supreme ruler ozma of oz her country would thereafter be rendered invisible to all who lived outside its borders and that all communication with oz would in the future be cut off  the children who had learned to look for the books about oz and who loved the stories about the gay and happy people inhabiting that favored country were as sorry as their historian that there would be no more books of oz stories they wrote many letters asking if the historian did not know of some adventures to write about that had happened before the land of oz was shut out from all the rest of the world but he did not know of any finally one of the children inquired why we couldnt hear from princess dorothy by wireless telegraph which would enable her to communicate to the historian whatever happened in the faroff land of oz without his seeing her or even knowing just where oz is  that seemed a good idea so the historian rigged up a high tower in his back yard and took lessons in wireless telegraphy until he understood it and then began to call princess dorothy of oz by sending messages into the air  now it wasnt likely that dorothy would be looking for wireless messages or would heed the call but one thing the historian was sure of and that was that the powerful sorceress glinda would know what he was doing and that he desired to communicate with dorothy for glinda has a big book in which is recorded every event that takes place anywhere in the world just the moment that it happens and so of course the book would tell her about the wireless message  and that was the way dorothy heard that the historian wanted to speak with her and there was a shaggy man in the land of oz who knew how to telegraph a wireless reply the result was that the historian begged so hard to be told the latest news of oz so that he could write it down for the children to read that dorothy asked permission of ozma and ozma graciously consented  that is why after two long years of waiting another oz story is now presented to the children of america this would not have been possible had not some clever man invented the wireless and an equally clever child suggested the idea of reaching the mysterious land of oz by its means  l

turned to the munchkin boy and shook his head  isnt said he  isnt any butter thats too bad unc wheres the jam then inquired ojo standing on a stool so he could look through all the shelves of the cupboard but unc nunkie shook his head again  gone he said  no jam either and no cakeno jellyno applesnothing but bread  all said unc again stroking his beard as he gazed from the window  the little boy brought the stool and sat beside his uncle munching the dry bread slowly and seeming in deep thought  nothing grows in our yard but the bread tree he mused and there are only two more loaves on that tree and theyre not ripe yet tell me unc why are we so poor  the old munchkin turned and looked at ojo he had kindly eyes but he hadnt smiled or laughed in so long that the boy had forgotten that unc nunkie could look any other way than solemn and unc never spoke any more words than he was obliged to so his little nephew who lived alone with him had learned to understand a great deal from one word  why are we so poor unc repeated the boy  not said the old munchkin  i think we are declared ojo what have we got  house said unc nunkie  i know but everyone in the land of oz has a place to live what else unc  bread  im eating the last loaf thats ripe there ive put aside your share unc its on the table so you can eat it when you get hungry but when that is gone what shall we eat unc  the old man shifted in his chair but merely shook his head  of course said ojo who was obliged to talk because his uncle would not no one starves in the land of oz either there is plenty for everyone you know only if it isnt just where you happen to be you must go where it is  the aged munchkin wriggled again and stared at his small nephew as if disturbed by his argument  by tomorrow morning the boy went on we must go where there is something to eat or we shall grow very hungry and become very unhappy  where asked unc  where shall we go i dont know im sure replied ojo but you must know unc you must have traveled in your time because youre so old i dont remember it because ever since i could remember anything weve lived right here in this lonesome round house with a little garden back of it and the thick woods all around all ive ever seen of the great land of oz unc dear is the view of that mountain over at the south where they say the hammerheads livewho wont let anybody go by themand that mountain at the north where they say nobody lives  one declared unc correcting him  oh yes one family lives there ive heard thats the crooked magician who is named dr pipt and his wife margolotte one year you told me about them i think it took you a whole year unc to say as much as ive just said about the crooked magician and his wife they live high up on the mountain and the good munchkin country where the fruits and flowers grow is just the other side its funny you and i should live here all alone in the middle of the forest isnt it  yes said unc  then lets go away and visit the munchkin country and its jolly goodnatured people id love to get a sight of something besides woods unc nunkie  too little said unc  why im not so little as i used to be answered the boy earnestly i think i can walk as far and as fast through the woods as you can unc and now that nothing grows in our back yard that is good to eat we must go where there is food  unc nunkie made no reply for a time then he shut down the window and turned his chair to face the room for the sun was sinking behind the treetops and it was growing cool  by and by ojo lighted the fire and the logs blazed freely in the broad fireplace the two sat in the firelight a long timethe old whitebearded munchkin and the little boy both were thinking when it grew quite dark outside ojo said  eat your bread unc and then we will go to bed  but unc nunkie did not eat the bread neither did he go directly to bed long after his little nephew was sound asleep in the corner of the room the old man sat by the fire thinking     chapter two  the crooked magician   just at dawn next morning unc nunkie laid his hand tenderly on ojos head and awakened him  come he said  ojo dressed he wore blue silk stockings blue knee pants with gold buckles a blue ruffled waist and a jacket of bright blue braided with gold his shoes were of blue leather and turned up at the toes which were pointed his hat had a peaked crown and a flat brim and around the brim was a row of tiny golden bells that tinkled when he moved this was the native costume of those who inhabited the munchkin country of the land of oz so unc nunkies dress was much like that of his nephew instead of shoes the old man wore boots with turnover tops and his blue coat had wide cuffs of gold braid  the boy noticed that his uncle had not eaten the bread and supposed the old man had not been hungry ojo was hungry though so he divided the piece of bread upon the table and ate his half for breakfast washing it down with fresh cool water from the brook unc put the other piece of bread in his jacket pocket after which he again said as he walked out through the doorway come  ojo was well pleased he was dreadfully tired of living all alone in the woods and wanted to travel and see people for a long time he had wished to explore the beautiful land of oz in which they lived when they were outside unc simply latched the door and started up the path no one would disturb their little house even if anyone came so far into the thick forest while they were gone  at the foot of the mountain that separated the country of the munchkins from the country of the gillikins the path divided one way led to the left and the other to the rightstraight up the mountain unc nunkie took this righthand path and ojo followed without asking why he knew it would take them to the house of the crooked magician whom he had never seen but who was their nearest neighbor  all the morning they trudged up the mountain path and at noon unc and ojo sat on a fallen treetrunk and ate the last of the bread which the old munchkin had placed in his pocket then they started on again and two hours later came in sight of the house of dr pipt  it was a big house round as were all the munchkin houses and painted blue which is the distinctive color of the munchkin country of oz there was a pretty garden around the house where blue trees and blue flowers grew in abundance and in one place were beds of blue cabbages blue carrots and blue lettuce all of which were delicious to eat in dr pipts garden grew buntrees caketrees creampuff bushes blue buttercups which yielded excellent blue butter and a row of chocolatecaramel plants paths of blue gravel divided the vegetable and flower beds and a wider path led up to the front door the place was in a clearing on the mountain but a little way off was the grim forest which completely surrounded it  unc knocked at the door of the house and a chubby pleasantfaced woman dressed all in blue opened it and greeted the visitors with a smile  ah said ojo you must be dame margolotte the good wife of dr pipt  i am my dear and all strangers are welcome to my home  may we see the famous magician madam  he is very busy just now she said shaking her head doubtfully but come in and let me give you something to eat for you must have traveled far in order to get our lonely place  we have replied ojo as he and unc entered the house we have come from a far lonelier place than this  a lonelier place and in the munchkin country she exclaimed then it must be somewhere in the blue forest  it is good dame margolotte  dear me she said looking at the man you must be unc nunkie known as the silent one then she looked at the boy and you must be ojo the unlucky she added  yes said unc  i never knew i was called the unlucky said ojo soberly but it is really a good name for me  well remarked the woman as she bustled around the room and set the table and brought food from the cupboard you were unlucky to live all alone in that dismal forest which is much worse than the forest around here but perhaps your luck will change now you are away from it if during your travels you can manage to lose that un at the beginning of your name unlucky you will then become ojo the lucky which will be a great improvement  how can i lose that un dame margolotte  i do not know how but you must keep the matter in mind and perhaps the chance will come to you she replied  ojo had never eaten such a fine meal in all his life there was a savory stew smoking hot a dish of blue peas a bowl of sweet milk of a delicate blue tint and a blue pudding with blue plums in it when the visitors had eaten heartily of this fare the woman said to them  do you wish to see dr pipt on business or for pleasure  unc shook his head  we are traveling replied ojo and we stopped at your house just to rest and refresh ourselves i do not think unc nunkie cares very much to see the famous crooked magician but for my part i am curious to look at such a great man  the woman seemed thoughtful  i remember that unc nunkie and my husband used to be friends many years ago she said so perhaps they will be glad to meet again the magician is very busy as i said but if you will promise not to disturb him you may come into his workshop and watch him prepare a wonderful charm  thank you replied the boy much pleased i would like to do that  she led the way to a great domed hall at the back of the house which was the magicians workshop there was a row of windows extending nearly around the sides of the circular room which rendered the place very light and there was a back door in addition to the one leading to the front part of the house before the row of windows a broad seat was built and there were some chairs and benches in the room besides at one end stood a great fireplace in which a blue log was blazing with a blue flame and over the fire hung four kettles in a row all bubbling and steaming at a great rate the magician was stirring all four of these kettles at the same time two with his hands and two with his feet to the latter wooden ladles being strapped for this man was so very crooked that his legs were as handy as his arms  unc nunkie came forward to greet his old friend but not being able to shake either his hands or his feet which were all occupied in stirring he patted the magicians bald head and asked what  ah its the silent one remarked dr pipt without looking up and he wants to know what im making well when it is quite finished this compound will be the wonderful powder of life which no one knows how to make but myself whenever it is sprinkled on anything that thing will at once come to life no matter what it is it takes me several years to make this magic powder but at this moment i am pleased to say it is nearly done you see i am making it for my good wife margolotte who wants to use some of it for a purpose of her own sit down and make yourself comfortable unc nunkie and after ive finished my task i will talk to you  you must know said margolotte when they were all seated together on the broad windowseat that my husband foolishly gave away all the powder of life he first made to old mombi the witch who used to live in the country of the gillikins to the north of here mombi gave to dr pipt a powder of perpetual youth in exchange for his powder of life but she cheated him wickedly for the powder of youth was no good and could work no magic at all  perhaps the powder of life couldnt either said ojo  yes it is perfection she declared the first lot we tested on our glass cat which not only began to live but has lived ever since shes somewhere around the house now  a glass cat exclaimed ojo astonished  yes she makes a very pleasant companion but admires herself a little more than is considered modest and she positively refuses to catch mice explained margolotte my husband made the cat some pink brains but they proved to be too highbred and particular for a cat so she thinks it is undignified in her to catch mice also she has a pretty bloodred heart but it is made of stonea ruby i thinkand so is rather hard and unfeeling i think the next glass cat the magician makes will have neither brains nor heart for then it will not object to catching mice and may prove of some use to us  what did old mombi the witch do with the powder of life your husband gave her asked the boy  she brought jack pumpkinhead to life for one thing was the reply i suppose youve heard of jack pumpkinhead he is now living near the emerald city and is a great favorite with the princess ozma who rules all the land of oz  no ive never heard of him remarked ojo im afraid i dont know much about the land of oz you see ive lived all my life with unc nunkie the silent one and there was no one to tell me anything  that is one reason you are ojo the unlucky said the woman in a sympathetic tone the more one knows the luckier he is for knowledge is the greatest gift in life  but tell me please what you intend to do with this new lot of the powder of life which dr pipt is making he said his wife wanted it for some especial purpose  so i do she answered i want it to bring my patchwork girl to life  oh a patchwork girl what is that ojo asked for this seemed even more strange and unusual than a glass cat  i think i must show you my patchwork girl said margolotte laughing at the boys astonishment for she is rather difficult to explain but first i will tell you that for many years i have longed for a servant to help me with the housework and to cook the meals and wash the dishes no servant will come here because the place is so lonely and outoftheway so my clever husband the crooked magician proposed that i make a girl out of some sort of material and he would make her live by sprinkling over her the powder of life this seemed an excellent suggestion and at once dr pipt set to work to make a new batch of his magic powder he has been at it a long long while and so i have had plenty of time to make the girl yet that task was not so easy as you may suppose at first i couldnt think what to make her of but finally in searching through a chest i came across an old patchwork quilt which my grandmother once made when she was young  what is a patchwork quilt asked ojo  a bedquilt made of patches of different kinds and colors of cloth all neatly sewed together the patches are of all shapes and sizes so a patchwork quilt is a very pretty and gorgeous thing to look at sometimes it is called a crazyquilt because the patches and colors are so mixed up we never have used my grandmothers manycolored patchwork quilt handsome as it is for we munchkins do not care for any color other than blue so it has been packed away in the chest for about a hundred years when i found it i said to myself that it would do nicely for my servant girl for when she was brought to life she would not be proud nor haughty as the glass cat is for such a dreadful mixture of colors would discourage her from trying to be as dignified as the blue munchkins are  is blue the only respectable color then inquired ojo  yes for a munchkin all our country is blue you know but in other parts of oz the people favor different colors at the emerald city where our princess ozma lives green is the popular color but all munchkins prefer blue to anything else and when my housework girl is brought to life she will find herself to be of so many unpopular colors that shell never dare be rebellious or impudent as servants are sometimes liable to be when they are made the same way their mistresses are  unc nunkie nodded approval  good idea he said and that was a long speech for unc nunkie because it was two words  so i cut up the quilt continued margolotte and made from it a very wellshaped girl which i stuffed with cottonwadding i will show you what a good job i did and she went to a tall cupboard and threw open the doors  then back she came lugging in her arms the patchwork girl which she set upon the bench and propped up so that the figure would not tumble over     chapter three  the patchwork girl   ojo examined this curious contrivance with wonder the patchwork girl was taller than he when she stood upright and her body was plump and rounded because it had been so neatly stuffed with cotton margolotte had first made the girls form from the patchwork quilt and then she had dressed it with a patchwork skirt and an apron with pockets in itusing the same gay material throughout upon the feet she had sewn a pair of red leather shoes with pointed toes all the fingers and thumbs of the girls hands had been carefully formed and stuffed and stitched at the edges with gold plates at the ends to serve as fingernails  she will have to work when she comes to life said margolotte  the head of the patchwork girl was the most curious part of her while she waited for her husband to finish making his powder of life the woman had found ample time to complete the head as her fancy dictated and she realized that a good servants head must be properly constructed the hair was of brown yarn and hung down on her neck in several neat braids her eyes were two silver suspenderbuttons cut from a pair of the magicians old trousers and they were sewed on with black threads which formed the pupils of the eyes margolotte had puzzled over the ears for some time for these were important if the servant was to hear distinctly but finally she had made them out of thin plates of gold and attached them in place by means of stitches through tiny holes bored in the metal gold is the most common metal in the land of oz and is used for many purposes because it is soft and pliable  the woman had cut a slit for the patchwork girls mouth and sewn two rows of white pearls in it for teeth using a strip of scarlet plush for a tongue this mouth ojo considered very artistic and lifelike and margolotte was pleased when the boy praised it there were almost too many patches on the face of the girl for her to be considered strictly beautiful for one cheek was yellow and the other red her chin blue her forehead purple and the center where her nose had been formed and padded a bright yellow  you ought to have had her face all pink suggested the boy  i suppose so but i had no pink cloth replied the woman still i cannot see as it matters much for i wish my patchwork girl to be useful rather than ornamental if i get tired looking at her patched face i can whitewash it  has she any brains asked ojo  no i forgot all about the brains exclaimed the woman i am glad you reminded me of them for it is not too late to supply them by any means until she is brought to life i can do anything i please with this girl but i must be careful not to give her too much brains and those she has must be such as are fitted to the station she is to occupy in life in other words her brains mustnt be very good  wrong said unc nunkie  no i am sure i am right about that returned the woman  he means explained ojo that unless your servant has good brains she wont know how to obey you properly nor do the things you ask her to do  well that may be true agreed margolotte but on the contrary a servant with too much brains is sure to become independent and highandmighty and feel above her work this is a very delicate task as i said and i must take care to give the girl just the right quantity of the right sort of brains i want her to know just enough but not too much  with this she went to another cupboard which was filled with shelves all the shelves were lined with blue glass bottles neatly labeled by the magician to show what they contained one whole shelf was marked brain furniture and the bottles on this shelf were labeled as follows obedience cleverness judgment courage ingenuity amiability learning truth poesy self reliance  let me see said margolotte of those qualities she must have obedience first of all and she took down the bottle bearing that label and poured from it upon a dish several grains of the contents amiability is also good and truth she poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles i think that will do she continued for the other qualities are not needed in a servant  unc nunkie who with ojo stood beside her touched the bottle marked cleverness  little said he  a little cleverness well perhaps you are right sir said she and was about to take down the bottle when the crooked magician suddenly called to her excitedly from the fireplace  quick margolotte come and help me  she ran to her husbands side at once and helped him lift the four kettles from the fire their contents had all boiled away leaving in the bottom of each kettle a few grains of fine white powder very carefully the magician removed this powder placing it all together in a golden dish where he mixed it with a golden spoon when the mixture was complete there was scarcely a handful all told  that said dr pipt in a pleased and triumphant tone is the wonderful powder of life which i alone in the world know how to make it has taken me nearly six years to prepare these precious grains of dust but the little heap on that dish is worth the price of a kingdom and many a king would give all he has to possess it when it has become cooled i will place it in a small bottle but meantime i must watch it carefully lest a gust of wind blow it away or scatter it  unc nunkie margolotte and the magician all stood looking at the marvelous powder but ojo was more interested just then in the patchwork girls brains thinking it both unfair and unkind to deprive her of any good qualities that were handy the boy took down every bottle on the shelf and poured some of the contents in margolottes dish no one saw him do this for all were looking at the powder of life but soon the woman remembered what she had been doing and came back to the cupboard  lets see she remarked i was about to give my girl a little cleverness which is the doctors substitute for intelligencea quality he has not yet learned how to manufacture taking down the bottle of cleverness she added some of the powder to the heap on the dish ojo became a bit uneasy at this for he had already put quite a lot of the cleverness powder in the dish but he dared not interfere and so he comforted himself with the thought that one cannot have too much cleverness  margolotte now carried the dish of brains to the bench ripping the seam of the patch on the girls forehead she placed the powder within the head and then sewed up the seam as neatly and securely as before  my girl is all ready for your powder of life my dear she said to her husband but the magician replied  this powder must not be used before tomorrow morning but i think it is now cool enough to be bottled  he selected a small gold bottle with a pepperbox top so that the powder might be sprinkled on any object through the small holes very carefully he placed the powder of life in the gold bottle and then locked it up in a drawer of his cabinet  at last said he rubbing his hands together gleefully i have ample leisure for a good talk with my old friend unc nunkie so let us sit down cosily and enjoy ourselves after stirring those four kettles for six years i am glad to have a little rest  you will have to do most of the talking said ojo for unc is called the silent one and uses few words  i know but that renders your uncle a most agreeable companion and gossip declared dr pipt most people talk too much so it is a relief to find one who talks too little  ojo looked at the magician with much awe and curiosity  dont you find it very annoying to be so crooked he asked  no i am quite proud of my person was the reply i suppose i am the only crooked magician in all the world some others are accused of being crooked but i am the only genuine  he was really very crooked and ojo wondered how he managed to do so many things with such a twisted body when he sat down upon a crooked chair that had been made to fit him one knee was under his chin and the other near the small of his back but he was a cheerful man and his face bore a pleasant and agreeable expression  i am not allowed to perform magic except for my own amusement he told his visitors as he lighted a pipe with a crooked stem and began to smoke too many people were working magic in the land of oz and so our lovely princess ozma put a stop to it i think she was quite right there were several wicked witches who caused a lot of trouble but now they are all out of business and only the great sorceress glinda the good is permitted to practice her arts which never harm anybody the wizard of oz who used to be a humbug and knew no magic at all has been taking lessons of glinda and im told he is getting to be a pretty good wizard but he is merely the assistant of the great sorceress ive the right to make a servant girl for my wife you know or a glass cat to catch our micewhich she refuses to dobut i am forbidden to work magic for others or to use it as a profession  magic must be a very interesting study said ojo  it truly is asserted the magician in my time ive performed some magical feats that were worthy of the skill of glinda the good for instance theres the powder of life and my liquid of petrifaction which is contained in that bottle on the shelf yonderover the window  what does the liquid of petrifaction do inquired the boy  turns everything it touches to solid marble its an invention of my own and i find it very useful once two of those dreadful kalidahs with bodies like bears and heads like tigers came here from the forest to attack us but i sprinkled some of that liquid on them and instantly they turned to marble i now use them as ornamental statuary in my garden this table looks to you like wood and once it really was wood but i sprinkled a few drops of the liquid of petrifaction on it and now it is marble it will never break nor wear out  fine said unc nunkie wagging his head and stroking his long gray beard  dear me what a chatterbox youre getting to be unc remarked the magician who was pleased with the compliment but just then there came a scratching at the back door and a shrill voice cried  let me in hurry up cant you let me in  margolotte got up and went to the door  ask like a good cat then she said  meeeeowww there does that suit your royal highness asked the voice in scornful accents  yes thats proper cat talk declared the woman and opened the door  at once a cat entered came to the center of the room and stopped short at the sight of strangers ojo and unc nunkie both stared at it with wide open eyes for surely no such curious creature had ever existed beforeeven in the land of oz     chapter four  the glass cat   the cat was made of glass so clear and transparent that you could see through it as easily as through a window in the top of its head however was a mass of delicate pink balls which looked like jewels and it had a heart made of a bloodred ruby the eyes were two large emeralds but aside from these colors all the rest of the animal was clear glass and it had a spunglass tail that was really beautiful  well doc pipt do you mean to introduce us or not demanded the cat in a tone of annoyance seems to me you are forgetting your manners  excuse me returned the magician this is unc nunkie the descendant of the former kings of the munchkins before this country became a part of the land of oz  he needs a haircut observed the cat washing its face  true replied unc with a low chuckle of amusement  but he has lived alone in the heart of the forest for many years the magician explained and although that is a barbarous country there are no barbers there  who is the dwarf asked the cat  that is not a dwarf but a boy answered the magician you have never seen a boy before he is now small because he is young with more years he will grow big and become as tall as unc nunkie  oh is that magic the glass animal inquired  yes but it is natures magic which is more wonderful than any art known to man for instance my magic made you and made you live and it was a poor job because you are useless and a bother to me but i cant make you grow you will always be the same sizeand the same saucy inconsiderate glass cat with pink brains and a hard ruby heart  no one can regret more than i the fact that you made me asserted the cat crouching upon the floor and slowly swaying its spunglass tail from side to side your world is a very uninteresting place ive wandered through your gardens and in the forest until im tired of it all and when i come into the house the conversation of your fat wife and of yourself bores me dreadfully  that is because i gave you different brains from those we ourselves possessand much too good for a cat returned dr pipt  cant you take em out then and replace em with pebbles so that i wont feel above my station in life asked the cat pleadingly  perhaps so ill try it after ive brought the patchwork girl to life he said  the cat walked up to the bench on which the patchwork girl reclined and looked at her attentively  are you going to make that dreadful thing live she asked  the magician nodded  it is intended to be my wifes servant maid he said when she is alive she will do all our work and mind the house but you are not to order her around bungle as you do us you must treat the patchwork girl respectfully  i wont i couldnt respect such a bundle of scraps under any circumstances  if you dont there will be more scraps than you will like cried margolotte angrily  why didnt you make her pretty to look at asked the cat you made me prettyvery pretty indeedand i love to watch my pink brains roll around when theyre working and to see my precious red heart beat she went to a long mirror as she said this and stood before it looking at herself with an air of much pride but that poor patched thing will hate herself when shes once alive continued the cat if i were you id use her for a mop and make another servant that is prettier  you have a perverted taste snapped margolotte much annoyed at this frank criticism i think the patchwork girl is beautiful considering what shes made of even the rainbow hasnt as many colors and you must admit that the rainbow is a pretty thing  the glass cat yawned and stretched herself upon the floor  have your own way she said im sorry for the patchwork girl thats all  ojo and unc nunkie slept that night in the magicians house and the boy was glad to stay because he was anxious to see the patchwork girl brought to life the glass cat was also a wonderful creature to little ojo who had never seen or known anything of magic before although he had lived in the fairyland of oz ever since he was born back there in the woods nothing unusual ever happened unc nunkie who might have been king of the munchkins had not his people united with all the other countries of oz in acknowledging ozma as their sole ruler had retired into this forgotten forest nook with his baby nephew and they had lived all alone there only that the neglected garden had failed to grow food for them they would always have lived in the solitary blue forest but now they had started out to mingle with other people and the first place they came to proved so interesting that ojo could scarcely sleep a wink all night  margolotte was an excellent cook and gave them a fine breakfast while they were all engaged in eating the good woman said  this is the last meal i shall have to cook for some time for right after breakfast dr pipt has promised to bring my new servant to life i shall let her wash the breakfast dishes and sweep and dust the house what a relief it will be  it will indeed relieve you of much drudgery said the magician by the way margolotte i thought i saw you getting some brains from the cupboard while i was busy with my kettles what qualities have you given your new servant  only those that an humble servant requires she answered i do not wish her to feel above her station as the glass cat does that would make her discontented and unhappy for of course she must always be a servant  ojo was somewhat disturbed as he listened to this and the boy began to fear he had done wrong in adding all those different qualities of brains to the lot margolotte had prepared for the servant but it was too late now for regret since all the brains were securely sewn up inside the patchwork girls head he might have confessed what he had done and thus allowed margolotte and her husband to change the brains but he was afraid of incurring their anger he believed that unc had seen him add to the brains and unc had not said a word against it but then unc never did say anything unless it was absolutely necessary  as soon as breakfast was over they all went into the magicians big workshop where the glass cat was lying before the mirror and the patchwork girl lay limp and lifeless upon the bench  now then said dr pipt in a brisk tone we shall perform one of the greatest feats of magic possible to man even in this marvelous land of oz in no other country could it be done at all i think we ought to have a little music while the patchwork girl comes to life it is pleasant to reflect that the first sounds her golden ears will hear will be delicious music  as he spoke he went to a phonograph which screwed fast to a small table and wound up the spring of the instrument and adjusted the big gold horn  the music my servant will usually hear remarked margolotte will be my orders to do her work but i see no harm in allowing her to listen to this unseen band while she wakens to her first realization of life my orders will beat the band afterward  the phonograph was now playing a stirring march tune and the magician unlocked his cabinet and took out the gold bottle containing the powder of life  they all bent over the bench on which the patchwork girl reclined unc nunkie and margolotte stood behind near the windows ojo at one side and the magician in front where he would have freedom to sprinkle the powder the glass cat came near too curious to watch the important scene  all ready asked dr pipt  all is ready answered his wife  so the magician leaned over and shook from the bottle some grains of the wonderful powder and they fell directly on the patchwork girls head and arms     chapter five  a terrible accident   it will take a few minutes for this powder to do its work remarked the magician sprinkling the body up and down with much care  but suddenly the patchwork girl threw up one arm which knocked the bottle of powder from the crooked mans hand and sent it flying across the room unc nunkie and margolotte were so startled that they both leaped backward and bumped together and uncs head joggled the shelf above them and upset the bottle containing the liquid of petrifaction  the magician uttered such a wild cry that ojo jumped away and the patchwork girl sprang after him and clasped her stuffed arms around him in terror the glass cat snarled and hid under the table and so it was that when the powerful liquid of petrifaction was spilled it fell only upon the wife of the magician and the uncle of ojo with these two the charm worked promptly they stood motionless and stiff as marble statues in exactly the positions they were in when the liquid struck them  ojo pushed the patchwork girl away and ran to unc nunkie filled with a terrible fear for the only friend and protector he had ever known when he grasped uncs hand it was cold and hard even the long gray beard was solid marble the crooked magician was dancing around the room in a frenzy of despair calling upon his wife to forgive him to speak to him to come to life again  the patchwork girl quickly recovering from her fright now came nearer and looked from one to another of the people with deep interest then she looked at herself and laughed noticing the mirror she stood before it and examined her extraordinary features with amazementher button eyes pearl bead teeth and puffy nose then addressing her reflection in the glass she exclaimed      whee but theres a gaudy dame     makes a paintbox blush with shame     razzledazzle fizzlefazzle     howdydo miss whatsyourname   she bowed and the reflection bowed then she laughed again long and merrily and the glass cat crept out from under the table and said  i dont blame you for laughing at yourself arent you horrid  horrid she replied why im thoroughly delightful im an original if you please and therefore incomparable of all the comic absurd rare and amusing creatures the world contains i must be the supreme freak who but poor margolotte could have managed to invent such an unreasonable being as i but im gladim awfully gladthat im just what i am and nothing else  be quiet will you cried the frantic magician be quiet and let me think if i dont think i shall go mad  think ahead said the patchwork girl seating herself in a chair think all you want to i dont mind  gee but im tired playing that tune called the phonograph speaking through its horn in a brazen scratchy voice if you dont mind pipt old boy ill cut it out and take a rest  the magician looked gloomily at the musicmachine  what dreadful luck he wailed despondently the powder of life must have fallen on the phonograph  he went up to it and found that the gold bottle that contained the precious powder had dropped upon the stand and scattered its lifegiving grains over the machine the phonograph was very much alive and began dancing a jig with the legs of the table to which it was attached and this dance so annoyed dr pipt that he kicked the thing into a corner and pushed a bench against it to hold it quiet  you were bad enough before said the magician resentfully but a live phonograph is enough to drive every sane person in the land of oz stark crazy  no insults please answered the phonograph in a surly tone you did it my boy dont blame me  youve bungled everything dr pipt added the glass cat contemptuously  except me said the patchwork girl jumping up to whirl merrily around the room  i think said ojo almost ready to cry through grief over unc nunkies sad fate it must all be my fault in some way im called ojo the unlucky you know  thats nonsense kiddie retorted the patchwork girl cheerfully no one can be unlucky who has the intelligence to direct his own actions the unlucky ones are those who beg for a chance to think like poor dr pipt here whats the row about anyway mr magicmaker  the liquid of petrifaction has accidentally fallen upon my dear wife and unc nunkie and turned them into marble he sadly replied  well why dont you sprinkle some of that powder on them and bring them to life again asked the patchwork girl  the magician gave a jump  why i hadnt thought of that he joyfully cried and grabbed up the golden bottle with which he ran to margolotte  said the patchwork girl      higgledy piggledy dee     what fools magicians be     his heads so thick     he cant think quick     so he takes advice from me   standing upon the bench for he was so crooked he could not reach the top of his wifes head in any other way dr pipt began shaking the bottle but not a grain of powder came out he pulled off the cover glanced within and then threw the bottle from him with a wail of despair  gonegone every bit gone he cried wasted on that miserable phonograph when it might have saved my dear wife  then the magician bowed his head on his crooked arms and began to cry  ojo was sorry for him he went up to the sorrowful man and said softly  you can make more powder of life dr pipt  yes but it will take me six yearssix long weary years of stirring four kettles with both feet and both hands was the agonized reply six years while poor margolotte stands watching me as a marble image  cant anything else be done asked the patchwork girl  the magician shook his head then he seemed to remember something and looked up  there is one other compound that would destroy the magic spell of the liquid of petrifaction and restore my wife and unc nunkie to life said he it may be hard to find the things i need to make this magic compound but if they were found i could do in an instant what will otherwise take six long weary years of stirring kettles with both hands and both feet  all right lets find the things then suggested the patchwork girl that seems a lot more sensible than those stirring times with the kettles  thats the idea scraps said the glass cat approvingly im glad to find you have decent brains mine are exceptionally good you can see em work theyre pink  scraps repeated the girl did you call me scraps is that my name  ii believe my poor wife had intended to name you angeline said the magician  but i like scraps best she replied with a laugh it fits me better for my patchwork is all scraps and nothing else thank you for naming me miss cat have you any name of your own  i have a foolish name that margolotte once gave me but which is quite undignified for one of my importance answered the cat she called me bungle  yes sighed the magician you were a sad bungle taken all in all i was wrong to make you as i did for a more useless conceited and brittle thing never before existed  im not so brittle as you think retorted the cat ive been alive a good many years for dr pipt experimented on me with the first magic powder of life he ever made and so far ive never broken or cracked or chipped any part of me  you seem to have a chip on your shoulder laughed the patchwork girl and the cat went to the mirror to see  tell me pleaded ojo speaking to the crooked magician what must we find to make the compound that will save unc nunkie  first was the reply i must have a sixleaved clover that can only be found in the green country around the emerald city and sixleaved clovers are very scarce even there  ill find it for you promised ojo  the next thing continued the magician is the left wing of a yellow butterfly that color can only be found in the yellow country of the winkies west of the emerald city  ill find it declared ojo is that all  oh no ill get my book of recipes and see what comes next  saying this the magician unlocked a drawer of his cabinet and drew out a small book covered with blue leather looking through the pages he found the recipe he wanted and said i must have a gill of water from a dark well  what kind of a well is that sir asked the boy  one where the light of day never penetrates the water must be put in a gold bottle and brought to me without any light ever reaching it  ill get the water from the dark well said ojo  then i must have three hairs from the tip of a woozys tail and a drop of oil from a live mans body  ojo looked grave at this  what is a woozy please he inquired  some sort of an animal ive never seen one so i cant describe it replied the magician  if i can find a woozy ill get the hairs from its tail said ojo but is there ever any oil in a mans body  the magician looked in the book again to make sure  thats what the recipe calls for he replied and of course we must get everything that is called for or the charm wont work the book doesnt say blood it says oil and there must be oil somewhere in a live mans body or the book wouldnt ask for it  all right returned ojo trying not to feel discouraged ill try to find it  the magician looked at the little munchkin boy in a doubtful way and said  all this will mean a long journey for you perhaps several long journeys for you must search through several of the different countries of oz in order to get the things i need  i know it sir but i must do my best to save unc nunkie  and also my poor wife margolotte if you save one you will save the other for both stand there together and the same compound will restore them both to life do the best you can ojo and while you are gone i shall begin the six years job of making a new batch of the powder of life then if you should unluckily fail to secure any one of the things needed i will have lost no time but if you succeed you must return here as quickly as you can and that will save me much tiresome stirring of four kettles with both feet and both hands  i will start on my journey at once sir said the boy  and i will go with you declared the patchwork girl  no no exclaimed the magician you have no right to leave this house you are only a servant and have not been discharged  scraps who had been dancing up and down the room stopped and looked at him  what is a servant she asked  one who serves aa sort of slave he explained  very well said the patchwork girl im going to serve you and your wife by helping ojo find the things you need you need a lot you know such as are not easily found  it is true sighed dr pipt i am well aware that ojo has undertaken a serious task  scraps laughed and resuming her dance she said      heres a job for a boy of brains     a drop of oil from a live mans veins     a sixleaved clover three nice hairs     from a woozys tail the book declares     are needed for the magic spell     and water from a pitchdark well     the yellow wing of a butterfly     to find must ojo also try     and if he gets them without harm     doc pipt will make the magic charm     but if he doesnt get em unc     will always stand a marble chunk   the magician looked at her thoughtfully  poor margolotte must have given you some of the quality of poesy by mistake he said and if that is true i didnt make a very good article when i prepared it or else you got an overdose or an underdose however i believe i shall let you go with ojo for my poor wife will not need your services until she is restored to life also i think you may be able to help the boy for your head seems to contain some thoughts i did not expect to find in it but be very careful of yourself for youre a souvenir of my dear margolotte try not to get ripped or your stuffing may fall out one of your eyes seems loose and you may have to sew it on tighter if you talk too much youll wear out your scarlet plush tongue which ought to have been hemmed on the edges and remember you belong to me and must return here as soon as your mission is accomplished  im going with scraps and ojo announced the glass cat  you cant said the magician  why not  youd get broken in no time and you couldnt be a bit of use to the boy and the patchwork girl  i beg to differ with you returned the cat in a haughty tone three heads are better than two and my pink brains are beautiful you can see em work  well go along said the magician irritably youre only an annoyance anyhow and im glad to get rid of you  thank you for nothing then answered the cat stiffly  dr pipt took a small basket from a cupboard and packed several things in it then he handed it to ojo  here is some food and a bundle of charms he said it is all i can give you but i am sure you will find friends on your journey who will assist you in your search take care of the patchwork girl and bring her safely back for she ought to prove useful to my wife as for the glass catproperly named bungleif she bothers you i now give you my permission to break her in two for she is not respectful and does not obey me i made a mistake in giving her the pink brains you see  then ojo went to unc nunkie and kissed the old mans marble face very tenderly  im going to try to save you unc he said just as if the marble image could hear him and then he shook the crooked hand of the crooked magician who was already busy hanging the four kettles in the fireplace and picking up his basket left the house  the patchwork girl followed him and after them came the glass cat     chapter six  the journey   ojo had never traveled before and so he only knew that the path down the mountainside led into the open munchkin country where large numbers of people dwelt scraps was quite new and not supposed to know anything of the land of oz while the glass cat admitted she had never wandered very far away from the magicians house there was only one path before them at the beginning so they could not miss their way and for a time they walked through the thick forest in silent thought each one impressed with the importance of the adventure they had undertaken  suddenly the patchwork girl laughed it was funny to see her laugh because her cheeks wrinkled up her nose tipped her silver button eyes twinkled and her mouth curled at the corners in a comical way  has something pleased you asked ojo who was feeling solemn and joyless through thinking upon his uncles sad fate  yes she answered your world pleases me for its a queer world and life in it is queerer still here am i made from an old bedquilt and intended to be a slave to margolotte rendered free as air by an accident that none of you could foresee i am enjoying life and seeing the world while the woman who made me is standing helpless as a block of wood if that isnt funny enough to laugh at i dont know what is  youre not seeing much of the world yet my poor innocent scraps remarked the cat the world doesnt consist wholly of the trees that are on all sides of us  but theyre part of it and arent they pretty trees returned scraps bobbing her head until her brown yarn curls fluttered in the breeze growing between them i can see lovely ferns and wildflowers and soft green mosses if the rest of your world is half as beautiful i shall be glad im alive  i dont know what the rest of the world is like im sure said the cat but i mean to find out  i have never been out of the forest ojo added but to me the trees are gloomy and sad and the wildflowers seem lonesome it must be nicer where there are no trees and there is room for lots of people to live together  i wonder if any of the people we shall meet will be as splendid as i am said the patchwork girl all i have seen so far have pale colorless skins and clothes as blue as the country they live in while i am of many gorgeous colorsface and body and clothes that is why i am bright and contented ojo while you are blue and sad  i think i made a mistake in giving you so many sorts of brains observed the boy perhaps as the magician said you have an overdose and they may not agree with you  what had you to do with my brains asked scraps  a lot replied ojo old margolotte meant to give you only a fewjust enough to keep you goingbut when she wasnt looking i added a good many more of the best kinds i could find in the magicians cupboard  thanks said the girl dancing along the path ahead of ojo and then dancing back to his side if a few brains are good many brains must be better  but they ought to be evenly balanced said the boy and i had no time to be careful from the way youre acting i guess the dose was badly mixed  scraps hasnt enough brains to hurt her so dont worry remarked the cat which was trotting along in a very dainty and graceful manner the only brains worth considering are mine which are pink you can see em work  after walking a long time they came to a little brook that trickled across the path and here ojo sat down to rest and eat something from his basket he found that the magician had given him part of a loaf of bread and a slice of cheese he broke off some of the bread and was surprised to find the loaf just as large as it was before it was the same way with the cheese however much he broke off from the slice it remained exactly the same size  ah said he nodding wisely thats magic dr pipt has enchanted the bread and the cheese so it will last me all through my journey however much i eat  why do you put those things into your mouth asked scraps gazing at him in astonishment do you need more stuffing then why dont you use cotton such as i am stuffed with  i dont need that kind said ojo  but a mouth is to talk with isnt it  it is also to eat with replied the boy if i didnt put food into my mouth and eat it i would get hungry and starve  ah i didnt know that she said give me some  ojo handed her a bit of the bread and she put it in her mouth  what next she asked scarcely able to speak  chew it and swallow it said the boy  scraps tried that her pearl teeth were unable to chew the bread and beyond her mouth there was no opening being unable to swallow she threw away the bread and laughed  i must get hungry and starve for i cant eat she said  neither can i announced the cat but im not fool enough to try cant you understand that you and i are superior people and not made like these poor humans  why should i understand that or anything else asked the girl dont bother my head by asking conundrums i beg of you just let me discover myself in my own way  with this she began amusing herself by leaping across the brook and back again  be careful or youll fall in the water warned ojo  never mind  youd better if you get wet youll be soggy and cant walk your colors might run too he said  dont my colors run whenever i run she asked  not in the way i mean if they get wet the reds and greens and yellows and purples of your patches might run into each other and become just a blurno color at all you know  then said the patchwork girl ill be careful for if i spoiled my splendid colors i would cease to be beautiful  pah sneered the glass cat such colors are not beautiful theyre ugly and in bad taste please notice that my body has no color at all im transparent except for my exquisite red heart and my lovely pink brainsyou can see em work  shooshooshoo cried scraps dancing around and laughing and your horrid green eyes miss bungle you cant see your eyes but we can and i notice youre very proud of what little color you have shoo miss bungle shooshooshoo if you were all colors and many colors as i am youd be too stuck up for anything she leaped over the cat and back again and the startled bungle crept close to a tree to escape her this made scraps laugh more heartily than ever and she said      whooptedoodledoo     the cat has lost her shoe     her tootsies bare but she dont care     so whats the odds to you   dear me ojo said the cat dont you think the creature is a little bit crazy  it may be he answered with a puzzled look  if she continues her insults ill scratch off her suspenderbutton eyes declared the cat  dont quarrel please pleaded the boy rising to resume the journey let us be good comrades and as happy and cheerful as possible for we are likely to meet with plenty of trouble on our way  it was nearly sundown when they came to the edge of the forest and saw spread out before them a delightful landscape there were broad blue fields stretching for miles over the valley which was dotted everywhere with pretty blue domed houses none of which however was very near to the place where they stood just at the point where the path left the forest stood a tiny house covered with leaves from the trees and before this stood a munchkin man with an axe in his hand he seemed very much surprised when ojo and scraps and the glass cat came out of the woods but as the patchwork girl approached nearer he sat down upon a bench and laughed so hard that he could not speak for a long time  this man was a woodchopper and lived all alone in the little house he had bushy blue whiskers and merry blue eyes and his blue clothes were quite old and worn  mercy me exclaimed the woodchopper when at last he could stop laughing who would think such a funny harlequin lived in the land of oz where did you come from crazyquilt  do you mean me asked the patchwork girl  of course he replied  you misjudge my ancestry im not a crazyquilt im patchwork she said  theres no difference he replied beginning to laugh again when my old grandmother sews such things together she calls it a crazyquilt but i never thought such a jumble could come to life  it was the magic powder that did it explained ojo  oh then you have come from the crooked magician on the mountain i might have known it forwell i declare heres a glass cat but the magician will get in trouble for this its against the law for anyone to work magic except glinda the good and the royal wizard of oz if you peopleor thingsor glass spectaclesor crazyquiltsor whatever you are go near the emerald city youll be arrested  were going there anyhow declared scraps sitting upon the bench and swinging her stuffed legs      if any of us takes a rest     well be arrested sure     and get no restitution     cause the rest we must endure   i see said the woodchopper nodding youre as crazy as the crazyquilt youre made of  she really is crazy remarked the glass cat but that isnt to be wondered at when you remember how many different things shes made of for my part im made of pure glassexcept my jewel heart and my pretty pink brains did you notice my brains stranger you can see em work  so i can replied the woodchopper but i cant see that they accomplish much a glass cat is a useless sort of thing but a patchwork girl is really useful she makes me laugh and laughter is the best thing in life there was once a woodchopper a friend of mine who was made all of tin and i used to laugh every time i saw him  a tin woodchopper said ojo that is strange  my friend wasnt always tin said the man but he was careless with his axe and used to chop himself very badly whenever he lost an arm or a leg he had it replaced with tin so after a while he was all tin  and could he chop wood then asked the boy  he could if he didnt rust his tin joints but one day he met dorothy in the forest and went with her to the emerald city where he made his fortune he is now one of the favorites of princess ozma and she has made him the emperor of the winkiesthe country where all is yellow  who is dorothy inquired the patchwork girl  a little maid who used to live in kansas but is now a princess of oz shes ozmas best friend they say and lives with her in the royal palace  is dorothy made of tin inquired ojo  is she patchwork like me inquired scraps  no said the man dorothy is flesh just as i am i know of only one tin person and that is nick chopper the tin woodman and there will never be but one patchwork girl for any magician that sees you will refuse to make another one like you  i suppose we shall see the tin woodman for we are going to the country of the winkies said the boy  what for asked the woodchopper  to get the left wing of a yellow butterfly  it is a long journey declared the man and you will go through lonely parts of oz and cross rivers and traverse dark forests before you get there  suits me all right said scraps ill get a chance to see the country  youre crazy girl better crawl into a ragbag and hide there or give yourself to some little girl to play with those who travel are likely to meet trouble thats why i stay at home  the woodchopper then invited them all to stay the night at his little hut but they were anxious to get on and so left him and continued along the path which was broader now and more distinct  they expected to reach some other house before it grew dark but the twilight was brief and ojo soon began to fear they had made a mistake in leaving the woodchopper  i can scarcely see the path he said at last can you see it scraps  no replied the patchwork girl who was holding fast to the boys arm so he could guide her  i can see declared the glass cat my eyes are better than yours and my pink brains  never mind your pink brains please said ojo hastily just run ahead and show us the way wait a minute and ill tie a string to you for then you can lead us  he got a string from his pocket and tied it around the cats neck and after that the creature guided them along the path they had proceeded in this way for about an hour when a twinkling blue light appeared ahead of them  good theres a house at last cried ojo when we reach it the good people will surely welcome us and give us a nights lodging but however far they walked the light seemed to get no nearer so by and by the cat stopped short saying  i think the light is traveling too and we shall never be able to catch up with it but here is a house by the roadside so why go farther  where is the house bungle  just here beside us scraps  ojo was now able to see a small house near the pathway it was dark and silent but the boy was tired and wanted to rest so he went up to the door and knocked  who is there cried a voice from within  i am ojo the unlucky and with me are miss scraps patchwork and the glass cat he replied  what do you want asked the voice  a place to sleep said ojo  come in then but dont make any noise and you must go directly to bed returned the voice  ojo unlatched the door and entered it was very dark inside and he could see nothing at all but the cat exclaimed why theres no one here  there must be said the boy some one spoke to me  i can see everything in the room replied the cat and no one is present but ourselves but here are three beds all made up so we may as well go to sleep  what is sleep inquired the patchwork girl  its what you do when you go to bed said ojo  but why do you go to bed persisted the patchwork girl  here here you are making altogether too much noise cried the voice they had heard before keep quiet strangers and go to bed  the cat which could see in the dark looked sharply around for the owner of the voice but could discover no one although the voice had seemed close beside them she arched her back a little and seemed afraid then she whispered to ojo come and led him to a bed  with his hands the boy felt of the bed and found it was big and soft with feather pillows and plenty of blankets so he took off his shoes and hat and crept into the bed then the cat led scraps to another bed and the patchwork girl was puzzled to know what to do with it  lie down and keep quiet whispered the cat warningly  cant i sing asked scraps  no  cant i whistle asked scraps  no  cant i dance till morning if i want to asked scraps  you must keep quiet said the cat in a soft voice  i dont want to replied the patchwork girl speaking as loudly as usual what right have you to order me around if i want to talk or yell or whistle  before she could say anything more an unseen hand seized her firmly and threw her out of the door which closed behind her with a sharp slam she found herself bumping and rolling in the road and when she got up and tried to open the door of the house again she found it locked  what has happened to scraps asked ojo  never mind lets go to sleep or something will happen to us answered the glass cat  so ojo snuggled down in his bed and fell asleep and he was so tired that he never wakened until broad daylight     chapter seven  the troublesome phonograph   when the boy opened his eyes next morning he looked carefully around the room these small munchkin houses seldom had more than one room in them that in which ojo now found himself had three beds set all in a row on one side of it the glass cat lay asleep on one bed ojo was in the second and the third was neatly made up and smoothed for the day on the other side of the room was a round table on which breakfast was already placed smoking hot only one chair was drawn up to the table where a place was set for one person no one seemed to be in the room except the boy and bungle  ojo got up and put on his shoes finding a toilet stand at the head of his bed he washed his face and hands and brushed his hair then he went to the table and said  i wonder if this is my breakfast  eat it commanded a voice at his side so near that ojo jumped but no person could he see  he was hungry and the breakfast looked good so he sat down and ate all he wanted then rising he took his hat and wakened the glass cat  come on bungle said he we must go  he cast another glance about the room and speaking to the air he said whoever lives here has been kind to me and im much obliged  there was no answer so he took his basket and went out the door the cat following him in the middle of the path sat the patchwork girl playing with pebbles she had picked up  oh there you are she exclaimed cheerfully i thought you were never coming out it has been daylight a long time  what did you do all night asked the boy  sat here and watched the stars and the moon she replied theyre interesting i never saw them before you know  of course not said ojo  you were crazy to act so badly and get thrown outdoors remarked bungle as they renewed their journey  thats all right said scraps if i hadnt been thrown out i wouldnt have seen the stars nor the big gray wolf  what wolf inquired ojo  the one that came to the door of the house three times during the night  i dont see why that should be said the boy thoughtfully there was plenty to eat in that house for i had a fine breakfast and i slept in a nice bed  dont you feel tired asked the patchwork girl noticing that the boy yawned  why yes im as tired as i was last night and yet i slept very well  and arent you hungry  its strange replied ojo i had a good breakfast and yet i think ill now eat some of my crackers and cheese  scraps danced up and down the path then she sang      kizzlekazzlekore     the wolf is at the door     theres nothing to eat but a bone without meat     and a bill from the grocery store   what does that mean asked ojo  dont ask me replied scraps i say what comes into my head but of course i know nothing of a grocery store or bones without meat orvery much else  no said the cat shes stark staring raving crazy and her brains cant be pink for they dont work properly  bother the brains cried scraps who cares for em anyhow have you noticed how beautiful my patches are in this sunlight  just then they heard a sound as of footsteps pattering along the path behind them and all three turned to see what was coming to their astonishment they beheld a small round table running as fast as its four spindle legs could carry it and to the top was screwed fast a phonograph with a big gold horn  hold on shouted the phonograph wait for me  goodness me its that music thing which the crooked magician scattered the powder of life over said ojo  so it is returned bungle in a grumpy tone of voice and then as the phonograph overtook them the glass cat added sternly what are you doing here anyhow  ive run away said the music thing after you left old dr pipt and i had a dreadful quarrel and he threatened to smash me to pieces if i didnt keep quiet of course i wouldnt do that because a talkingmachine is supposed to talk and make a noiseand sometimes music so i slipped out of the house while the magician was stirring his four kettles and ive been running after you all night now that ive found such pleasant company i can talk and play tunes all i want to  ojo was greatly annoyed by this unwelcome addition to their party at first he did not know what to say to the newcomer but a little thought decided him not to make friends  we are traveling on important business he declared and youll excuse me if i say we cant be bothered  how very impolite exclaimed the phonograph  im sorry but its true said the boy youll have to go somewhere else  this is very unkind treatment i must say whined the phonograph in an injured tone everyone seems to hate me and yet i was intended to amuse people  it isnt you we hate especially observed the glass cat its your dreadful music when i lived in the same room with you i was much annoyed by your squeaky horn it growls and grumbles and clicks and scratches so it spoils the music and your machinery rumbles so that the racket drowns every tune you attempt  that isnt my fault its the fault of my records i must admit that i havent a clear record answered the machine  just the same youll have to go away said ojo  wait a minute cried scraps this music thing interests me i remember to have heard music when i first came to life and i would like to hear it again what is your name my poor abused phonograph  victor columbia edison it answered  well i shall call you vic for short said the patchwork girl go ahead and play something  itll drive you crazy warned the cat  im crazy now according to your statement loosen up and reel out the music vic  the only record i have with me explained the phonograph is one the magician attached just before we had our quarrel its a highly classical composition  a what inquired scraps  it is classical music and is considered the best and most puzzling ever manufactured youre supposed to like it whether you do or not and if you dont the proper thing is to look as if you did understand  not in the least said scraps  then listen  at once the machine began to play and in a few minutes ojo put his hands to his ears to shut out the sounds and the cat snarled and scraps began to laugh  cut it out vic she said thats enough  but the phonograph continued playing the dreary tune so ojo seized the crank jerked it free and threw it into the road however the moment the crank struck the ground it bounded back to the machine again and began winding it up and still the music played  lets run cried scraps and they all started and ran down the path as fast as they could go but the phonograph was right behind them and could run and play at the same time it called out reproachfully  whats the matter dont you love classical music  no vic said scraps halting we will passical the classical and preserve what joy we have left i havent any nerves thank goodness but your music makes my cotton shrink  then turn over my record theres a ragtime tune on the other side said the machine  whats ragtime  the opposite of classical  all right said scraps and turned over the record  the phonograph now began to play a jerky jumble of sounds which proved so bewildering that after a moment scraps stuffed her patchwork apron into the gold horn and cried stopstop thats the other extreme its extremely bad  muffled as it was the phonograph played on  if you dont shut off that music ill smash your record threatened ojo  the music stopped at that and the machine turned its horn from one to another and said with great indignation whats the matter now is it possible you cant appreciate ragtime  scraps ought to being rags herself said the cat but i simply cant stand it it makes my whiskers curl  it is indeed dreadful exclaimed ojo with a shudder  its enough to drive a crazy lady mad murmured the patchwork girl ill tell you what vic she added as she smoothed out her apron and put it on again for some reason or other youve missed your guess youre not a concert youre a nuisance  music hath charms to soothe the savage breast asserted the phonograph sadly  then were not savages i advise you to go home and beg the magicians pardon  never hed smash me  thats what we shall do if you stay here ojo declared  run along vic and bother some one else advised scraps find some one who is real wicked and stay with him till he repents in that way you can do some good in the world  the music thing turned silently away and trotted down a side path toward a distant munchkin village  is that the way we go asked bungle anxiously  no said ojo i think we shall keep straight ahead for this path is the widest and best when we come to some house we will inquire the way to the emerald city     chapter eight  the foolish owl and the wise donkey   on they went and half an hours steady walking brought them to a house somewhat better than the two they had already passed it stood close to the roadside and over the door was a sign that read miss foolish owl and mr wise donkey public advisers  when ojo read this sign aloud scraps said laughingly well here is a place to get all the advice we want maybe more than we need lets go in  the boy knocked at the door  come in called a deep bass voice  so they opened the door and entered the house where a little lightbrown donkey dressed in a blue apron and a blue cap was engaged in dusting the furniture with a blue cloth on a shelf over the window sat a great blue owl with a blue sunbonnet on her head blinking her big round eyes at the visitors  good morning said the donkey in his deep voice which seemed bigger than he was did you come to us for advice  why we came anyhow replied scraps and now we are here we may as well have some advice its free isnt it  certainly said the donkey advice doesnt cost anythingunless you follow it permit me to say by the way that you are the queerest lot of travelers that ever came to my shop judging you merely by appearances i think youd better talk to the foolish owl yonder  they turned to look at the bird which fluttered its wings and stared back at them with its big eyes  hoottitoottitoot cried the owl      fiddlecumfoo     howdydo     riddlecum tiddlecum     tooralaloo   that beats your poetry scraps said ojo  its just nonsense declared the glass cat  but its good advice for the foolish said the donkey admiringly listen to my partner and you cant go wrong  said the owl in a grumbling voice      patchwork girl has come to life     no ones sweetheart no ones wife     lacking sense and loving fun     shell be snubbed by everyone   quite a compliment quite a compliment i declare exclaimed the donkey turning to look at scraps you are certainly a wonder my dear and i fancy youd make a splendid pincushion if you belonged to me id wear smoked glasses when i looked at you  why asked the patchwork girl  because you are so gay and gaudy  it is my beauty that dazzles you she asserted you munchkin people all strut around in your stupid blue color while i  you are wrong in calling me a munchkin interrupted the donkey for i was born in the land of mo and came to visit the land of oz on the day it was shut off from all the rest of the world so here i am obliged to stay and i confess it is a very pleasant country to live in  hoottitoot cried the owl      ojos searching for a charm     cause unc nunkies come to harm     charms are scarce theyre hard to get     ojos got a job you bet   is the owl so very foolish asked the boy  extremely so replied the donkey notice what vulgar expressions she uses but i admire the owl for the reason that she is positively foolish owls are supposed to be so very wise generally that a foolish one is unusual and you perhaps know that anything or anyone unusual is sure to be interesting to the wise  the owl flapped its wings again muttering these words      its hard to be a glassy cat     no cat can be more hard than that     shes so transparent every act     is clear to us and thats a fact   have you noticed my pink brains inquired bungle proudly you can see em work  not in the daytime said the donkey she cant see very well by day poor thing but her advice is excellent i advise you all to follow it  the owl hasnt given us any advice as yet the boy declared  no then what do you call all those sweet poems  just foolishness replied ojo scraps does the same thing  foolishness of course to be sure the foolish owl must be foolish or she wouldnt be the foolish owl you are very complimentary to my partner indeed asserted the donkey rubbing his front hoofs together as if highly pleased  the sign says that you are wise remarked scraps to the donkey i wish you would prove it  with great pleasure returned the beast put me to the test my dear patches and ill prove my wisdom in the wink of an eye  what is the best way to get to the emerald city asked ojo  walk said the donkey  i know but what road shall i take was the boys next question  the road of yellow bricks of course it leads directly to the emerald city  and how shall we find the road of yellow bricks  by keeping along the path you have been following youll come to the yellow bricks pretty soon and youll know them when you see them because theyre the only yellow things in the blue country  thank you said the boy at last you have told me something  is that the extent of your wisdom asked scraps  no replied the donkey i know many other things but they wouldnt interest you so ill give you a last word of advice move on for the sooner you do that the sooner youll get to the emerald city of oz  hoottitoottitoottitoo screeched the owl      off you go fast or slow     where youre going you dont know     patches bungle munchkin lad     facing fortunes good and bad     meeting dangers grave and sad     sometimes worried sometimes glad     where youre going you dont know     nor do i but off you go   sounds like a hint to me said the patchwork girl  then lets take it and go replied ojo  they said goodbye to the wise donkey and the foolish owl and at once resumed their journey     chapter nine  they meet the woozy   there seem to be very few houses around here after all remarked ojo after they had walked for a time in silence  never mind said scraps we are not looking for houses but rather the road of yellow bricks wont it be funny to run across something yellow in this dismal blue country  there are worse colors than yellow in this country asserted the glass cat in a spiteful tone  oh do you mean the pink pebbles you call your brains and your red heart and green eyes asked the patchwork girl  no i mean you if you must know it growled the cat  youre jealous laughed scraps youd give your whiskers for a lovely variegated complexion like mine  i wouldnt retorted the cat ive the clearest complexion in the world and i dont employ a beautydoctor either  i see you dont said scraps  please dont quarrel begged ojo this is an important journey and quarreling makes me discouraged to be brave one must be cheerful so i hope you will be as goodtempered as possible  they had traveled some distance when suddenly they faced a high fence which barred any further progress straight ahead it ran directly across the road and enclosed a small forest of tall trees set close together when the group of adventurers peered through the bars of the fence they thought this forest looked more gloomy and forbidding than any they had ever seen before  they soon discovered that the path they had been following now made a bend and passed around the enclosure but what made ojo stop and look thoughtful was a sign painted on the fence which read      beware of the woozy   that means he said that theres a woozy inside that fence and the woozy must be a dangerous animal or they wouldnt tell people to beware of it  lets keep out then replied scraps that path is outside the fence and mr woozy may have all his little forest to himself for all we care  but one of our errands is to find a woozy ojo explained the magician wants me to get three hairs from the end of a woozys tail  lets go on and find some other woozy suggested the cat this one is ugly and dangerous or they wouldnt cage him up maybe we shall find another that is tame and gentle  perhaps there isnt any other at all answered ojo the sign doesnt say beware a woozy it says beware the woozy which may mean theres only one in all the land of oz  then said scraps suppose we go in and find him very likely if we ask him politely to let us pull three hairs out of the tip of his tail he wont hurt us  it would hurt him im sure and that would make him cross said the cat  you neednt worry bungle remarked the patchwork girl for if there is danger you can climb a tree ojo and i are not afraid are we ojo  i am a little the boy admitted but this danger must be faced if we intend to save poor unc nunkie how shall we get over the fence  climb answered scraps and at once she began climbing up the rows of bars ojo followed and found it more easy than he had expected when they got to the top of the fence they began to get down on the other side and soon were in the forest the glass cat being small crept between the lower bars and joined them  here there was no path of any sort so they entered the woods the boy leading the way and wandered through the trees until they were nearly in the center of the forest they now came upon a clear space in which stood a rocky cave  so far they had met no living creature but when ojo saw the cave he knew it must be the den of the woozy  it is hard to face any savage beast without a sinking of the heart but still more terrifying is it to face an unknown beast which you have never seen even a picture of so there is little wonder that the pulses of the munchkin boy beat fast as he and his companions stood facing the cave the opening was perfectly square and about big enough to admit a goat  i guess the woozy is asleep said scraps shall i throw in a stone to waken him  no please dont answered ojo his voice trembling a little im in no hurry  but he had not long to wait for the woozy heard the sound of voices and came trotting out of his cave as this is the only woozy that has ever lived either in the land of oz or out of it i must describe it to you  the creature was all squares and flat surfaces and edges its head was an exact square like one of the buildingblocks a child plays with therefore it had no ears but heard sounds through two openings in the upper corners its nose being in the center of a square surface was flat while the mouth was formed by the opening of the lower edge of the block the body of the woozy was much larger than its head but was likewise blockshapedbeing twice as long as it was wide and high the tail was square and stubby and perfectly straight and the four legs were made in the same way each being foursided the animal was covered with a thick smooth skin and had no hair at all except at the extreme end of its tail where there grew exactly three stiff stubby hairs the beast was dark blue in color and his face was not fierce nor ferocious in expression but rather goodhumored and droll  seeing the strangers the woozy folded his hind legs as if they had been hinged and sat down to look his visitors over  well well he exclaimed what a queer lot you are at first i thought some of those miserable munchkin farmers had come to annoy me but i am relieved to find you in their stead it is plain to me that you are a remarkable groupas remarkable in your way as i am in mineand so you are welcome to my domain nice place isnt it but lonesomedreadfully lonesome  why did they shut you up here asked scraps who was regarding the queer square creature with much curiosity  because i eat up all the honeybees which the munchkin farmers who live around here keep to make them honey  are you fond of eating honeybees inquired the boy  very they are really delicious but the farmers did not like to lose their bees and so they tried to destroy me of course they couldnt do that  why not  my skin is so thick and tough that nothing can get through it to hurt me so finding they could not destroy me they drove me into this forest and built a fence around me unkind wasnt it  but what do you eat now asked ojo  nothing at all ive tried the leaves from the trees and the mosses and creeping vines but they dont seem to suit my taste so there being no honeybees here ive eaten nothing for years  you must be awfully hungry said the boy ive got some bread and cheese in my basket would you like that kind of food  give me a nibble and i will try it then i can tell you better whether it is grateful to my appetite returned the woozy  so the boy opened his basket and broke a piece off the loaf of bread he tossed it toward the woozy who cleverly caught it in his mouth and ate it in a twinkling  thats rather good declared the animal any more  try some cheese said ojo and threw down a piece  the woozy ate that too and smacked its long thin lips  thats mighty good it exclaimed any more  plenty replied ojo so he sat down on a stump and fed the woozy bread and cheese for a long time for no matter how much the boy broke off the loaf and the slice remained just as big  thatll do said the woozy at last im quite full i hope the strange food wont give me indigestion  i hope not said ojo its what i eat  well i must say im much obliged and im glad you came announced the beast is there anything i can do in return for your kindness  yes said ojo earnestly you have it in your power to do me a great favor if you will  what is it asked the woozy name the favor and i will grant it  ii want three hairs from the tip of your tail said ojo with some hesitation  three hairs why thats all i haveon my tail or anywhere else exclaimed the beast  i know but i want them very much  they are my sole ornaments my prettiest feature said the woozy uneasily if i give up those three hairs iim just a blockhead  yet i must have them insisted the boy firmly and he then told the woozy all about the accident to unc nunkie and margolotte and how the three hairs were to be a part of the magic charm that would restore them to life the beast listened with attention and when ojo had finished the recital it said with a sigh  i always keep my word for i pride myself on being square so you may have the three hairs and welcome i think under such circumstances it would be selfish in me to refuse you  thank you thank you very much cried the boy joyfully may i pull out the hairs now  any time you like answered the woozy  so ojo went up to the queer creature and taking hold of one of the hairs began to pull he pulled harder he pulled with all his might but the hair remained fast  whats the trouble asked the woozy which ojo had dragged here and there all around the clearing in his endeavor to pull out the hair  it wont come said the boy panting  i was afraid of that declared the beast youll have to pull harder  ill help you exclaimed scraps coming to the boys side you pull the hair and ill pull you and together we ought to get it out easily  wait a jiffy called the woozy and then it went to a tree and hugged it with its front paws so that its body couldnt be dragged around by the pull all ready now go ahead  ojo grasped the hair with both hands and pulled with all his strength while scraps seized the boy around his waist and added her strength to his but the hair wouldnt budge instead it slipped out of ojos hands and he and scraps both rolled upon the ground in a heap and never stopped until they bumped against the rocky cave  give it up advised the glass cat as the boy arose and assisted the patchwork girl to her feet a dozen strong men couldnt pull out those hairs i believe theyre clinched on the under side of the woozys thick skin  then what shall i do asked the boy despairingly if on our return i fail to take these three hairs to the crooked magician the other things i have come to seek will be of no use at all and we cannot restore unc nunkie and margolotte to life  theyre goners i guess said the patchwork girl  never mind added the cat i cant see that old unc and margolotte are worth all this trouble anyhow  but ojo did not feel that way he was so disheartened that he sat down upon a stump and began to cry  the woozy looked at the boy thoughtfully  why dont you take me with you asked the beast then when at last you get to the magicians house he can surely find some way to pull out those three hairs  ojo was overjoyed at this suggestion  thats it he cried wiping away the tears and springing to his feet with a smile if i take the three hairs to the magician it wont matter if they are still in your body  it cant matter in the least agreed the woozy  come on then said the boy picking up his basket let us start at once i have several other things to find you know  but the glass cat gave a little laugh and inquired in her scornful way  how do you intend to get the beast out of this forest  that puzzled them all for a time  let us go to the fence and then we may find a way suggested scraps so they walked through the forest to the fence reaching it at a point exactly opposite that where they had entered the enclosure  how did you get in asked the woozy  we climbed over answered ojo  i cant do that said the beast im a very swift runner for i can overtake a honeybee as it flies and i can jump very high which is the reason they made such a tall fence to keep me in but i cant climb at all and im too big to squeeze between the bars of the fence  ojo tried to think what to do  can you dig he asked  no answered the woozy for i have no claws my feet are quite flat on the bottom of them nor can i gnaw away the boards as i have no teeth  youre not such a terrible creature after all remarked scraps  you havent heard me growl or you wouldnt say that declared the woozy when i growl the sound echoes like thunder all through the valleys and woodlands and children tremble with fear and women cover their heads with their aprons and big men run and hide i suppose there is nothing in the world so terrible to listen to as the growl of a woozy  please dont growl then begged ojo earnestly  there is no danger of my growling for i am not angry only when angry do i utter my fearful earsplitting soulshuddering growl also when i am angry my eyes flash fire whether i growl or not  real fire asked ojo  of course real fire do you suppose theyd flash imitation fire inquired the woozy in an injured tone  in that case ive solved the riddle cried scraps dancing with glee those fenceboards are made of wood and if the woozy stands close to the fence and lets his eyes flash fire they might set fire to the fence and burn it up then he could walk away with us easily being free  ah i have never thought of that plan or i would have been free long ago said the woozy but i cannot flash fire from my eyes unless i am very angry  cant you get angry bout something please asked ojo  ill try you just say krizzlekroo to me  will that make you angry inquired the boy  terribly angry  what does it mean asked scraps  i dont know thats what makes me so angry replied the woozy  he then stood close to the fence with his head near one of the boards and scraps called out krizzlekroo then ojo said krizzlekroo and the glass cat said krizzlekroo the woozy began to tremble with anger and small sparks darted from his eyes seeing this they all cried krizzlekroo together and that made the beasts eyes flash fire so fiercely that the fenceboard caught the sparks and began to smoke then it burst into flame and the woozy stepped back and said triumphantly  aha that did the business all right it was a happy thought for you to yell all together for that made me as angry as i have ever been fine sparks werent they  reglar fireworks replied scraps admiringly  in a few moments the board had burned to a distance of several feet leaving an opening big enough for them all to pass through ojo broke some branches from a tree and with them whipped the fire until it was extinguished  we dont want to burn the whole fence down said he for the flames would attract the attention of the munchkin farmers who would then come and capture the woozy again i guess theyll be rather surprised when they find hes escaped  so they will declared the woozy chuckling gleefully when they find im gone the farmers will be badly scared for theyll expect me to eat up their honeybees as i did before  that reminds me said the boy that you must promise not to eat honeybees while you are in our company  none at all  not a bee you would get us all into trouble and we cant afford to have any more trouble than is necessary ill feed you all the bread and cheese you want and that must satisfy you  all right ill promise said the woozy cheerfully and when i promise anything you can depend on it cause im square  i dont see what difference that makes observed the patchwork girl as they found the path and continued their journey the shape doesnt make a thing honest does it  of course it does returned the woozy very decidedly no one could trust that crooked magician for instance just because he is crooked but a square woozy couldnt do anything crooked if he wanted to  i am neither square nor crooked said scraps looking down at her plump body  no youre round so youre liable to do anything asserted the woozy do not blame me miss gorgeous if i regard you with suspicion many a satin ribbon has a cotton back  scraps didnt understand this but she had an uneasy misgiving that she had a cotton back herself it would settle down at times and make her squat and dumpy and then she had to roll herself in the road until her body stretched out again     chapter ten  shaggy man to the rescue   they had not gone very far before bungle who had run on ahead came bounding back to say that the road of yellow bricks was just before them at once they hurried forward to see what this famous road looked like  it was a broad road but not straight for it wandered over hill and dale and picked out the easiest places to go all its length and breadth was paved with smooth bricks of a bright yellow color so it was smooth and level except in a few places where the bricks had crumbled or been removed leaving holes that might cause the unwary to stumble  i wonder said ojo looking up and down the road which way to go  where are you bound for asked the woozy  the emerald city he replied  then go west said the woozy i know this road pretty well for ive chased many a honeybee over it  have you ever been to the emerald city asked scraps  no i am very shy by nature as you may have noticed so i havent mingled much in society  are you afraid of men inquired the patchwork girl  me with my heartrending growlmy horrible shudderful growl i should say not i am not afraid of anything declared the woozy  i wish i could say the same sighed ojo i dont think we need be afraid when we get to the emerald city for unc nunkie has told me that ozma our girl ruler is very lovely and kind and tries to help everyone who is in trouble but they say there are many dangers lurking on the road to the great fairy city and so we must be very careful  i hope nothing will break me said the glass cat in a nervous voice im a little brittle you know and cant stand many hard knocks  if anything should fade the colors of my lovely patches it would break my heart said the patchwork girl  im not sure you have a heart ojo reminded her  then it would break my cotton persisted scraps do you think they are all fast colors ojo she asked anxiously  they seem fast enough when you run he replied and then looking ahead of them he exclaimed oh what lovely trees  they were certainly pretty to look upon and the travelers hurried forward to observe them more closely  why they are not trees at all said scraps they are just monstrous plants  that is what they really were masses of great broad leaves which rose from the ground far into the air until they towered twice as high as the top of the patchwork girls head who was a little taller than ojo the plants formed rows on both sides of the road and from each plant rose a dozen or more of the big broad leaves which swayed continually from side to side although no wind was blowing but the most curious thing about the swaying leaves was their color they seemed to have a general groundwork of blue but here and there other colors glinted at times through the bluegorgeous yellows turning to pink purple orange and scarlet mingled with more sober browns and grayseach appearing as a blotch or stripe anywhere on a leaf and then disappearing to be replaced by some other color of a different shape the changeful coloring of the great leaves was very beautiful but it was bewildering as well and the novelty of the scene drew our travelers close to the line of plants where they stood watching them with rapt interest  suddenly a leaf bent lower than usual and touched the patchwork girl swiftly it enveloped her in its embrace covering her completely in its thick folds and then it swayed back upon its stem  why shes gone gasped ojo in amazement and listening carefully he thought he could hear the muffled screams of scraps coming from the center of the folded leaf but before he could think what he ought to do to save her another leaf bent down and captured the glass cat rolling around the little creature until she was completely hidden and then straightening up again upon its stem  look out cried the woozy run run fast or you are lost  ojo turned and saw the woozy running swiftly up the road but the last leaf of the row of plants seized the beast even as he ran and instantly he disappeared from sight  the boy had no chance to escape half a dozen of the great leaves were bending toward him from different directions and as he stood hesitating one of them clutched him in its embrace in a flash he was in the dark then he felt himself gently lifted until he was swaying in the air with the folds of the leaf hugging him on all sides  at first he struggled hard to escape crying out in anger let me go let me go but neither struggles nor protests had any effect whatever the leaf held him firmly and he was a prisoner  then ojo quieted himself and tried to think despair fell upon him when he remembered that all his little party had been captured even as he was and there was none to save them  i might have expected it he sobbed miserably im ojo the unlucky and something dreadful was sure to happen to me  he pushed against the leaf that held him and found it to be soft but thick and firm it was like a great bandage all around him and he found it difficult to move his body or limbs in order to change their position  the minutes passed and became hours ojo wondered how long one could live in such a condition and if the leaf would gradually sap his strength and even his life in order to feed itself the little munchkin boy had never heard of any person dying in the land of oz but he knew one could suffer a great deal of pain his greatest fear at this time was that he would always remain imprisoned in the beautiful leaf and never see the light of day again  no sound came to him through the leaf all around was intense silence ojo wondered if scraps had stopped screaming or if the folds of the leaf prevented his hearing her by and by he thought he heard a whistle as of some one whistling a tune yes it really must be some one whistling he decided for he could follow the strains of a pretty munchkin melody that unc nunkie used to sing to him the sounds were low and sweet and although they reached ojos ears very faintly they were clear and harmonious  could the leaf whistle ojo wondered nearer and nearer came the sounds and then they seemed to be just the other side of the leaf that was hugging him  suddenly the whole leaf toppled and fell carrying the boy with it and while he sprawled at full length the folds slowly relaxed and set him free he scrambled quickly to his feet and found that a strange man was standing before hima man so curious in appearance that the boy stared with round eyes  he was a big man with shaggy whiskers shaggy eyebrows shaggy hairbut kindly blue eyes that were gentle as those of a cow on his head was a green velvet hat with a jeweled band which was all shaggy around the brim rich but shaggy laces were at his throat a coat with shaggy edges was decorated with diamond buttons the velvet breeches had jeweled buckles at the knees and shags all around the bottoms on his breast hung a medallion bearing a picture of princess dorothy of oz and in his hand as he stood looking at ojo was a sharp knife shaped like a dagger  oh exclaimed ojo greatly astonished at the sight of this stranger and then he added who has saved me sir  cant you see replied the other with a smile im the shaggy man  yes i can see that said the boy nodding was it you who rescued me from the leaf  none other you may be sure but take care or i shall have to rescue you again  ojo gave a jump for he saw several broad leaves leaning toward him but the shaggy man began to whistle again and at the sound the leaves all straightened up on their stems and kept still  the man now took ojos arm and led him up the road past the last of the great plants and not till he was safely beyond their reach did he cease his whistling  you see the music charms em said he singing or whistlingit doesnt matter whichmakes em behave and nothing else will i always whistle as i go by em and so they always let me alone today as i went by whistling i saw a leaf curled and knew there must be something inside it i cut down the leaf with my knife andout you popped lucky i passed by wasnt it  you were very kind said ojo and i thank you will you please rescue my companions also  what companions asked the shaggy man  the leaves grabbed them all said the boy theres a patchwork girl and  a what  a girl made of patchwork you know shes alive and her name is scraps and theres a glass cat  glass asked the shaggy man  all glass  and alive  yes said ojo she has pink brains and theres a woozy  whats a woozy inquired the shaggy man  why iicant describe it answered the boy greatly perplexed but its a queer animal with three hairs on the tip of its tail that wont come out and  what wont come out asked the shaggy man the tail  the hairs wont come out but youll see the woozy if youll please rescue it and then youll know just what it is  of course said the shaggy man nodding his shaggy head and then he walked back among the plants still whistling and found the three leaves which were curled around ojos traveling companions the first leaf he cut down released scraps and on seeing her the shaggy man threw back his shaggy head opened wide his mouth and laughed so shaggily and yet so merrily that scraps liked him at once then he took off his hat and made her a low bow saying  my dear youre a wonder i must introduce you to my friend the scarecrow  when he cut down the second leaf he rescued the glass cat and bungle was so frightened that she scampered away like a streak and soon had joined ojo when she sat beside him panting and trembling the last plant of all the row had captured the woozy and a big bunch in the center of the curled leaf showed plainly where he was with his sharp knife the shaggy man sliced off the stem of the leaf and as it fell and unfolded out trotted the woozy and escaped beyond the reach of any more of the dangerous plants     chapter eleven  a good friend   soon the entire party was gathered on the road of yellow bricks quite beyond the reach of the beautiful but treacherous plants the shaggy man staring first at one and then at the other seemed greatly pleased and interested  ive seen queer things since i came to the land of oz said he but never anything queerer than this band of adventurers let us sit down a while and have a talk and get acquainted  havent you always lived in the land of oz asked the munchkin boy  no i used to live in the big outside world but i came here once with dorothy and ozma let me stay  how do you like oz asked scraps isnt the country and the climate grand  its the finest country in all the world even if it is a fairyland and im happy every minute i live in it said the shaggy man but tell me something about yourselves  so ojo related the story of his visit to the house of the crooked magician and how he met there the glass cat and how the patchwork girl was brought to life and of the terrible accident to unc nunkie and margolotte then he told how he had set out to find the five different things which the magician needed to make a charm that would restore the marble figures to life one requirement being three hairs from a woozys tail  we found the woozy explained the boy and he agreed to give us the three hairs but we couldnt pull them out so we had to bring the woozy along with us  i see returned the shaggy man who had listened with interest to the story but perhaps i who am big and strong can pull those three hairs from the woozys tail  try it if you like said the woozy  so the shaggy man tried it but pull as hard as he could he failed to get the hairs out of the woozys tail so he sat down again and wiped his shaggy face with a shaggy silk handkerchief and said  it doesnt matter if you can keep the woozy until you get the rest of the things you need you can take the beast and his three hairs to the crooked magician and let him find a way to extract em what are the other things you are to find  one said ojo is a sixleaved clover  you ought to find that in the fields around the emerald city said the shaggy man there is a law against picking sixleaved clovers but i think i can get ozma to let you have one  thank you replied ojo the next thing is the left wing of a yellow butterfly  for that you must go to the winkie country the shaggy man declared ive never noticed any butterflies there but that is the yellow country of oz and its ruled by a good friend of mine the tin woodman  oh ive heard of him exclaimed ojo he must be a wonderful man  so he is and his heart is wonderfully kind im sure the tin woodman will do all in his power to help you to save your unc nunkie and poor margolotte  the next thing i must find said the munchkin boy is a gill of water from a dark well  indeed well that is more difficult said the shaggy man scratching his left ear in a puzzled way ive never heard of a dark well have you  no said ojo  do you know where one may be found inquired the shaggy man  i cant imagine said ojo  then we must ask the scarecrow  the scarecrow but surely sir a scarecrow cant know anything  most scarecrows dont i admit answered the shaggy man but this scarecrow of whom i speak is very intelligent he claims to possess the best brains in all oz  better than mine asked scraps  better than mine echoed the glass cat mine are pink and you can see em work  well you cant see the scarecrows brains work but they do a lot of clever thinking asserted the shaggy man if anyone knows where a dark well is its my friend the scarecrow  where does he live inquired ojo  he has a splendid castle in the winkie country near to the palace of his friend the tin woodman and he is often to be found in the emerald city where he visits dorothy at the royal palace  then we will ask him about the dark well said ojo  but what else does this crooked magician want asked the shaggy man  a drop of oil from a live mans body  oh but there isnt such a thing  that is what i thought replied ojo but the crooked magician said it wouldnt be called for by the recipe if it couldnt be found and therefore i must search until i find it  i wish you good luck said the shaggy man shaking his head doubtfully but i imagine youll have a hard job getting a drop of oil from a live mans body theres blood in a body but no oil  theres cotton in mine said scraps dancing a little jig  i dont doubt it returned the shaggy man admiringly youre a regular comforter and as sweet as patchwork can be all you lack is dignity  i hate dignity cried scraps kicking a pebble high in the air and then trying to catch it as it fell half the fools and all the wise folks are dignified and im neither the one nor the other  shes just crazy explained the glass cat  the shaggy man laughed  shes delightful in her way he said im sure dorothy will be pleased with her and the scarecrow will dote on her did you say you were traveling toward the emerald city  yes replied ojo i thought that the best place to go at first because the sixleaved clover may be found there  ill go with you said the shaggy man and show you the way  thank you exclaimed ojo i hope it wont put you out any  no said the other i wasnt going anywhere in particular ive been a rover all my life and although ozma has given me a suite of beautiful rooms in her palace i still get the wandering fever once in a while and start out to roam the country over ive been away from the emerald city several weeks this time and now that ive met you and your friends im sure it will interest me to accompany you to the great city of oz and introduce you to my friends  that will be very nice said the boy gratefully  i hope your friends are not dignified observed scraps  some are and some are not he answered but i never criticise my friends if they are really true friends they may be anything they like for all of me  theres some sense in that said scraps nodding her queer head in approval come on and lets get to the emerald city as soon as possible with this she ran up the path skipping and dancing and then turned to await them  it is quite a distance from here to the emerald city remarked the shaggy man so we shall not get there today nor tomorrow therefore let us take the jaunt in an easy manner im an old traveler and have found that i never gain anything by being in a hurry take it easy is my motto if you cant take it easy take it as easy as you can  after walking some distance over the road of yellow bricks ojo said he was hungry and would stop to eat some bread and cheese he offered a portion of the food to the shaggy man who thanked him but refused it  when i start out on my travels said he i carry along enough square meals to last me several weeks think ill indulge in one now as long as were stopping anyway  saying this he took a bottle from his pocket and shook from it a tablet about the size of one of ojos fingernails  that announced the shaggy man is a square meal in condensed form invention of the great professor wogglebug of the royal college of athletics it contains soup fish roast meat salad appledumplings ice cream and chocolatedrops all boiled down to this small size so it can be conveniently carried and swallowed when you are hungry and need a square meal  im square said the woozy give me one please  so the shaggy man gave the woozy a tablet from his bottle and the beast ate it in a twinkling  you have now had a six course dinner declared the shaggy man  pshaw said the woozy ungratefully i want to taste something theres no fun in that sort of eating  one should only eat to sustain life replied the shaggy man and that tablet is equal to a peck of other food  i dont care for it i want something i can chew and taste grumbled the woozy  you are quite wrong my poor beast said the shaggy man in a tone of pity think how tired your jaws would get chewing a square meal like this if it were not condensed to the size of a small tabletwhich you can swallow in a jiffy  chewing isnt tiresome its fun maintained the woozy i always chew the honeybees when i catch them give me some bread and cheese ojo  no no youve already eaten a big dinner protested the shaggy man  may be answered the woozy but i guess ill fool myself by munching some bread and cheese i may not be hungry having eaten all those things you gave me but i consider this eating business a matter of taste and i like to realize whats going into me  ojo gave the beast what he wanted but the shaggy man shook his shaggy head reproachfully and said there was no animal so obstinate or hard to convince as a woozy  at this moment a patter of footsteps was heard and looking up they saw the live phonograph standing before them it seemed to have passed through many adventures since ojo and his comrades last saw the machine for the varnish of its wooden case was all marred and dented and scratched in a way that gave it an aged and disreputable appearance  dear me exclaimed ojo staring hard what has happened to you  nothing much replied the phonograph in a sad and depressed voice ive had enough things thrown at me since i left you to stock a department store and furnish half a dozen bargaincounters  are you so broken up that you cant play asked scraps  no i still am able to grind out delicious music just now ive a record on tap that is really superb said the phonograph growing more cheerful  that is too bad remarked ojo weve no objection to you as a machine you know but as a musicmaker we hate you  then why was i ever invented demanded the machine in a tone of indignant protest  they looked at one another inquiringly but no one could answer such a puzzling question finally the shaggy man said  id like to hear the phonograph play  ojo sighed weve been very happy since we met you sir he said  i know but a little misery at times makes one appreciate happiness more tell me phony what is this record like which you say you have on tap  its a popular song sir in all civilized lands the common people have gone wild over it  makes civilized folks wild folks eh then its dangerous  wild with joy i mean explained the phonograph listen this song will prove a rare treat to you i know it made the author richfor an author it is called my lulu  then the phonograph began to play a strain of odd jerky sounds was followed by these words sung by a man through his nose with great vigor of expression      ah wants mah lulu mah coalblack lulu     ah wants mah looloo looloo looloo lu     ah loves mah lulu mah coalblack lulu     there aint nobody else loves looloo lu   hereshut that off cried the shaggy man springing to his feet what do you mean by such impertinence  its the latest popular song declared the phonograph speaking in a sulky tone of voice  a popular song  yes one that the feebleminded can remember the words of and those ignorant of music can whistle or sing that makes a popular song popular and the time is coming when it will take the place of all other songs  that time wont come to us just yet said the shaggy man sternly im something of a singer myself and i dont intend to be throttled by any lulus like your coalblack one i shall take you all apart mr phony and scatter your pieces far and wide over the country as a matter of kindness to the people you might meet if allowed to run around loose having performed this painful duty i shall  but before he could say more the phonograph turned and dashed up the road as fast as its four tablelegs could carry it and soon it had entirely disappeared from their view  the shaggy man sat down again and seemed well pleased some one else will save me the trouble of scattering that phonograph said he for it is not possible that such a musicmaker can last long in the land of oz when you are rested friends let us go on our way  during the afternoon the travelers found themselves in a lonely and uninhabited part of the country even the fields were no longer cultivated and the country began to resemble a wilderness the road of yellow bricks seemed to have been neglected and became uneven and more difficult to walk upon scrubby underbrush grew on either side of the way while huge rocks were scattered around in abundance  but this did not deter ojo and his friends from trudging on and they beguiled the journey with jokes and cheerful conversation toward evening they reached a crystal spring which gushed from a tall rock by the roadside and near this spring stood a deserted cabin said the shaggy man halting here  we may as well pass the night here where there is shelter for our heads and good water to drink road beyond here is pretty bad worst we shall have to travel so lets wait until morning before we tackle it  they agreed to this and ojo found some brushwood in the cabin and made a fire on the hearth the fire delighted scraps who danced before it until ojo warned her she might set fire to herself and burn up after that the patchwork girl kept at a respectful distance from the darting flames but the woozy lay down before the fire like a big dog and seemed to enjoy its warmth  for supper the shaggy man ate one of his tablets but ojo stuck to his bread and cheese as the most satisfying food he also gave a portion to the woozy  when darkness came on and they sat in a circle on the cabin floor facing the firelightthere being no furniture of any sort in the placeojo said to the shaggy man  wont you tell us a story  im not good at stories was the reply but i sing like a bird  raven or crow asked the glass cat  like a song bird ill prove it ill sing a song i composed myself dont tell anyone im a poet they might want me to write a book dont tell em i can sing or theyd want me to make records for that awful phonograph havent time to be a public benefactor so ill just sing you this little song for your own amusement  they were glad enough to be entertained and listened with interest while the shaggy man chanted the following verses to a tune that was not unpleasant      ill sing a song of ozland where wondrous creatures dwell     and fruits and flowers and shady bowers abound in every dell     where magic is a science and where no one shows surprise     if some amazing thing takes place before his very eyes      our rulers a bewitching girl whom fairies love to please     shes always kept her magic sceptre to enforce decrees     to make her people happy for her heart is kind and true     and to aid the needy and distressed is what she longs to do      and then theres princess dorothy as sweet as any rose     a lass from kansas where they dont grow fairies i suppose     and theres the brainy scarecrow with a body stuffed with straw     who utters words of wisdom rare that fill us all with awe      ill not forget nick chopper the woodman made of tin     whose tender heart thinks killing time is quite a dreadful sin     nor old professor wogglebug whos highly magnified     and looks so big to everyone that he is filled with pride      jack pumpkinheads a dear old chum who might be called a chump     but won renown by riding round upon a magic gump     the sawhorse is a splendid steed and though hes made of wood     he does as many thrilling stunts as any meat horse could      and now ill introduce a beast that evryone adores     the cowardly lion shakes with fear most evry time he roars     and yet he does the bravest things that any lion might     because he knows that cowardice is not considered right      theres tiktokhes a clockwork man and quite a funny sight     he talks and walks mechanically when hes wound up tight     and weve a hungry tiger who would babies love to eat     but never does because we feed him other kinds of meat      its hard to name all of the freaks this noble lands acquired     twould make my song so very long that you would soon be tired     but give attention while i mention one wise yellow hen     and nine fine tiny piglets living in a golden pen      just search the whole world oversail the seas from coast to coast     no other nation in creation queerer folk can boast     and now our rare museum will include a cat of glass     a woozy andlast but not leasta crazy patchwork lass   ojo was so pleased with this song that he applauded the singer by clapping his hands and scraps followed suit by clapping her padded fingers together although they made no noise the cat pounded on the floor with her glass pawsgently so as not to break themand the woozy which had been asleep woke up to ask what the row was about  i seldom sing in public for fear they might want me to start an opera company remarked the shaggy man who was pleased to know his effort was appreciated voice just now is a little out of training rusty perhaps  tell me said the patchwork girl earnestly do all those queer people you mention really live in the land of oz  every one of em i even forgot one thing dorothys pink kitten  for goodness sake exclaimed bungle sitting up and looking interested a pink kitten how absurd is it glass  no just ordinary kitten  then it cant amount to much i have pink brains and you can see em work  dorothys kitten is all pinkbrains and allexcept blue eyes names eureka great favorite at the royal palace said the shaggy man yawning  the glass cat seemed annoyed  do you think a pink kittencommon meatis as pretty as i am she asked  cant say tastes differ you know replied the shaggy man yawning again but heres a pointer that may be of service to you make friends with eureka and youll be solid at the palace  im solid now solid glass  you dont understand rejoined the shaggy man sleepily anyhow make friends with the pink kitten and youll be all right if the pink kitten despises you look out for breakers  would anyone at the royal palace break a glass cat  might you never can tell advise you to purr soft and look humbleif you can and now im going to bed  bungle considered the shaggy mans advice so carefully that her pink brains were busy long after the others of the party were fast asleep     chapter twelve  the giant porcupine   next morning they started out bright and early to follow the road of yellow bricks toward the emerald city the little munchkin boy was beginning to feel tired from the long walk and he had a great many things to think of and consider besides the events of the journey at the wonderful emerald city which he would presently reach were so many strange and curious people that he was half afraid of meeting them and wondered if they would prove friendly and kind above all else he could not drive from his mind the important errand on which he had come and he was determined to devote every energy to finding the things that were necessary to prepare the magic recipe he believed that until dear unc nunkie was restored to life he could feel no joy in anything and often he wished that unc could be with him to see all the astonishing things ojo was seeing but alas unc nunkie was now a marble statue in the house of the crooked magician and ojo must not falter in his efforts to save him  the country through which they were passing was still rocky and deserted with here and there a bush or a tree to break the dreary landscape ojo noticed one tree especially because it had such long silky leaves and was so beautiful in shape as he approached it he studied the tree earnestly wondering if any fruit grew on it or if it bore pretty flowers  suddenly he became aware that he had been looking at that tree a long timeat least for five minutesand it had remained in the same position although the boy had continued to walk steadily on so he stopped short and when he stopped the tree and all the landscape as well as his companions moved on before him and left him far behind  ojo uttered such a cry of astonishment that it aroused the shaggy man who also halted the others then stopped too and walked back to the boy  whats wrong asked the shaggy man  why were not moving forward a bit no matter how fast we walk declared ojo now that we have stopped we are moving backward cant you see just notice that rock  scraps looked down at her feet and said the yellow bricks are not moving  but the whole road is answered ojo  true quite true agreed the shaggy man i know all about the tricks of this road but i have been thinking of something else and didnt realize where we were  it will carry us back to where we started from predicted ojo beginning to be nervous  no replied the shaggy man it wont do that for i know a trick to beat this tricky road ive traveled this way before you know turn around all of you and walk backward  what good will that do asked the cat  youll find out if you obey me said the shaggy man  so they all turned their backs to the direction in which they wished to go and began walking backward in an instant ojo noticed they were gaining ground and as they proceeded in this curious way they soon passed the tree which had first attracted his attention to their difficulty  how long must we keep this up shags asked scraps who was constantly tripping and tumbling down only to get up again with a laugh at her mishap  just a little way farther replied the shaggy man  a few minutes later he called to them to turn about quickly and step forward and as they obeyed the order they found themselves treading solid ground  that task is well over observed the shaggy man its a little tiresome to walk backward but that is the only way to pass this part of the road which has a trick of sliding back and carrying with it anyone who is walking upon it  with new courage and energy they now trudged forward and after a time came to a place where the road cut through a low hill leaving high banks on either side of it they were traveling along this cut talking together when the shaggy man seized scraps with one arm and ojo with another and shouted stop  whats wrong now asked the patchwork girl  see there answered the shaggy man pointing with his finger  directly in the center of the road lay a motionless object that bristled all over with sharp quills which resembled arrows the body was as big as a tenbushelbasket but the projecting quills made it appear to be four times bigger  well what of it asked scraps  that is chiss who causes a lot of trouble along this road was the reply  chiss what is chiss  i think it is merely an overgrown porcupine but here in oz they consider chiss an evil spirit hes different from a reglar porcupine because he can throw his quills in any direction which an american porcupine cannot do thats what makes old chiss so dangerous if we get too near hell fire those quills at us and hurt us badly  then we will be foolish to get too near said scraps  im not afraid declared the woozy the chiss is cowardly im sure and if it ever heard my awful terrible frightful growl it would be scared stiff  oh can you growl asked the shaggy man  that is the only ferocious thing about me asserted the woozy with evident pride my growl makes an earthquake blush and the thunder ashamed of itself if i growled at that creature you call chiss it would immediately think the world had cracked in two and bumped against the sun and moon and that would cause the monster to run as far and as fast as its legs could carry it  in that case said the shaggy man you are now able to do us all a great favor please growl  but you forget returned the woozy my tremendous growl would also frighten you and if you happen to have heart disease you might expire  true but we must take that risk decided the shaggy man bravely being warned of what is to occur we must try to bear the terrific noise of your growl but chiss wont expect it and it will scare him away  the woozy hesitated  im fond of you all and i hate to shock you it said  never mind said ojo  you may be made deaf  if so we will forgive you  very well then said the woozy in a determined voice and advanced a few steps toward the giant porcupine pausing to look back it asked all ready  all ready they answered  then cover up your ears and brace yourselves firmly now thenlook out  the woozy turned toward chiss opened wide its mouth and said  queeeeeeeek  go ahead and growl said scraps  why ii did growl retorted the woozy who seemed much astonished  what that little squeak she cried  it is the most awful growl that ever was heard on land or sea in caverns or in the sky protested the woozy i wonder you stood the shock so well didnt you feel the ground tremble i suppose chiss is now quite dead with fright  the shaggy man laughed merrily  poor wooz said he your growl wouldnt scare a fly  the woozy seemed to be humiliated and surprised it hung its head a moment as if in shame or sorrow but then it said with renewed confidence anyhow my eyes can flash fire and good fire too good enough to set fire to a fence  that is true declared scraps i saw it done myself but your ferocious growl isnt as loud as the tick of a beetleor one of ojos snores when hes fast asleep  perhaps said the woozy humbly i have been mistaken about my growl it has always sounded very fearful to me but that may have been because it was so close to my ears  never mind ojo said soothingly it is a great talent to be able to flash fire from your eyes no one else can do that  as they stood hesitating what to do chiss stirred and suddenly a shower of quills came flying toward them almost filling the air they were so many scraps realized in an instant that they had gone too near to chiss for safety so she sprang in front of ojo and shielded him from the darts which stuck their points into her own body until she resembled one of those targets they shoot arrows at in archery games the shaggy man dropped flat on his face to avoid the shower but one quill struck him in the leg and went far in as for the glass cat the quills rattled off her body without making even a scratch and the skin of the woozy was so thick and tough that he was not hurt at all  when the attack was over they all ran to the shaggy man who was moaning and groaning and scraps promptly pulled the quill out of his leg then up he jumped and ran over to chiss putting his foot on the monsters neck and holding it a prisoner the body of the great porcupine was now as smooth as leather except for the holes where the quills had been for it had shot every single quill in that one wicked shower  let me go it shouted angrily how dare you put your foot on chiss  im going to do worse than that old boy replied the shaggy man you have annoyed travelers on this road long enough and now i shall put an end to you  you cant returned chiss nothing can kill me as you know perfectly well  perhaps that is true said the shaggy man in a tone of disappointment seems to me ive been told before that you cant be killed but if i let you go what will you do  pick up my quills again said chiss in a sulky voice  and then shoot them at more travelers no that wont do you must promise me to stop throwing quills at people  i wont promise anything of the sort declared chiss  why not  because it is my nature to throw quills and every animal must do what nature intends it to do it isnt fair for you to blame me if it were wrong for me to throw quills then i wouldnt be made with quills to throw the proper thing for you to do is to keep out of my way  why theres some sense in that argument admitted the shaggy man thoughtfully but people who are strangers and dont know you are here wont be able to keep out of your way  tell you what said scraps who was trying to pull the quills out of her own body lets gather up all the quills and take them away with us then old chiss wont have any left to throw at people  ah thats a clever idea you and ojo must gather up the quills while i hold chiss a prisoner for if i let him go he will get some of his quills and be able to throw them again  so scraps and ojo picked up all the quills and tied them in a bundle so they might easily be carried after this the shaggy man released chiss and let him go knowing that he was harmless to injure anyone  its the meanest trick i ever heard of muttered the porcupine gloomily how would you like it shaggy man if i took all your shags away from you  if i threw my shags and hurt people you would be welcome to capture them was the reply  then they walked on and left chiss standing in the road sullen and disconsolate the shaggy man limped as he walked for his wound still hurt him and scraps was much annoyed because the quills had left a number of small holes in her patches  when they came to a flat stone by the roadside the shaggy man sat down to rest and then ojo opened his basket and took out the bundle of charms the crooked magician had given him  i am ojo the unlucky he said or we would never have met that dreadful porcupine but i will see if i can find anything among these charms which will cure your leg  soon he discovered that one of the charms was labelled for flesh wounds and this the boy separated from the others it was only a bit of dried root taken from some unknown shrub but the boy rubbed it upon the wound made by the quill and in a few moments the place was healed entirely and the shaggy mans leg was as good as ever  rub it on the holes in my patches suggested scraps and ojo tried it but without any effect  the charm you need is a needle and thread said the shaggy man but do not worry my dear those holes do not look badly at all  theyll let in the air and i dont want people to think im airy or that ive been stuck up said the patchwork girl  you were certainly stuck up until we pulled out those quills observed ojo with a laugh  so now they went on again and coming presently to a pond of muddy water they tied a heavy stone to the bundle of quills and sunk it to the bottom of the pond to avoid carrying it farther     chapter thirteen  scraps and the scarecrow   from here on the country improved and the desert places began to give way to fertile spots still no houses were yet to be seen near the road there were some hills with valleys between them and on reaching the top of one of these hills the travelers found before them a high wall running to the right and the left as far as their eyes could reach immediately in front of them where the wall crossed the roadway stood a gate having stout iron bars that extended from top to bottom they found on coming nearer that this gate was locked with a great padlock rusty through lack of use  well said scraps i guess well stop here  its a good guess replied ojo our way is barred by this great wall and gate it looks as if no one had passed through in many years  looks are deceiving declared the shaggy man laughing at their disappointed faces and this barrier is the most deceiving thing in all oz  it prevents our going any farther anyhow said scraps there is no one to mind the gate and let people through and weve no key to the padlock  true replied ojo going a little nearer to peep through the bars of the gate what shall we do shaggy man if we had wings we might fly over the wall but we cannot climb it and unless we get to the emerald city i wont be able to find the things to restore unc nunkie to life  all very true answered the shaggy man quietly but i know this gate having passed through it many times  how they all eagerly inquired  ill show you how said he he stood ojo in the middle of the road and placed scraps just behind him with her padded hands on his shoulders after the patchwork girl came the woozy who held a part of her skirt in his mouth then last of all was the glass cat holding fast to the woozys tail with her glass jaws  now said the shaggy man you must all shut your eyes tight and keep them shut until i tell you to open them  i cant objected scraps my eyes are buttons and they wont shut  so the shaggy man tied his red handkerchief over the patchwork girls eyes and examined all the others to make sure they had their eyes fast shut and could see nothing  whats the game anyhowblindmansbuff asked scraps  keep quiet commanded the shaggy man sternly all ready then follow me  he took ojos hand and led him forward over the road of yellow bricks toward the gate holding fast to one another they all followed in a row expecting every minute to bump against the iron bars the shaggy man also had his eyes closed but marched straight ahead nevertheless and after he had taken one hundred steps by actual count he stopped and said  now you may open your eyes  they did so and to their astonishment found the wall and the gateway far behind them while in front the former blue country of the munchkins had given way to green fields with pretty farmhouses scattered among them  that wall explained the shaggy man is what is called an optical illusion it is quite real while you have your eyes open but if you are not looking at it the barrier doesnt exist at all its the same way with many other evils in life they seem to exist and yet its all seeming and not true you will notice that the wallor what we thought was a wallseparates the munchkin country from the green country that surrounds the emerald city which lies exactly in the center of oz there are two roads of yellow bricks through the munchkin country but the one we followed is the best of the two dorothy once traveled the other way and met with more dangers than we did but all our troubles are over for the present as another days journey will bring us to the great emerald city  they were delighted to know this and proceeded with new courage in a couple of hours they stopped at a farmhouse where the people were very hospitable and invited them to dinner the farm folk regarded scraps with much curiosity but no great astonishment for they were accustomed to seeing extraordinary people in the land of oz  the woman of this house got her needle and thread and sewed up the holes made by the porcupine quills in the patchwork girls body after which scraps was assured she looked as beautiful as ever  you ought to have a hat to wear remarked the woman for that would keep the sun from fading the colors of your face i have some patches and scraps put away and if you will wait two or three days ill make you a lovely hat that will match the rest of you  never mind the hat said scraps shaking her yarn braids its a kind offer but we cant stop i cant see that my colors have faded a particle as yet can you  not much replied the woman you are still very gorgeous in spite of your long journey  the children of the house wanted to keep the glass cat to play with so bungle was offered a good home if she would remain but the cat was too much interested in ojos adventures and refused to stop  children are rough playmates she remarked to the shaggy man and although this home is more pleasant than that of the crooked magician i fear i would soon be smashed to pieces by the boys and girls  after they had rested themselves they renewed their journey finding the road now smooth and pleasant to walk upon and the country growing more beautiful the nearer they drew to the emerald city  by and by ojo began to walk on the green grass looking carefully around him  what are you trying to find asked scraps  a sixleaved clover said he  dont do that exclaimed the shaggy man earnestly its against the law to pick a sixleaved clover you must wait until you get ozmas consent  she wouldnt know it declared the boy  ozma knows many things said the shaggy man in her room is a magic picture that shows any scene in the land of oz where strangers or travelers happen to be she may be watching the picture of us even now and noticing everything that we do  does she always watch the magic picture asked ojo  not always for she has many other things to do but as i said she may be watching us this very minute  i dont care said ojo in an obstinate tone of voice ozmas only a girl  the shaggy man looked at him in surprise  you ought to care for ozma said he if you expect to save your uncle for if you displease our powerful ruler your journey will surely prove a failure whereas if you make a friend of ozma she will gladly assist you as for her being a girl that is another reason why you should obey her laws if you are courteous and polite everyone in oz loves ozma and hates her enemies for she is as just as she is powerful  ojo sulked a while but finally returned to the road and kept away from the green clover the boy was moody and bad tempered for an hour or two afterward because he could really see no harm in picking a sixleaved clover if he found one and in spite of what the shaggy man had said he considered ozmas law to be unjust  they presently came to a beautiful grove of tall and stately trees through which the road wound in sharp curvesfirst one way and then another as they were walking through this grove they heard some one in the distance singing and the sounds grew nearer and nearer until they could distinguish the words although the bend in the road still hid the singer the song was something like this      heres to the hale old bale of straw     thats cut from the waving grain     the sweetest sight man ever saw     in forest dell or plain     it fills me with a crunkling joy     a strawstack to behold     for then i pad this lucky boy     with strands of yellow gold   ah exclaimed the shaggy man here comes my friend the scarecrow  what a live scarecrow asked ojo  yes the one i told you of hes a splendid fellow and very intelligent youll like him im sure  just then the famous scarecrow of oz came around the bend in the road riding astride a wooden sawhorse which was so small that its riders legs nearly touched the ground  the scarecrow wore the blue dress of the munchkins in which country he was made and on his head was set a peaked hat with a flat brim trimmed with tinkling bells a rope was tied around his waist to hold him in shape for he was stuffed with straw in every part of him except the top of his head where at one time the wizard of oz had placed sawdust mixed with needles and pins to sharpen his wits the head itself was merely a bag of cloth fastened to the body at the neck and on the front of this bag was painted the faceears eyes nose and mouth  the scarecrows face was very interesting for it bore a comical and yet winning expression although one eye was a bit larger than the other and ears were not mates the munchkin farmer who had made the scarecrow had neglected to sew him together with close stitches and therefore some of the straw with which he was stuffed was inclined to stick out between the seams his hands consisted of padded white gloves with the fingers long and rather limp and on his feet he wore munchkin boots of blue leather with broad turns at the tops of them  the sawhorse was almost as curious as its rider it had been rudely made in the beginning to saw logs upon so that its body was a short length of a log and its legs were stout branches fitted into four holes made in the body the tail was formed by a small branch that had been left on the log while the head was a gnarled bump on one end of the body two knots of wood formed the eyes and the mouth was a gash chopped in the log when the sawhorse first came to life it had no ears at all and so could not hear but the boy who then owned him had whittled two ears out of bark and stuck them in the head after which the sawhorse heard very distinctly  this queer wooden horse was a great favorite with princess ozma who had caused the bottoms of its legs to be shod with plates of gold so the wood would not wear away its saddle was made of clothofgold richly encrusted with precious gems it had never worn a bridle  as the scarecrow came in sight of the party of travelers he reined in his wooden steed and dismounted greeting the shaggy man with a smiling nod then he turned to stare at the patchwork girl in wonder while she in turn stared at him  shags he whispered drawing the shaggy man aside pat me into shape theres a good fellow  while his friend punched and patted the scarecrows body to smooth out the humps scraps turned to ojo and whispered roll me out please ive sagged down dreadfully from walking so much and men like to see a stately figure  she then fell upon the ground and the boy rolled her back and forth like a rollingpin until the cotton had filled all the spaces in her patchwork covering and the body had lengthened to its fullest extent scraps and the scarecrow both finished their hasty toilets at the same time and again they faced each other  allow me miss patchwork said the shaggy man to present my friend the right royal scarecrow of oz scarecrow this is miss scraps patches scraps this is the scarecrow scarecrowscraps scrapsscarecrow  they both bowed with much dignity  forgive me for staring so rudely said the scarecrow but you are the most beautiful sight my eyes have ever beheld  that is a high compliment from one who is himself so beautiful murmured scraps casting down her suspenderbutton eyes by lowering her head but tell me good sir are you not a trifle lumpy  yes of course thats my straw you know it bunches up sometimes in spite of all my efforts to keep it even doesnt your straw ever bunch  oh im stuffed with cotton said scraps it never bunches but its inclined to pack down and make me sag  but cotton is a highgrade stuffing i may say it is even more stylish not to say aristocratic than straw said the scarecrow politely still it is but proper that one so entrancingly lovely should have the best stuffing there is going ierim so glad ive met you miss scraps introduce us again shaggy  once is enough replied the shaggy man laughing at his friends enthusiasm  then tell me where you found her anddear me what a queer cat what are you made ofgelatine  pure glass answered the cat proud to have attracted the scarecrows attention i am much more beautiful than the patchwork girl im transparent and scraps isnt ive pink brainsyou can see em work and ive a ruby heart finely polished while scraps hasnt any heart at all  no more have i said the scarecrow shaking hands with scraps as if to congratulate her on the fact ive a friend the tin woodman who has a heart but i find i get along pretty well without one and sowell well heres a little munchkin boy too shake hands my little man how are you  ojo placed his hand in the flabby stuffed glove that served the scarecrow for a hand and the scarecrow pressed it so cordially that the straw in his glove crackled  meantime the woozy had approached the sawhorse and begun to sniff at it the sawhorse resented this familiarity and with a sudden kick pounded the woozy squarely on its head with one goldshod foot  take that you monster it cried angrily  the woozy never even winked  to be sure he said ill take anything i have to but dont make me angry you wooden beast or my eyes will flash fire and burn you up  the sawhorse rolled its knot eyes wickedly and kicked again but the woozy trotted away and said to the scarecrow  what a sweet disposition that creature has i advise you to chop it up for kindlingwood and use me to ride upon my back is flat and you cant fall off  i think the trouble is that you havent been properly introduced said the scarecrow regarding the woozy with much wonder for he had never seen such a queer animal before  the sawhorse is the favorite steed of princess ozma the ruler of the land of oz and he lives in a stable decorated with pearls and emeralds at the rear of the royal palace he is swift as the wind untiring and is kind to his friends all the people of oz respect the sawhorse highly and when i visit ozma she sometimes allows me to ride himas i am doing today now you know what an important personage the sawhorse is and if some oneperhaps yourselfwill tell me your name your rank and station and your history it will give me pleasure to relate them to the sawhorse this will lead to mutual respect and friendship  the woozy was somewhat abashed by this speech and did not know how to reply but ojo said  this square beast is called the woozy and he isnt of much importance except that he has three hairs growing on the tip of his tail  the scarecrow looked and saw that this was true  but said he in a puzzled way what makes those three hairs important the shaggy man has thousands of hairs but no one has ever accused him of being important  so ojo related the sad story of unc nunkies transformation into a marble statue and told how he had set out to find the things the crooked magician wanted in order to make a charm that would restore his uncle to life one of the requirements was three hairs from a woozys tail but not being able to pull out the hairs they had been obliged to take the woozy with them  the scarecrow looked grave as he listened and he shook his head several times as if in disapproval  we must see ozma about this matter he said that crooked magician is breaking the law by practicing magic without a license and im not sure ozma will allow him to restore your uncle to life  already i have warned the boy of that declared the shaggy man  at this ojo began to cry i want my unc nunkie he exclaimed i know how he can be restored to life and im going to do itozma or no ozma what right has this girl ruler to keep my unc nunkie a statue forever  dont worry about that just now advised the scarecrow go on to the emerald city and when you reach it have the shaggy man take you to see dorothy tell her your story and im sure she will help you dorothy is ozmas best friend and if you can win her to your side your uncle is pretty safe to live again then he turned to the woozy and said im afraid you are not important enough to be introduced to the sawhorse after all  im a better beast than he is retorted the woozy indignantly my eyes can flash fire and his cant  is this true inquired the scarecrow turning to the munchkin boy  yes said ojo and told how the woozy had set fire to the fence  have you any other accomplishments asked the scarecrow  i have a most terrible growlthat is sometimes said the woozy as scraps laughed merrily and the shaggy man smiled but the patchwork girls laugh made the scarecrow forget all about the woozy he said to her  what an admirable young lady you are and what jolly good company we must be better acquainted for never before have i met a girl with such exquisite coloring or such natural artless manners  no wonder they call you the wise scarecrow replied scraps  when you arrive at the emerald city i will see you again continued the scarecrow just now i am going to call upon an old friendan ordinary young lady named jinjurwho has promised to repaint my left ear for me you may have noticed that the paint on my left ear has peeled off and faded which affects my hearing on that side jinjur always fixes me up when i get weatherworn  when do you expect to return to the emerald city asked the shaggy man  ill be there this evening for im anxious to have a long talk with miss scraps how is it sawhorse are you equal to a swift run  anything that suits you suits me returned the wooden horse  so the scarecrow mounted to the jeweled saddle and waved his hat when the sawhorse darted away so swiftly that they were out of sight in an instant     chapter fourteen  ojo breaks the law   what a queer man remarked the munchkin boy when the party had resumed its journey  and so nice and polite added scraps bobbing her head i think he is the handsomest man ive seen since i came to life  handsome is as handsome does quoted the shaggy man but we must admit that no living scarecrow is handsomer the chief merit of my friend is that he is a great thinker and in oz it is considered good policy to follow his advice  i didnt notice any brains in his head observed the glass cat  you cant see em work but theyre there all right declared the shaggy man i hadnt much confidence in his brains myself when first i came to oz for a humbug wizard gave them to him but i was soon convinced that the scarecrow is really wise and unless his brains make him so such wisdom is unaccountable  is the wizard of oz a humbug asked ojo  not now he was once but he has reformed and now assists glinda the good who is the royal sorceress of oz and the only one licensed to practice magic or sorcery glinda has taught our old wizard a good many clever things so he is no longer a humbug  they walked a little while in silence and then ojo said  if ozma forbids the crooked magician to restore unc nunkie to life what shall i do  the shaggy man shook his head  in that case you cant do anything he said but dont be discouraged yet we will go to princess dorothy and tell her your troubles and then we will let her talk to ozma dorothy has the kindest little heart in the world and she has been through so many troubles herself that she is sure to sympathize with you  is dorothy the little girl who came here from kansas asked the boy  yes in kansas she was dorothy gale i used to know her there and she brought me to the land of oz but now ozma has made her a princess and dorothys aunt em and uncle henry are here too here the shaggy man uttered a long sigh and then he continued its a queer country this land of oz but i like it nevertheless  what is queer about it asked scraps  you for instance said he  did you see no girls as beautiful as i am in your own country she inquired  none with the same gorgeous variegated beauty he confessed in america a girl stuffed with cotton wouldnt be alive nor would anyone think of making a girl out of a patchwork quilt  what a queer country america must be she exclaimed in great surprise the scarecrow whom you say is wise told me i am the most beautiful creature he has ever seen  i know and perhaps you arefrom a scarecrow point of view replied the shaggy man but why he smiled as he said it scraps could not imagine  as they drew nearer to the emerald city the travelers were filled with admiration for the splendid scenery they beheld handsome houses stood on both sides of the road and each had a green lawn before it as well as a pretty flower garden  in another hour said the shaggy man we shall come in sight of the walls of the royal city  he was walking ahead with scraps and behind them came the woozy and the glass cat ojo had lagged behind for in spite of the warnings he had received the boys eyes were fastened on the clover that bordered the road of yellow bricks and he was eager to discover if such a thing as a sixleaved clover really existed  suddenly he stopped short and bent over to examine the ground more closely yes here at last was a clover with six spreading leaves he counted them carefully to make sure in an instant his heart leaped with joy for this was one of the important things he had come forone of the things that would restore dear unc nunkie to life  he glanced ahead and saw that none of his companions was looking back neither were any other people about for it was midway between two houses the temptation was too strong to be resisted  i might search for weeks and weeks and never find another sixleaved clover he told himself and quickly plucking the stem from the plant he placed the prized clover in his basket covering it with the other things he carried there then trying to look as if nothing had happened he hurried forward and overtook his comrades  the emerald city which is the most splendid as well as the most beautiful city in any fairyland is surrounded by a high thick wall of green marble polished smooth and set with glistening emeralds there are four gates one facing the munchkin country one facing the country of the winkies one facing the country of the quadlings and one facing the country of the gillikins the emerald city lies directly in the center of these four important countries of oz the gates had bars of pure gold and on either side of each gateway were built high towers from which floated gay banners other towers were set at distances along the walls which were broad enough for four people to walk abreast upon  this enclosure all green and gold and glittering with precious gems was indeed a wonderful sight to greet our travelers who first observed it from the top of a little hill but beyond the wall was the vast city it surrounded and hundreds of jeweled spires domes and minarets flaunting flags and banners reared their crests far above the towers of the gateways in the center of the city our friends could see the tops of many magnificent trees some nearly as tall as the spires of the buildings and the shaggy man told them that these trees were in the royal gardens of princess ozma  they stood a long time on the hilltop feasting their eyes on the splendor of the emerald city  whee exclaimed scraps clasping her padded hands in ecstacy thatll do for me to live in all right no more of the munchkin country for these patchesand no more of the crooked magician  why you belong to dr pipt replied ojo looking at her in amazement you were made for a servant scraps so you are personal property and not your own mistress  bother dr pipt if he wants me let him come here and get me ill not go back to his den of my own accord thats certain only one place in the land of oz is fit to live in and thats the emerald city its lovely its almost as beautiful as i am ojo  in this country remarked the shaggy man people live wherever our ruler tells them to it wouldnt do to have everyone live in the emerald city you know for some must plow the land and raise grains and fruits and vegetables while others chop wood in the forests or fish in the rivers or herd the sheep and the cattle  poor things said scraps  im not sure they are not happier than the city people replied the shaggy man theres a freedom and independence in country life that not even the emerald city can give one i know that lots of the city people would like to get back to the land the scarecrow lives in the country and so do the tin woodman and jack pumpkinhead yet all three would be welcome to live in ozmas palace if they cared to too much splendor becomes tiresome you know but if were to reach the emerald city before sundown we must hurry for it is yet a long way off  the entrancing sight of the city had put new energy into them all and they hurried forward with lighter steps than before there was much to interest them along the roadway for the houses were now set more closely together and they met a good many people who were coming or going from one place or another all these seemed happyfaced pleasant people who nodded graciously to the strangers as they passed and exchanged words of greeting  at last they reached the great gateway just as the sun was setting and adding its red glow to the glitter of the emeralds on the green walls and spires somewhere inside the city a band could be heard playing sweet music a soft subdued hum as of many voices reached their ears from the neighboring yards came the low mooing of cows waiting to be milked  they were almost at the gate when the golden bars slid back and a tall soldier stepped out and faced them ojo thought he had never seen so tall a man before the soldier wore a handsome green and gold uniform with a tall hat in which was a waving plume and he had a belt thickly encrusted with jewels but the most peculiar thing about him was his long green beard which fell far below his waist and perhaps made him seem taller than he really was  halt said the soldier with the green whiskers not in a stern voice but rather in a friendly tone  they halted before he spoke and stood looking at him  good evening colonel said the shaggy man whats the news since i left anything important  billina has hatched out thirteen new chickens replied the soldier with the green whiskers and theyre the cutest little fluffy yellow balls you ever saw the yellow hen is mighty proud of those children i can tell you  she has a right to be agreed the shaggy man let me see thats about seven thousand chicks she has hatched out isnt it general  that at least was the reply you will have to visit billina and congratulate her  it will give me pleasure to do that said the shaggy man but you will observe that i have brought some strangers home with me i am going to take them to see dorothy  one moment please said the soldier barring their way as they started to enter the gate i am on duty and i have orders to execute is anyone in your party named ojo the unlucky  why thats me cried ojo astonished at hearing his name on the lips of a stranger  the soldier with the green whiskers nodded i thought so said he and i am sorry to announce that it is my painful duty to arrest you  arrest me exclaimed the boy what for  i havent looked to see answered the soldier then he drew a paper from his breast pocket and glanced at it oh yes you are to be arrested for willfully breaking one of the laws of oz  breaking a law said scraps nonsense soldier youre joking  not this time returned the soldier with a sigh my dear childwhat are you a rummage sale or a guessmequickin me you behold the bodyguard of our gracious ruler princess ozma as well as the royal army of oz and the police force of the emerald city  and only one man exclaimed the patchwork girl  only one and plenty enough in my official positions ive had nothing to do for a good many yearsso long that i began to fear i was absolutely uselessuntil today an hour ago i was called to the presence of her highness ozma of oz and told to arrest a boy named ojo the unlucky who was journeying from the munchkin country to the emerald city and would arrive in a short time this command so astonished me that i nearly fainted for it is the first time anyone has merited arrest since i can remember you are rightly named ojo the unlucky my poor boy since you have broken a law of oz  but you are wrong said scraps ozma is wrongyou are all wrongfor ojo has broken no law  then he will soon be free again replied the soldier with the green whiskers anyone accused of crime is given a fair trial by our ruler and has every chance to prove his innocence but just now ozmas orders must be obeyed  with this he took from his pocket a pair of handcuffs made of gold and set with rubies and diamonds and these he snapped over ojos wrists     chapter fifteen  ozmas prisoner   the boy was so bewildered by this calamity that he made no resistance at all he knew very well he was guilty but it surprised him that ozma also knew it he wondered how she had found out so soon that he had picked the sixleaved clover he handed his basket to scraps and said  keep that until i get out of prison if i never get out take it to the crooked magician to whom it belongs  the shaggy man had been gazing earnestly in the boys face uncertain whether to defend him or not but something he read in ojos expression made him draw back and refuse to interfere to save him the shaggy man was greatly surprised and grieved but he knew that ozma never made mistakes and so ojo must really have broken the law of oz  the soldier with the green whiskers now led them all through the gate and into a little room built in the wall here sat a jolly little man richly dressed in green and having around his neck a heavy gold chain to which a number of great golden keys were attached this was the guardian of the gate and at the moment they entered his room he was playing a tune upon a mouthorgan  listen he said holding up his hand for silence ive just composed a tune called the speckled alligator its in patchtime which is much superior to ragtime and ive composed it in honor of the patchwork girl who has just arrived  how did you know i had arrived asked scraps much interested  its my business to know whos coming for im the guardian of the gate keep quiet while i play you the speckled alligator  it wasnt a very bad tune nor a very good one but all listened respectfully while he shut his eyes and swayed his head from side to side and blew the notes from the little instrument when it was all over the soldier with the green whiskers said  guardian i have here a prisoner  good gracious a prisoner cried the little man jumping up from his chair which one not the shaggy man  no this boy  ah i hope his fault is as small as himself said the guardian of the gate but what can he have done and what made him do it  cant say replied the soldier all i know is that he has broken the law  but no one ever does that  then he must be innocent and soon will be released i hope you are right guardian just now i am ordered to take him to prison get me a prisoners robe from your official wardrobe  the guardian unlocked a closet and took from it a white robe which the soldier threw over ojo it covered him from head to foot but had two holes just in front of his eyes so he could see where to go in this attire the boy presented a very quaint appearance  as the guardian unlocked a gate leading from his room into the streets of the emerald city the shaggy man said to scraps  i think i shall take you directly to dorothy as the scarecrow advised and the glass cat and the woozy may come with us ojo must go to prison with the soldier with the green whiskers but he will be well treated and you need not worry about him  what will they do with him asked scraps  that i cannot tell since i came to the land of oz no one has ever been arrested or imprisoneduntil ojo broke the law  seems to me that girl ruler of yours is making a big fuss over nothing remarked scraps tossing her yarn hair out of her eyes with a jerk of her patched head i dont know what ojo has done but it couldnt be anything very bad for you and i were with him all the time  the shaggy man made no reply to this speech and presently the patchwork girl forgot all about ojo in her admiration of the wonderful city she had entered  they soon separated from the munchkin boy who was led by the soldier with the green whiskers down a side street toward the prison ojo felt very miserable and greatly ashamed of himself but he was beginning to grow angry because he was treated in such a disgraceful manner instead of entering the splendid emerald city as a respectable traveler who was entitled to a welcome and to hospitality he was being brought in as a criminal handcuffed and in a robe that told all he met of his deep disgrace  ojo was by nature gentle and affectionate and if he had disobeyed the law of oz it was to restore his dear unc nunkie to life his fault was more thoughtless than wicked but that did not alter the fact that he had committed a fault at first he had felt sorrow and remorse but the more he thought about the unjust treatment he had receivedunjust merely because he considered it sothe more he resented his arrest blaming ozma for making foolish laws and then punishing folks who broke them only a sixleaved clover a tiny green plant growing neglected and trampled under foot what harm could there be in picking it ojo began to think ozma must be a very bad and oppressive ruler for such a lovely fairyland as oz the shaggy man said the people loved her but how could they  the little munchkin boy was so busy thinking these thingswhich many guilty prisoners have thought before himthat he scarcely noticed all the splendor of the city streets through which they passed whenever they met any of the happy smiling people the boy turned his head away in shame although none knew who was beneath the robe  by and by they reached a house built just beside the great city wall but in a quiet retired place it was a pretty house neatly painted and with many windows before it was a garden filled with blooming flowers the soldier with the green whiskers led ojo up the gravel path to the front door on which he knocked  a woman opened the door and seeing ojo in his white robe exclaimed  goodness me a prisoner at last but what a small one soldier  the size doesnt matter tollydiggle my dear the fact remains that he is a prisoner said the soldier and this being the prison and you the jailer it is my duty to place the prisoner in your charge  true come in then and ill give you a receipt for him  they entered the house and passed through a hall to a large circular room where the woman pulled the robe off from ojo and looked at him with kindly interest the boy on his part was gazing around him in amazement for never had he dreamed of such a magnificent apartment as this in which he stood the roof of the dome was of colored glass worked into beautiful designs the walls were paneled with plates of gold decorated with gems of great size and many colors and upon the tiled floor were soft rugs delightful to walk upon the furniture was framed in gold and upholstered in satin brocade and it consisted of easy chairs divans and stools in great variety also there were several tables with mirror tops and cabinets filled with rare and curious things in one place a case filled with books stood against the wall and elsewhere ojo saw a cupboard containing all sorts of games  may i stay here a little while before i go to prison asked the boy pleadingly  why this is your prison replied tollydiggle and in me behold your jailor take off those handcuffs soldier for it is impossible for anyone to escape from this house  i know that very well replied the soldier and at once unlocked the handcuffs and released the prisoner  the woman touched a button on the wall and lighted a big chandelier that hung suspended from the ceiling for it was growing dark outside then she seated herself at a desk and asked  what name  ojo the unlucky answered the soldier with the green whiskers  unlucky ah that accounts for it said she what crime  breaking a law of oz  all right theres your receipt soldier and now im responsible for the prisoner im glad of it for this is the first time ive ever had anything to do in my official capacity remarked the jailer in a pleased tone  its the same with me tollydiggle laughed the soldier but my task is finished and i must go and report to ozma that ive done my duty like a faithful police force a loyal army and an honest bodyguardas i hope i am  saying this he nodded farewell to tollydiggle and ojo and went away  now then said the woman briskly i must get you some supper for you are doubtless hungry what would you prefer planked whitefish omelet with jelly or muttonchops with gravy  ojo thought about it then he said ill take the chops if you please  very well amuse yourself while im gone i wont be long and then she went out by a door and left the prisoner alone  ojo was much astonished for not only was this unlike any prison he had ever heard of but he was being treated more as a guest than a criminal there were many windows and they had no locks there were three doors to the room and none were bolted he cautiously opened one of the doors and found it led into a hallway but he had no intention of trying to escape if his jailor was willing to trust him in this way he would not betray her trust and moreover a hot supper was being prepared for him and his prison was very pleasant and comfortable so he took a book from the case and sat down in a big chair to look at the pictures  this amused him until the woman came in with a large tray and spread a cloth on one of the tables then she arranged his supper which proved the most varied and delicious meal ojo had ever eaten in his life  tollydiggle sat near him while he ate sewing on some fancy work she held in her lap when he had finished she cleared the table and then read to him a story from one of the books  is this really a prison he asked when she had finished reading  indeed it is she replied it is the only prison in the land of oz  and am i a prisoner  bless the child of course  then why is the prison so fine and why are you so kind to me he earnestly asked  tollydiggle seemed surprised by the question but she presently answered  we consider a prisoner unfortunate he is unfortunate in two waysbecause he has done something wrong and because he is deprived of his liberty therefore we should treat him kindly because of his misfortune for otherwise he would become hard and bitter and would not be sorry he had done wrong ozma thinks that one who has committed a fault did so because he was not strong and brave therefore she puts him in prison to make him strong and brave when that is accomplished he is no longer a prisoner but a good and loyal citizen and everyone is glad that he is now strong enough to resist doing wrong you see it is kindness that makes one strong and brave and so we are kind to our prisoners  ojo thought this over very carefully i had an idea said he that prisoners were always treated harshly to punish them  that would be dreadful cried tollydiggle isnt one punished enough in knowing he has done wrong dont you wish ojo with all your heart that you had not been disobedient and broken a law of oz  ii hate to be different from other people he admitted  yes one likes to be respected as highly as his neighbors are said the woman when you are tried and found guilty you will be obliged to make amends in some way i dont know just what ozma will do to you because this is the first time one of us has broken a law but you may be sure she will be just and merciful here in the emerald city people are too happy and contented ever to do wrong but perhaps you came from some faraway corner of our land and having no love for ozma carelessly broke one of her laws  yes said ojo ive lived all my life in the heart of a lonely forest where i saw no one but dear unc nunkie  i thought so said tollydiggle but now we have talked enough so let us play a game until bedtime     chapter sixteen  princess dorothy   dorothy gale was sitting in one of her rooms in the royal palace while curled up at her feet was a little black dog with a shaggy coat and very bright eyes she wore a plain white frock without any jewels or other ornaments except an emeraldgreen hairribbon for dorothy was a simple little girl and had not been in the least spoiled by the magnificence surrounding her once the child had lived on the kansas prairies but she seemed marked for adventure for she had made several trips to the land of oz before she came to live there for good her very best friend was the beautiful ozma of oz who loved dorothy so well that she kept her in her own palace so as to be near her the girls uncle henry and aunt emthe only relatives she had in the worldhad also been brought here by ozma and given a pleasant home dorothy knew almost everybody in oz and it was she who had discovered the scarecrow the tin woodman and the cowardly lion as well as tiktok the clockwork man her life was very pleasant now and although she had been made a princess of oz by her friend ozma she did not care much to be a princess and remained as sweet as when she had been plain dorothy gale of kansas  dorothy was reading in a book this evening when jellia jamb the favorite servantmaid of the palace came to say that the shaggy man wanted to see her  all right said dorothy tell him to come right up  but he has some queer creatures with himsome of the queerest ive ever laid eyes on reported jellia  never mind let em all come up replied dorothy  but when the door opened to admit not only the shaggy man but scraps the woozy and the glass cat dorothy jumped up and looked at her strange visitors in amazement the patchwork girl was the most curious of all and dorothy was uncertain at first whether scraps was really alive or only a dream or a nightmare toto her dog slowly uncurled himself and going to the patchwork girl sniffed at her inquiringly but soon he lay down again as if to say he had no interest in such an irregular creation  youre a new one to me dorothy said reflectively addressing the patchwork girl i cant imagine where youve come from  who me asked scraps looking around the pretty room instead of at the girl oh i came from a bedquilt i guess thats what they say anyhow some call it a crazyquilt and some a patchwork quilt but my name is scrapsand now you know all about me  not quite all returned dorothy with a smile i wish youd tell me how you came to be alive  thats an easy job said scraps sitting upon a big upholstered chair and making the springs bounce her up and down margolotte wanted a slave so she made me out of an old bedquilt she didnt use cotton stuffing suspenderbutton eyes red velvet tongue pearl beads for teeth the crooked magician made a powder of life sprinkled me with it andhere i am perhaps youve noticed my different colors a very refined and educated gentleman named the scarecrow whom i met told me i am the most beautiful creature in all oz and i believe it  oh have you met our scarecrow then asked dorothy a little puzzled to understand the brief history related  yes isnt he jolly  the scarecrow has many good qualities replied dorothy but im sorry to hear all this bout the crooked magician ozmall be mad as hops when she hears hes been doing magic again she told him not to  he only practices magic for the benefit of his own family explained bungle who was keeping at a respectful distance from the little black dog  dear me said dorothy i hadnt noticed you before are you glass or what  im glass and transparent too which is more than can be said of some folks answered the cat also i have some lovely pink brains you can see em work  oh is that so come over here and let me see  the glass cat hesitated eyeing the dog  send that beast away and i will she said  beast why thats my dog toto an hes the kindest dog in all the world toto knows a good many things too most as much as i do i guess  why doesnt he say anything asked bungle  he cant talk not being a fairy dog explained dorothy hes just a common united states dog but thats a good deal and i understand him and he understands me just as well as if he could talk  toto at this got up and rubbed his head softly against dorothys hand which she held out to him and he looked up into her face as if he had understood every word she had said  this cat toto she said to him is made of glass so you mustnt bother it or chase it any more than you do my pink kitten its probly brittle and might break if it bumped against anything  woof said toto and that meant he understood  the glass cat was so proud of her pink brains that she ventured to come close to dorothy in order that the girl might see em work this was really interesting but when dorothy patted the cat she found the glass cold and hard and unresponsive so she decided at once that bungle would never do for a pet  what do you know about the crooked magician who lives on the mountain asked dorothy  he made me replied the cat so i know all about him the patchwork girl is newthree or four days oldbut ive lived with dr pipt for years and though i dont much care for him i will say that he has always refused to work magic for any of the people who come to his house he thinks theres no harm in doing magic things for his own family and he made me out of glass because the meat cats drink too much milk he also made scraps come to life so she could do the housework for his wife margolotte  then why did you both leave him asked dorothy  i think youd better let me explain that interrupted the shaggy man and then he told dorothy all of ojos story and how unc nunkie and margolotte had accidentally been turned to marble by the liquid of petrifaction then he related how the boy had started out in search of the things needed to make the magic charm which would restore the unfortunates to life and how he had found the woozy and taken him along because he could not pull the three hairs out of its tail dorothy listened to all this with much interest and thought that so far ojo had acted very well but when the shaggy man told her of the munchkin boys arrest by the soldier with the green whiskers because he was accused of wilfully breaking a law of oz the little girl was greatly shocked  what do you spose hes done she asked  i fear he has picked a sixleaved clover answered the shaggy man sadly i did not see him do it and i warned him that to do so was against the law but perhaps that is what he did nevertheless  im sorry bout that said dorothy gravely for now there will be no one to help his poor uncle and margolotte cept this patchwork girl the woozy and the glass cat  dont mention it said scraps thats no affair of mine margolotte and unc nunkie are perfect strangers to me for the moment i came to life they came to marble  i see remarked dorothy with a sigh of regret the woman forgot to give you a heart  im glad she did retorted the patchwork girl a heart must be a great annoyance to one it makes a person feel sad or sorry or devoted or sympatheticall of which sensations interfere with ones happiness  i have a heart murmured the glass cat its made of a ruby but i dont imagine i shall let it bother me about helping unc nunkie and margolotte  thats a pretty hard heart of yours said dorothy and the woozy of course  why as for me observed the woozy who was reclining on the floor with his legs doubled under him so that he looked much like a square box i have never seen those unfortunate people you are speaking of and yet i am sorry for them having at times been unfortunate myself when i was shut up in that forest i longed for some one to help me and by and by ojo came and did help me so im willing to help his uncle im only a stupid beast dorothy but i cant help that and if youll tell me what to do to help ojo and his uncle ill gladly do it  dorothy walked over and patted the woozy on his square head  youre not pretty she said but i like you what are you able to do anything special  i can make my eyes flash firereal firewhen im angry when anyone says krizzlekroo to me i get angry and then my eyes flash fire  i dont see as fireworks could help ojos uncle remarked dorothy can you do anything else  ii thought i had a very terrifying growl said the woozy with hesitation but perhaps i was mistaken  yes said the shaggy man you were certainly wrong about that then he turned to dorothy and added what will become of the munchkin boy  i dont know she said shaking her head thoughtfully ozma will see him bout it of course and then shell punish him but how i dont know cause no one ever has been punished in oz since i knew anything about the place too bad shaggy man isnt it  while they were talking scraps had been roaming around the room and looking at all the pretty things it contained she had carried ojos basket in her hand until now when she decided to see what was inside it she found the bread and cheese which she had no use for and the bundle of charms which were curious but quite a mystery to her then turning these over she came upon the sixleaved clover which the boy had plucked  scraps was quickwitted and although she had no heart she recognized the fact that ojo was her first friend she knew at once that because the boy had taken the clover he had been imprisoned and she understood that ojo had given her the basket so they would not find the clover in his possession and have proof of his crime so turning her head to see that no one noticed her she took the clover from the basket and dropped it into a golden vase that stood on dorothys table then she came forward and said to dorothy  i wouldnt care to help ojos uncle but i will help ojo he did not break the lawno one can prove he didand that greenwhiskered soldier had no right to arrest him  ozma ordered the boys arrest said dorothy and of course she knew what she was doing but if you can prove ojo is innocent they will set him free at once  theyll have to prove him guilty wont they asked scraps  i spose so  well they cant do that declared the patchwork girl  as it was nearly time for dorothy to dine with ozma which she did every evening she rang for a servant and ordered the woozy taken to a nice room and given plenty of such food as he liked best  thats honeybees said the woozy  you cant eat honeybees but youll be given something just as nice dorothy told him then she had the glass cat taken to another room for the night and the patchwork girl she kept in one of her own rooms for she was much interested in the strange creature and wanted to talk with her again and try to understand her better     chapter seventeen  ozma and her friends   the shaggy man had a room of his own in the royal palace so there he went to change his shaggy suit of clothes for another just as shaggy but not so dusty from travel he selected a costume of peagreen and pink satin and velvet with embroidered shags on all the edges and iridescent pearls for ornaments then he bathed in an alabaster pool and brushed his shaggy hair and whiskers the wrong way to make them still more shaggy this accomplished and arrayed in his splendid shaggy garments he went to ozmas banquet hall and found the scarecrow the wizard and dorothy already assembled there the scarecrow had made a quick trip and returned to the emerald city with his left ear freshly painted  a moment later while they all stood in waiting a servant threw open a door the orchestra struck up a tune and ozma of oz entered  much has been told and written concerning the beauty of person and character of this sweet girl ruler of the land of ozthe richest the happiest and most delightful fairyland of which we have any knowledge yet with all her queenly qualities ozma was a real girl and enjoyed the things in life that other real girls enjoy when she sat on her splendid emerald throne in the great throne room of her palace and made laws and settled disputes and tried to keep all her subjects happy and contented she was as dignified and demure as any queen might be but when she had thrown aside her jeweled robe of state and her sceptre and had retired to her private apartments the girljoyous lighthearted and freereplaced the sedate ruler  in the banquet hall tonight were gathered only old and trusted friends so here ozma was herselfa mere girl she greeted dorothy with a kiss the shaggy man with a smile the little old wizard with a friendly handshake and then she pressed the scarecrows stuffed arm and cried merrily  what a lovely left ear why its a hundred times better than the old one  im glad you like it replied the scarecrow well pleased jinjur did a neat job didnt she and my hearing is now perfect isnt it wonderful what a little paint will do if its properly applied  it really is wonderful she agreed as they all took their seats but the sawhorse must have made his legs twinkle to have carried you so far in one day i didnt expect you back before tomorrow at the earliest  well said the scarecrow i met a charming girl on the road and wanted to see more of her so i hurried back  ozma laughed  i know she returned its the patchwork girl she is certainly bewildering if not strictly beautiful  have you seen her then the straw man eagerly asked  only in my magic picture which shows me all scenes of interest in the land of oz  i fear the picture didnt do her justice said the scarecrow  it seemed to me that nothing could be more gorgeous declared ozma whoever made that patchwork quilt from which scraps was formed must have selected the gayest and brightest bits of cloth that ever were woven  i am glad you like her said the scarecrow in a satisfied tone although the straw man did not eat not being made so he could he often dined with ozma and her companions merely for the pleasure of talking with them he sat at the table and had a napkin and plate but the servants knew better than to offer him food after a little while he asked where is the patchwork girl now  in my room replied dorothy ive taken a fancy to her shes so queer andanduncommon  shes half crazy i think added the shaggy man  but she is so beautiful exclaimed the scarecrow as if that fact disarmed all criticism they all laughed at his enthusiasm but the scarecrow was quite serious seeing that he was interested in scraps they forbore to say anything against her the little band of friends ozma had gathered around her was so quaintly assorted that much care must be exercised to avoid hurting their feelings or making any one of them unhappy it was this considerate kindness that held them close friends and enabled them to enjoy one anothers society  another thing they avoided was conversing on unpleasant subjects and for that reason ojo and his troubles were not mentioned during the dinner the shaggy man however related his adventures with the monstrous plants which had seized and enfolded the travelers and told how he had robbed chiss the giant porcupine of the quills which it was accustomed to throw at people both dorothy and ozma were pleased with this exploit and thought it served chiss right  then they talked of the woozy which was the most remarkable animal any of them had ever before seenexcept perhaps the live sawhorse ozma had never known that her dominions contained such a thing as a woozy there being but one in existence and this being confined in his forest for many years dorothy said she believed the woozy was a good beast honest and faithful but she added that she did not care much for the glass cat  still said the shaggy man the glass cat is very pretty and if she were not so conceited over her pink brains no one would object to her as a companion  the wizard had been eating silently until now when he looked up and remarked  that powder of life which is made by the crooked magician is really a wonderful thing but dr pipt does not know its true value and he uses it in the most foolish ways  i must see about that said ozma gravely then she smiled again and continued in a lighter tone it was dr pipts famous powder of life that enabled me to become the ruler of oz  ive never heard that story said the shaggy man looking at ozma questioningly  well when i was a baby girl i was stolen by an old witch named mombi and transformed into a boy began the girl ruler i did not know who i was and when i grew big enough to work the witch made me wait upon her and carry wood for the fire and hoe in the garden one day she came back from a journey bringing some of the powder of life which dr pipt had given her i had made a pumpkinheaded man and set it up in her path to frighten her for i was fond of fun and hated the witch but she knew what the figure was and to test her powder of life she sprinkled some of it on the man i had made it came to life and is now our dear friend jack pumpkinhead that night i ran away with jack to escape punishment and i took old mombis powder of life with me during our journey we came upon a wooden sawhorse standing by the road and i used the magic powder to bring it to life the sawhorse has been with me ever since when i got to the emerald city the good sorceress glinda knew who i was and restored me to my proper person when i became the rightful ruler of this land so you see had not old mombi brought home the powder of life i might never have run away from her and become ozma of oz nor would we have had jack pumpkinhead and the sawhorse to comfort and amuse us  that story interested the shaggy man very much as well as the others who had often heard it before the dinner being now concluded they all went to ozmas drawingroom where they passed a pleasant evening before it came time to retire     chapter eighteen  ojo is forgiven   the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers went to the prison and took ojo away to the royal palace where he was summoned to appear before the girl ruler for judgment again the soldier put upon the boy the jeweled handcuffs and white prisoners robe with the peaked top and holes for the eyes ojo was so ashamed both of his disgrace and the fault he had committed that he was glad to be covered up in this way so that people could not see him or know who he was he followed the soldier with the green whiskers very willingly anxious that his fate might be decided as soon as possible  the inhabitants of the emerald city were polite people and never jeered at the unfortunate but it was so long since they had seen a prisoner that they cast many curious looks toward the boy and many of them hurried away to the royal palace to be present during the trial  when ojo was escorted into the great throne room of the palace he found hundreds of people assembled there in the magnificent emerald throne which sparkled with countless jewels sat ozma of oz in her robe of state which was embroidered with emeralds and pearls on her right but a little lower was dorothy and on her left the scarecrow still lower but nearly in front of ozma sat the wonderful wizard of oz and on a small table beside him was the golden vase from dorothys room into which scraps had dropped the stolen clover  at ozmas feet crouched two enormous beasts each the largest and most powerful of its kind although these beasts were quite free no one present was alarmed by them for the cowardly lion and the hungry tiger were well known and respected in the emerald city and they always guarded the ruler when she held high court in the throne room there was still another beast present but this one dorothy held in her arms for it was her constant companion the little dog toto toto knew the cowardly lion and the hungry tiger and often played and romped with them for they were good friends  seated on ivory chairs before ozma with a clear space between them and the throne were many of the nobility of the emerald city lords and ladies in beautiful costumes and officials of the kingdom in the royal uniforms of oz behind these courtiers were others of less importance filling the great hall to the very doors  at the same moment that the soldier with the green whiskers arrived with ojo the shaggy man entered from a side door escorting the patchwork girl the woozy and the glass cat all these came to the vacant space before the throne and stood facing the ruler  hullo ojo said scraps how are you  all right he replied but the scene awed the boy and his voice trembled a little with fear nothing could awe the patchwork girl and although the woozy was somewhat uneasy in these splendid surroundings the glass cat was delighted with the sumptuousness of the court and the impressiveness of the occasionpretty big words but quite expressive  at a sign from ozma the soldier removed ojos white robe and the boy stood face to face with the girl who was to decide his punishment he saw at a glance how lovely and sweet she was and his heart gave a bound of joy for he hoped she would be merciful  ozma sat looking at the prisoner a long time then she said gently  one of the laws of oz forbids anyone to pick a sixleaved clover you are accused of having broken this law even after you had been warned not to do so  ojo hung his head and while he hesitated how to reply the patchwork girl stepped forward and spoke for him  all this fuss is about nothing at all she said facing ozma unabashed you cant prove he picked the sixleaved clover so youve no right to accuse him of it search him if you like but you wont find the clover look in his basket and youll find its not there he hasnt got it so i demand that you set this poor munchkin boy free  the people of oz listened to this defiance in amazement and wondered at the queer patchwork girl who dared talk so boldly to their ruler but ozma sat silent and motionless and it was the little wizard who answered scraps  so the clover hasnt been picked eh he said i think it has i think the boy hid it in his basket and then gave the basket to you i also think you dropped the clover into this vase which stood in princess dorothys room hoping to get rid of it so it would not prove the boy guilty youre a stranger here miss patches and so you dont know that nothing can be hidden from our powerful rulers magic picturenor from the watchful eyes of the humble wizard of oz look all of you with these words he waved his hands toward the vase on the table which scraps now noticed for the first time  from the mouth of the vase a plant sprouted slowly growing before their eyes until it became a beautiful bush and on the topmost branch appeared the sixleaved clover which ojo had unfortunately picked  the patchwork girl looked at the clover and said oh so youve found it very well prove he picked it if you can  ozma turned to ojo  did you pick the sixleaved clover she asked  yes he replied i knew it was against the law but i wanted to save unc nunkie and i was afraid if i asked your consent to pick it you would refuse me  what caused you to think that asked the ruler  why it seemed to me a foolish law unjust and unreasonable even now i can see no harm in picking a sixleaved clover and ii had not seen the emerald city then nor you and i thought a girl who would make such a silly law would not be likely to help anyone in trouble  ozma regarded him musingly her chin resting upon her hand but she was not angry on the contrary she smiled a little at her thoughts and then grew sober again  i suppose a good many laws seem foolish to those people who do not understand them she said but no law is ever made without some purpose and that purpose is usually to protect all the people and guard their welfare as you are a stranger i will explain this law which to you seems so foolish years ago there were many witches and magicians in the land of oz and one of the things they often used in making their magic charms and transformations was a sixleaved clover these witches and magicians caused so much trouble among my people often using their powers for evil rather than good that i decided to forbid anyone to practice magic or sorcery except glinda the good and her assistant the wizard of oz both of whom i can trust to use their arts only to benefit my people and to make them happier since i issued that law the land of oz has been far more peaceful and quiet but i learned that some of the witches and magicians were still practicing magic on the sly and using the sixleaved clovers to make their potions and charms therefore i made another law forbidding anyone from plucking a sixleaved clover or from gathering other plants and herbs which the witches boil in their kettles to work magic with that has almost put an end to wicked sorcery in our land so you see the law was not a foolish one but wise and just and in any event it is wrong to disobey a law  ojo knew she was right and felt greatly mortified to realize he had acted and spoken so ridiculously but he raised his head and looked ozma in the face saying  i am sorry i have acted wrongly and broken your law i did it to save unc nunkie and thought i would not be found out but i am guilty of this act and whatever punishment you think i deserve i will suffer willingly  ozma smiled more brightly then and nodded graciously  you are forgiven she said for although you have committed a serious fault you are now penitent and i think you have been punished enough soldier release ojo the lucky and  i beg your pardon im ojo the unlucky said the boy  at this moment you are lucky said she release him soldier and let him go free  the people were glad to hear ozmas decree and murmured their approval as the royal audience was now over they began to leave the throne room and soon there were none remaining except ojo and his friends and ozma and her favorites  the girl ruler now asked ojo to sit down and tell her all his story which he did beginning at the time he had left his home in the forest and ending with his arrival at the emerald city and his arrest ozma listened attentively and was thoughtful for some moments after the boy had finished speaking then she said  the crooked magician was wrong to make the glass cat and the patchwork girl for it was against the law and if he had not unlawfully kept the bottle of liquid of petrifaction standing on his shelf the accident to his wife margolotte and to unc nunkie could not have occurred i can understand however that ojo who loves his uncle will be unhappy unless he can save him also i feel it is wrong to leave those two victims standing as marble statues when they ought to be alive so i propose we allow dr pipt to make the magic charm which will save them and that we assist ojo to find the things he is seeking what do you think wizard  that is perhaps the best thing to do replied the wizard but after the crooked magician has restored those poor people to life you must take away his magic powers  i will promised ozma  now tell me please what magic things must you find continued the wizard addressing ojo  the three hairs from the woozys tail i have said the boy that is i have the woozy and the hairs are in his tail the sixleaved clover ii  you may take it and keep it said ozma that will not be breaking the law for it is already picked and the crime of picking it is forgiven  thank you cried ojo gratefully then he continued the next thing i must find is a gill of water from a dark well  the wizard shook his head that said he will be a hard task but if you travel far enough you may discover it  i am willing to travel for years if it will save unc nunkie declared ojo earnestly  then youd better begin your journey at once advised the wizard  dorothy had been listening with interest to this conversation now she turned to ozma and asked may i go with ojo to help him  would you like to returned ozma  yes i know oz pretty well but ojo doesnt know it at all im sorry for his uncle and poor margolotte and id like to help save them may i go  if you wish to replied ozma  if dorothy goes then i must go to take care of her said the scarecrow decidedly a dark well can only be discovered in some outoftheway place and there may be dangers there  you have my permission to accompany dorothy said ozma and while you are gone i will take care of the patchwork girl  ill take care of myself announced scraps for im going with the scarecrow and dorothy i promised ojo to help him find the things he wants and ill stick to my promise  very well replied ozma but i see no need for ojo to take the glass cat and the woozy  i prefer to remain here said the cat ive nearly been nicked half a dozen times already and if theyre going into dangers its best for me to keep away from them  let jellia jamb keep her till ojo returns suggested dorothy we wont need to take the woozy either but he ought to be saved because of the three hairs in his tail  better take me along said the woozy my eyes can flash fire you know and i can growla little  im sure youll be safer here ozma decided and the woozy made no further objection to the plan  after consulting together they decided that ojo and his party should leave the very next day to search for the gill of water from a dark well so they now separated to make preparations for the journey  ozma gave the munchkin boy a room in the palace for that night and the afternoon he passed with dorothygetting acquainted as she saidand receiving advice from the shaggy man as to where they must go the shaggy man had wandered in many parts of oz and so had dorothy for that matter yet neither of them knew where a dark well was to be found  if such a thing is anywhere in the settled parts of oz said dorothy wed probly have heard of it long ago if its in the wild parts of the country no one there would need a dark well praps there isnt such a thing  oh there must be returned ojo positively or else the recipe of dr pipt wouldnt call for it  thats true agreed dorothy and if its anywhere in the land of oz were bound to find it  well were bound to search for it anyhow said the scarecrow as for finding it we must trust to luck  dont do that begged ojo earnestly im called ojo the unlucky you know     chapter nineteen  trouble with the tottenhots   a days journey from the emerald city brought the little band of adventurers to the home of jack pumpkinhead which was a house formed from the shell of an immense pumpkin jack had made it himself and was very proud of it there was a door and several windows and through the top was stuck a stovepipe that led from a small stove inside the door was reached by a flight of three steps and there was a good floor on which was arranged some furniture that was quite comfortable  it is certain that jack pumpkinhead might have had a much finer house to live in had he wanted it for ozma loved the stupid fellow who had been her earliest companion but jack preferred his pumpkin house as it matched himself very well and in this he was not so stupid after all  the body of this remarkable person was made of wood branches of trees of various sizes having been used for the purpose this wooden framework was covered by a red shirtwith white spots in itblue trousers a yellow vest a jacket of greenandgold and stout leather shoes the neck was a sharpened stick on which the pumpkin head was set and the eyes ears nose and mouth were carved on the skin of the pumpkin very like a childs jackolantern  the house of this interesting creation stood in the center of a vast pumpkinfield where the vines grew in profusion and bore pumpkins of extraordinary size as well as those which were smaller some of the pumpkins now ripening on the vines were almost as large as jacks house and he told dorothy he intended to add another pumpkin to his mansion  the travelers were cordially welcomed to this quaint domicile and invited to pass the night there which they had planned to do the patchwork girl was greatly interested in jack and examined him admiringly  you are quite handsome she said but not as really beautiful as the scarecrow  jack turned at this to examine the scarecrow critically and his old friend slyly winked one painted eye at him  there is no accounting for tastes remarked the pumpkinhead with a sigh an old crow once told me i was very fascinating but of course the bird might have been mistaken yet i have noticed that the crows usually avoid the scarecrow who is a very honest fellow in his way but stuffed i am not stuffed you will observe my body is good solid hickory  i adore stuffing said the patchwork girl  well as for that my head is stuffed with pumpkinseeds declared jack i use them for brains and when they are fresh i am intellectual just now i regret to say my seeds are rattling a bit so i must soon get another head  oh do you change your head asked ojo  to be sure pumpkins are not permanent mores the pity and in time they spoil that is why i grow such a great field of pumpkinsthat i may select a new head whenever necessary  who carves the faces on them inquired the boy  i do that myself i lift off my old head place it on a table before me and use the face for a pattern to go by sometimes the faces i carve are better than othersmore expressive and cheerful you knowbut i think they average very well  before she had started on the journey dorothy had packed a knapsack with the things she might need and this knapsack the scarecrow carried strapped to his back the little girl wore a plain gingham dress and a checked sunbonnet as she knew they were best fitted for travel ojo also had brought along his basket to which ozma had added a bottle of square meal tablets and some fruit but jack pumpkinhead grew a lot of things in his garden besides pumpkins so he cooked for them a fine vegetable soup and gave dorothy ojo and toto the only ones who found it necessary to eat a pumpkin pie and some green cheese for beds they must use the sweet dried grasses which jack had strewn along one side of the room but that satisfied dorothy and ojo very well toto of course slept beside his little mistress  the scarecrow scraps and the pumpkinhead were tireless and had no need to sleep so they sat up and talked together all night but they stayed outside the house under the bright stars and talked in low tones so as not to disturb the sleepers during the conversation the scarecrow explained their quest for a dark well and asked jacks advice where to find it  the pumpkinhead considered the matter gravely  that is going to be a difficult task said he and if i were you id take any ordinary well and enclose it so as to make it dark  i fear that wouldnt do replied the scarecrow the well must be naturally dark and the water must never have seen the light of day for otherwise the magic charm might not work at all  how much of the water do you need asked jack  a gill  how much is a gill  whya gill is a gill of course answered the scarecrow who did not wish to display his ignorance  i know cried scraps jack and jill went up the hill to fetch  no no thats wrong interrupted the scarecrow there are two kinds of gills i think one is a girl and the other is  a gillyflower said jack  no a measure  how big a measure  well ill ask dorothy  so next morning they asked dorothy and she said  i dont just know how much a gill is but ive brought along a gold flask that holds a pint thats more than a gill im sure and the crooked magician may measure it to suit himself but the thing thats bothering us most jack is to find the well  jack gazed around the landscape for he was standing in the doorway of his house  this is a flat country so you wont find any dark wells here said he you must go into the mountains where rocks and caverns are  and where is that asked ojo  in the quadling country which lies south of here replied the scarecrow ive known all along that we must go to the mountains  so have i said dorothy  butgoodness methe quadling country is full of dangers declared jack ive never been there myself but  i have said the scarecrow ive faced the dreadful hammerheads which have no arms and butt you like a goat and ive faced the fighting trees which bend down their branches to pound and whip you and had many other adventures there  its a wild country remarked dorothy soberly and if we go there were sure to have troubles of our own but i guess well have to go if we want that gill of water from the dark well  so they said goodbye to the pumpkinhead and resumed their travels heading now directly toward the south country where mountains and rocks and caverns and forests of great trees abounded this part of the land of oz while it belonged to ozma and owed her allegiance was so wild and secluded that many queer peoples hid in its jungles and lived in their own way without even a knowledge that they had a ruler in the emerald city if they were left alone these creatures never troubled the inhabitants of the rest of oz but those who invaded their domains encountered many dangers from them  it was a two days journey from jack pumkinheads house to the edge of the quadling country for neither dorothy nor ojo could walk very fast and they often stopped by the wayside to rest the first night they slept on the broad fields among the buttercups and daisies and the scarecrow covered the children with a gauze blanket taken from his knapsack so they would not be chilled by the night air toward evening of the second day they reached a sandy plain where walking was difficult but some distance before them they saw a group of palm trees with many curious black dots under them so they trudged bravely on to reach that place by dark and spend the night under the shelter of the trees  the black dots grew larger as they advanced and although the light was dim dorothy thought they looked like big kettles turned upside down just beyond this place a jumble of huge jagged rocks lay scattered rising to the mountains behind them  our travelers preferred to attempt to climb these rocks by daylight and they realized that for a time this would be their last night on the plains  twilight had fallen by the time they came to the trees beneath which were the black circular objects they had marked from a distance dozens of them were scattered around and dorothy bent near to one which was about as tall as she was to examine it more closely as she did so the top flew open and out popped a dusky creature rising its length into the air and then plumping down upon the ground just beside the little girl another and another popped out of the circular potlike dwelling while from all the other black objects came popping more creaturesvery like jumpingjacks when their boxes are unhookeduntil fully a hundred stood gathered around our little group of travelers  by this time dorothy had discovered they were people tiny and curiously formed but still people their skins were dusky and their hair stood straight up like wires and was brilliant scarlet in color their bodies were bare except for skins fastened around their waists and they wore bracelets on their ankles and wrists and necklaces and great pendant earrings  toto crouched beside his mistress and wailed as if he did not like these strange creatures a bit scraps began to mutter something about hoppity poppity jumpity dump but no one paid any attention to her ojo kept close to the scarecrow and the scarecrow kept close to dorothy but the little girl turned to the queer creatures and asked  who are you  they answered this question all together in a sort of chanting chorus the words being as follows      were the jolly tottenhots     we do not like the day     but in the night tis our delight     to gambol skip and play      we hate the sun and from it run     the moon is cool and clear     so on this spot each tottenhot     waits for it to appear      were evry one chock full of fun     and full of mischief too     but if youre gay and with us play     well do no harm to you   glad to meet you tottenhots said the scarecrow solemnly but you mustnt expect us to play with you all night for weve traveled all day and some of us are tired  and we never gamble added the patchwork girl its against the law  these remarks were greeted with shouts of laughter by the impish creatures and one seized the scarecrows arm and was astonished to find the straw man whirl around so easily so the tottenhot raised the scarecrow high in the air and tossed him over the heads of the crowd some one caught him and tossed him back and so with shouts of glee they continued throwing the scarecrow here and there as if he had been a basketball  presently another imp seized scraps and began to throw her about in the same way they found her a little heavier than the scarecrow but still light enough to be tossed like a sofacushion and they were enjoying the sport immensely when dorothy angry and indignant at the treatment her friends were receiving rushed among the tottenhots and began slapping and pushing them until she had rescued the scarecrow and the patchwork girl and held them close on either side of her perhaps she would not have accomplished this victory so easily had not toto helped her barking and snapping at the bare legs of the imps until they were glad to flee from his attack as for ojo some of the creatures had attempted to toss him also but finding his body too heavy they threw him to the ground and a row of the imps sat on him and held him from assisting dorothy in her battle  the little brown folks were much surprised at being attacked by the girl and the dog and one or two who had been slapped hardest began to cry then suddenly they gave a shout all together and disappeared in a flash into their various houses the tops of which closed with a series of pops that sounded like a bunch of firecrackers being exploded  the adventurers now found themselves alone and dorothy asked anxiously  is anybody hurt  not me answered the scarecrow they have given my straw a good shaking up and taken all the lumps out of it i am now in splendid condition and am really obliged to the tottenhots for their kind treatment  i feel much the same way said scraps my cotton stuffing had sagged a good deal with the days walking and theyve loosened it up until i feel as plump as a sausage but the play was a little rough and id had quite enough of it when you interfered  six of them sat on me said ojo but as they are so little they didnt hurt me much  just then the roof of the house in front of them opened and a tottenhot stuck his head out very cautiously and looked at the strangers  cant you take a joke he asked reproachfully havent you any fun in you at all  if i had such a quality replied the scarecrow your people would have knocked it out of me but i dont bear grudges i forgive you  so do i added scraps that is if you behave yourselves after this  it was just a little roughhouse thats all said the tottenhot but the question is not if we will behave but if you will behave we cant be shut up here all night because this is our time to play nor do we care to come out and be chewed up by a savage beast or slapped by an angry girl that slapping hurts like sixty some of my folks are crying about it so heres the proposition you let us alone and well let you alone  you began it declared dorothy  well you ended it so we wont argue the matter may we come out again or are you still cruel and slappy  tell you what well do said dorothy were all tired and want to sleep until morning if youll let us get into your house and stay there until daylight you can play outside all you want to  thats a bargain cried the tottenhot eagerly and he gave a queer whistle that brought his people popping out of their houses on all sides when the house before them was vacant dorothy and ojo leaned over the hole and looked in but could see nothing because it was so dark but if the tottenhots slept there all day the children thought they could sleep there at night so ojo lowered himself down and found it was not very deep  theres a soft cushion all over said he come on in  dorothy handed toto to the boy and then climbed in herself after her came scraps and the scarecrow who did not wish to sleep but preferred to keep out of the way of the mischievous tottenhots  there seemed no furniture in the round den but soft cushions were strewn about the floor and these they found made very comfortable beds they did not close the hole in the roof but left it open to admit air it also admitted the shouts and ceaseless laughter of the impish tottenhots as they played outside but dorothy and ojo being weary from their journey were soon fast asleep  toto kept an eye open however and uttered low threatening growls whenever the racket made by the creatures outside became too boisterous and the scarecrow and the patchwork girl sat leaning against the wall and talked in whispers all night long no one disturbed the travelers until daylight when in popped the tottenhot who owned the place and invited them to vacate his premises     chapter twenty  the captive yoop   as they were preparing to leave dorothy asked can you tell us where there is a dark well  never heard of such a thing said the tottenhot we live our lives in the dark mostly and sleep in the daytime but weve never seen a dark well or anything like one  does anyone live on those mountains beyond here asked the scarecrow  lots of people but youd better not visit them we never go there was the reply  what are the people like dorothy inquired  cant say weve been told to keep away from the mountain paths and so we obey this sandy desert is good enough for us and were not disturbed here declared the tottenhot  so they left the man snuggling down to sleep in his dusky dwelling and went out into the sunshine taking the path that led toward the rocky places they soon found it hard climbing for the rocks were uneven and full of sharp points and edges and now there was no path at all clambering here and there among the boulders they kept steadily on gradually rising higher and higher until finally they came to a great rift in a part of the mountain where the rock seemed to have split in two and left high walls on either side  spose we go this way suggested dorothy its much easier walking than to climb over the hills  how about that sign asked ojo  what sign she inquired  the munchkin boy pointed to some words painted on the wall of rock beside them which dorothy had not noticed the words read      look out for yoop   the girl eyed this sign a moment and turned to the scarecrow asking  who is yoop or what is yoop  the straw man shook his head then looked at toto and the dog said woof  only way to find out is to go on said scraps  this being quite true they went on as they proceeded the walls of rock on either side grew higher and higher presently they came upon another sign which read      beware the captive yoop   why as for that remarked dorothy if yoop is a captive theres no need to beware of him whatever yoop happens to be id much rather have him a captive than running around loose  so had i agreed the scarecrow with a nod of his painted head  still said scraps reflectively      yooptehooptelooptegoop     who put noodles in the soup     we may beware but we dont care     and dare go where we scare the yoop   dear me arent you feeling a little queer just now dorothy asked the patchwork girl  not queer but crazy said ojo when she says those things im sure her brains get mixed somehow and work the wrong way  i dont see why we are told to beware the yoop unless he is dangerous observed the scarecrow in a puzzled tone  never mind well find out all about him when we get to where he is replied the little girl  the narrow canyon turned and twisted this way and that and the rift was so small that they were able to touch both walls at the same time by stretching out their arms toto had run on ahead frisking playfully when suddenly he uttered a sharp bark of fear and came running back to them with his tail between his legs as dogs do when they are frightened  ah said the scarecrow who was leading the way we must be near yoop  just then as he rounded a sharp turn the straw man stopped so suddenly that all the others bumped against him  what is it asked dorothy standing on tiptoes to look over his shoulder but then she saw what it was and cried oh in a tone of astonishment  in one of the rock wallsthat at their leftwas hollowed a great cavern in front of which was a row of thick iron bars the tops and bottoms being firmly fixed in the solid rock over this cavern was a big sign which dorothy read with much curiosity speaking the words aloud that all might know what they said      mister yoophis cave      the largest untamed giant in captivity     height 21 feetand yet he has but 2 feet     weight 1640 poundsbut he waits all the time     age 400 years and up as they say in the       department store advertisements     temper fierce and ferociousexcept when asleep     appetite ravenousprefers meat people and       orange marmalade      strangers approaching this cave do so at their       own peril      psdont feed the giant yourself   very well said ojo with a sigh lets go back  its a long way back declared dorothy  so it is remarked the scarecrow and it means a tedious climb over those sharp rocks if we cant use this passage i think it will be best to run by the giants cave as fast as we can go mister yoop seems to be asleep just now  but the giant wasnt asleep he suddenly appeared at the front of his cavern seized the iron bars in his great hairy hands and shook them until they rattled in their sockets yoop was so tall that our friends had to tip their heads way back to look into his face and they noticed he was dressed all in pink velvet with silver buttons and braid the giants boots were of pink leather and had tassels on them and his hat was decorated with an enormous pink ostrich feather carefully curled  yoho he said in a deep bass voice i smell dinner  i think you are mistaken replied the scarecrow there is no orange marmalade around here  ah but i eat other things asserted mister yoop that is i eat them when i can get them but this is a lonely place and no good meat has passed by my cave for many years so im hungry  havent you eaten anything in many years asked dorothy  nothing except six ants and a monkey i thought the monkey would taste like meat people but the flavor was different i hope you will taste better for you seem plump and tender  oh im not going to be eaten said dorothy  why not  i shall keep out of your way she answered  how heartless wailed the giant shaking the bars again consider how many years it is since ive eaten a single plump little girl they tell me meat is going up but if i can manage to catch you im sure it will soon be going down and ill catch you if i can  with this the giant pushed his big arms which looked like treetrunks except that treetrunks dont wear pink velvet between the iron bars and the arms were so long that they touched the opposite wall of the rock passage then he extended them as far as he could reach toward our travelers and found he could almost touch the scarecrowbut not quite  come a little nearer please begged the giant  im a scarecrow  a scarecrow ugh i dont care a straw for a scarecrow who is that brightcolored delicacy behind you  me asked scraps im a patchwork girl and im stuffed with cotton  dear me sighed the giant in a disappointed tone that reduces my dinner from four to twoand the dog ill save the dog for dessert  toto growled keeping a good distance away  back up said the scarecrow to those behind him let us go back a little way and talk this over  so they turned and went around the bend in the passage where they were out of sight of the cave and mister yoop could not hear them  my idea began the scarecrow when they had halted is to make a dash past the cave going on a run  hed grab us said dorothy  well he cant grab but one at a time and ill go first as soon as he grabs me the rest of you can slip past him out of his reach and he will soon let me go because i am not fit to eat  they decided to try this plan and dorothy took toto in her arms so as to protect him she followed just after the scarecrow then came ojo with scraps the last of the four their hearts beat a little faster than usual as they again approached the giants cave this time moving swiftly forward  it turned out about the way the scarecrow had planned mister yoop was quite astonished to see them come flying toward him and thrusting his arms between the bars he seized the scarecrow in a firm grip in the next instant he realized from the way the straw crunched between his fingers that he had captured the noneatable man but during that instant of delay dorothy and ojo had slipped by the giant and were out of reach uttering a howl of rage the monster threw the scarecrow after them with one hand and grabbed scraps with the other  the poor scarecrow went whirling through the air and so cleverly was he aimed that he struck ojos back and sent the boy tumbling head over heels and he tripped dorothy and sent her also sprawling upon the ground toto flew out of the little girls arms and landed some distance ahead and all were so dazed that it was a moment before they could scramble to their feet again when they did so they turned to look toward the giants cave and at that moment the ferocious mister yoop threw the patchwork girl at them  down went all three again in a heap with scraps on top the giant roared so terribly that for a time they were afraid he had broken loose but he hadnt so they sat in the road and looked at one another in a rather bewildered way and then began to feel glad  we did it exclaimed the scarecrow with satisfaction and now we are free to go on our way  mister yoop is very impolite declared scraps he jarred me terribly its lucky my stitches are so fine and strong for otherwise such harsh treatment might rip me up the back  allow me to apologize for the giant said the scarecrow raising the patchwork girl to her feet and dusting her skirt with his stuffed hands mister yoop is a perfect stranger to me but i fear from the rude manner in which he has acted that he is no gentleman  dorothy and ojo laughed at this statement and toto barked as if he understood the joke after which they all felt better and resumed the journey in high spirits  of course said the little girl when they had walked a way along the passage it was lucky for us the giant was caged for if he had happened to be loose hehe  perhaps in that case he wouldnt be hungry any more said ojo gravely     chapter twentyone  hip hopper the champion   they must have had good courage to climb all those rocks for after getting out of the canyon they encountered more rock hills to be surmounted toto could jump from one rock to another quite easily but the others had to creep and climb with care so that after a whole day of such work dorothy and ojo found themselves very tired  as they gazed upward at the great mass of tumbled rocks that covered the steep incline dorothy gave a little groan and said  thats going to be a terble hard climb scarecrow i wish we could find the dark well without so much trouble  suppose said ojo you wait here and let me do the climbing for its on my account were searching for the dark well then if i dont find anything ill come back and join you  no replied the little girl shaking her head positively well all go together for that way we can help each other if you went alone something might happen to you ojo  so they began the climb and found it indeed difficult for a way but presently in creeping over the big crags they found a path at their feet which wound in and out among the masses of rock and was quite smooth and easy to walk upon as the path gradually ascended the mountain although in a roundabout way they decided to follow it  this must be the road to the country of the hoppers said the scarecrow  who are the hoppers asked dorothy  some people jack pumpkinhead told me about he replied  i didnt hear him replied the girl  no you were asleep explained the scarecrow but he told scraps and me that the hoppers and the horners live on this mountain  he said in the mountain declared scraps but of course he meant on it  didnt he say what the hoppers and horners were like inquired dorothy  no he only said they were two separate nations and that the horners were the most important  well if we go to their country well find out all about em said the girl but ive never heard ozma mention those people so they cant be very important  is this mountain in the land of oz asked scraps  course it is answered dorothy its in the south country of the quadlings when one comes to the edge of oz in any direction there is nothing more to be seen at all once you could see sandy desert all around oz but now its diffrent and no other people can see us any more than we can see them  if the mountain is under ozmas rule why doesnt she know about the hoppers and the horners ojo asked  why its a fairyland explained dorothy and lots of queer people live in places so tucked away that those in the emerald city never even hear of em in the middle of the country its diffrent but when you get around the edges youre sure to run into strange little corners that surprise you i know for ive traveled in oz a good deal and so has the scarecrow  yes admitted the straw man ive been considerable of a traveler in my time and i like to explore strange places i find i learn much more by traveling than by staying at home  during this conversation they had been walking up the steep pathway and now found themselves well up on the mountain they could see nothing around them for the rocks beside their path were higher than their heads nor could they see far in front of them because the path was so crooked but suddenly they stopped because the path ended and there was no place to go ahead was a big rock lying against the side of the mountain and this blocked the way completely  there wouldnt be a path though if it didnt go somewhere said the scarecrow wrinkling his forehead in deep thought  this is somewhere isnt it asked the patchwork girl laughing at the bewildered looks of the others      the path is locked the way is blocked     yet here weve innocently flocked     and now were here its rather queer     theres no front door that can be knocked   please dont scraps said ojo you make me nervous  well said dorothy im glad of a little rest for thats a dreaful steep path  as she spoke she leaned against the edge of the big rock that stood in their way to her surprise it slowly swung backward and showed behind it a dark hole that looked like the mouth of a tunnel  why heres where the path goes to she exclaimed  so it is answered the scarecrow but the question is do we want to go where the path does  its underground right inside the mountain said ojo peering into the dark hole perhaps theres a well there and if there is its sure to be a dark one  why thats true enough cried dorothy with eagerness lets go in scarecrow cause if others have gone were pretty safe to go too  toto looked in and barked but he did not venture to enter until the scarecrow had bravely gone first scraps followed closely after the straw man and then ojo and dorothy timidly stepped inside the tunnel as soon as all of them had passed the big rock it slowly turned and filled up the opening again but now they were no longer in the dark for a soft rosy light enabled them to see around them quite distinctly  it was only a passage wide enough for two of them to walk abreastwith toto in between themand it had a high arched roof they could not see where the light which flooded the place so pleasantly came from for there were no lamps anywhere visible the passage ran straight for a little way and then made a bend to the right and another sharp turn to the left after which it went straight again but there were no side passages so they could not lose their way  after proceeding some distance toto who had gone on ahead began to bark loudly they ran around a bend to see what was the matter and found a man sitting on the floor of the passage and leaning his back against the wall he had probably been asleep before totos barks aroused him for he was now rubbing his eyes and staring at the little dog with all his might  there was something about this man that toto objected to and when he slowly rose to his foot they saw what it was he had but one leg set just below the middle of his round fat body but it was a stout leg and had a broad flat foot at the bottom of it on which the man seemed to stand very well he had never had but this one leg which looked something like a pedestal and when toto ran up and made a grab at the mans ankle he hopped first one way and then another in a very active manner looking so frightened that scraps laughed aloud  toto was usually a well behaved dog but this time he was angry and snapped at the mans leg again and again this filled the poor fellow with fear and in hopping out of totos reach he suddenly lost his balance and tumbled heel over head upon the floor when he sat up he kicked toto on the nose and made the dog howl angrily but dorothy now ran forward and caught totos collar holding him back  do you surrender she asked the man  who me asked the hopper  yes you said the little girl  am i captured he inquired  of course my dog has captured you she said  well replied the man if im captured i must surrender for its the proper thing to do i like to do everything proper for it saves one a lot of trouble  it does indeed said dorothy please tell us who you are  im hip hopperhip hopper the champion  champion what she asked in surprise  champion wrestler im a very strong man and that ferocious animal which you are so kindly holding is the first living thing that has ever conquered me  and you are a hopper she continued  yes my people live in a great city not far from here would you like to visit it  im not sure she said with hesitation have you any dark wells in your city  i think not we have wells you know but theyre all well lighted and a well lighted well cannot well be a dark well but there may be such a thing as a very dark well in the horner country which is a black spot on the face of the earth  where is the horner country ojo inquired  the other side of the mountain theres a fence between the hopper country and the horner country and a gate in the fence but you cant pass through just now because we are at war with the horners  thats too bad said the scarecrow what seems to be the trouble  why one of them made a very insulting remark about my people he said we were lacking in understanding because we had only one leg to a person i cant see that legs have anything to do with understanding things the horners each have two legs just as you have thats one leg too many it seems to me  no declared dorothy its just the right number  you dont need them argued the hopper obstinately youve only one head and one body and one nose and mouth two legs are quite unnecessary and they spoil ones shape  but how can you walk with only one leg asked ojo  walk who wants to walk exclaimed the man walking is a terribly awkward way to travel i hop and so do all my people its so much more graceful and agreeable than walking  i dont agree with you said the scarecrow but tell me is there any way to get to the horner country without going through the city of the hoppers  yes there is another path from the rocky lowlands outside the mountain that leads straight to the entrance of the horner country but its a long way around so youd better come with me perhaps they will allow you to go through the gate but we expect to conquer them this afternoon if we get time and then you may go and come as you please  they thought it best to take the hoppers advice and asked him to lead the way this he did in a series of hops and he moved so swiftly in this strange manner that those with two legs had to run to keep up with him     chapter twentytwo  the joking horners   it was not long before they left the passage and came to a great cave so high that it must have reached nearly to the top of the mountain within which it lay it was a magnificent cave illumined by the soft invisible light so that everything in it could be plainly seen the walls were of polished marble white with veins of delicate colors running through it and the roof was arched and fantastic and beautiful  built beneath this vast dome was a pretty villagenot very large for there seemed not more than fifty houses altogetherand the dwellings were of marble and artistically designed no grass nor flowers nor trees grew in this cave so the yards surrounding the houses carved in designs both were smooth and bare and had low walls around them to mark their boundaries  in the streets and the yards of the houses were many people all having one leg growing below their bodies and all hopping here and there whenever they moved even the children stood firmly upon their single legs and never lost their balance  all hail champion cried a man in the first group of hoppers they met whom have you captured  no one replied the champion in a gloomy voice these strangers have captured me  then said another we will rescue you and capture them for we are greater in number  no answered the champion i cant allow it ive surrendered and it isnt polite to capture those youve surrendered to  never mind that said dorothy we will give you your liberty and set you free  really asked the champion in joyous tones  yes said the little girl your people may need you to help conquer the horners  at this all the hoppers looked downcast and sad several more had joined the group by this time and quite a crowd of curious men women and children surrounded the strangers  this war with our neighbors is a terrible thing remarked one of the women some one is almost sure to get hurt  why do you say that madam inquired the scarecrow  because the horns of our enemies are sharp and in battle they will try to stick those horns into our warriors she replied  how many horns do the horners have asked dorothy  each has one horn in the center of his forehead was the answer  oh then theyre unicorns declared the scarecrow  no theyre horners we never go to war with them if we can help it on account of their dangerous horns but this insult was so great and so unprovoked that our brave men decided to fight in order to be revenged said the woman  what weapons do you fight with the scarecrow asked  we have no weapons explained the champion whenever we fight the horners our plan is to push them back for our arms are longer than theirs  then you are better armed said scraps  yes but they have those terrible horns and unless we are careful they prick us with the points returned the champion with a shudder that makes a war with them dangerous and a dangerous war cannot be a pleasant one  i see very clearly remarked the scarecrow that you are going to have trouble in conquering those hornersunless we help you  oh cried the hoppers in a chorus can you help us please do we will be greatly obliged it would please us very much and by these exclamations the scarecrow knew that his speech had met with favor  how far is it to the horner country he asked  why its just the other side of the fence they answered and the champion added  come with me please and ill show you the horners  so they followed the champion and several others through the streets and just beyond the village came to a very high picket fence built all of marble which seemed to divide the great cave into two equal parts  but the part inhabited by the horners was in no way as grand in appearance as that of the hoppers instead of being marble the walls and roof were of dull gray rock and the square houses were plainly made of the same material but in extent the city was much larger than that of the hoppers and the streets were thronged with numerous people who busied themselves in various ways  looking through the open pickets of the fence our friends watched the horners who did not know they were being watched by strangers and found them very unusual in appearance they were little folks in size and had bodies round as balls and short legs and arms their heads were round too and they had long pointed ears and a horn set in the center of the forehead the horns did not seem very terrible for they were not more than six inches long but they were ivory white and sharp pointed and no wonder the hoppers feared them  the skins of the horners were light brown but they wore snowwhite robes and were barefooted dorothy thought the most striking thing about them was their hair which grew in three distinct colors on each and every headred yellow and green the red was at the bottom and sometimes hung over their eyes then came a broad circle of yellow and the green was at the top and formed a brushshaped topknot  none of the horners was yet aware of the presence of strangers who watched the little brown people for a time and then went to the big gate in the center of the dividing fence it was locked on both sides and over the latch was a sign reading      war is declared   cant we go through asked dorothy  not now answered the champion  i think said the scarecrow that if i could talk with those horners they would apologize to you and then there would be no need to fight  cant you talk from this side asked the champion  not so well replied the scarecrow do you suppose you could throw me over that fence it is high but i am very light  we can try it said the hopper i am perhaps the strongest man in my country so ill undertake to do the throwing but i wont promise you will land on your feet  no matter about that returned the scarecrow just toss me over and ill be satisfied  so the champion picked up the scarecrow and balanced him a moment to see how much he weighed and then with all his strength tossed him high into the air  perhaps if the scarecrow had been a trifle heavier he would have been easier to throw and would have gone a greater distance but as it was instead of going over the fence he landed just on top of it and one of the sharp pickets caught him in the middle of his back and held him fast prisoner had he been face downward the scarecrow might have managed to free himself but lying on his back on the picket his hands waved in the air of the horner country while his feet kicked the air of the hopper country so there he was  are you hurt called the patchwork girl anxiously  course not said dorothy but if he wiggles that way he may tear his clothes how can we get him down mr champion  the champion shook his head  i dont know he confessed if he could scare horners as well as he does crows it might be a good idea to leave him there  this is terrible said ojo almost ready to cry i spose its because i am ojo the unlucky that everyone who tries to help me gets into trouble  you are lucky to have anyone to help you declared dorothy but dont worry well rescue the scarecrow somehow  i know how announced scraps here mr champion just throw me up to the scarecrow im nearly as light as he is and when im on top the fence ill pull our friend off the picket and toss him down to you  all right said the champion and he picked up the patchwork girl and threw her in the same manner he had the scarecrow he must have used more strength this time however for scraps sailed far over the top of the fence and without being able to grab the scarecrow at all tumbled to the ground in the horner country where her stuffed body knocked over two men and a woman and made a crowd that had collected there run like rabbits to get away from her  seeing the next moment that she was harmless the people slowly returned and gathered around the patchwork girl regarding her with astonishment one of them wore a jeweled star in his hair just above his horn and this seemed a person of importance he spoke for the rest of his people who treated him with great respect  who are you unknown being he asked  scraps she said rising to her feet and patting her cotton wadding smooth where it had bunched up  and where did you come from he continued  over the fence dont be silly theres no other place i could have come from she replied  he looked at her thoughtfully  you are not a hopper said he for you have two legs theyre not very well shaped but they are two in number and that strange creature on top the fencewhy doesnt he stop kickingmust be your brother or father or son for he also has two legs  you must have been to visit the wise donkey said scraps laughing so merrily that the crowd smiled with her in sympathy but that reminds me captainor king  i am chief of the horners and my name is jak  of course little jack horner i might have known it but the reason i volplaned over the fence was so i could have a talk with you about the hoppers  what about the hoppers asked the chief frowning  youve insulted them and youd better beg their pardon said scraps if you dont theyll probably hop over here and conquer you  were not afraidas long as the gate is locked declared the chief and we didnt insult them at all one of us made a joke that the stupid hoppers couldnt see  the chief smiled as he said this and the smile made his face look quite jolly  what was the joke asked scraps  a horner said they have less understanding than we because theyve only one leg ha ha you see the point dont you if you stand on your legs and your legs are under you thenha ha hathen your legs are your understanding hee hee hee ho ho my but thats a fine joke and the stupid hoppers couldnt see it they couldnt see that with only one leg they must have less understanding than we who have two legs ha ha ha hee hee ho ho the chief wiped the tears of laughter from his eyes with the bottom hem of his white robe and all the other horners wiped their eyes on their robes for they had laughed just as heartily as their chief at the absurd joke  then said scraps their understanding of the understanding you meant led to the misunderstanding  exactly and so theres no need for us to apologize returned the chief  no need for an apology perhaps but much need for an explanation said scraps decidedly you dont want war do you  not if we can help it admitted jak horner the question is whos going to explain the joke to the horners you know it spoils any joke to be obliged to explain it and this is the best joke i ever heard  who made the joke asked scraps  diksey horner he is working in the mines just now but hell be home before long suppose we wait and talk with him about it maybe hell be willing to explain his joke to the hoppers  all right said scraps ill wait if diksey isnt too long  no hes short hes shorter than i am ha ha ha say thats a better joke than dikseys he wont be too long because hes short hee hee ho  the other horners who were standing by roared with laughter and seemed to like their chiefs joke as much as he did scraps thought it was odd that they could be so easily amused but decided there could be little harm in people who laughed so merrily     chapter twentythree  peace is declared   come with me to my dwelling and ill introduce you to my daughters said the chief were bringing them up according to a book of rules that was written by one of our leading old bachelors and everyone says theyre a remarkable lot of girls  so scraps accompanied him along the street to a house that seemed on the outside exceptionally grimy and dingy the streets of this city were not paved nor had any attempt been made to beautify the houses or their surroundings and having noticed this condition scraps was astonished when the chief ushered her into his home  here was nothing grimy or faded indeed on the contrary the room was of dazzling brilliance and beauty for it was lined throughout with an exquisite metal that resembled translucent frosted silver the surface of this metal was highly ornamented in raised designs representing men animals flowers and trees and from the metal itself was radiated the soft light which flooded the room all the furniture was made of the same glorious metal and scraps asked what it was  thats radium answered the chief we horners spend all our time digging radium from the mines under this mountain and we use it to decorate our homes and make them pretty and cosy it is a medicine too and no one can ever be sick who lives near radium  have you plenty of it asked the patchwork girl  more than we can use all the houses in this city are decorated with it just the same as mine is  why dont you use it on your streets then and the outside of your houses to make them as pretty as they are within she inquired  outside who cares for the outside of anything asked the chief we horners dont live on the outside of our homes we live inside many people are like those stupid hoppers who love to make an outside show i suppose you strangers thought their city more beautiful than ours because you judged from appearances and they have handsome marble houses and marble streets but if you entered one of their stiff dwellings you would find it bare and uncomfortable as all their show is on the outside they have an idea that what is not seen by others is not important but with us the rooms we live in are our chief delight and care and we pay no attention to outside show  seems to me said scraps musingly it would be better to make it all prettyinside and out  seems why youre all seams my girl said the chief and then he laughed heartily at his latest joke and a chorus of small voices echoed the chorus with teeheehee ha ha  scraps turned around and found a row of girls seated in radium chairs ranged along one wall of the room there were nineteen of them by actual count and they were of all sizes from a tiny child to one almost a grown woman all were neatly dressed in spotless white robes and had brown skins horns on their foreheads and threecolored hair  these said the chief are my sweet daughters my dears i introduce to you miss scraps patchwork a lady who is traveling in foreign parts to increase her store of wisdom  the nineteen horner girls all arose and made a polite curtsey after which they resumed their seats and rearranged their robes properly  why do they sit so still and all in a row asked scraps  because it is ladylike and proper replied the chief  but some are just children poor things dont they ever run around and play and laugh and have a good time  no indeed said the chief that would be improper in young ladies as well as in those who will sometime become young ladies my daughters are being brought up according to the rules and regulations laid down by a leading bachelor who has given the subject much study and is himself a man of taste and culture politeness is his great hobby and he claims that if a child is allowed to do an impolite thing one cannot expect the grown person to do anything better  is it impolite to romp and shout and be jolly asked scraps  well sometimes it is and sometimes it isnt replied the horner after considering the question by curbing such inclinations in my daughters we keep on the safe side once in a while i make a good joke as you have heard and then i permit my daughters to laugh decorously but they are never allowed to make a joke themselves  that old bachelor who made the rules ought to be skinned alive declared scraps and would have said more on the subject had not the door opened to admit a little horner man whom the chief introduced as diksey  whats up chief asked diksey winking nineteen times at the nineteen girls who demurely cast down their eyes because their father was looking  the chief told the man that his joke had not been understood by the dull hoppers who had become so angry that they had declared war so the only way to avoid a terrible battle was to explain the joke so they could understand it  all right replied diksey who seemed a goodnatured man ill go at once to the fence and explain i dont want any war with the hoppers for wars between nations always cause hard feelings  so the chief and diksey and scraps left the house and went back to the marble picket fence the scarecrow was still stuck on the top of his picket but had now ceased to struggle on the other side of the fence were dorothy and ojo looking between the pickets and there also were the champion and many other hoppers  diksey went close to the fence and said  my good hoppers i wish to explain that what i said about you was a joke you have but one leg each and we have two legs each our legs are under us whether one or two and we stand on them so when i said you had less understanding than we i did not mean that you had less understanding you understand but that you had less standundering so to speak do you understand that  the hoppers thought it over carefully then one said  that is clear enough but where does the joke come in  dorothy laughed for she couldnt help it although all the others were solemn enough  ill tell you where the joke comes in she said and took the hoppers away to a distance where the horners could not hear them you know she then explained those neighbors of yours are not very bright poor things and what they think is a joke isnt a joke at allits true dont you see  true that we have less understanding asked the champion  yes its true because you dont understand such a poor joke if you did youd be no wiser than they are  ah yes of course they answered looking very wise  so ill tell you what to do continued dorothy laugh at their poor joke and tell em its pretty good for a horner then they wont dare say you have less understanding because you understand as much as they do  the hoppers looked at one another questioningly and blinked their eyes and tried to think what it all meant but they couldnt figure it out  what do you think champion asked one of them  i think it is dangerous to think of this thing any more than we can help he replied let us do as this girl says and laugh with the horners so as to make them believe we see the joke then there will be peace again and no need to fight  they readily agreed to this and returned to the fence laughing as loud and as hard as they could although they didnt feel like laughing a bit the horners were much surprised  thats a fine jokefor a hornerand we are much pleased with it said the champion speaking between the pickets but please dont do it again  i wont promised diksey if i think of another such joke ill try to forget it  good cried the chief horner the war is over and peace is declared  there was much joyful shouting on both sides of the fence and the gate was unlocked and thrown wide open so that scraps was able to rejoin her friends  what about the scarecrow she asked dorothy  we must get him down somehow or other was the reply  perhaps the horners can find a way suggested ojo so they all went through the gate and dorothy asked the chief horner how they could get the scarecrow off the fence the chief didnt know how but diksey said  a ladders the thing  have you one asked dorothy  to be sure we use ladders in our mines said he then he ran away to get the ladder and while he was gone the horners gathered around and welcomed the strangers to their country for through them a great war had been avoided  in a little while diksey came back with a tall ladder which he placed against the fence ojo at once climbed to the top of the ladder and dorothy went about halfway up and scraps stood at the foot of it toto ran around it and barked then ojo pulled the scarecrow away from the picket and passed him down to dorothy who in turn lowered him to the patchwork girl  as soon as he was on his feet and standing on solid ground the scarecrow said  much obliged i feel much better im not stuck on that picket any more  the horners began to laugh thinking this was a joke but the scarecrow shook himself and patted his straw a little and said to dorothy is there much of a hole in my back  the little girl examined him carefully  theres quite a hole she said but ive got a needle and thread in the knapsack and ill sew you up again  do so he begged earnestly and again the hoppers laughed to the scarecrows great annoyance  while dorothy was sewing up the hole in the straw mans back scraps examined the other parts of him  one of his legs is ripped too she exclaimed  oho cried little diksey thats bad give him the needle and thread and let him mend his ways  ha ha ha laughed the chief and the other horners at once roared with laughter  whats funny inquired the scarecrow sternly  dont you see asked diksey who had laughed even harder than the others thats a joke its by odds the best joke i ever made you walk with your legs and so thats the way you walk and your legs are the ways see so when you mend your legs you mend your ways ho ho ho hee hee id no idea i could make such a fine joke  just wonderful echoed the chief how do you manage to do it diksey  i dont know said diksey modestly perhaps its the radium but i rather think its my splendid intellect  if you dont quit it the scarecrow told him therell be a worse war than the one youve escaped from  ojo had been deep in thought and now he asked the chief is there a dark well in any part of your country  a dark well none that ever i heard of was the answer  oh yes said diksey who overheard the boys question theres a very dark well down in my radium mine  is there any water in it ojo eagerly asked  cant say ive never looked to see but we can find out  so as soon as the scarecrow was mended they decided to go with diksey to the mine when dorothy had patted the straw man into shape again he declared he felt as good as new and equal to further adventures  still said he i prefer not to do picket duty again high life doesnt seem to agree with my constitution and then they hurried away to escape the laughter of the horners who thought this was another joke     chapter twentyfour  ojo finds the dark well   they now followed diksey to the farther end of the great cave beyond the horner city where there were several round dark holes leading into the ground in a slanting direction diksey went to one of these holes and said  here is the mine in which lies the dark well you are seeking follow me and step carefully and ill lead you to the place  he went in first and after him came ojo and then dorothy with the scarecrow behind her the patchwork girl entered last of all for toto kept close beside his little mistress  a few steps beyond the mouth of the opening it was pitch dark you wont lose your way though said the horner for theres only one way to go the mines mine and i know every step of the way hows that for a joke eh the mines mine then he chuckled gleefully as they followed him silently down the steep slant the hole was just big enough to permit them to walk upright although the scarecrow being much the taller of the party often had to bend his head to keep from hitting the top  the floor of the tunnel was difficult to walk upon because it had been worn smooth as glass and pretty soon scraps who was some distance behind the others slipped and fell head foremost at once she began to slide downward so swiftly that when she came to the scarecrow she knocked him off his feet and sent him tumbling against dorothy who tripped up ojo the boy fell against the horner so that all went tumbling down the slide in a regular mixup unable to see where they were going because of the darkness  fortunately when they reached the bottom the scarecrow and scraps were in front and the others bumped against them so that no one was hurt they found themselves in a vast cave which was dimly lighted by the tiny grains of radium that lay scattered among the loose rocks  now said diksey when they had all regained their feet i will show you where the dark well is this is a big place but if we hold fast to each other we wont get lost  they took hold of hands and the horner led them into a dark corner where he halted  be careful said he warningly the well is at your feet  all right replied ojo and kneeling down he felt in the well with his hand and found that it contained a quantity of water wheres the gold flask dorothy he asked and the little girl handed him the flask which she had brought with her  ojo knelt again and by feeling carefully in the dark managed to fill the flask with the unseen water that was in the well then he screwed the top of the flask firmly in place and put the precious water in his pocket  all right he said again in a glad voice now we can go back  they returned to the mouth of the tunnel and began to creep cautiously up the incline this time they made scraps stay behind for fear she would slip again but they all managed to get up in safety and the munchkin boy was very happy when he stood in the horner city and realized that the water from the dark well which he and his friends had traveled so far to secure was safe in his jacket pocket     chapter twentyfive  they bribe the lazy quadling   now said dorothy as they stood on the mountain path having left behind them the cave in which dwelt the hoppers and the horners i think we must find a road into the country of the winkies for there is where ojo wants to go next  is there such a road asked the scarecrow  i dont know she replied i spose we can go back the way we came to jack pumpkinheads house and then turn into the winkie country but that seems like running round a haystack doesnt it  yes said the scarecrow what is the next thing ojo must get  a yellow butterfly answered the boy  that means the winkie country all right for its the yellow country of oz remarked dorothy i think scarecrow we ought to take him to the tin woodman for hes the empror of the winkies and will help us to find what ojo wants  of course replied the scarecrow brightening at the suggestion the tin woodman will do anything we ask him for hes one of my dearest friends i believe we can take a crosscut into his country and so get to his castle a day sooner than if we travel back the way we came  i think so too said the girl and that means we must keep to the left  they were obliged to go down the mountain before they found any path that led in the direction they wanted to go but among the tumbled rocks at the foot of the mountain was a faint trail which they decided to follow two or three hours walk along this trail brought them to a clear level country where there were a few farms and some scattered houses but they knew they were still in the country of the quadlings because everything had a bright red color not that the trees and grasses were red but the fences and houses were painted that color and all the wildflowers that bloomed by the wayside had red blossoms this part of the quadling country seemed peaceful and prosperous if rather lonely and the road was more distinct and easier to follow  but just as they were congratulating themselves upon the progress they had made they came upon a broad river which swept along between high banks and here the road ended and there was no bridge of any sort to allow them to cross  this is queer mused dorothy looking at the water reflectively why should there be any road if the river stops everyone walking along it  wow said toto gazing earnestly into her face  thats the best answer youll get declared the scarecrow with his comical smile for no one knows any more than toto about this road  said scraps      evry time i see a river     i have chills that make me shiver     for i never can forget     all the waters very wet     if my patches get a soak     it will be a sorry joke     so to swim ill never try     till i find the water dry   try to control yourself scraps said ojo youre getting crazy again no one intends to swim that river  no decided dorothy we couldnt swim it if we tried its too big a river and the water moves awful fast  there ought to be a ferryman with a boat said the scarecrow but i dont see any  couldnt we make a raft suggested ojo  theres nothing to make one of answered dorothy  wow said toto again and dorothy saw he was looking along the bank of the river  why he sees a house over there cried the little girl i wonder we didnt notice it ourselves lets go and ask the people how to get cross the river  a quarter of a mile along the bank stood a small round house painted bright red and as it was on their side of the river they hurried toward it a chubby little man dressed all in red came out to greet them and with him were two children also in red costumes the mans eyes were big and staring as he examined the scarecrow and the patchwork girl and the children shyly hid behind him and peeked timidly at toto  do you live here my good man asked the scarecrow  i think i do most mighty magician replied the quadling bowing low but whether im awake or dreaming i cant be positive so im not sure where i live if youll kindly pinch me ill find out all about it  youre awake said dorothy and this is no magician but just the scarecrow  but hes alive protested the man and he oughtnt to be you know and that other dreadful personthe girl who is all patchesseems to be alive too  very much so declared scraps making a face at him but that isnt your affair you know  ive a right to be surprised havent i asked the man meekly  im not sure but anyhow youve no right to say im dreadful the scarecrow who is a gentleman of great wisdom thinks im beautiful retorted scraps  never mind all that said dorothy tell us good quadling how we can get across the river  i dont know replied the quadling  dont you ever cross it asked the girl  never  dont travelers cross it  not to my knowledge said he  they were much surprised to hear this and the man added its a pretty big river and the current is strong i know a man who lives on the opposite bank for ive seen him there a good many years but weve never spoken because neither of us has ever crossed over  thats queer said the scarecrow dont you own a boat  the man shook his head  nor a raft  where does this river go to asked dorothy  that way answered the man pointing with one hand it goes into the country of the winkies which is ruled by the tin emperor who must be a mighty magician because hes all made of tin and yet hes alive and that way pointing with the other hand the river runs between two mountains where dangerous people dwell  the scarecrow looked at the water before them  the current flows toward the winkie country said he and so if we had a boat or a raft the river would float us there more quickly and more easily than we could walk  that is true agreed dorothy and then they all looked thoughtful and wondered what could be done  why cant the man make us a raft asked ojo  will you inquired dorothy turning to the quadling  the chubby man shook his head  im too lazy he said my wife says im the laziest man in all oz and she is a truthful woman i hate work of any kind and making a raft is hard work  ill give you my emrald ring promised the girl  no i dont care for emeralds if it were a ruby which is the color i like best i might work a little while  ive got some square meal tablets said the scarecrow each one is the same as a dish of soup a fried fish a mutton potpie lobster salad charlotte russe and lemon jellyall made into one little tablet that you can swallow without trouble  without trouble exclaimed the quadling much interested then those tablets would be fine for a lazy man its such hard work to chew when you eat  ill give you six of those tablets if youll help us make a raft promised the scarecrow theyre a combination of food which people who eat are very fond of i never eat you know being straw but some of my friends eat regularly what do you say to my offer quadling  ill do it decided the man ill help and you can do most of the work but my wife has gone fishing for red eels today so some of you will have to mind the children  scraps promised to do that and the children were not so shy when the patchwork girl sat down to play with them they grew to like toto too and the little dog allowed them to pat him on his head which gave the little ones much joy  there were a number of fallen trees near the house and the quadling got his axe and chopped them into logs of equal length he took his wifes clothesline to bind these logs together so that they would form a raft and ojo found some strips of wood and nailed them along the tops of the logs to render them more firm the scarecrow and dorothy helped roll the logs together and carry the strips of wood but it took so long to make the raft that evening came just as it was finished and with evening the quadlings wife returned from her fishing  the woman proved to be cross and badtempered perhaps because she had only caught one red eel during all the day when she found that her husband had used her clothesline and the logs she had wanted for firewood and the boards she had intended to mend the shed with and a lot of gold nails she became very angry scraps wanted to shake the woman to make her behave but dorothy talked to her in a gentle tone and told the quadlings wife she was a princess of oz and a friend of ozma and that when she got back to the emerald city she would send them a lot of things to repay them for the raft including a new clothesline this promise pleased the woman and she soon became more pleasant saying they could stay the night at her house and begin their voyage on the river next morning  this they did spending a pleasant evening with the quadling family and being entertained with such hospitality as the poor people were able to offer them the man groaned a good deal and said he had overworked himself by chopping the logs but the scarecrow gave him two more tablets than he had promised which seemed to comfort the lazy fellow     chapter twentysix  the trick river   next morning they pushed the raft into the water and all got aboard the quadling man had to hold the log craft fast while they took their places and the flow of the river was so powerful that it nearly tore the raft from his hands as soon as they were all seated upon the logs he let go and away it floated and the adventurers had begun their voyage toward the winkie country  the little house of the quadlings was out of sight almost before they had cried their goodbyes and the scarecrow said in a pleased voice it wont take us long to get to the winkie country at this rate  they had floated several miles down the stream and were enjoying the ride when suddenly the raft slowed up stopped short and then began to float back the way it had come  why whats wrong asked dorothy in astonishment but they were all just as bewildered as she was and at first no one could answer the question soon however they realized the truth that the current of the river had reversed and the water was now flowing in the opposite directiontoward the mountains  they began to recognize the scenes they had passed and by and by they came in sight of the little house of the quadlings again the man was standing on the river bank and he called to them  how do you do glad to see you again i forgot to tell you that the river changes its direction every little while sometimes it flows one way and sometimes the other  they had no time to answer him for the raft was swept past the house and a long distance on the other side of it  were going just the way we dont want to go said dorothy and i guess the best thing we can do is to get to land before were carried any farther  but they could not get to land they had no oars nor even a pole to guide the raft with the logs which bore them floated in the middle of the stream and were held fast in that position by the strong current  so they sat still and waited and even while they were wondering what could be done the raft slowed down stopped and began drifting the other wayin the direction it had first followed after a time they repassed the quadling house and the man was still standing on the bank he cried out to them  good day glad to see you again i expect i shall see you a good many times as you go by unless you happen to swim ashore  by that time they had left him behind and were headed once more straight toward the winkie country  this is pretty hard luck said ojo in a discouraged voice the trick river keeps changing it seems and here we must float back and forward forever unless we manage in some way to get ashore  can you swim asked dorothy  no im ojo the unlucky  neither can i toto can swim a little but that wont help us to get to shore  i dont know whether i could swim or not remarked scraps but if i tried it id surely ruin my lovely patches  my straw would get soggy in the water and i would sink said the scarecrow  so there seemed no way out of their dilemma and being helpless they simply sat still ojo who was on the front of the raft looked over into the water and thought he saw some large fishes swimming about he found a loose end of the clothesline which fastened the logs together and taking a gold nail from his pocket he bent it nearly double to form a hook and tied it to the end of the line having baited the hook with some bread which he broke from his loaf he dropped the line into the water and almost instantly it was seized by a great fish  they knew it was a great fish because it pulled so hard on the line that it dragged the raft forward even faster than the current of the river had carried it the fish was frightened and it was a strong swimmer as the other end of the clothesline was bound around the logs he could not get it away and as he had greedily swallowed the gold hook at the first bite he could not get rid of that either  when they reached the place where the current had before changed the fish was still swimming ahead in its wild attempt to escape the raft slowed down yet it did not stop because the fish would not let it it continued to move in the same direction it had been going as the current reversed and rushed backward on its course it failed to drag the raft with it slowly inch by inch they floated on and the fish tugged and tugged and kept them going  i hope he wont give up said ojo anxiously if the fish can hold out until the current changes again well be all right  the fish did not give up but held the raft bravely on its course till at last the water in the river shifted again and floated them the way they wanted to go but now the captive fish found its strength failing seeking a refuge it began to drag the raft toward the shore as they did not wish to land in this place the boy cut the rope with his pocketknife and set the fish free just in time to prevent the raft from grounding  the next time the river backed up the scarecrow managed to seize the branch of a tree that overhung the water and they all assisted him to hold fast and prevent the raft from being carried backward while they waited here ojo spied a long broken branch lying upon the bank so he leaped ashore and got it when he had stripped off the side shoots he believed he could use the branch as a pole to guide the raft in case of emergency  they clung to the tree until they found the water flowing the right way when they let go and permitted the raft to resume its voyage in spite of these pauses they were really making good progress toward the winkie country and having found a way to conquer the adverse current their spirits rose considerably they could see little of the country through which they were passing because of the high banks and they met with no boats or other craft upon the surface of the river  once more the trick river reversed its current but this time the scarecrow was on guard and used the pole to push the raft toward a big rock which lay in the water he believed the rock would prevent their floating backward with the current and so it did they clung to this anchorage until the water resumed its proper direction when they allowed the raft to drift on  floating around a bend they saw ahead a high bank of water extending across the entire river and toward this they were being irresistibly carried there being no way to arrest the progress of the raft they clung fast to the logs and let the river sweep them on swiftly the raft climbed the bank of water and slid down on the other side plunging its edge deep into the water and drenching them all with spray  as again the raft righted and drifted on dorothy and ojo laughed at the ducking they had received but scraps was much dismayed and the scarecrow took out his handkerchief and wiped the water off the patchwork girls patches as well as he was able to the sun soon dried her and the colors of her patches proved good for they did not run together nor did they fade  after passing the wall of water the current did not change or flow backward any more but continued to sweep them steadily forward the banks of the river grew lower too permitting them to see more of the country and presently they discovered yellow buttercups and dandelions growing amongst the grass from which evidence they knew they had reached the winkie country  dont you think we ought to land dorothy asked the scarecrow  pretty soon he replied the tin woodmans castle is in the southern part of the winkie country and so it cant be a great way from here  fearing they might drift too far dorothy and ojo now stood up and raised the scarecrow in their arms as high as they could thus allowing him a good view of the country for a time he saw nothing he recognized but finally he cried  there it is there it is  what asked dorothy  the tin woodmans tin castle i can see its turrets glittering in the sun its quite a way off but wed better land as quickly as we can  they let him down and began to urge the raft toward the shore by means of the pole it obeyed very well for the current was more sluggish now and soon they had reached the bank and landed safely  the winkie country was really beautiful and across the fields they could see afar the silvery sheen of the tin castle with light hearts they hurried toward it being fully rested by their long ride on the river  by and by they began to cross an immense field of splendid yellow lilies the delicate fragrance of which was very delightful  how beautiful they are cried dorothy stopping to admire the perfection of these exquisite flowers  yes said the scarecrow reflectively but we must be careful not to crush or injure any of these lilies  why not asked ojo  the tin woodman is very kindhearted was the reply and he hates to see any living thing hurt in any way  are flowers alive asked scraps  yes of course and these flowers belong to the tin woodman so in order not to offend him we must not tread on a single blossom  once said dorothy the tin woodman stepped on a beetle and killed the little creature that made him very unhappy and he cried until his tears rusted his joints so he couldnt move em  what did he do then asked ojo  put oil on them until the joints worked smooth again  oh exclaimed the boy as if a great discovery had flashed across his mind but he did not tell anybody what the discovery was and kept the idea to himself  it was a long walk but a pleasant one and they did not mind it a bit late in the afternoon they drew near to the wonderful tin castle of the emperor of the winkies and ojo and scraps who had never seen it before were filled with amazement  tin abounded in the winkie country and the winkies were said to be the most skillful tinsmiths in all the world so the tin woodman had employed them in building his magnificent castle which was all of tin from the ground to the tallest turret and so brightly polished that it glittered in the suns rays more gorgeously than silver around the grounds of the castle ran a tin wall with tin gates but the gates stood wide open because the emperor had no enemies to disturb him  when they entered the spacious grounds our travelers found more to admire tin fountains sent sprays of clear water far into the air and there were many beds of tin flowers all as perfectly formed as any natural flowers might be there were tin trees too and here and there shady bowers of tin with tin benches and chairs to sit upon also on the sides of the pathway leading up to the front door of the castle were rows of tin statuary very cleverly executed among these ojo recognized statues of dorothy toto the scarecrow the wizard the shaggy man jack pumpkinhead and ozma all standing upon neat pedestals of tin  toto was well acquainted with the residence of the tin woodman and being assured a joyful welcome he ran ahead and barked so loudly at the front door that the tin woodman heard him and came out in person to see if it were really his old friend toto next moment the tin man had clasped the scarecrow in a warm embrace and then turned to hug dorothy but now his eye was arrested by the strange sight of the patchwork girl and he gazed upon her in mingled wonder and admiration     chapter twentyseven  the tin woodman objects   the tin woodman was one of the most important personages in all oz though emperor of the winkies he owed allegiance to ozma who ruled all the land and the girl and the tin man were warm personal friends he was something of a dandy and kept his tin body brilliantly polished and his tin joints well oiled also he was very courteous in manner and so kind and gentle that everyone loved him the emperor greeted ojo and scraps with cordial hospitality and ushered the entire party into his handsome tin parlor where all the furniture and pictures were made of tin the walls were paneled with tin and from the tin ceiling hung tin chandeliers  the tin woodman wanted to know first of all where dorothy had found the patchwork girl so between them the visitors told the story of how scraps was made as well as the accident to margolotte and unc nunkie and how ojo had set out upon a journey to procure the things needed for the crooked magicians magic charm then dorothy told of their adventures in the quadling country and how at last they succeeded in getting the water from a dark well  while the little girl was relating these adventures the tin woodman sat in an easy chair listening with intense interest while the others sat grouped around him ojo however had kept his eyes fixed upon the body of the tin emperor and now he noticed that under the joint of his left knee a tiny drop of oil was forming he watched this drop of oil with a fastbeating heart and feeling in his pocket brought out a tiny vial of crystal which he held secreted in his hand  presently the tin woodman changed his position and at once ojo to the astonishment of all dropped to the floor and held his crystal vial under the emperors knee joint just then the drop of oil fell and the boy caught it in his bottle and immediately corked it tight then with a red face and embarrassed manner he rose to confront the others  what in the world were you doing asked the tin woodman  i caught a drop of oil that fell from your kneejoint confessed ojo  a drop of oil exclaimed the tin woodman dear me how careless my valet must have been in oiling me this morning im afraid i shall have to scold the fellow for i cant be dropping oil wherever i go  never mind said dorothy ojo seems glad to have the oil for some reason  yes declared the munchkin boy i am glad for one of the things the crooked magician sent me to get was a drop of oil from a live mans body i had no idea at first that there was such a thing but its now safe in the little crystal vial  you are very welcome to it indeed said the tin woodman have you now secured all the things you were in search of  not quite all answered ojo there were five things i had to get and i have found four of them i have the three hairs in the tip of a woozys tail a sixleaved clover a gill of water from a dark well and a drop of oil from a live mans body the last thing is the easiest of all to get and im sure that my dear unc nunkieand good margolotte as wellwill soon be restored to life  the munchkin boy said this with much pride and pleasure  good exclaimed the tin woodman i congratulate you but what is the fifth and last thing you need in order to complete the magic charm  the left wing of a yellow butterfly said ojo in this yellow country and with your kind assistance that ought to be very easy to find  the tin woodman stared at him in amazement  surely you are joking he said  no replied ojo much surprised i am in earnest  but do you think for a moment that i would permit you or anyone else to pull the left wing from a yellow butterfly demanded the tin woodman sternly  why not sir  why not you ask me why not it would be cruelone of the most cruel and heartless deeds i ever heard of asserted the tin woodman the butterflies are among the prettiest of all created things and they are very sensitive to pain to tear a wing from one would cause it exquisite torture and it would soon die in great agony i would not permit such a wicked deed under any circumstances  ojo was astounded at hearing this dorothy too looked grave and disconcerted but she knew in her heart that the tin woodman was right the scarecrow nodded his head in approval of his friends speech so it was evident that he agreed with the emperors decision scraps looked from one to another in perplexity  who cares for a butterfly she asked  dont you inquired the tin woodman  not the snap of a finger for i have no heart said the patchwork girl but i want to help ojo who is my friend to rescue the uncle whom he loves and id kill a dozen useless butterflies to enable him to do that  the tin woodman sighed regretfully  you have kind instincts he said and with a heart you would indeed be a fine creature i cannot blame you for your heartless remark as you cannot understand the feelings of those who possess hearts i for instance have a very neat and responsive heart which the wonderful wizard of oz once gave me and so i shall nevernevernever permit a poor yellow butterfly to be tortured by anyone  the yellow country of the winkies said ojo sadly is the only place in oz where a yellow butterfly can be found  im glad of that said the tin woodman as i rule the winkie country i can protect my butterflies  unless i get the wingjust one left wing said ojo miserably i cant save unc nunkie  then he must remain a marble statue forever declared the tin emperor firmly  ojo wiped his eyes for he could not hold back the tears  ill tell you what to do said scraps well take a whole yellow butterfly alive and well to the crooked magician and let him pull the left wing off  no you wont said the tin woodman you cant have one of my dear little butterflies to treat in that way  then what in the world shall we do asked dorothy  they all became silent and thoughtful no one spoke for a long time then the tin woodman suddenly roused himself and said  we must all go back to the emerald city and ask ozmas advice shes a wise little girl our ruler and she may find a way to help ojo save his unc nunkie  so the following morning the party started on the journey to the emerald city which they reached in due time without any important adventure it was a sad journey for ojo for without the wing of the yellow butterfly he saw no way to save unc nunkieunless he waited six years for the crooked magician to make a new lot of the powder of life the boy was utterly discouraged and as he walked along he groaned aloud  is anything hurting you inquired the tin woodman in a kindly tone for the emperor was with the party  im ojo the unlucky replied the boy i might have known i would fail in anything i tried to do  why are you ojo the unlucky asked the tin man  because i was born on a friday  friday is not unlucky declared the emperor its just one of seven days do you suppose all the world becomes unlucky oneseventh of the time  it was the thirteenth day of the month said ojo  thirteen ah that is indeed a lucky number replied the tin woodman all my good luck seems to happen on the thirteenth i suppose most people never notice the good luck that comes to them with the number 13 and yet if the least bit of bad luck falls on that day they blame it to the number and not to the proper cause  thirteens my lucky number too remarked the scarecrow  and mine said scraps ive just thirteen patches on my head  but continued ojo im lefthanded  many of our greatest men are that way asserted the emperor to be lefthanded is usually to be twohanded the righthanded people are usually onehanded  and ive a wart under my right arm said ojo  how lucky cried the tin woodman if it were on the end of your nose it might be unlucky but under your arm it is luckily out of the way  for all those reasons said the munchkin boy i have been called ojo the unlucky  then we must turn over a new leaf and call you henceforth ojo the lucky declared the tin man every reason you have given is absurd but i have noticed that those who continually dread ill luck and fear it will overtake them have no time to take advantage of any good fortune that comes their way make up your mind to be ojo the lucky  how can i asked the boy when all my attempts to save my dear uncle have failed  never give up ojo advised dorothy no one ever knows whats going to happen next  ojo did not reply but he was so dejected that even their arrival at the emerald city failed to interest him  the people joyfully cheered the appearance of the tin woodman the scarecrow and dorothy who were all three general favorites and on entering the royal palace word came to them from ozma that she would at once grant them an audience  dorothy told the girl ruler how successful they had been in their quest until they came to the item of the yellow butterfly which the tin woodman positively refused to sacrifice to the magic potion  he is quite right said ozma who did not seem a bit surprised had ojo told me that one of the things he sought was the wing of a yellow butterfly i would have informed him before he started out that he could never secure it then you would have been saved the troubles and annoyances of your long journey  i didnt mind the journey at all said dorothy it was fun  as it has turned out remarked ojo i can never get the things the crooked magician sent me for and so unless i wait the six years for him to make the powder of life unc nunkie cannot be saved  ozma smiled  dr pipt will make no more powder of life i promise you said she i have sent for him and had him brought to this palace where he now is and his four kettles have been destroyed and his book of recipes burned up i have also had brought here the marble statues of your uncle and of margolotte which are standing in the next room  they were all greatly astonished at this announcement  oh let me see unc nunkie let me see him at once please cried ojo eagerly  wait a moment replied ozma for i have something more to say nothing that happens in the land of oz escapes the notice of our wise sorceress glinda the good she knew all about the magicmaking of dr pipt and how he had brought the glass cat and the patchwork girl to life and the accident to unc nunkie and margolotte and of ojos quest and his journey with dorothy glinda also knew that ojo would fail to find all the things he sought so she sent for our wizard and instructed him what to do something is going to happen in this palace presently and that something will i am sure please you all and now continued the girl ruler rising from her chair you may follow me into the next room     chapter twentyeight  the wonderful wizard of oz   when ojo entered the room he ran quickly to the statue of unc nunkie and kissed the marble face affectionately  i did my best unc he said with a sob but it was no use  then he drew back and looked around the room and the sight of the assembled company quite amazed him  aside from the marble statues of unc nunkie and margolotte the glass cat was there curled up on a rug and the woozy was there sitting on its square hind legs and looking on the scene with solemn interest and there was the shaggy man in a suit of shaggy peagreen satin and at a table sat the little wizard looking quite important and as if he knew much more than he cared to tell  last of all dr pipt was there and the crooked magician sat humped up in a chair seeming very dejected but keeping his eyes fixed on the lifeless form of his wife margolotte whom he fondly loved but whom he now feared was lost to him forever  ozma took a chair which jellia jamb wheeled forward for the ruler and back of her stood the scarecrow the tin woodman and dorothy as well as the cowardly lion and the hungry tiger the wizard now arose and made a low bow to ozma and another less deferent bow to the assembled company  ladies and gentlemen and beasts he said i beg to announce that our gracious ruler has permitted me to obey the commands of the great sorceress glinda the good whose humble assistant i am proud to be we have discovered that the crooked magician has been indulging in his magical arts contrary to law and therefore by royal edict i hereby deprive him of all power to work magic in the future he is no longer a crooked magician but a simple munchkin he is no longer even crooked but a man like other men  as he pronounced these words the wizard waved his hand toward dr pipt and instantly every crooked limb straightened out and became perfect the former magician with a cry of joy sprang to his feet looked at himself in wonder and then fell back in his chair and watched the wizard with fascinated interest  the glass cat which dr pipt lawlessly made continued the wizard is a pretty cat but its pink brains made it so conceited that it was a disagreeable companion to everyone so the other day i took away the pink brains and replaced them with transparent ones and now the glass cat is so modest and well behaved that ozma has decided to keep her in the palace as a pet  i thank you said the cat in a soft voice  the woozy has proved himself a good woozy and a faithful friend the wizard went on so we will send him to the royal menagerie where he will have good care and plenty to eat all his life  much obliged said the woozy that beats being fenced up in a lonely forest and starved  as for the patchwork girl resumed the wizard she is so remarkable in appearance and so clever and good tempered that our gracious ruler intends to preserve her carefully as one of the curiosities of the curious land of oz scraps may live in the palace or wherever she pleases and be nobodys servant but her own  thats all right said scraps  we have all been interested in ojo the little wizard continued because his love for his unfortunate uncle has led him bravely to face all sorts of dangers in order that he might rescue him the munchkin boy has a loyal and generous heart and has done his best to restore unc nunkie to life he has failed but there are others more powerful than the crooked magician and there are more ways than dr pipt knew of to destroy the charm of the liquid of petrifaction glinda the good has told me of one way and you shall now learn how great is the knowledge and power of our peerless sorceress  as he said this the wizard advanced to the statue of margolote and made a magic pass at the same time muttering a magic word that none could hear distinctly at once the woman moved turned her head wonderingly this way and that to note all who stood before her and seeing dr pipt ran forward and threw herself into her husbands outstretched arms  then the wizard made the magic pass and spoke the magic word before the statue of unc nunkie the old munchkin immediately came to life and with a low bow to the wizard said thanks  but now ojo rushed up and threw his arms joyfully about his uncle and the old man hugged his little nephew tenderly and stroked his hair and wiped away the boys tears with a handkerchief for ojo was crying from pure happiness  ozma came forward to congratulate them  i have given to you my dear ojo and unc nunkie a nice house just outside the walls of the emerald city she said and there you shall make your future home and be under my protection  didnt i say you were ojo the lucky asked the tin woodman as everyone crowded around to shake ojos hand  yes and it is true replied ojo gratefully
