88390882	through the eye of the needle                                  a romance                            with an introduction                                     by                               w d howells                                     1907      introduction   aristides homos an emissary of the altrurian commonwealth visited the united states during the summer of 1893 and the fall and winter following for some weeks or months he was the guest of a wellknown man of letters at a hotel in one of our mountain resorts in the early autumn he spent several days at the great columbian exhibition in chicago and later he came to new york where he remained until he sailed rather suddenly for altruria taking the circuitous route by which he came he seems to have written pretty constantly throughout his sojourn with us to an intimate friend in his own country giving freely his impressions of our civilization his letters from new york appear to have been especially full and in offering the present synopsis of these to the american reader it will not be impertinent to note certain peculiarities of the altrurian attitude which the temperament of the writer has somewhat modified he is entangled in his social sophistries regarding all the competitive civilizations he cannot apparently do full justice to the superior heroism of charity and selfsacrifice as practised in countries where people live upon each other as the americans do instead of for each other as the altrurians do but he has some glimmerings of the beauty of our living and he has undoubtedly the wish to be fair to our ideals he is unable to value our devotion to the spirit of christianity amid the practices which seem to deny it but he evidently wishes to recognize the possibility of such a thing he at least accords us the virtues of our defects and among the many visitors who have censured us he has not seen us with his censures prepared to fit the instances in fact the very reverse has been his method  many of the instances which he fits with his censures are such as he could no longer note if he came among us again that habit of celebrating the munificence of the charitable rich on which he spends his sarcasm has fallen from us through the mere superabundance of occasion our rich people give so continuously for all manner of good objects that it would be impossible for our press however vigilant to note the successive benefactions and millions are now daily bestowed upon needy educational institutions of which no mention whatever is made in the newspapers if a millionaire is now and then surprised in a good action by a reporter of uncommon diligence he is able by an appeal to their common humanity to prevail with the witness to spare him the revolting publicity which it must be confessed would once have followed his discovery the right hand which is full to overflowing is now as skilled as the empty right hand in keeping the left hand ignorant of its doings this has happened through the general decay of snobbishness among us perhaps it is certain that there is no longer the passion for a knowledge of the rich and the smart which made us ridiculous to mr homos ten or twelve years ago our newspapers abounded in intelligence of the coming and going of social leaders of their dinners and lunches and teas of their receptions and balls and the guests who were bidden to them but this sort of unwholesome and exciting gossip which was formerly devoured by their readers with inappeasable voracity is no longer supplied simply because the taste for it has wholly passed away  much the same might be said of the social hospitalities which raised our visitors surprise for example many people are now asked to dinner who really need a dinner and not merely those who revolt from the notion of dinner with loathing and go to it with abhorrence at the tables of our highest social leaders one now meets on a perfect equality persons of interesting minds and uncommon gifts who would once have been excluded because they were hungry or were not in the hostesss set or had not a new gown or a dresssuit this contributes greatly to the pleasure of the time and promotes the increasing kindliness between the rich and poor for which our status is above all things notable  the accusation which our critic brings that the american spirit has been almost europeanized away in its social forms would be less grounded in the observance of a later visitor the customs of good society must be the same everywhere in some measure but the student of the competitive world would now find european hospitality americanized rather than american hospitality europeanized the careful research which has been made into our social origins has resulted in bringing back many of the aboriginal usages and with the return of the old american spirit of fraternity many of the earlier dishes as well as amenities have been restored a thanksgiving dinner in the year 1906 would have been found more like a thanksgiving dinner in 1806 than the dinner to which mr homos was asked in 1893 and which he has studied so interestingly though not quite without some faults of taste and discretion the prodigious change for the better in some material aspects of our status which has taken place in the last twelve years could nowhere be so well noted as in the picture he gives us of the housing of our people in 1893 his study of the evolution of the apartmenthouse from the old flathouse and the still older single dwelling is very curious and upon the whole not incorrect but neither of these last differed so much from the first as the apartmenthouse now differs from the apartmenthouse of his day there are now no dark rooms opening on airless pits for the family or black closets and dismal basements for the servants every room has abundant light and perfect ventilation and as nearly a southern exposure as possible the appointments of the houses are no longer in the spirit of profuse and vulgar luxury which it must be allowed once characterized them they are simply but tastefully finished they are absolutely fireproof and with their less expensive decoration the rents have been so far lowered that in any good position a quarter of nine or ten rooms with as many baths can be had for from three thousand to fifteen thousand dollars this fact alone must attract to our metropolis the best of our population the bone and sinew which have no longer any use for themselves where they have been expended in rearing colossal fortunes and now demand a metropolitan repose  the apartments are much better fitted for a family of generous size than those which mr homos observed children who were once almost unheard of and quite unheard in apartmenthouses increasingly abound under favor of the gospel of race preservation the elevators are full of them and in the grassy courts round which the houses are built the little ones play all day long or paddle in the fountains warmed with steampipes in the winter and cooled to an agreeable temperature in a summer which has almost lost its terrors for the stayathome newyorker each child has his or her little plot of ground in the roofgarden where they are taught the once wellnigh forgotten art of agriculture  the improvement of the tenementhouse has gone hand in hand with that of the apartmenthouse as nearly as the rate of interest on the landlords investment will allow the housing of the poor approaches in comfort that of the rich their children are still more numerous and the playgrounds supplied them in every open space and on every pier are visited constantly by the bettertodo children who exchange with them lessons of form and fashion for the scarcely less valuable instruction in practical life which the poorer little ones are able to give the rents in the tenement houses are reduced even more notably than those in the apartmenthouses so that now with the constant increase in wages the tenants are able to pay their rents promptly the evictions once so common are very rare it is doubtful whether a nightly or daily walk in the poorer quarters of the town would develop in the coldest weather half a dozen cases of families set out on the sidewalk with their household goods about them  the altrurian emissary visited this country when it was on the verge of the period of great economic depression extending from 1894 to 1898 but after the spanish war providence marked the divine approval of our victory in that contest by renewing in unexampled measure the prosperity of the republic with the downfall of the trusts and the release of our industrial and commercial forces to unrestricted activity the condition of every form of labor has been immeasurably improved and it is now united with capital in bonds of the closest affection but in no phase has its fate been so brightened as in that of domestic service this has occurred not merely through the rise of wages but through a greater knowledge between the employing and employed when a few years since it became practically impossible for mothers of families to get help from the intelligenceoffices and ladies were obliged through lack of cooks and chambermaids to do the work of the kitchen and the chamber and parlor they learned to realize what such work was how poorly paid how badly lodged how meanly fed from this practical knowledge it was impossible for them to retreat to their old supremacy and indifference as mistresses the servant problem was solved once for all by humanity and it is doubtful whether if mr homos returned to us now he would give offence by preaching the example of the altrurian ladies or would be shocked by the contempt and ignorance of american women where other women who did their household drudgery were concerned  as women from having no help have learned how to use their helpers certain other hardships have been the means of good the flattened wheel of the trolley banging the track day and night and tormenting the waking and sleeping ear was oddly enough the inspiration of reforms which have made our city the quietest in the world the trolleys now pass unheard the elevated train glides by overhead with only a modulated murmur the subway is a retreat fit for meditation and prayer where the passenger can possess his soul in a peace to be found nowhere else the automobile which was unknown in the day of the altrurian emissary whirs softly through the most crowded thoroughfare far below the speed limit with a sigh of gentle satisfaction in its own harmlessness and like the sweet south taking and giving odor the streets that he saw so filthy and unkempt in 1893 are now at least as clean as they are quiet asphalt has universally replaced the cobblestones and belgian blocks of his day and though it is everywhere full of holes it is still asphalt and may some time be put in repair  there is a note of exaggeration in his characterization of our men which the reader must regret they are not now the intellectual inferior of our women or at least not so much the inferiors since his day they have made a vast advance in the knowledge and love of literature with the multitude of our periodicals and the swarm of our fictions selling from a hundred thousand to half a million each even our businessmen cannot wholly escape culture and they have become more and more cultured so that now you frequently hear them asking what this or that book is all about with the mention of them the reader will naturally recur to the work of their useful and devoted livesthe accumulation of money it is this accumulation this heapingup of riches which the altrurian emissary accuses in the lovestory closing his study of our conditions but which he might not now so totally condemn  as we have intimated he has more than once guarded against a rash conclusion to which the logical habit of the altrurian mind might have betrayed him if he could revisit us we are sure that he would have still greater reason to congratulate himself on his forbearance and would doubtless profit by the lesson which events must teach all but the most hopeless doctrinaires the evil of even a small war and soldiers themselves do not deny that wars large or small are evil has as we have noted been overruled for good in the sort of golden age or age on a gold basis which we have long been enjoying if our goodfortune should be continued to us in reward of our public and private virtue the fact would suggest to so candid an observer that in economics as in other things the rule proves the exception and that as good times have hitherto always been succeeded by bad times it stands to reason that our present period of prosperity will never be followed by a period of adversity  it would seem from the story continued by another hand in the second part of this work that altruria itself is not absolutely logical in its events which are subject to some of the anomalies governing in our own affairs a people living in conditions which some of our dreamers would consider ideal are forced to discourage foreign emigration against their rule of universal hospitality and in at least one notable instance are obliged to protect themselves against what they believe an evil example by using compulsion with the wrongdoers though the theory of their life is entirely opposed to anything of the kind perhaps however we are not to trust to this other hand at all times since it is a womans hand and is not to be credited with the firm and unerring touch of a mans the story as she completes it is the story of the altrurians love for an american woman and will be primarily interesting for that reason like the altrurians narrative it is here compiled from a succession of letters which in her case were written to a friend in america as his were written to a friend in altruria but it can by no means have the sociological value which the record of his observations among ourselves will have for the thoughtful reader it is at best the record of desultory and imperfect glimpses of a civilization fundamentally alien to her own such as would attract an enthusiastic nature but would leave it finally in a sort of misgiving as to the reality of the things seen and heard some such misgiving attended the inquiries of those who met the altrurian during his sojourn with us but it is a pity that a more absolute conclusion should not have been the effect of this lively ladys knowledge of the ideal country of her adoption it is however an interesting psychological result and it continues the tradition of all the observers of ideal conditions from sir thomas more down to william morris either we have no terms for conditions so unlike our own that they cannot be reported to us with absolute intelligence or else there is in every experience of them an essential vagueness and uncertainty   part first    through the eye of the needle     i   if i spoke with altrurian breadth of the way newyorkers live my dear cyril i should begin by saying that the newyorkers did not live at all but outside of our happy country one learns to distinguish and to allow that there are several degrees of living all indeed hateful to us if we knew them and yet none without some saving grace in it you would say that in conditions where men were embattled against one another by the greed and the envy and the ambition which these conditions perpetually appeal to here there could be no grace in life but we must remember that men have always been better than their conditions and that otherwise they would have remained savages without the instinct or the wish to advance indeed our own state is testimony of a potential civility in all states which we must keep in mind when we judge the peoples of the plutocratic world and especially the american people who are above all others the devotees and exemplars of the plutocratic ideal without limitation by any aristocracy theocracy or monarchy they are purely commercial and the thing that cannot be bought and sold has logically no place in their life but life is not logical outside of altruria we are the only people in the world my dear cyril who are privileged to live reasonably and again i say we must put by our own criterions if we wish to understand the americans or to recognize that measure of loveliness which their warped and stunted and perverted lives certainly show in spite of theory and in spite of conscience even i can make this clear to you i think by a single instance say that of the american who sees a case of distress and longs to relieve it if he is rich he can give relief with a good conscience except for the harm that may come to his beneficiary from being helped but if he is not rich or not finally rich and especially if he has a family dependent upon him he cannot give in anything like the measure christ bade us give without wronging those dear to him immediately or remotely that is to say in conditions which oblige every man to look out for himself a man cannot be a christian without remorse he cannot do a generous action without selfreproach he cannot be nobly unselfish without the fear of being a fool you would think that this predicament must deprave and so without doubt it does and yet it is not wholly depraving it often has its effect in character of a rare and pathetic sublimity and many americans take all the cruel risks of doing good reckless of the evil that may befall them and defiant of the upbraidings of their own hearts this is something that we altrurians can scarcely understand it is like the munificence of a savage who has killed a deer and shares it with his starving tribesmen forgetful of the hungering little ones who wait his return from the chase with food for life in plutocratic countries is still a chase and the game is wary and sparse as the terrible average of failures witnesses  of course i do not mean that americans may not give at all without sensible risk or that giving among them is always followed by a logical regret but as i said life with them is in no wise logical they even applaud one another for their charities which they measure by the amount given rather than by the love that goes with the giving the widows mite has little credit with them but the rich mans million has an acclaim that reverberates through their newspapers long after his gift is made it is only the poor in america who do charity as we do by giving help where it is needed the americans are mostly too busy if they are at all prosperous to give anything but money and the more money they give the more charitable they esteem themselves from time to time some man with twenty or thirty millions gives one of them away usually to a public institution of some sort where it will have no effect with the people who are underpaid for their work or cannot get work and then his deed is famed throughout the continent as a thing really beyond praise yet any one who thinks about it must know that he never earned the millions he kept or the millions he gave but somehow made them from the labor of others that with all the wealth left him he cannot miss the fortune he lavishes any more than if the check which conveyed it were a withered leaf and not in any wise so much as an ordinary workingman might feel the bestowal of a postagestamp  but in this study of the plutocratic mind always so fascinating to me i am getting altogether away from what i meant to tell you i meant to tell you not how americans live in the spirit illogically blindly and blunderingly but how they live in the body and more especially how they house themselves in this city of new york a great many of them do not house themselves at all but that is a class which we cannot now consider and i will speak only of those who have some sort of a roof over their heads     ii   formerly the newyorker lived in one of three different ways in private houses or boardinghouses or hotels there were few restaurants or public tables outside of the hotels and those who had lodgings and took their meals at eatinghouses were but a small proportion of the whole number the old classification still holds in a measure but within the last thirty years or ever since the civil war when the enormous commercial expansion of the country began several different ways of living have been opened the first and most noticeable of these is housekeeping in flats or apartments of three or four rooms or more on the same floor as in all the countries of europe except england though the flat is now making itself known in london too before the war the newyorker who kept house did so in a separate house three or four stories in height with a street door of its own its pattern within was fixed by long usage and seldom varied without it was of brownstone before and brick behind with an open space there for drying clothes which was sometimes gardened or planted with trees and vines the rear of the city blocks which these houses formed was more attractive than the front as you may still see in the vast succession of monotonous crossstreets not yet invaded by poverty or business and often the perspective of these rears is picturesque and pleasing but with the sudden growth of the population when peace came and through the acquaintance the hordes of american tourists had made with european fashions of living it became easy or at least simple to divide the floors of many of these private dwellings into apartments each with its own kitchen and all the apparatus of housekeeping the apartments then had the street entrance and the stairways in common and they had in common the cellar and the furnace for heating they had in common the disadvantage of being badly aired and badly lighted they were dark cramped and uncomfortable but they were cheaper than separate houses and they were more homelike than boardinghouses or hotels large numbers of them still remain in use and when people began to live in flats in conformity with the law of evolution many buildings were put up and subdivided into apartments in imitation of the old dwellings which had been changed  but the apartment as the newyorkers now mostly have it was at the same time evolving from another direction the poorer class of new york workpeople had for a long period before the war lived as they still live in vast edifices once thought prodigiously tall which were called tenementhouses in these a family of five or ten persons is commonly packed in two or three rooms and even in one room where they eat and sleep without the amenities and often without the decencies of life and of course without light and air the buildings in case of fire are deathtraps but the law obliges the owners to provide some apparent means of escape which they do in the form of iron balconies and ladders giving that festive air to their façades which i have already noted the bare and dirty entries and staircases are really ramifications of the filthy streets without and each tenement opens upon a landing as if it opened upon a public thoroughfare the rents extorted from the inmates is sometimes a hundred per cent and is nearly always cruelly out of proportion to the value of the houses not to speak of the wretched shelter afforded and when the rent is not paid the family in arrears is set with all its poor household gear upon the sidewalk in a pitiless indifference to the season and the weather which you could not realize without seeing it and which is incredible even of plutocratic nature of course landlordism which you have read so much of is at its worst in the case of the tenementhouses but you must understand that comparatively few people in new york own the roofs that shelter them by far the greater number live however they live in houses owned by others by a class who prosper and grow rich or richer simply by owning the roofs over other mens heads the landlords have of course no human relation with their tenants and really no business relations for all the affairs between them are transacted by agents some have the reputation of being better than others but they all live or expect to live without work on their rents they are very much respected for it the rents are considered a just return from the money invested you must try to conceive of this as an actual fact and not merely as a statistical statement i know it will not be easy for you it is not easy for me though i have it constantly before my face     iii   the tenementhouse such as it is is the original of the apartmenthouse which perpetuates some of its most characteristic features on a scale and in material undreamed of in the simple philosophy of the inventor of the tenementhouse the worst of these features is the want of light and air but as much more space and as many more rooms are conceded as the tenant will pay for the apartmenthouse however soars to heights that the tenementhouse never half reached and is sometimes ten stories high it is built fireproof very often and is generally equipped with an elevator which runs night and day and makes one level of all the floors the cheaper sort or those which have departed less from the tenementhouse original have no elevators but the street door in all is kept shut and locked and is opened only by the tenants latchkey or by the janitor having charge of the whole building in the finer houses there is a page whose sole duty it is to open and shut this door and who is usually brassbuttoned to one blinding effect of livery with the elevatorboy where this page or hallboy is found the elevator carries you to the door of any apartment you seek where he is not found there is a bell and a speakingtube in the lower entry for each apartment and you ring up the occupant and talk to him as many stories off as he happens to be but people who can afford to indulge their pride will not live in this sort of apartmenthouse and the rents in them are much lower than in the finer sort the finer sort are vulgarly fine for the most part with a gaudy splendor of mosaic pavement marble stairs frescoed ceilings painted walls and cabinet woodwork but there are many that are fine in a good taste in the things that are common to the inmates their fittings for housekeeping are of all degrees of perfection and except for the want of light and air life in them has a high degree of gross luxury they are heated throughout with pipes of steam or hot water and they are sometimes lighted with both gas and electricity which the inmate uses at will though of course at his own cost outside they are the despair of architecture for no style has yet been invented which enables the artist to characterize them with beauty and wherever they lift their vast bulks they deform the whole neighborhood throwing the other buildings out of scale and making it impossible for future edifices to assimilate themselves to the intruder  there is no end to the apartmenthouses for multitude and there is no street or avenue free from them of course the better sort are to be found on the fashionable avenues and the finer crossstreets but others follow the course of the horsecar lines on the eastern and western avenues and the elevated roads on the avenues which these have invaded in such places they are shops below and apartments above and i cannot see that the inmates seem at all sensible that they are unfitly housed in them people are born and married and live and die in the midst of an uproar so frantic that you would think they would go mad of it and i believe the physicians really attribute something of the growing prevalence of neurotic disorders to the wear and tear of the nerves from the rush of the trains passing almost momently and the perpetual jarring of the earth and air from their swift transit i once spent an evening in one of these apartments which a friend had taken for a few weeks last spring you can get them out of season for any length of time and as the weather had begun to be warm we had the windows open and so we had the full effect of the railroad operated under them my friend had become accustomed to it but for me it was an affliction which i cannot give you any notion of the trains seemed to be in the room with us and i sat as if i had a locomotive in my lap their shrieks and groans burst every sentence i began and if i had not been master of that visible speech which we use so much at home i never should have known what my friend was saying i cannot tell you how this brutal clamor insulted me and made the mere exchange of thought a part of the squalid struggle which is the plutocratic conception of life i came away after a few hours of it bewildered and bruised as if i had been beaten upon with hammers  some of the apartments on the elevated lines are very good as such things go they are certainly costly enough to be good and they are inhabited by people who can afford to leave them during the hot season when the noise is at its worst but most of them belong to people who must dwell in them summer and winter for want of money and leisure to get out of them and who must suffer incessantly from the noise i could not endure for a few hours in health it is bad enough but in sickness it must be horrible beyond all parallel imagine a mother with a dying child in such a place or a wife bending over the pillow of her husband to catch the last faint whisper of farewell as a train of five or six cars goes roaring by the open window what horror what profanation     iv   the noise is bad everywhere in new york but in some of the finer apartmenthouses on the better streets you are as well out of it as you can be anywhere in the city i have been a guest in these at different times and in one of them i am such a frequent guest that i may be said to know its life intimately in fact my hostess women transact society so exclusively in america that you seldom think of your host in the apartment i mean to speak of invited me to explore it one night when i dined with her so that i might as she said tell my friends when i got back to altruria how people lived in america and i cannot feel that i am violating her hospitality in telling you now she is that mrs makely whom i met last summer in the mountains and whom you thought so strange a type from the account of her i gave you but who is not altogether uncommon here i confess that with all her faults i like her and i like to go to her house she is in fact a very good woman perfectly selfish by tradition as the american women must be and wildly generous by nature as they nearly always are and infinitely superior to her husband in cultivation as is commonly the case with them as he knows nothing but business he thinks it is the only thing worth knowing and he looks down on the tastes and interests of her more intellectual life with amiable contempt as something almost comic she respects business too and so she does not despise his ignorance as you would suppose it is at least the ignorance of a businessman who must have something in him beyond her ken or else he would not be able to make money as he does  with your greater sense of humor i think you would be amused if you could see his smile of placid selfsatisfaction as he listens to our discussion of questions and problems which no more enter his daily life than they enter the daily life of an eskimo but i do not find it altogether amusing myself and i could not well forgive it if i did not know that he was at heart so simple and good in spite of his commerciality but he is sweet and kind as the american men so often are and he thinks his wife is the delightfulest creature in the world as the american husband nearly always does they have several times asked me to dine with them en famille and as a matter of form he keeps me a little while with him after dinner when she has left the table and smokes his cigar after wondering why we do not smoke in altruria but i can see that he is impatient to get to her in their drawingroom where we find her reading a book in the crimson light of the canopied lamp and where he presently falls silent perfectly happy to be near her the drawingroom is of a good size itself and it has a room opening out of it called the library with a case of books in it and mrs makelys pianoforte the place is rather too richly and densely rugged and there is rather more curtaining and shading of the windows than we should like but mrs makely is too well uptodate as she would say to have much of the bricàbrac about which she tells me used to clutter peoples houses here there are some pretty good pictures on the walls and a few vases and bronzes and she says she has produced a greater effect of space by quelling the furnitureshe means having few pieces and having them as small as possible there is a little stand with her afternoon teaset in one corner and there is a pretty writingdesk in the library i remember a sofa and some easychairs but not too many of them she has a table near one of the windows with books and papers on it she tells me that she sees herself that the place is kept just as she wishes it for she has rather a passion for neatness and you never can trust servants not to stand the books on their heads or study a vulgar symmetry in the arrangements she never allows them in there she says except when they are at work under her eye and she never allows anybody there except her guests and her husband after he has smoked of course her dog must be there and one evening after her husband fell asleep in the armchair near her the dog fell asleep on the fleece at her feet and we heard them softly breathing in unison she made a pretty little mocking mouth when the sound first became audible and said that she ought really to have sent mr makely out with the dog for the dog ought to have the air every day and she had been kept indoors but sometimes mr makely came home from business so tired that she hated to send him out even for the dogs sake though he was so apt to become dyspeptic they wont let you have dogs in some of the apartmenthouses but i tore up the first lease that had that clause in it and i told mr makely that i would rather live in a house all my days than any flat where my dog wasnt as welcome as i was of course theyre rather troublesome  the makelys had no children but it is seldom that the occupants of apartmenthouses of a good class have children though there is no clause in the lease against them i verified this fact from mrs makely herself by actual inquiry for in all the times that i had gone up and down in the elevator to her apartment i had never seen any children she seemed at first to think i was joking and not to like it but when she found that i was in earnest she said that she did not suppose all the families living under that roof had more than four or five children among them she said that it would be inconvenient and i could not allege the tenementhouses in the poor quarters of the city where children seemed to swarm for it is but too probable that they do not regard convenience in such places and that neither parents nor children are more comfortable for their presence     v   comfort is the american ideal in a certain way and comfort is certainly what is studied in such an apartment as the makelys inhabit we got to talking about it and the ease of life in such conditions and it was then she made me that offer to show me her flat and let me report to the altrurians concerning it she is all impulse and she asked how would i like to see it now and when i said i should be delighted she spoke to her husband and told him that she was going to show me through the flat he roused himself promptly and went before us at her bidding to turn up the electrics in the passages and rooms and then she led the way out through the diningroom  this and the parlors count three and the kitchen here is the fourth room of the eight she said and as she spoke she pushed open the door of a small room blazing with light and dense with the fumes of the dinner and the dishwashing which was now going on in a closet opening out of the kitchen  she showed me the set range at one side and the refrigerator in an alcove which she said went with the flat and lena she said to the cook this is the altrurian gentleman i was telling you about and i want him to see your kitchen can i take him into your room  the cook said oh yes maam and she gave me a good stare while mrs makely went to the kitchen window and made me observe that it let in the outside air though the court that it opened into was so dark that one had to keep the electrics going in the kitchen night and day of course its an expense she said as she closed the kitchen door after us she added in a low rapid tone you must excuse my introducing the cook she has read all about you in the papersyou didnt know i suppose that there were reporters that day of your delightful talk in the mountains but i had themand she was wild when she heard you were coming and made me promise to let her have a sight of you somehow she says she wants to go and live in altruria and if you would like to take home a cook or a servant of any kind you wouldnt have much trouble now here she ran on without a moments pause while she flung open another door is what you wont find in every apartmenthouse even very good ones and thats a back elevator sometimes there are only stairs and they make the poor things climb the whole way up from the basement when they come in and all your marketing has to be brought up that way too sometimes they send it up on a kind of dumbwaiter in the cheap places and you give your orders to the marketmen down below through a speakingtube but here we have none of that bother and this elevator is for the kitchen and housekeeping part of the flat the grocers and the butchers man and anybody who has packages for you or trunks or that sort of thing use it and of course its for the servants and they appreciate not having to walk up as much as anybody  oh yes i said and she shut the elevator door and opened another a little beyond it  this is our guest chamber she continued as she ushered me into a very pretty room charmingly furnished it isnt very light by day for it opens on a court like the kitchen and the servants room here and with that she whipped out of the guest chamber and into another doorway across the corridor this room was very much narrower but there were two small beds in it very neat and clean with some furnishings that were in keeping and a good carpet under foot mrs makely was clearly proud of it and expected me to applaud it but i waited for her to speak which upon the whole she probably liked as well  i only keep two servants because in a flat there isnt really room for more and i put out the wash and get in cleaningwomen when its needed i like to use my servants well because it pays and i hate to see anybody imposed upon some people put in a doubledecker as they call ita bedstead with two tiers like the berths on a ship but i think thats a shame and i give them two regular beds even if it does crowd them a little more and the beds have to be rather narrow this room has outside air from the court and though its always dark its very pleasant as you see i did not say that i did not see and this sufficed mrs makely  now she said ill show you our rooms and she flew down the corridor towards two doors that stood open side by side and flashed into them before me her husband was already in the first she entered smiling in supreme content with his wife his belongings and himself  this is a southern exposure and it has a perfect gush of sun from morning till night some of the flats have the kitchen at the end and thats stupid you can have a kitchen in any sort of hole for you can keep on the electrics and with them the air is perfectly good as soon as i saw these chambers and found out that they would let you keep a dog i told mr makely to sign the lease instantly and i would see to the rest  she looked at me and i praised the room and its dainty tastefulness to her hearts content so that she said well its some satisfaction to show you anything mr homos you are so appreciative im sure youll give a good account of us to the altrurians well now well go back to the padrawingroom this is the end of the story  well said her husband with a wink at me i thought it was to be continued in our next and he nodded towards the door that opened from his wifes bower into the room adjoining  why you poor old fellow she shouted i forgot all about your room and she dashed into it before us and began to show it off it was equipped with every bachelor luxury and with every appliance for health and comfort and here she said he can smoke or anything as long as he keeps the door shut oh good gracious i forgot the bathroom and they both united in showing me this with its tiled floor and walls and its porcelain tub and then mrs makely flew up the corridor before us put out the electrics dick she called back over her shoulder     vi   when we were again seated in the drawingroom which she had been so near calling a parlor she continued to bubble over with delight in herself and her apartment now isnt it about perfect she urged and i had to own that it was indeed very convenient and very charming and in the rapture of the moment she invited me to criticise it  i see very little to criticise i said from your point of view but i hope you wont think it indiscreet if i ask a few questions  she laughed ask anything mr homos i hope i got hardened to your questions in the mountains  she said you used to get off some pretty tough ones said her husband helpless to take his eyes from her although he spoke to me  it is about your servants i began  oh of course perfectly characteristic go on  you told me that they had no natural light either in the kitchen or their bedroom do they never see the light of day  the lady laughed heartily the waitress is in the front of the house several hours every morning at her work and they both have an afternoon off once a week some people only let them go once a fortnight but i think they are human beings as well as we are and i let them go every week  but except for that afternoon once a week your cook lives in electriclight perpetually  electriclight is very healthy and it doesnt heat the air the lady triumphed i can assure you that she thinks shes very well off and so she is i felt a little temper in her voice and i was silent until she asked me rather stiffly is there any other inquiry you would like to make  yes i said but i do not think you would like it  now i assure you mr homos you were never more mistaken in your life i perfectly delight in your naïveté i know that the altrurians dont think as we do about some things and i dont expect it what is it you would like to ask  well why should you require your servants to go down on a different elevator from yourselves  why good gracious cried the ladyarent they different from us in every way to be sure they dress up in their ridiculous best when they go out but you couldnt expect us to let them use the front elevator i dont want to go up and down with my own cook and i certainly dont with my neighbors cook  yes i suppose you would feel that an infringement of your social dignity but if you found yourself beside a cook in a horsecar or other public conveyance you would not feel personally affronted  no that is a very different thing that is something we cannot control but thank goodness we can control our elevator and if i were in a house where i had to ride up and down with the servants i would no more stay in it than i would in one where i couldnt keep a dog i should consider it a perfect outrage i cannot understand you mr homos you are a gentleman and you must have the traditions of a gentleman and yet you ask me such a thing as that  i saw a cast in her husbands eye which i took for a hint not to press the matter and so i thought i had better say it is only that in altruria we hold serving in peculiar honor  well said the lady scornfully if you went and got your servants from an intelligenceoffice and had to look up their references you wouldnt hold them in very much honor i tell you they look out for their interests as sharply as we do for ours and its nothing between us but a question of  business suggested her husband  yes she assented as if this clinched the matter  thats what im always telling you dolly and yet you will try to make them your friends as soon as you get them into your house you want them to love you and you know that sentiment hasnt got anything to do with it  well i cant help it dick i cant live with a person without trying to like them and wanting them to like me and then when the ungrateful things are saucy or leave me in the lurch as they do half the time it almost breaks my heart but im thankful to say that in these hard times they wont be apt to leave a good place without a good reason  are there many seeking employment i asked this because i thought it was safe ground  well they just stand around in the office as thick said the lady and the americans are trying to get places as well as the foreigners but i wont have americans they are too uppish and they are never half so well trained as the swedes or the irish they still expect to be treated as one of the family i suppose she continued with a lingering ire in her voice that in altruria you do treat them as one of the family  we have no servants in the american sense i answered as inoffensively as i could  mrs makely irrelevantly returned to the question that had first provoked her indignation and i should like to know how much worse it is to have a back elevator for the servants than it is to have the basement door for the servants as you always do when you live in a separate house  i should think it was no worse i admitted and i thought this a good chance to turn the talk from the dangerous channel it had taken i wish mrs makely you would tell me something about the way people live in separate houses in new york  she was instantly pacified why i should be delighted i only wish my friend mrs bellington strange was back from europe then i could show you a model house i mean to take you there as soon as she gets home shes a kind of altrurian herself you know she was my dearest friend at school and it almost broke my heart when she married mr strange so much older and her inferior in every way but shes got his money now and oh the good she does do with it i know youll like each other mr homos i do wish eva was at home  i said that i should be very glad to meet an american altrurian but that now i wished she would tell me about the normal new york house and what was its animating principle beginning with the basement door  she laughed and said why its just like any other house     vii   i can never insist enough my dear cyril upon the illogicality of american life you know what the plutocratic principle is and what the plutocratic civilization should logically be but the plutocratic civilization is much better than it should logically be bad as it is for the personal equation constantly modifies it and renders it far less dreadful than you would reasonably expect that is the potentialities of goodness implanted in the human heart by the creator forbid the plutocratic man to be what the plutocratic scheme of life implies he is often merciful kindly and generous as i have told you already in spite of conditions absolutely egotistical you would think that the americans would be abashed in view of the fact that their morality is often in contravention of their economic principles but apparently they are not so and i believe that for the most part they are not aware of the fact nevertheless the fact is there and you must keep it in mind if you would conceive of them rightly you can in no other way account for the contradictions which you will find in my experiences among them and these are often so bewildering that i have to take myself in hand from time to time and ask myself what mad world i have fallen into and whether after all it is not a ridiculous nightmare i am not sure that when i return and we talk these things over together i shall be able to overcome your doubts of my honesty and i think that when i no longer have them before my eyes i shall begin to doubt my own memory but for the present i can only set down what i at least seem to see and trust you to accept it if you cannot understand it  perhaps i can aid you by suggesting that logically the americans should be what the altrurians are since their polity embodies our belief that all men are born equal with the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness but that illogically they are what the europeans are since they still cling to the economical ideals of europe and hold that men are born socially unequal and deny them the liberty and happiness which can come from equality alone it is in their public life and civic life that altruria prevails it is in their social and domestic life that europe prevails and here i think is the severest penalty they must pay for excluding women from political affairs for women are at once the best and the worst americans the best because their hearts are the purest the worst because their heads are the idlest another contradiction you will say and i cannot deny it for with all their cultivation the american women have no real intellectual interests but only intellectual fads and while they certainly think a great deal they reflect little or not at all the inventions and improvements which have made their household work easy the wealth that has released them in such vast numbers from work altogether has not enlarged them to the sphere of duties which our altrurian women share with us but has left them with their quickened intelligences the prey of the trivialities which engross the european women and which have formed the life of the sex hitherto in every country where women have an economical and social freedom without the political freedom that can alone give it dignity and import they have a great deal of beauty and they are inconsequently charming i need not tell you that they are romantic and heroic or that they would go to the stake for a principle if they could find one as willingly as any martyr of the past but they have not much more perspective than children and their reading and their talk about reading seem not to have broadened their mental horizons beyond the old sunrise and the old sunset of the kitchen and the parlor  in fine the american house as it is the american household is what the american woman makes it and wills it to be whether she wishes it to be so or not for i often find that the american woman wills things that she in no wise wishes what the normal new york house is however i had great difficulty in getting mrs makely to tell me for as she said quite frankly she could not imagine my not knowing she asked me if i really wanted her to begin at the beginning and when i said that i did she took a little more time to laugh at the idea and then she said i suppose you mean a brownstone fourstory house in the middle of a block  yes i think that is what i mean i said  well she began those high steps that they all have unless theyre englishbasement houses really give them another story for people used to dine in the front room of their basements youve noticed the little front yard about as big as a handkerchief generally and the steps leading down to the iron gate which is kept locked and the basement door inside the gate well thats what you might call the back elevator of a house for it serves the same purpose the supplies are brought in there and marketmen go in and out and the ashes and the swill and the servantsthat you object to so much we have no alleys in new york the blocks are so narrow north and south and of course we have no back doors so we have to put the garbage out on the sidewalkand its nasty enough goodness knows underneath the sidewalk there are bins where people keep their coal and kindling youve noticed the gratings in the pavements  i said yes and i was ashamed to own that at first i had thought them some sort of registers for tempering the cold in winter this would have appeared ridiculous in the last degree to my hostess for the americans have as yet no conception of publicly modifying the climate as we do  back of what used to be the diningroom and what is now used for a laundry generally is the kitchen with closets between of course and then the back yard which some people make very pleasant with shrubs and vines the kitchen is usually dark and close and the girls can only get a breath of fresh air in the yard i like to see them but generally its taken up with clotheslines for people in houses nearly all have their washing done at home over the kitchen is the diningroom which takes up the whole of the first floor with the pantry and it almost always has a baywindow out of it of course that overhangs the kitchen and darkens it a little more but it makes the diningroom so pleasant i tell my husband that i should be almost willing to live in a house again just on account of the diningroom baywindow i had it full of flowers in pots for the southern sun came in and then the yard was so nice for the dog you didnt have to take him out for exercise yourself he chased the cats there and got plenty of it i must say that the cats on the back fences were a drawback at night to be sure we have them here too its seven stories down but you do hear them along in the spring the parlor or drawingroom is usually rather long and runs from the diningroom to the front of the house though where the house is very deep they have a sort of middle room or back parlor dick get some paper and draw it wouldnt you like to see a plan of the floor  i said that i should and she bade her husband make it like their old house in west thirtythird street we all looked at it together  this is the front door mrs makely explained where people come in and then begins the misery of a housestairs they mostly go up straight but sometimes they have them curve a little and in the new houses the architects have all sorts of little dodges for squaring them and putting landings then on the second floordraw it dickyou have two nice large chambers with plenty of light and air before and behind i do miss the light and air in a flat theres no denying it  youll go back to a house yet dolly said her husband  never she almost shrieked and he winked at me as if it were the best joke in the world never as long as houses have stairs  put in an elevator he suggested  well that is what eveleth strange has and she lets the servants use it too and mrs makely said with a look at me i suppose that would please you mr homos well theres a nice sideroom over the front door here and a bathroom at the rear then you have more stairs and large chambers and two siderooms that makes plenty of chambers for a small family i used to give two of the thirdstory rooms to my two girls i ought really to have made them sleep in one it seemed such a shame to let the cook have a whole large room to herself but i had nothing else to do with it and she did take such comfort in it poor old thing you see the rooms came wrong in our house for it fronted north and i had to give the girls sunny rooms or else give them front rooms so that it was as broad as it was long i declare i was perplexed about it the whole time we lived there it seemed so perfectly anomalous  and what is an englishbasement house like i ventured to ask in interruption of the retrospective melancholy she had fallen into  oh never live in an englishbasement house if you value your spine cried the lady an englishbasement house is nothing but stairs in the first place its only one room wide and its a story higher than the highstoop house its one room forward and one back the whole way up and in an englishbasement its always up and never down if i had my way there wouldnt one stone be left upon another in the englishbasements in new york  i have suffered mrs makely to be nearly as explicit to you as she was to me for the kind of house she described is of the form ordinarily prevailing in all american cities and you can form some idea from it how city people live here i ought perhaps to tell you that such a house is fitted with every housekeeping convenience and that there is hot and cold water throughout and gas everywhere it has fireplaces in all the rooms where fires are often kept burning for pleasure but it is really heated from a furnace in the basement through large pipes carried to the different stories and opening into them by some such registers as we use the separate houses sometimes have steamheating but not often they each have their drainage into the sewer of the street and this is trapped and trapped again as in the houses of our old plutocratic cities to keep the poison of the sewer from getting into the houses     viii   you will be curious to know something concerning the cost of living in such a house and you may be sure that i did not fail to question mrs makely on this point she was at once very volubly communicative she told me all she knew and as her husband said a great deal more  why of course she began you can spend all you have in new york if you like and people do spend fortunes every year but i suppose you mean the average cost of living in a brownstone house in a good block that rents for 1800 or 2000 a year with a family of three or four children and two servants well what should you say dick  ten or twelve thousand a yearfifteen answered her husband  yes fully that she answered with an effect of disappointment in his figures we had just ourselves and we never spent less than seven and we didnt dress and we didnt entertain either to speak of but you have to live on a certain scale and generally you live up to your income  quite said mr makely  i dont know what makes it cost so provisions are cheap enough and they say people live in as good style for a third less in london there used to be a superstition that you could live for less in a flat and they always talk to you about the cost of a furnace and a man to tend it and keep the snow shovelled off your sidewalk but that is all stuff five hundred dollars will make up the whole difference and more you pay quite as much rent for a decent flat and then you dont get half the room no if it wasnt for the stairs i wouldnt live in a flat for an instant but that makes all the difference  and the young people i urgedthose who are just starting in lifehow do they manage say when the husband has 1500 or 2000 a year  poor things she returned i dont know how they manage they board till they go distracted or they dry up and blow away or else the wife has a little money too and they take a small flat and ruin themselves of course they want to live nicely and like other people  but if they didnt  why then they could live delightfully my husband says he often wishes he was a mastermechanic in new york with a thousand a year and a flat for twelve dollars a month he would have the best time in the world  her husband nodded his acquiescence fightingcock wouldnt be in it he said trouble is we all want to do the swell thing  but you cant all do it i ventured and from what i see of the simple outoftheway neighborhoods in my walks you dont all try  why no he said some of us were talking about that the other night at the club and one of the fellows was saying that he believed there was as much oldfashioned quiet almost countrified life in new york among the great mass of the people as youd find in any city in the world said you met old codgers that took care of their own furnaces just as you would in a town of five thousand inhabitants  yes thats all very well said his wife but they wouldnt be nice people nice people want to live nicely and so they live beyond their means or else they scrimp and suffer i dont know which is worst  but there is no obligation to do either i asked  oh yes there is she returned if youve been born in a certain way and brought up in a certain way you cant get out of it you simply cant you have got to keep in it till you drop or a woman has  that means the womans husband too said mr makely with his wink for me always die together  in fact there is the same competition in the social world as in the business world and it is the ambition of every american to live in some such house as the new york house and as soon as a village begins to grow into a town such houses are built still the immensely greater number of the americans necessarily live so simply and cheaply that such a house would be almost as strange to them as to an altrurian but while we should regard its furnishings as vulgar and unwholesome most americans would admire and covet its rich rugs or carpets its papered walls and thickly curtained windows and all its foolish ornamentation and most american women would long to have a house like the ordinary highstoop new york house that they might break their backs over its stairs and become invalids and have servants about them to harass them and hate them  of course i put it too strongly for there is often illogically a great deal of love between the american women and their domestics though why there should be any at all i cannot explain except by reference to that mysterious personal equation which modifies all conditions here you will have made your reflection that the servants as they are cruelly called i have heard them called so in their hearing and wondered they did not fly tooth and nail at the throat that uttered the insult form really no part of the house but are aliens in the household and the family life in spite of this fact much kindness grows up between them and the family and they do not always slight the work that i cannot understand their ever having any heart in often they do slight it and they insist unsparingly upon the scanty privileges which their mistresses seem to think a monstrous invasion of their own rights the habit of oppression grows upon the oppressor and you would find tenderhearted women here gentle friends devoted wives loving mothers who would be willing that their domestics should remain indoors week in and week out and where they are confined in the ridiculous american flat never see the light of day in fact though the americans do not know it and would be shocked to be told it their servants are really slaves who are none the less slaves because they cannot be beaten or bought and sold except by the week or month and for the price which they fix themselves and themselves receive in the form of wages they are social outlaws so far as the society of the family they serve is concerned and they are restricted in the visits they receive and pay among themselves they are given the worst rooms in the house and they are fed with the food that they have prepared only when it comes cold from the family table in the wealthier houses where many of them are kept they are supplied with a coarser and cheaper victual bought and cooked for them apart from that provided for the family they are subject at all hours to the pleasure or caprice of the master or mistress every circumstance of their life is an affront to that just selfrespect which even americans allow is the right of every human being with the rich they are said to be sometimes indolent dishonest mendacious and all that plato long ago explained that slaves must be but in the middleclass families they are mostly faithful diligent and reliable in a degree that would put to shame most men who hold positions of trust and would leave many ladies whom they relieve of work without ground for comparison     ix   after mrs makely had told me about the new york house we began to talk of the domestic service and i ventured to hint some of the things that i have so plainly said to you she frankly consented to my whole view of the matter for if she wishes to make an effect or gain a point she has a magnanimity that stops at nothing short of selfdevotion i know it she said you are perfectly right but here we are and what are we to do what do you do in altruria i should like to know  i said that in altruria we all worked and that personal service was honored among us like medical attendance in america i did not know what other comparison to make but i said that any one in health would think it as unwholesome and as immoral to let another serve him as to let a doctor physic him at this mrs makely and her husband laughed so that i found myself unable to go on for some moments till mrs makely with a final shriek shouted to him dick do stop or i shall die excuse me mr homos but you are so deliciously funny and i know youre just joking you wont mind my laughing do go on  i tried to give her some notion as to how we manage in our common life which we have simplified so much beyond anything that this barbarous people dream of and she grew a little soberer as i went on and seemed at least to believe that i was not as her husband said stuffing them but she ended as they always do here by saying that it might be all very well in altruria but it would never do in america and that it was contrary to human nature to have so many things done in common now ill tell you she said after we broke up housekeeping in thirtythird street we stored our furniture  excuse me i said howstored  oh i dare say you never store your furniture in altruria but here we have hundreds of storage warehouses of all sorts and sizes packed with furniture that people put into them when they go to europe or get sick to death of servants and the whole bother of housekeeping and thats what we did and then as my husband says we browsed about for a year or two first we tried hotelling it and we took a hotel apartment furnished and dined at the hotel table until i certainly thought i should go off i got so tired of it then we hired a suite in one of the family hotels that there are so many of and got out enough of our things to furnish it and had our meals in our rooms they let you do that for the same price often they are glad to have you for the diningroom is so packed but everything got to tasting just the same as everything else and my husband had the dyspepsia so bad he couldnt half attend to business and i suffered from indigestion myself cooped up in a few small rooms that way and the dog almost died and finally we gave that up and took an apartment and got out our thingsthe storage cost as much as the rent of a small houseand put them into it and had a caterer send in the meals as they do in europe but it isnt the same here as it is in europe and we got so sick of it in a month that i thought i should scream when i saw the same old dishes coming on the table day after day we had to keep one servantexcuse me mr homos domesticanyway to look after the table and the parlor and chamber work and my husband said we might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb and so we got in a cook and bad as it is its twenty million times better than anything else you can do servants are a plague but you have got to have them and so i have resigned myself to the will of providence if they dont like it neither do i and so i fancy its about as broad as its long i have found this is a favorite phrase of mrs makelys and that it seems to give her a great deal of comfort  and you dont feel that theres any harm in it i ventured to ask  harm in it she repeated why arent the poor things glad to get the work what would they do without it  from what i see of your conditions i should be afraid that they would starve i said  yes they cant all get places in shops or restaurants and they have to do something or starve as you say she said and she seemed to think what i had said was a concession to her position  but if it were your own case i suggested if you had no alternatives but starvation and domestic service you would think there was harm in it even although you were glad to take a servants place  i saw her flush and she answered haughtily you must excuse me if i refuse to imagine myself taking a servants place even for the sake of argument  and you are quite right i said your american instinct is too strong to brook even in imagination the indignities which seem daily hourly and momently inflicted upon servants in your system  to my great astonishment she seemed delighted by this conclusion yes she said and she smiled radiantly and now you understand how it is that american girls wont go out to service though the pay is so much better and they are so much better housed and fedand everything besides she added with an irrelevance which always amuses her husband though i should be alarmed by it for her sanity if i did not find it so characteristic of women here who seem to be mentally characterized by the illogicality of the civilization theyre not half so good as the foreign servants theyve been brought up in homes of their own and theyre uppish and they have no idea of anything but thirdrate boardinghouse cooking and theyre always hoping to get married so that really you have no peace of your life with them  and it never seems to you that the whole relation is wrong i asked  what relation  that between maid and mistress the hirer and the hireling  why good gracious she burst out didnt christ himself say that the laborer was worthy of his hire and how would you get your work done if you didnt pay for it  it might be done for you when you could not do it yourself from affection  from affection she returned with the deepest derision well i rather think i shall have to do it myself if i want it done from affection but i suppose you think i ought to do it myself as the altrurian ladies do i can tell you that in america it would be impossible for a lady to do her own work and there are no intelligenceoffices where you can find girls that want to work for love its as broad as its long  its simply business her husband said  they were right my dear friend and i was wrong strange as it must appear to you the tie of service which we think as sacred as the tie of blood can be here only a business relation and in these conditions service must forever be grudgingly given and grudgingly paid there is something in it i do not quite know what for i can never place myself precisely in an americans place that degrades the poor creatures who serve so that they must not only be social outcasts but must leave such a taint of dishonor on their work that one cannot even do it for ones self without a sense of outraged dignity you might account for this in europe where ages of prescriptive wrong have distorted the relation out of all human wholesomeness and christian loveliness but in america where many and perhaps most of those who keep servants and call them so are but a single generation from fathers who earned their bread by the sweat of their brows and from mothers who nobly served in all household offices it is in the last degree bewildering i can only account for it by that bedevilment of the entire american ideal through the retention of the english economy when the english polity was rejected but at the heart of america there is this ridiculous contradiction and it must remain there until the whole country is altrurianized there is no other hope but i did not now urge this point and we turned to talk of other things related to the matters we had been discussing  the men said mrs makely get out of the whole bother very nicely as long as they are single and even when theyre married they are apt to run off to the club when theres a prolonged upheaval in the kitchen  i dont dolly suggested her husband  no you dont dick she returned fondly but there are not many like you  he went on with a wink at me i never live at the club except in summer when you go away to the mountains  well you know i cant very well take you with me she said  oh i couldnt leave my business anyway he said and he laughed     x   i had noticed the vast and splendid clubhouses in the best places in the city and i had often wondered about their life which seemed to me a blind groping towards our own though only upon terms that forbade it to those who most needed it the clubs here are not like our groups the free association of sympathetic people though one is a little more literary or commercial or scientific or political than another but the entrance to each is more or less jealously guarded there is an initiationfee and there are annual dues which are usually heavy enough to exclude all but the professional and business classes though there are of course successful artists and authors in them during the past winter i visited some of the most characteristic where i dined and supped with the members or came alone when one of these put me down for a fortnight or a month  they are equipped with kitchens and cellars and their wines and dishes are of the best each is in fact like a luxurious private house on a large scale outwardly they are palaces and inwardly they have every feature and function of a princely residence complete even to a certain number of guestchambers where members may pass the night or stay indefinitely in some cases and actually live at the club the club however is known only to the cities and larger towns in this highly developed form to the ordinary simple american of the country or of the country town of five or ten thousand people a new york club would be as strange as it would be to any altrurian  do many of the husbands left behind in the summer live at the club i asked  all that have a club do he said often theres a very good table dhôte dinner that you couldnt begin to get for the same price anywhere else and there are a lot of good fellows there and you can come pretty near forgetting that youre homeless or even that youre married  he laughed and his wife said you ought to be ashamed dick and me worrying about you all the time im away and wondering what the cook gives you here yes she continued addressing me thats the worst thing about the clubs they make the men so comfortable that they say its one of the principal obstacles to early marriages the young men try to get lodgings near them so that they can take their meals there and they know they get much better things to eat than they could have in a house of their own at a great deal more expense and so they simply dont think of getting married of course she said with that wonderful unintentional or at least unconscious frankness of hers i dont blame the clubs altogether theres no use denying that girls are expensively brought up and that a young man has to think twice before taking one of them out of the kind of home shes used to and putting her into the kind of home he can give her if the clubs have killed early marriages the women have created the clubs  do women go much to them i asked choosing this question as a safe one  much she screamed they dont go at all they cant they wont let us to be sure there are some that have rooms where ladies can go with their friends who are members and have lunch or dinner but as for seeing the inside of the clubhouse proper where these great creaturesshe indicated her husbandare sitting up smoking and telling stories it isnt to be dreamed of  her husband laughed you wouldnt like the smoking dolly  nor the stories some of them she retorted  oh the stories are always firstrate he said and he laughed more than before  and they never gossip at the clubs mr homosnever she added  well hardly ever said her husband with an intonation that i did not understand it seemed to be some sort of catchphrase  all i know said mrs makely is that i like to have my husband belong to his club its a nice place for him in summer and very often in winter when im dull or going out somewhere that he hates he can go down to his club and smoke a cigar and come home just about the time i get in and its much better than worrying through the evening with a book he hates books poor dick she looked fondly at him as if this were one of the greatest merits in the world but i confess i shouldnt like him to be a mere club man like some of them  but how i asked  why belonging to five or six or more even and spending their whole time at them when theyre not at business  there was a pause and mr makely put on an air of modest worth which he carried off with his usual wink towards me i said finally and if the ladies are not admitted to the mens clubs why dont they have clubs of their own  oh they haveseveral i believe but who wants to go and meet a lot of women you meet enough of them in society goodness knows you hardly meet any one else especially at afternoon teas they bore you to death  mrs makelys nerves seemed to lie in the direction of a prolongation of this subject and i asked my next question a little away from it i wish you would tell me mrs makely something about your way of provisioning your household you said that the grocers and butchers man came up to the kitchen with your supplies  yes and the milkman and the iceman the iceman always puts the ice into the refrigerator its very convenient and quite like your own house  but you go out and select the things yourself the day before or in the morning  oh not at all the men come and the cook gives the order she knows pretty well what we want on the different days and i never meddle with it from one weeks end to the other unless we have friends the tradespeople send in their bills at the end of the month and thats all there is of it her husband gave me one of his queer looks and she went on when we were younger and just beginning housekeeping i used to go out and order the things myself i used even to go to the big markets and half kill myself trying to get things a little cheaper at one place and another and waste more carfare and lay up more doctors bills than it would all come to ten times over i used to fret my life out remembering the prices but now thank goodness thats all over i dont know any more what beef is a pound than my husband does if a thing isnt good i send it straight back and that puts them on their honor you know and they have to give me the best of everything the bills average about the same from month to month a little more if we have company but if theyre too outrageous i make a fuss with the cook and she scolds the men and then it goes better for a while still its a great bother  i confess that i did not see what the bother was but i had not the courage to ask for i had already conceived a wholesome dread of the mystery of an american ladys nerves so i merely suggested and that is the way that people usually manage  why she said i suppose that some oldfashioned people still do their marketing and people that have to look to their outgoes and know what every mouthful costs them but their lives are not worth having eveleth strange does itor she did do it when she was in the country i dare say she wont when she gets backjust from a sense of duty and because she says that a housekeeper ought to know about her expenses but i ask her who will care whether she knows or not and as for giving the money to the poor that she saves by spending economically i tell her that the butchers and the grocers have to live too as well as the poor and so its as broad as its long     xi   i could not make out whether mr makely approved of his wifes philosophy or not i do not believe he thought much about it the money probably came easily with him and he let it go easily as an american likes to do there is nothing penurious or sordid about this curious people so fierce in the pursuit of riches when these are once gained they seem to have no value to the man who has won them and he has generally no object in life but to see his womankind spend them  this is the season of the famous thanksgiving which has now become the national holiday but has no longer any savor in it of the grim puritanism it sprang from it is now appointed by the president and the governors of the several states in proclamations enjoining a pious gratitude upon the people for their continued prosperity as a nation and a public acknowledgment of the divine blessings the blessings are supposed to be of the material sort grouped in the popular imagination as good times and it is hard to see what they are when hordes of men and women of every occupation are feeling the pinch of poverty in their different degrees it is not merely those who have always the wolf at their doors who are now suffering but those whom the wolf never threatened before those who amuse as well as those who serve the rich are alike anxious and fearful where they are not already in actual want thousands of poor players as well as hundreds of thousands of poor laborers are out of employment and the winter threatens to be one of dire misery yet you would not imagine from the smiling face of things as you would see it in the better parts of this great city that there was a heavy heart or an empty stomach anywhere below it in fact people here are so used to seeing other people in want that it no longer affects them as reality it is merely dramatic or hardly so lifelike as thatit is merely histrionic it is rendered still more spectacular to the imaginations of the fortunate by the melodrama of charity they are invited to take part in by endless appeals and their fancy is flattered by the notion that they are curing the distress they are only slightly relieving by a gift from their superfluity the charity of course is better than nothing but it is a fleeting mockery of the trouble at the best if it were proposed that the city should subsidize a theatre a which the idle players could get employment in producing good plays at a moderate cost to the people the notion would not be considered more ridiculous than that of founding municipal works for the different sorts of idle workers and it would not be thought half so nefarious for the proposition to give work by the collectivity is supposed to be in contravention of the sacred principle of monopolistic competition so dear to the american economist and it would be denounced as an approximation to the surrender of the city to anarchism and destruction by dynamite  but as i have so often said the american life is in no wise logical and you will not be surprised though you may be shocked or amused to learn that the festival of thanksgiving is now so generally devoted to witnessing a game of football between the elevens of two great universities that the services at the churches are very scantily attended the americans are practical if they are not logical and this preference of football to prayer and praise on thanksgivingday has gone so far that now a principal church in the city holds its services on thanksgivingeve so that the worshippers may not be tempted to keep away from their favorite game  there is always a heavy dinner at home after the game to console the friends of those who have lost and to heighten the joy of the winning side among the comfortable people the poor recognize the day largely as a sort of carnival they go about in masquerade on the eastern avenues and the children of the foreign races who populate that quarter penetrate the better streets blowing horns and begging of the passers they have probably no more sense of its difference from the old carnival of catholic europe than from the still older saturnalia of pagan times perhaps you will say that a masquerade is no more pagan than a football game and i confess that i have a pleasure in that innocent misapprehension of the holiday on the east side i am not more censorious of it than i am of the displays of festival cheer at the provisionstores or greengroceries throughout the city at this time they are almost as numerous on the avenues as the drinkingsaloons and thanks to them the tasteful housekeeping is at least convenient in a high degree the waste is inevitable with the system of separate kitchens and it is not in provisions alone but in labor and in time a hundred cooks doing the work of one but the americans have no conception of our cooperative housekeeping and so the folly goes on  meantime the provisionstores add much to their effect of crazy gayety on the avenues the variety and harmony of colors is very great and this morning i stood so long admiring the arrangement in one of them that i am afraid i rendered myself a little suspicious to the policeman guarding the liquorstore on the nearest corner there seems always to be a policeman assigned to this duty the display was on either side of the provisioners door and began on one hand with a basal line of pumpkins well out on the sidewalk then it was built up with the soft white and cool green of cauliflowers and open boxes of red and white grapes to the window that flourished in banks of celery and rosy apples on the other side graygreen squashes formed the foundation and the wall was sloped upward with the delicious salads you can find here the dark red of beets the yellow of carrots and the blue of cabbages the association of colors was very artistic and even the line of mutton carcasses overhead with each a brace of grouse or half a dozen quail in its embrace and flanked with long sides of beef at the four ends of the line was picturesque though the sight of the carnage at the provisionstores here would always be dreadful to an altrurian in the great markets it is intolerable this sort of business is mostly in the hands of the germans who have a good eye for such effects as may be studied in it but the fruiterers are nearly all italians and their stalls are charming i always like too the cheeriness of the chestnut and peanut ovens of the italians the pleasant smell and friendly smoke that rise from them suggest a simple and homelike life which there are so any things in this great weary heedless city to make one forget     xii   but i am allowing myself to wander too far from mrs makely and her letter which reached me only two days before thanksgiving   my dear mr homoswill you give me the pleasure of your company at dinner on thanksgivingday at eight oclock very informally my friend mrs bellington strange has unexpectedly returned from europe within the week and i am asking a few friends whom i can trust to excuse this very short notice to meet her  with mr makelys best regards yours cordially dorothea makely  the sphinx november the twenty sixth eighteen hundred and ninetythree   i must tell you that it has been a fad with the ladies here to spell out their dates and though the fashion is waning mrs makely is a woman who would remain in such an absurdity among the very last i will let you make your own conclusions concerning this for though as an altrurian i cannot respect her i like her so much and have so often enjoyed her generous hospitality that i cannot bring myself to criticise her except by the implication of the facts she is anomalous but to our way of thinking all the americans i have met are anomalous and she has the merits that you would not logically attribute to her character of course i cannot feel that her evident regard for me is the least of these though i like to think that it is founded on more reason than the rest  i have by this time become far too well versed in the polite insincerities of the plutocratic world to imagine that because she asked me to come to her dinner very informally i was not to come in all the state i could put into my dress you know what the evening dress of men is here from the costumes in our museum and you can well believe that i never put on those ridiculous black trousers without a sense of their grotesquenessthat scrap of waistcoat reduced to a mere rim so as to show the whole white breadth of the starched shirtbosom and that coat chopped away till it seems nothing but tails and lapels it is true that i might go out to dinner in our national costume in fact mrs makely has often begged me to wear it for she says the chinese wear theirs but i have not cared to make the sensation which i must if i wore it my outlandish views of life and my frank study of their customs signalize me quite sufficiently among the americans  at the hour named i appeared in mrs makelys drawingroom in all the formality that i knew her invitation to come very informally really meant i found myself the first as i nearly always do but i had only time for a word or two with my hostess before the others began to come she hastily explained that as soon as she knew mrs strange was in new york she had despatched a note telling her that i was still here and that as she could not get settled in time to dine at home she must come and take thanksgiving dinner with her she will have to go out with mr makely but i am going to put you next to her at table for i want you both to have a good time but dont you forget that you are going to take me out  i said that i should certainly not forget it and i showed her the envelope with my name on the outside and hers on a card inside which the servingman at the door had given me in the hall as the first token that the dinner was to be unceremonious  she laughed and said ive had the luck to pick up two or three other agreeable people that i know will be glad to meet you usually its such a scratch lot at thanksgiving for everybody dines at home that can and you have to trust to the highways and the byways for your guests if you give a dinner but i did want to bring mrs strange and you together and so i chanced it of course its a sentin dinner as you must have inferred from the man at the door ive given my servants a holiday and had clarets people do the whole thing its as broad as its long and as my husband says you might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb and it saves bother everybody will know its sent in so that nobody will be deceived therell be a turkey in it somewhere and cranberry sauce ive insisted on that but it wont be a regular american thanksgiving dinner and im rather sorry on your account for i wanted you to see one and i meant to have had you here just with ourselves but eveleth stranges coming back put a new face on things and so ive gone in for this affair which isnt at all what you would like thats the reason i tell you at once its sent in     xiii   i am so often at a loss for the connection in mrs makelys ideas that i am more patient with her incoherent jargon than you will be i am afraid it went on to much the effect that i have tried to report until the moment she took the hand of the guest who came next they arrived until there were eight of us in all mrs strange coming last with excuses for being late i had somehow figured her as a person rather mystical and recluse in appearance perhaps on account of her name and i had imagined her tall and superb but she was really rather small though not below the womans average and she had a face more round than otherwise with a sort of businesslike earnestness but a very charming smile and presently as i saw an american sense of humor she had brown hair and gray eyes and teeth not too regular to be monotonous her mouth was very sweet whether she laughed or sat gravely silent she at once affected me like a person who had been sobered beyond her nature by responsibilities and had steadily strengthened under the experiences of life she was dressed with a sort of personal taste in a rich gown of black lace which came up to her throat and she did not subject me to that embarrassment i always feel in the presence of a lady who is much décolletée when i sit next her or face to face with her i cannot always look at her without a sense of taking an immodest advantage sometimes i find a kind of pathos in this sacrifice of fashion which affects me as if the poor lady were wearing that sort of gown because she thought she really ought and then i keep my eyes firmly on hers or avert them altogether but there are other cases which have not this appealing quality yet in the very worst of the cases it would be a mistake to suppose that there was a display personally meant of the display personally made even then it would be found that the gown was worn so because the dressmaker had made it so and whether she had made it in this country or in europe that she had made it in compliance with a european custom in fact all the society customs of the americans follow some european original and usually some english original and it is only fair to say that in this particular custom they do not go to the english extreme  we did not go out to dinner at mrs makelys by the rules of english precedence because there are nominally no ranks here and we could not but i am sure it will not be long before the americans will begin playing at precedence just as they now play at the other forms of aristocratic society for the present however there was nothing for us to do but to proceed when dinner was served in such order as offered itself after mr makely gave his arm to mrs strange though of course the white shoulders of the other ladies went gleaming out before the white shoulders of mrs makely shone beside my black ones i have now become so used to these observances that they no longer affect me as they once did and as i suppose my account of them must affect you painfully comically but i have always the sense of having a part in amateur theatricals and i do not see how the americans can fail to have the same sense for there is nothing spontaneous in them and nothing that has grown even dramatically out of their own life  often when i admire the perfection of the stagesetting it is with a vague feeling that i am derelict in not offering it an explicit applause in fact this is permitted in some sort and measure as now when we sat down at mrs makelys exquisite table and the ladies frankly recognized her touch in it one of them found a phrase for it at once and pronounced it a symphony in chrysanthemums for the color and the character of these flowers played through all the appointments of the table and rose to a magnificent finale in the vast group in the middle of the board infinite in their caprices of tint and design another lady said that it was a dream and then mrs makely said no a memory and confessed that she had studied the effect from her recollection of some tables at a chrysanthemum show held here year before last which seemed failures because they were so simply and crudely adapted in the china and napery to merely one kind and color of the flower  then she added i wanted to do something very chrysanthemummy because it seems to me the thanksgiving flower and belongs to thanksgiving quite as much as holly belongs to christmas  everybody applauded her intention and they hungrily fell to upon the excellent oysters with her warning that we had better make the most of everything in its turn for she had conformed her dinner to the brevity of the notice she had given her guests     xiv   just what the dinner was i will try to tell you for i think that it will interest you to know what people here think a very simple dinner that is people of any degree of fashion for the unfashionable americans who are innumerably in the majority have no more than the altrurians seen such a dinner as mrs makelys this sort generally sit down to a single dish of meat with two or three vegetables and they drink tea or coffee or water only with their dinner even when they have company as they say the things are all put on the table at once and the average of americans who have seen a dinner served in courses after the russian manner invariable in the fine world here is not greater than those who have seen a servingman in livery among these the host piles up his guests plate with meat and vegetables and it is passed from hand to hand till it reaches him his drink arrives from the hostess by the same means one maid serves the table in a better class and two maids in a class still better it is only when you reach people of very decided form that you find a man in a black coat behind your chair mrs makely mindful of the informality of her dinner in everything had two men  i should say the difference between the altrurians and the unfashionable americans in view of such a dinner as she gave us would be that while it would seem to us abominable for its extravagance and revolting in its appeals to appetite it would seem to most of such americans altogether admirable and enviable and would appeal to their ambition to give such a dinner themselves as soon as ever they could  well with our oysters we had a delicate french wine though i am told that formerly spanish wines were served a delicious soup followed the oysters and then we had fish with sliced cucumbers dressed with oil and vinegar like a salad and i suppose you will ask what we could possibly have eaten more but this was only the beginning and next there came a course of sweetbreads with green peas with this the champagne began at once to flow for mrs makely was nothing if not original and she had champagne very promptly one of the gentlemen praised her for it and said you could not have it too soon and he had secretly hoped it would have begun with the oysters next we had a removea tenderloin of beef with mushrooms fresh and not of the canned sort which it is usually accompanied with this fact won our hostess more compliments from the gentlemen which could not have gratified her more if she had dressed and cooked the dish herself she insisted upon our trying the stewed terrapin for if it did come in a little by the neck and shoulders it was still in place at a thanksgiving dinner because it was so american and the stuffed peppers which if they were not american were at least mexican and originated in the kitchen of a sister republic there were one or two other sidedishes and with all the burgundy began to be poured out  mr makely said that claret all came now from california no matter what french château they named it after but burgundy you could not err in his guests were now drinking the different wines and to much the same effect i should think as if they had mixed them all in one cup though i ought to say that several of the ladies took no wine and kept me in countenance after the first taste i was obliged to take of each in order to pacify my host  you must know that all the time there were plates of radishes olives celery and roasted almonds set about that every one ate of without much reference to the courses the talking and the feasting were at their height but there was a little flagging of the appetite perhaps when it received the stimulus of a waterice flavored with rum after eating it i immediately experienced an extraordinary revival of my hunger i am ashamed to confess that i was gorging myself like the rest but i quailed inwardly when one of the menservants set down before mr makely a roast turkey that looked as large as an ostrich it was received with cries of joy and one of the gentlemen said ah mrs makely i was waiting to see how you would interpolate the turkey but you never fail i knew you would get it in somewhere but where he added in a burlesque whisper behind his hand are the  canvasback duck she asked and at that moment the servant set before the anxious inquirer a platter of these renowned birds which you know something of already from the report our emissaries have given of their cult among the americans  every one laughed and after the gentleman had made a despairing flourish over them with a carvingknife in emulation of mr makelys emblematic attempt upon the turkey both were taken away and carved at a sideboard they were then served in slices the turkey with cranberry sauce and the ducks with currant jelly and i noticed that no one took so much of the turkey that he could not suffer himself to be helped also to the duck i must tell you that there a salad with the duck and after that there was an icecream with fruit and all manner of candied fruits and candies different kinds of cheese coffee and liqueurs to drink after the coffee  well now mrs makely proclaimed in high delight with her triumph i must let you imagine the pumpkinpie i meant to have it because it isnt really thanksgiving without it but i couldnt for the life of me see where it would come in     xv   the sally of the hostess made them all laugh and they began to talk about the genuine american character of the holiday and what a fine thing it was to have something truly national they praised mrs makely for thinking of so many american dishes and the facetious gentleman said that she rendered no greater tribute than was due to the overruling providence which had so abundantly bestowed them upon the americans as a people you must have been glad mrs strange he said to the lady at my side to get back to our american oysters there seems nothing else so potent to bring us home from europe  im afraid she answered that i dont care so much for the american oyster as i should but i am certainly glad to get back  in time for the turkey perhaps  no i care no more for the turkey than for the oyster of my native land said the lady  ah well say the canvasback duck then the canvasback duck is no alien he is as thoroughly american as the turkey or as any of us  no i should not have missed him either persisted the lady  what could one have missed the gentleman said with a bow to the hostess in the dinner mrs makely has given us if there had been nothing i should not have missed it and when the laugh at his drolling had subsided he asked mrs strange then if it is not too indiscreet might i inquire what in the world has lured you again to our shores if it was not the oyster nor the turkey nor yet the canvasback  the american dinnerparty said the lady with the same burlesque  well he consented i think i understand you it is different from the english dinnerparty in being a festivity rather than a solemnity though after all the american dinner is only a condition of the english dinner do you find us much changed mrs strange  i think we are every year a little more european said the lady one notices it on getting home  i supposed we were so european already returned the gentleman that a european landing among us would think he had got back to his startingpoint in a sort of vicious circle i am myself so thoroughly europeanized in all my feelings and instincts that do you know mrs makely if i may confess it without offence  oh by all means cried the hostess  when that vast bird which we have been praising that colossal roast turkey appeared i felt a shudder go through my delicate substance such as a refined englishman might have experienced at the sight and i said to myself quite as if i were not one of you good heavens now they will begin talking through their noses and eating with their knives its what i might have expected  it was impossible not to feel that this gentleman was talking at me if the americans have a foreign guest they always talk at him more or less and i was not surprised when he said i think our friend mr homos will conceive my fine revolt from the crude period of our existence which the roast turkey marks as distinctly as the graffiti of the cavedweller proclaim his epoch  no i protested i am afraid that i have not the documents for the interpretation of your emotion i hope you will take pity on my ignorance and tell me just what you mean  the others said they none of them knew either and would like to know and the gentleman began by saying that he had been going over the matter in his mind on his way to dinner and he had really been trying to lead up to it ever since we sat down ive been struck first of all by the fact in our evolution that we havent socially evolved from ourselves weve evolved from the europeans from the english i dont think youll find a single society rite with us now that had its origin in our peculiar national life if we have a peculiar national life i doubt it sometimes if you begin with the earliest thing in the day if you begin with breakfast as society gives breakfasts you have an english breakfast though american people and provisions  i must say i think theyre both much nicer said mrs makely  ah there i am with you we borrow the form but we infuse the spirit i am talking about the form though then if you come to the society lunch which is almost indistinguishable from the society breakfast you have the english lunch which is really an undersized english dinner the afternoon tea is english again with its troops of eager females and stray reluctant males though i believe there are rather more men at the english teas owing to the larger leisure class in england the afternoon tea and the at home are as nearly alike as the breakfast and the lunch then in the course of time we arrive at the great society function the dinner and what is the dinner with us but the dinner of our mothercountry  it is livelier suggested mrs makely again  livelier i grant you but i am still speaking of the form and not of the spirit the evening reception which is gradually fading away as a separate rite with its supper and its dance we now have as the english have it for the people who have not been asked to dinner the ball which brings us round to breakfast again is again the ball of our anglosaxon kin beyond the seas in short from the society point of view we are in everything their mere rinsings  nothing of the kind cried mrs makely i wont let you say such a thing on thanksgivingday too why there is the thanksgiving dinner itself if that isnt purely american i should like to know what is  it is purely american but it is strictly domestic it is not society nobody but some great soul like you mrs makely would have the courage to ask anybody to a thanksgiving dinner and even you ask only such easygoing housefriends as we are proud to be you wouldnt think of giving a dinnerparty on thanksgiving  no i certainly shouldnt i should think it was very presuming and you are all as nice as you can be to have come today i am not the only great soul at the table but that is neither here nor there thanksgiving is a purely american thing and its more popular than ever a few years ago you never heard of it outside of new england  the gentleman laughed you are perfectly right mrs makely as you always are thanksgiving is purely american so is the cornhusking so is the applebee so is the sugarparty so is the spellingmatch so is the churchsociable but none of these have had their evolution in our society entertainments the new years call was also purely american but that is now as extinct as the dodo though i believe the other american festivities are still known in the rural districts  yes said mrs makely and i think its a great shame that we cant have some of them in a refined form in society i once went to a sugarparty up in new hampshire when i was a girl and i never enjoyed myself so much in my life i should like to make up a party to go to one somewhere in the catskills in march will you all go it would be something to show mr homos i should like to show him something really american before he goes home theres nothing american left in society  you forget the american woman suggested the gentleman she is always american and she is always in society  yes returned our hostess with a thoughtful air youre quite right in that one always meets more women than men in society but its because the men are so lazy and so comfortable at their clubs they wont go they enjoy themselves well enough in society after they get there as i tell my husband when he grumbles over having to dress  well said the gentleman a great many things the daytime things we really cant come to because we dont belong to the aristocratic class as you ladies do and we are busy downtown but i dont think we are reluctant about dinner and the young fellows are nearly always willing to go to a ball if the suppers good and its a house where they dont feel obliged to dance but what do you think mr homos he asked how does your observation coincide with my experience  i answered that i hardly felt myself qualified to speak for though i had assisted at the different kinds of society rites he had mentioned thanks to the hospitality of my friends in new york i knew the english functions only from a very brief stay in england on my way here and from what i had read of them in english fiction and in the relations of our emissaries he inquired into our emissary system and the company appeared greatly interested in such account of it as i could briefly give  well he said that would do while you kept it to yourselves but now that your country is known to the plutocratic world your public documents will be apt to come back to the countries your emissaries have visited and make trouble the first thing you know some of our bright reporters will get on to one of your emissaries and interview him and then we shall get what you think of us at first hands bytheby have you seen any of those primitive social delights which mrs makely regrets so much  i our hostess protested but then she perceived that he was joking and she let me answer  i said that i had seen them nearly all during the past year in new england and in the west but they appeared to me inalienable of the simpler life of the country and that i was not surprised they should not have found an evolution in the more artificial society of the cities  i see he returned that you reserve your opinion of our more artificial society but you may be sure that our reporters will get it out of you yet before you leave us  those horrid reporters one of the ladies irrelevantly sighed  the gentleman resumed in the mean time i dont mind saying how it strikes me i think you are quite right about the indigenous american things being adapted only to the simpler life of the country and the smaller towns it is so everywhere as soon as people become at all refined they look down upon what is their own as something vulgar but it is peculiarly so with us we have nothing national that is not connected with the life of work and when we begin to live the life of pleasure we must borrow from the people abroad who have always lived the life of pleasure  mr homos you know mrs makely explained for me as if this were the aptest moment thinks we all ought to work he thinks we oughtnt to have any servants  oh no my dear lady i put in i dont think that of you as you are none of you could see more plainly than i do that in your conditions you must have servants and that you cannot possibly work unless poverty obliges you  the other ladies had turned upon me with surprise and horror at mrs makelys words but they now apparently relented as if i had fully redeemed myself from the charge made against me mrs strange alone seemed to have found nothing monstrous in my supposed position sometimes she said i wish we had to work all of us and that we could be freed from our servile bondage to servants  several of the ladies admitted that it was the greatest slavery in the world and that it would be comparative luxury to do ones own work but they all asked in one form or another what were they to do and mrs strange owned that she did not know the facetious gentleman asked me how the ladies did in altruria and when i told them as well as i could they were of course very civil about it but i could see that they all thought it impossible or if not impossible then ridiculous i did not feel bound to defend our customs and i knew very well that each woman there was imagining herself in our conditions with the curse of her plutocratic tradition still upon her they could not do otherwise any of them and they seemed to get tired of such effort as they did make  mrs makely rose and the other ladies rose with her for the americans follow the english custom in letting the men remain at table after the women have left but on this occasion i found it varied by a pretty touch from the french custom and the men instead of merely standing up while the women filed out gave each his arm as far as the drawingroom to the lady he had brought in to dinner then we went back and what is the pleasantest part of the dinner to most men began for us     xvi   i must say to the credit of the americans that although the eating and drinking among them appear gross enough to an altrurian you are not revolted by the coarse stories which the english sometimes tell as soon as the ladies have left them if it is a mens dinner or more especially a mens supper these stories are pretty sure to follow the coffee but when there have been women at the board some sense of their presence seems to linger in the more delicate american nerves and the indulgence is limited to two or three things off color as the phrase is here told with anxious glances at the drawingroom doors to see if they are fast shut  i do not remember just what brought the talk back from these primrose paths to that question of american society forms but presently some one said he believed the churchsociable was the thing in most towns beyond the applebee and sugarparty stage and this opened the inquiry as to how far the church still formed the social life of the people in cities some one suggested that in brooklyn it formed it altogether and then they laughed for brooklyn is always a joke with the newyorkers i do not know exactly why except that this vast city is so largely a suburb and that it has a great number of churches and is comparatively cheap then another told of a lady who had come to new york he admitted twenty years ago and was very lonely as she had no letters until she joined a church this at once brought her a general acquaintance and she began to find herself in society but as soon as she did so she joined a more exclusive church where they took no notice of strangers they all laughed at that bit of human nature as they called it and they philosophized the relation of women to society as a purely business relation the talk ranged to the mutable character of society and how people got into it or were of it and how it was very different from what it once was except that with women it was always business they spoke of certain new rich people with affected contempt but i could see that they were each proud of knowing such millionaires as they could claim for acquaintance though they pretended to make fun of the number of menservants you had to run the gantlet of in their houses before you could get to your hostess  one of my commensals said he had noticed that i took little or no wine and when i said that we seldom drank it in altruria he answered that he did not think i could make that go in america if i meant to dine much dining you know means overeating he explained and if you wish to overeat you must overdrink i venture to say that you will pass a worse night than any of us mr homos and that you will be sorrier tomorrow than i shall they were all smoking and i confess that their tobacco was secretly such an affliction to me that i was at one moment in doubt whether i should take a cigar myself or ask leave to join the ladies  the gentleman who had talked so much already said well i dont mind dining a great deal especially with makely here but i do object to supping as i have to do now and then in the way of pleasure last saturday night i sat down at eleven oclock to bluepoint oysters consommé stewed terrapinyours was very good makely i wish i had taken more of itlamb chops with peas redhead duck with celery mayonnaise nesselrode pudding fruit cheese and coffee with sausages caviare radishes celery and olives interspersed wildly and drinkables and smokables ad libitum and i can assure you that i felt very devout when i woke up after churchtime in the morning it is this turning night into day that is killing us we men who have to go to business the next morning ought to strike and say that we wont go to anything later than eightoclock dinner  ah then the women would insist upon our making it fouroclock tea said another  our host seemed to be reminded of something by the mention of the women and he said after a glance at the state of the cigars shall we join the ladies  one of the menservants had evidently been waiting for this question he held the door open and we all filed into the drawingroom  mrs makely hailed me with ah mr homos im so glad youve come we poor women have been having a most dismal time  honestly asked the funny gentleman dont you always without us yes but this has been worse than usual mrs strange has been asking us how many people we supposed there were in this city within five minutes walk of us who had no dinner today do you call that kind  a little more than kin and less than kind perhaps the gentleman suggested but what does she propose to do about it  he turned towards mrs strange who answered nothing what does any one propose to do about it  then why do you think about it  i dont it thinks about itself do you know that poem of longfellows the challenge  no i never heard of it  well it begins in his sweet old way about some spanish king who was killed before a city he was besieging and one of his knights sallies out of the camp and challenges the people of the city the living and the dead as traitors then the poet breaks off apropos de rien       there is a greater army        that besets us round with strife      a numberless starving army        at all the gates of life      the povertystricken millions        who challenge our wine and bread      and impeach us all for traitors        both the living and the dead      and whenever i sit at the banquet        where the feast and song are high      amid the mirth and the music        i can hear that fearful cry       and hollow and haggard faces        look into the lighted hall      and wasted hands are extended        to catch the crumbs that fall      for within there is light and plenty        and odors fill the air      but without there is cold and darkness        and hunger and despair      and there in the camp of famine        in wind and cold and rain      christ the great lord of the army        lies dead upon the plain   ah said the facetious gentleman that is fine we really forget how fine longfellow was it is so pleasant to hear you quoting poetry mrs strange that sort of thing has almost gone out and its a pity     xvii   our fashion of offering hospitality on the impulse would be as strange here as offering it without some special inducement for its acceptance the inducement is as often as can be a celebrity or eccentricity of some sort or some visiting foreigner and i suppose that i have been a good deal used myself in one quality or the other but when the thing has been done fully and guardedly at all points it does not seem to have been done for pleasure either by the host or the guest the dinner is given in payment of another dinner or out of ambition by people who are striving to get forward in society or by great social figures who give regularly a certain number of dinners every season in either case it is eaten from motives at once impersonal and selfish i do not mean to say that i have not been at many dinners where i felt nothing perfunctory either in host or guest and where as sweet and gay a spirit ruled as at any of our own simple feasts still i think our main impression of american hospitality would be that it was thoroughly infused with the plutocratic principle and that it meant business  i am speaking now of the hospitality of society people who number after all but a few thousands out of the many millions of american people these millions are so far from being in society even when they are very comfortable and on the way to great prosperity if they are not already greatly prosperous that if they were suddenly confronted with the best society of the great eastern cities they would find it almost as strange as so many altrurians a great part of them have no conception of entertaining except upon an altrurian scale of simplicity and they know nothing and care less for the forms that society people value themselves upon when they begin in the ascent of the social scale to adopt forms it is still to wear them lightly and with an individual freedom and indifference it is long before anxiety concerning the social law renders them vulgar  yet from highest to lowest from first to last one invariable fact characterizes them all and it may be laid down as an axiom that in a plutocracy the man who needs a dinner is the man who is never asked to dine i do not say that he is not given a dinner he is very often given a dinner and for the most part he is kept from starving to death but he is not suffered to sit at meat with his host if the person who gives him a meal can be called his host his need of the meal stamps him with a hopeless inferiority and relegates him morally to the company of the swine at their husks and of lazarus whose sores the dogs licked usually of course he is not physically of such a presence as to fit him for any place in good society short of abrahams bosom but even if he were entirely decent or of an inoffensive shabbiness it would not be possible for his benefactors in any grade of society to ask him to their tables he is sometimes fed in the kitchen where the people of the house feed in the kitchen themselves he is fed at the back door  we were talking of this the other night at the house of that lady whom mrs makely invited me specially to meet on thanksgivingday it happened then as it often happens here that although i was asked to meet her i saw very little of her it was not so bad as it sometimes is for i have been asked to meet people very informally and passed the whole evening with them and yet not exchanged a word with them mrs makely really gave me a seat next mrs strange at table and we had some unimportant conversation but there was a lively little creature visàvis of me who had a fancy of addressing me so much of her talk that my acquaintance with mrs strange rather languished through the dinner and she went away so soon after the men rejoined the ladies in the drawingroom that i did not speak to her there i was rather surprised then to receive a note from her a few days later asking me to dinner and i finally went i am ashamed to own more from curiosity than from any other motive i had been in the mean time thoroughly coached concerning her by mrs makely whom i told of my invitation and who said quite frankly that she wished mrs strange had asked her too but eveleth strange wouldnt do that she explained because it would have the effect of paying me back im so glad on your account that youre going for i do want you to know at least one american woman that you can unreservedly approve of i know you dont begin to approve of me and i was so vexed that you really had no chance to talk with her that night you met her here it seemed to me as if she ran away early just to provoke me and to tell you the truth i thought she had taken a dislike to you i wish i could tell you just what sort of a person she is but it would be perfectly hopeless for you havent got the documents and you never could get them i used to be at school with her and even then she wasnt like any of the other girls she was always so original and did things from such a high motive that afterwards when we were all settled i was perfectly thunderstruck at her marrying old bellington strange who was twice her age and had nothing but his money he was not related to the new york bellingtons at all and nobody knows how he got the name nobody ever heard of the stranges in fact people say that he used to be plain peter b strange till he married eveleth and she made him drop the peter and blossom out in the bellington so that he could seem to have a social as well as a financial history people who dislike her insisted that they were not in the least surprised at her marrying him that the highmotive business was just her pose and that she had jumped at the chance of getting him but i always stuck up for herand i know that she did it for the sake of her family who were all as poor as poor and were dependent on her after her father went to smash in his business she was always as highstrung and romantic as she could be but i dont believe that even then she would have taken mr strange if there had been anybody else i dont suppose any one else ever looked at her for the young men are pretty sharp nowadays and are not going to marry girls without a cent when there are so many rich girls just as charming every way you cant expect them to at any rate whatever her motive was she had her reward for mr strange died within a year of their marriage and she got all his money there was no attempt to break the will for mr strange seemed to be literally of no family and shes lived quietly on in the house he bought her ever since except when shes in europe and thats about twothirds of the time she has her mother with her and i suppose that her sisters and her cousins and her aunts come in for outdoor aid shes always helping somebody they say thats her pose now but if it is i dont think its a bad one and certainly if she wanted to get married again there would be no trouble with her three millions i advise you to go to her dinner by all means mr homos it will be something worth while in every way and perhaps youll convert her to altrurianism shes as hopeful a subject as i know     xviii   i was one of the earliest of the guests for i cannot yet believe that people do not want me to come exactly when they say they do i perceived however that one other gentleman had come before me and i was both surprised and delighted to find that this was my acquaintance mr bullion the boston banker he professed as much pleasure at our meeting as i certainly felt but after a few words he went on talking with mrs strange while i was left to her mother an elderly woman of quiet and even timid bearing who affected me at once as born and bred in a wholly different environment in fact every american of the former generation is almost as strange to it in tradition though not in principle as i am and i found myself singularly at home with this sweet lady who seemed glad of my interest in her i was taken from her side to be introduced to a lady on the opposite side of the room who said she had been promised my acquaintance by a friend of hers whom i had met in the mountainsmr twelvemough did i remember him she gave a little cry while still speaking and dramatically stretched her hand towards a gentleman who entered at the moment and whom i saw to be no other than mr twelvemough himself as soon as he had greeted our hostess he hastened up to us and barely giving himself time to press the still outstretched hand of my companion shook mine warmly and expressed the greatest joy at seeing me he said that he had just got back to town in a manner and had not known i was here till mrs strange had asked him to meet me there were not a great many other guests when they all arrived and we sat down a party not much larger than at mrs makelys  i found that i was again to take out my hostess but i was put next the lady with whom i had been talking she had come without her husband who was apparently of a different social taste from herself and had an engagement of his own there was an artist and his wife whose looks i liked some others whom i need not specify were there i fancied because they had heard of altruria and were curious to see me as mr twelvemough sat quite at the other end of the table the lady on my right could easily ask me whether i liked his books she said tentatively people liked them because they felt sure when they took up one of his novels they had not got hold of a tract on political economy in disguise  it was this complimentary close of a remark which scarcely began with praise that made itself heard across the table and was echoed with a heartfelt sigh from the lips of another lady  yes she said that is what i find such a comfort in mr twelvemoughs books  we were speaking of mr twelvemoughs books the first lady triumphed and several began to extol them for being fiction pure and simple and not dealing with anything but loves of young people  mr twelvemough sat looking as modest as he could under the praise and one of the ladies said that in a novel she had lately read there was a description of a surgical operation that made her feel as if she had been present at a clinic then the author said that he had read that passage too and found it extremely well done it was fascinating but it was not art  the painter asked why was it not art  the author answered well if such a thing as that was art then anything that a man chose to do in a work of imagination was art  precisely said the painterart is choice  on that ground the banker interposed you could say that political economy was a fit subject for art if an artist chose to treat it  it would have its difficulties the painter admitted but there are certain phases of political economy dramatic moments human moments which might be very fitly treated in art for instance who would object to mr twelvemoughs describing an eviction from an east side tenementhouse on a cold winter night with the mother and her children huddled about the fire the father had kindled with pieces of the household furniture  i should object very much for one said the lady who had objected to the account of the surgical operation it would be too creepy art should give pleasure  then you think a tragedy is not art asked the painter  i think that these harrowing subjects are brought in altogether too much said the lady there are enough of them in real life without filling all the novels with them its terrible the number of beggars you meet on the street this winter do you want to meet them in mr twelvemoughs novels too  well it wouldnt cost me any money there i shouldnt have to give  you oughtnt to give money in real life said the lady you ought to give charity tickets if the beggars refuse them it shows they are impostors  its some comfort to know that the charities are so active said the elderly young lady even if half the letters one gets do turn out to be appeals from them  its very disappointing to have them do it though said the artist lightly i thought there was a society to abolish poverty that doesnt seem to be so active as the charities this winter is it possible theyve found it a failure  well said mr bullion perhaps they have suspended during the hard times  they tossed the ball back and forth with a lightness the americans have and i could not have believed if i had not known how hardened people become to such things here that they were almost in the actual presence of hunger and cold it was within five minutes walk of their warmth and surfeit and if they had lifted the window and called who goes there the houselessness that prowls the night could have answered them from the street below despair  i had an amusing experience mr twelvemough began when i was doing a little visiting for the charities in our ward the other winter  for the sake of the literary material the artist suggested  partly for the sake of the literary material you know we have to look for our own everywhere but we had a case of an old actors son who had got out of all the places he had filled on account of rheumatism and could not go to sea or drive a truck or even wrap gasfixtures in paper any more  a checkered employ the banker mused aloud  it was not of a simultaneous nature the novelist explained so he came on the charities and as i knew the theatrical profession a little and how generous it was with all related to it i said that i would undertake to look after his case you know the theory is that we get work for our patients or clients or whatever they are and i went to a manager whom i knew to be a good fellow and i asked him for some sort of work he said yes send the man round and he would give him a job copying parts for a new play he had written  the novelist paused and nobody laughed  it seems to me that your experience is instructive rather than amusing said the banker it shows that something can be done if you try  well said mr twelvemough i thought that was the moral myself till the fellow came afterwards to thank me he said that he considered himself very lucky for the manager had told him that there were six other men had wanted that job  everybody laughed now and i looked at my hostess in a little bewilderment she murmured i suppose the joke is that he had befriended one man at the expense of six others  oh i returned is that a joke  no one answered but the lady at my right asked how do you manage with poverty in altruria  i saw the banker fix a laughing eye on me but i answered in altruria we have no poverty  ah i knew you would say that he cried out thats what he always does he explained to the lady bring up any one of our little difficulties and ask how they get over it in altruria and he says they have nothing like it its very simple  they all began to ask me questions but with a courteous incredulity which i could feel well enough and some of my answers made them laugh all but my hostess who received them with a gravity that finally prevailed but i was not disposed to go on talking of altruria then though they all protested a real interest and murmured against the hardship of being cut off with so brief an account of our country as i had given them  well said the banker at last if there is no cure for our poverty we might as well go on and enjoy ourselves  yes said our hostess with a sad little smile we might as well enjoy ourselves     xix   the talk at mrs stranges table took a far wider range than my meagre notes would intimate and we sat so long that it was almost eleven before the men joined the ladies in the drawingroom you will hardly conceive of remaining two three or four hours at dinner as one often does here in society out of society the meals are despatched with a rapidity unknown to the altrurians our habit of listening to lectors especially at the evening repast and then of reasoning upon what we have heard prolongs our stay at the board but the fondest listener the greatest talker among us would be impatient of the delay eked out here by the great number and the slow procession of the courses served yet the poorest american would find his ideal realized rather in the longdrawnout gluttony of the society dinner here than in our temperate simplicity  at such a dinner it is very hard to avoid a surfeit and i have to guard myself very carefully lest in the excitement of the talk i gorge myself with everything in its turn even at the best my overloaded stomach often joins with my conscience in reproaching me for what you would think a shameful excess at table yet wicked as my riot is my waste is worse and i have to think with contrition not only of what i have eaten but of what i have left uneaten in a city where so many wake and sleep in hunger  the ladies made a show of lingering after we joined them in the drawingroom but there were furtive glances at the clock and presently her guests began to bid mrs strange goodnight when i came up and offered her my hand she would not take it but murmured with a kind of passion dont go i mean it stay and tell us about altruriamy mother and me  i was by no means loath for i must confess that all i had seen and heard of this lady interested me in her more and more i felt at home with her too as with no other society woman i have met she seemed to me not only good but very sincere and very goodhearted in spite of the world she lived in yet i have met so many disappointments here of the kind that our civilization wholly fails to prepare us for that i should not have been surprised to find that mrs strange had wished me to stay not that she might hear me talk about altruria but that i might hear her talk about herself you must understand that the essential vice of a system which concentres a human beings thoughts upon his own interests from the first moment of responsibility colors and qualifies every motive with egotism all egotists are unconscious for otherwise they would be intolerable to themselves but some are subtler than others and as most women have finer natures than most men everywhere and in america most women have finer minds than most men their egotism usually takes the form of pose this is usually obvious but in some cases it is so delicately managed that you do not suspect it unless some other woman gives you a hint of it and even then you cannot be sure of it seeing the selfsacrifice almost to martyrdom which the poseuse makes for it if mrs makely had not suggested that some people attributed a pose to mrs strange i should certainly never have dreamed of looking for it and i should have been only intensely interested when she began as soon as i was left alone with her and her mother  you may not know how unusual i am in asking this favor of you mr homos but you might as well learn from me as from others that i am rather unusual in everything in fact you can report in altruria when you get home that you found at least one woman in america whom fortune had smiled upon in every way and who hated her smiling fortune almost as much as she hated herself im quite satisfied she went on with a sad mockery that fortune is a man and an american when he has given you all the materials for having a good time he believes that you must be happy because there is nothing to hinder it isnt that i want to be happy in the greedy way that men think we do for then i could easily be happy if you have a soul which is not above buttons buttons are enough but if you expect to be of real use to help on and to help out you will be disappointed i have not the faith that they say upholds you altrurians in trying to help out if i dont see my way out it seems to me that my reason has some right to satisfaction and that if i am a woman grown i cant be satisfied with the assurances they would give to little girlsthat everything is going on well any one can see that things are not going on well there is more and more wretchedness of every kind not hunger of body alone but hunger of soul if you escape one you suffer the other because if you have a soul you must long to help not for a time but for all time i suppose she asked abruptly that mrs makely has told you something about me  something i admitted  i ask she went on because i dont want to bore you with a statement of my case if you know it already ever since i heard you were in new york i have wished to see you and to talk with you about altruria i did not suppose that there would be any chance at mrs makelys and there wasnt and i did not suppose there would be any chance here unless i could take courage to do what i have done now you must excuse it if it seems as extraordinary a proceeding to you as it really is i wouldnt at all have you think it is usual for a lady to ask one of her guests to stay after the rest in order if you please to confess herself to him its a crime without a name  she laughed not gayly but humorously and then went on speaking always with a feverish eagerness which i find it hard to give you a sense of for the women here have an intensity quite beyond our experience of the sex at home  but you are a foreigner and you come from an order of things so utterly unlike ours that perhaps you will be able to condone my offence at any rate i have risked it she laughed again more gayly and recovered herself in a cheerfuller and easier mood well the long and the short of it is that i have come to the end of my tether i have tried as truly as i believe any woman ever did to do my share with money and with work to help make life better for those whose life is bad and though one mustnt boast of good works i may say that i have been pretty thorough and if ive given up its because i see in our state of things no hope of curing the evil its like trying to soak up the drops of a rainstorm you do dry up a drop here and there but the clouds are full of them and the first thing you know you stand with your blottingpaper in your hand in a puddle over your shoetops there is nothing but charity and charity is a failure except for the moment if you think of the misery around you that must remain around you for ever and ever as long as you live you have your choiceto go mad and be put into an asylum or go mad and devote yourself to society     xx  while mrs strange talked on her mother listened quietly with a dim submissive smile and her hands placidly crossed in her lap she now said it seems to be very different now from what it was in my time there are certainly a great many beggars and we used never to have one children grew up and people lived and died in large towns without ever seeing one i remember when my husband first took me abroad how astonished we were at the beggars now i meet as many in new york as i met in london or in rome but if you dont do charity what can you do christ enjoined it and paul says  oh people never do the charity that christ meant said mrs strange and as things are now how could they who would dream of dividing half her frocks and wraps with poor women or selling all and giving to the poor that is what makes it so hopeless we know that christ was perfectly right and that he was perfectly sincere in what he said to the good young millionaire but we all go away exceeding sorrowful just as the good young millionaire did we have to if we dont want to come on charity ourselves how do you manage about that she asked me and then she added but of course i forgot that you have no need of charity  oh yes we have i returned and i tried once more as i have tried so often with americans to explain how the heavenly need of giving the self continues with us but on terms that do not harrow the conscience of the giver as selfsacrifice always must here at its purest and noblest i sought to make her conceive of our nation as a family where every one was secured against want by the common provision and against the degrading and depraving inequality which comes from want the deadlevel of equality is what the americans call the condition in which all would be as the angels of god and they blasphemously deny that he ever meant his creatures to be alike happy because some through a long succession of unfair advantages have inherited more brain or brawn or beauty than others i found that this gross and impious notion of god darkened even the clear intelligence of a woman like mrs strange and indeed it prevails here so commonly that it is one of the first things advanced as an argument against the altrurianization of america  i believe i did at last succeed in showing her how charity still continues among us but in forms that bring neither a sense of inferiority to him who takes nor anxiety to him who gives i said that benevolence here often seemed to involve essentially some such risk as a man should run if he parted with a portion of the vital air which belonged to himself and his family in succoring a fellowbeing from suffocation but that with us where it was no more possible for one to deprive himself of his share of the common food shelter and clothing than of the air he breathed one could devote ones self utterly to others without that foul alloy of fear which i thought must basely qualify every good deed in plutocratic conditions  she said that she knew what i meant and that i was quite right in my conjecture as regarded men at least a man who did not stop to think what the effect upon himself and his own his giving must have would be a fool or a madman but women could often give as recklessly as they spent without any thought of consequences for they did not know how money came  women i said are exterior to your conditions and they can sacrifice themselves without wronging any one  or rather she continued without the sense of wronging any one our men like to keep us in that innocence or ignorance they think it is pretty or they think it is funny and as long as a girl is in her fathers house or a wife is in her husbands she knows no more of moneyearning or moneymaking than a child most grown women among us if they had a sum of money in the bank would not know how to get it out they would not know how to indorse a check much less draw one but there are plenty of women who are inside the conditions as much as men arepoor women who have to earn their bread and richwomen who have to manage their property i cant speak for the poor women but i can speak for the rich and i can confess for them that what you imagine is true the taint of unfaith and distrust is on every dollar that you dole out so that as far as the charity of the rich is concerned i would read shakespeare  it curseth him that gives and him that takes  perhaps that is why the rich give comparatively so little the poor can never understand how much the rich value their money how much the owner of a great fortune dreads to see it less if it were not so they would surely give more than they do for a man who has ten millions could give eight of them without feeling the loss the man with a hundred could give ninety and be no nearer want ah its a strange mystery my poor husband and i used to talk of it a great deal in the long year that he lay dying and i think i hate my superfluity the more because i know he hated it so much  a little trouble had stolen into her impassioned tones and there was a gleam as of tears in the eyes she dropped for a moment they were shining still when she lifted them again to mine  i suppose she said that mrs makely told you something of my marriage  eveleth her mother protested with a gentle murmur  oh i think i can be frank with mr homos he is not an american and he will understand or at least he will not misunderstand besides i dare say i shall not say anything worse than mrs makely has said already my husband was much older than i and i ought not to have married him a young girl ought never to marry an old man or even a man who is only a good many years her senior but we both faithfully tried to make the best of our mistake not the worst and i think this effort helped us to respect each other when there couldnt be any question of more he was a rich man and he had made his money out of nothing or at least from a beginning of utter poverty but in his last years he came to a sense of its worthlessness such as few men who have made their money ever have he was a common man in a great many ways he was imperfectly educated and he was ungrammatical and he never was at home in society but he had a tender heart and an honest nature and i revere his memory as no one would believe i could without knowing him as i did his money became a burden and a terror to him he did not know what to do with it and he was always morbidly afraid of doing harm with it he got to thinking that money was an evil in itself  that is what we think i ventured  yes i know but he had thought this out for himself and yet he had times when his thinking about it seemed to him a kind of craze and at any rate he distrusted himself so much that he died leaving it all to me i suppose he thought that perhaps i could learn how to give it without hurting and then he knew that in our state of things i must have some money to keep the wolf from the door and i am afraid to part with it too i have given and given but there seems some evil spell on the principal that guards it from encroachment so that it remains the same and if i do not watch the interest grows in the bank with that frightful life dead money seems endowed with as the hair of dead people grows in the grave  eveleth her mother murmured again  oh yes she answered i dare say my words are wild i dare say they only mean that i loathe my luxury from the bottom of my soul and long to be rid of it if i only could without harm to others and with safety to myself     xxi   it seemed to me that i became suddenly sensible of this luxury for the first time i had certainly been aware that i was in a large and stately house and that i had been served and banqueted with a princely pride and profusion but there had somehow been through all a sort of simplicity a sort of quiet so that i had not thought of the establishment and its operation even so much as i had thought of mrs makelys far inferior scale of living or else what with my going about so much in society i was ceasing to be so keenly observant of the material facts as i had been at first but i was better qualified to judge of what i saw and i had now a vivid sense of the costliness of mrs stranges environment there were thousands of dollars in the carpets underfoot there were tens of thousands in the pictures on the walls in a bronze group that withdrew itself into a certain niche with a faint reluctance there was the value of a skilled artisans wage for five years of hard work in the bindings of the books that showed from the library shelves there was almost as much money as most of the authors had got for writing them every fixture every movable was an artistic masterpiece a fortune as fortunes used to be counted even in this land of affluence had been lavished in the mere furnishing of a house which the palaces of nobles and princes of other times had contributed to embellish  my husband mrs strange went on bought this house for me and let me furnish it after my own fancy after it was all done we neither of us liked it and when he died i felt as if he had left me in a tomb here  eveleth said her mother you ought not to speak so before mr homos he will not know what to think of you and he will go back to altruria with a very wrong idea of american women  at this protest mrs strange seemed to recover herself a little yes she said you must excuse me i have no right to speak so but one is often much franker with foreigners than with ones own kind and besides there is somethingi dont know whatthat will not let me keep the truth from you  she gazed at me entreatingly and then as if some strong emotion swept her from her own hold she broke out  he thought he would make some sort of atonement to me as if i owed none to him his money was all he had to do it with and he spent that upon me in every way he could think of though he knew that money could not buy anything that was really good and that if it bought anything beautiful it uglified it with the sense of cost to every one who could value it in dollars and cents he was a good man far better than people ever imagined and very simplehearted and honest like a child in his contrition for his wealth which he did not dare to get rid of and though i know that if he were to come back it would be just as it was his memory is as dear to me as if  she stopped and pressed in her lip with her teeth to stay its tremor i was painfully affected i knew that she had never meant to be so open with me and was shocked and frightened at herself i was sorry for her and yet i was glad for it seemed to me that she had given me a glimpse not only of the truth in her own heart but of the truth in the hearts of a whole order of prosperous people in these lamentable conditions whom i shall hereafter be able to judge more leniently more justly  i began to speak of altruria as if that were what our talk had been leading up to and she showed herself more intelligently interested concerning us than any one i have yet seen in this country we appeared i found neither incredible nor preposterous to her our life in her eyes had that beauty of right living which the americans so feebly imagine or imagine not at all she asked what route i had come by to america and she seemed disappointed and aggrieved that we placed the restrictions we have felt necessary upon visitors from the plutocratic world were we afraid she asked that they would corrupt our citizens or mar our content with our institutions she seemed scarcely satisfied when i explained as i have explained so often here that the measures we had taken were rather in the interest of the plutocratic world than of the altrurians and alleged the fact that no visitor from the outside had ever been willing to go home again as sufficient proof that we had nothing to fear from the spread of plutocratic ideals among us i assured her and this she easily imagined that the better known these became the worse they appeared to us and that the only concern our priors felt in regard to them was that our youth could not conceive of them in their enormity but in seeing how estimable plutocratic people often were they would attribute to their conditions the inherent good of human nature i said our own life was so directly reasoned from its economic premises that they could hardly believe the plutocratic life was often an absolute non sequitur of the plutocratic premises i confessed that this error was at the bottom of my own wish to visit america and study those premises  and what has your conclusion been she said leaning eagerly towards me across the table between us laden with the maps and charts we had been examining for the verification of the position of altruria and my own course here by way of england  a slight sigh escaped mrs gray which i interpreted as an expression of fatigue it was already past twelve oclock and i made it the pretext for escape  you have seen the meaning and purport of altruria so clearly i said that i think i can safely leave you to guess the answer to that question  she laughed and did not try to detain me now when i offered my hand for goodnight i fancied her mother took leave of me coldly and with a certain effect of inculpation     xxii   it is long since i wrote you and you have had reason enough to be impatient of my silence i submit to the reproaches of your letter with a due sense of my blame whether i am altogether to blame you shall say after you have read this  i cannot yet decide whether i have lost a great happiness the greatest that could come to any man or escaped the worst misfortune that could befall me but such as it is i will try to set the fact honestly down  i do not know whether you had any conjecture from my repeated mention of a lady whose character greatly interested me that i was in the way of feeling any other interest in her than my letters expressed i am no longer young though at thirtyfive an altrurian is by no means so old as an american at the same age the romantic ideals of the american women which i had formed from the american novels had been dissipated if i had any sentiment towards them as a type it was one of distrust which my very sense of the charm in their inconsequence their beauty their brilliancy served rather to intensify i thought myself doubly defended by that difference between their civilization and ours which forbade reasonable hope of happiness in any sentiment for them tenderer than that of the student of strange effects in human nature but we have not yet my dear cyril reasoned the passions even in altruria  after i last wrote you a series of accidents or what appeared so threw me more and more constantly into the society of mrs strange we began to laugh at the fatality with which we met everywhereat teas at lunches at dinners at evening receptions and even at balls where i have been a great deal because with all my thirtyfive years i have not yet outlived that fondness for dancing which has so often amused you in me wherever my acquaintance widened among cultivated people they had no inspiration but to ask us to meet each other as if there were really no other woman in new york who could be expected to understand me you must come to lunch or tea or dinner whichever it might be and we will have her she will be so much interested to meet you  but perhaps we should have needed none of these accidents to bring us together i at least can look back and see that when none of them happened i sought occasions for seeing her and made excuses of our common interest in this matter and in that to go to her as for her i can only say that i seldom failed to find her at home whether i called upon her nominal day or not and more than once the man who let me in said he had been charged by mrs strange to say that if i called she was to be back very soon or else he made free to suggest that though mrs strange was not at home mrs gray was and then i found it easy to stay until mrs strange returned the good old lady had an insatiable curiosity about altruria and though i do not think she ever quite believed in our reality she at least always treated me kindly as if i were the victim of an illusion that was thoroughly benign  i think she had some notion that your letters which i used often to take with me and read to mrs strange and herself were inventions of mine and the fact that they bore only an english postmark confirmed her in this notion though i explained that in our present passive attitude towards the world outside we had as yet no postal relations with other countries and as all our communication at home was by electricity that we had no letterpost of our own the very fact that she belonged to a purer and better age in america disqualified her to conceive of altruria her daughter who had lived into a full recognition of the terrible anarchy in which the conditions have ultimated here could far more vitally imagine us and to her i believe we were at once a living reality her perception her sympathy her intelligence became more and more to me and i escaped to them oftener and oftener from a world where an altrurian must be so painfully at odds in all companies here i am aware that i have been regarded either as a good joke or a bad joke according to the humor of the listener and it was grateful to be taken seriously  from the first i was sensible of a charm in her different from that i felt in other american women and impossible in our altrurian women she had a deep and almost tragical seriousness masked with a most winning gayety a light irony a fine scorn that was rather for herself than for others she had thought herself out of all sympathy with her environment she knew its falsehood its vacuity its hopelessness but she necessarily remained in it and of it she was as much at odds in it as i was without my poor privilege of criticism and protest for as she said she could not set herself up as a censor of things that she must keep on doing as other people did she could have renounced the world as there are ways and means of doing here but she had no vocation to the religious life and she could not feign it without a sense of sacrilege in fact this generous and magnanimous and gifted woman was without that faith that trust in god which comes to us from living his law and which i wonder any american can keep she denied nothing but she had lost the strength to affirm anything she no longer tried to do good from her heart though she kept on doing charity in what she said was a mere mechanical impulse from the belief of other days but always with the ironical doubt that she was doing harm women are nothing by halves as men can be and she was in a despair which no man can realize for we have always some if or and which a woman of the like mood casts from her in wild rejection where she could not clearly see her way to a true life it was the same to her as an impenetrable darkness  you will have inferred something of all this from what i have written of her before and from words of hers that i have reported to you do you think it so wonderful then that in the joy i felt at the hope the solace which my story of our life seemed to give her she should become more and more precious to me it was not wonderful either i think that she should identify me with that hope that solace and should suffer herself to lean upon me in a reliance infinitely sweet and endearing but what a fantastic dream it now appears     xxiii   i can hardly tell you just how we came to own our love to each other but one day i found myself alone with her mother with the sense that eveleth had suddenly withdrawn from the room at the knowledge of my approach mrs gray was strongly moved by something but she governed herself and after giving me a tremulous hand bade me sit  will you excuse me mr homos she began if i ask you whether you intend to make america your home after this  oh no i answered and i tried to keep out of my voice the despair with which the notion filled me i have sometimes had nightmares here in which i thought that i was an american by choice and i can give you no conception of the rapture of awakening to the fact that i could still go back to altruria that i had not cast my lot with this wretched people how could i do that i faltered and i was glad to perceive that i had imparted to her no hint of the misery which i had felt at such a notion i mean by getting naturalized and becoming a citizen and taking up your residence among us  no i answered as quietly as i could i had not thought of that  and you still intend to go back to altruria  i hope so i ought to have gone back long ago and if i had not met the friends i have in this house i stopped for i did not know how i should end what i had begun to say  i am glad you think we are your friends said the lady for we have tried to show ourselves your friends i feel as if this had given me the right to say something to you that you may think very odd  say anything to me my dear lady i returned i shall not think it unkind no matter how odd it is  oh its nothing its merely thatthat when you are not here with us i lose my grasp on altruria andand i begin to doubt  i smiled i know people here have often hinted something of that kind to me tell me mrs gray do americans generally take me for an impostor  oh no she answered fervently everybody that i have heard speak of you has the highest regard for you and believes you perfectly sincere but  but what i entreated  they think you may be mistaken  then they think i am out of my witsthat i am in an hallucination  no not that she returned but it is so very difficult for us to conceive of a whole nation living as you say you do on the same terms as one family and no one trying to get ahead of another or richer and having neither inferiors nor superiors but just one dead level of equality where there is no distinction except by natural gifts and good deeds or beautiful works it seems impossibleit seems ridiculous  yes i confessed i know that it seems so to the americans  and i must tell you something else mr homos and i hope you wont take it amiss the first night when you talked about altruria here and showed us how you had come by way of england and the place where altruria ought to be on our maps i looked them over after you were gone and i could make nothing of it i have often looked at the map since but i could never find altruria it was no use  why i said if you will let me have your atlas  she shook her head it would be the same again as soon as you went away i could not conceal my distress and she went on now you mustnt mind what i say im nothing but a silly old woman and eveleth would never forgive me if she could know what ive been saying  then mrs strange isnt troubled as you are concerning me i asked and i confess my anxiety attenuated my voice almost to a whisper  she wont admit that she is it might be better for her if she would but eveleth is very true to her friends and thatthat makes me all the more anxious that she should not deceive herself  oh mrs gray i could not keep a certain tone of reproach out of my words  she began to weep there i knew i should hurt your feelings but you mustnt mind what i say i beg your pardon i take it all back  ah i dont want you to take it back but what proof shall i give you that there is such a land as altruria if the darkness implies the day america must imply altruria in what way do i seem false or mad except that i claim to be the citizen of a country where people love one another as the first christians did  that is just it she returned nobody can imagine the first christians and do you think we can imagine anything like them in our own day  but mrs strangeshe imagines us you say  she thinks she does but i am afraid she only thinks so and i know her better than you do mr homos i know how enthusiastic she always was and how unhappy she has been since she has lost her hold on faith and how eagerly she has caught at the hope you have given her of a higher life on earth than we live here if she should ever find out that she was wrong i dont know what would become of her you mustnt mind me you mustnt let me wound you by what i say  you dont wound me and i only thank you for what you say but i entreat you to believe in me mrs strange has not deceived herself and i have not deceived her shall i protest to you by all i hold sacred that i am really what i told you i was that i am not less and that altruria is infinitely more happier better gladder than any words of mine can say shall i not have the happiness to see your daughter today i had something to say to herand now i have so much more if she is in the house wont you send to her i can make her understand  i stopped at a certain expression which i fancied i saw in mrs grays face  mr homos she began so very seriously that my heart trembled with a vague misgiving sometimes i think you had better not see my daughter any more  not see her any more i gasped  yes i dont see what good can come of it and its all very strange and uncanny i dont know how to explain it but indeed it isnt anything personal its because you are of a state of things so utterly opposed to human nature that i dont see howi am afraid that  but i am not uncanny to her i entreated i am not unnatural not incredible  oh no that is the worst of it but i have said too much i have said a great deal more than i ought but you must excuse it i am an old woman i am not very well and i suppose its that that makes me talk so much  she rose from her chair and i perforce rose from mine and made a movement towards her  no no she said i dont need any help you must come again soon and see us and show that youve forgotten what ive said she gave me her hand and i could not help bending over it and kissing it she gave a little pathetic whimper oh i know ive said the most dreadful things to you  you havent said anything that takes your friendship from me mrs gray and that is what i care for my own eyes filled with tearsi do not know whyand i groped my way from the room without seeing any one in the obscurity of the hallway where i found myself i was aware of some one there by that sort of fine perception which makes us know the presence of a spirit  you are going a whisper said why are you going and eveleth had me by the hand and was drawing me gently into the dim drawingroom that opened from the place i dont know all my mother has been saying to you i had to let her say something she thought she ought i knew you would know how to excuse it  oh my dearest i said and why i said this i do not know or how we found ourselves in each others arms  what are we doing she murmured  you dont believe i am an impostor an illusion a visionary i besought her straining her closer to my heart  i believe in you with all my soul she answered  we sat down side by side and talked long i did not go away the whole day with a high disdain of convention she made me stay her mother sent word that she would not be able to come to dinner and we were alone together at table in an image of what our united lives might be we spent the evening in that happy interchange of trivial confidences that lovers use in symbol of the unutterable raptures that fill them we were there in what seemed an infinite present without a past without a future     xxiv   society had to be taken into our confidence and mrs makely saw to it that there were no reserves with society our engagement was not quite like that of two young persons but people found in our character and circumstance an interest far transcending that felt in the engagement of the most romantic lovers some note of the fact came to us by accident as one evening when we stood near a couple and heard them talking it must be very weird the man said something like being engaged to a materialization yes said the girl quite the demon lover business i should think she glanced round as people do in talking and at sight of us she involuntarily put her hand over her mouth i looked at eveleth there was nothing expressed in her face but a generous anxiety for me but so far as the open attitude of society towards us was concerned nothing could have been more flattering we could hardly have been more asked to meet each other than before but now there were entertainments in special recognition of our betrothal which eveleth said could not be altogether refused though she found the ordeal as irksome as i did in america however you get used to many things i do not know why it should have been done but in the society columns of several of the great newspapers our likenesses were printed from photographs procured i cannot guess how with descriptions of our persons as to those points of coloring and carriage and stature which the pictures could not give and with biographies such as could be ascertained in her case and imagined in mine in some of the society papers paragraphs of a surprising scurrility appeared attacking me as an impostor and aspersing the motives of eveleth in her former marriage and treating her as a foolish crank or an audacious flirt the goodness of her life her selfsacrifice and works of benevolence counted for no more against these wanton attacks than the absolute inoffensiveness of my own the writers knew no harm of her and they knew nothing at all of me but they devoted us to the execration of their readers simply because we formed apt and ready themes for paragraphs you may judge of how wild they were in their aim when some of them denounced me as an altrurian plutocrat  we could not escape this storm of notoriety we had simply to let it spend its fury when it began several reporters of both sexes came to interview me and questioned me not only as to all the facts of my past life and all my purposes in the future but as to my opinion of hypnotism eternal punishment the ibsen drama and the tariff reform i did my best to answer them seriously and certainly i answered them civilly but it seemed from what they printed that the answers i gave did not concern them for they gave others for me they appeared to me for the most part kindly and wellmeaning young people though vastly ignorant of vital things they had apparently visited me with minds made up or else their reports were revised by some controlling hand and a quality injected more in the taste of the special journals they represented than in keeping with the facts when i realized this i refused to see any more reporters or to answer them and then they printed the questions they had prepared to ask me in such form that my silence was made of the same damaging effect as a full confession of guilt upon the charges  the experience was so strange and new to me that it affected me in a degree i was unwilling to let eveleth imagine but she divined my distress and when she divined that it was chiefly for her she set herself to console and reassure me she told me that this was something every one here expected in coming willingly or unwillingly before the public and that i must not think of it at all for certainly no one else would think twice of it this i found was really so for when i ventured to refer tentatively to some of these publications i found that people if they had read them had altogether forgotten them and that they were with all the glare of print of far less effect with our acquaintance than something said under the breath in a corner i found that some of our friends had not known the effigies for ours which they had seen in the papers others made a joke of the whole affair as the americans do with so many affairs and said that they supposed the pictures were those of people who had been cured by some patent medicine they looked so strong and handsome this i think was a piece of mr makelys humor in the beginning but it had a general vogue long after the interviews and the illustrations were forgotten     xxv   i linger a little upon these trivial matters because i shrink from what must follow they were scarcely blots upon our happiness rather they were motes in the sunshine which had no other cloud it is true that i was always somewhat puzzled by a certain manner in mrs gray which certainly was from no unfriendliness for me she could not have been more affectionate to me after our engagement if i had been really her own son and it was not until after our common kindness had confirmed itself upon the new footing that i felt this perplexing qualification on it i felt it first one day when i found her alone and i talked long and freely to her of eveleth and opened to her my whole heart of joy in our love at one point she casually asked me how soon we should expect to return from altruria after our visit and at first i did not understand  of course she explained you will want to see all your old friends and so will eveleth for they will be her friends too but if you want me to go with you as you say you must let me know when i shall see new york again  why i said you will always be with us  well then she pursued with a smile when shall you come back  oh never i answered no one ever leaves altruria if he can help it unless he is sent on a mission  she looked a little mystified and i went on of course i was not officially authorized to visit the world outside but i was permitted to do so to satisfy a curiosity the priors thought useful but i have now had quite enough of it and i shall never leave home again  you wont come to live in america  god forbid said i and i am afraid i could not hide the horror that ran through me at the thought and when you once see our happy country you could no more be persuaded to return to america than a disembodied spirit could be persuaded to return to the earth  she was silent and i asked but surely you understood this mrs gray  no she said reluctantly does eveleth  why certainly i said we have talked it over a hundred times hasnt she  i dont know she returned with a vague trouble in her voice and eyes perhaps i havent understood her exactly perhapsbut i shall be ready to do whatever you and she think best i am an old woman you know and you know i was born here and i should feel the change  her words conveyed to me a delicate reproach i felt for the first time that in my love of my own country i had not considered her love of hers it is said that the icelanders are homesick when they leave their world of lava and snow and i ought to have remembered that an american might have some such tenderness for his atrocious conditions if he were exiled from them forever i suppose it was the large and wide mind of eveleth with its openness to a knowledge and appreciation of better things that had suffered me to forget this she seemed always so eager to see altruria she imagined it so fully so lovingly that i had ceased to think of her as an alien she seemed one of us by birth as well as by affinity  yet now the words of her mother and the light they threw upon the situation gave me pause i began to ask myself questions i was impatient to ask eveleth so that there should be no longer any shadow of misgiving in my breast and yet i found myself dreading to ask them lest by some perverse juggle i had mistaken our perfect sympathy for a perfect understanding     xxvi   like all cowards who wait a happy moment for the duty that should not be suffered to wait at all i was destined to have the affair challenge me instead of seizing the advantage of it that instant frankness would have given me shall i confess that i let several days go by and still had not spoken to eveleth when at the end of a long eveningthe last long evening we passed togethershe said  what would you like to have me do with this house while we are gone  do with this house i echoed and i felt as if i were standing on the edge of an abyss  yes shall we let it or sell itor what or give it away i drew a little breath at this perhaps we had not misunderstood each other after all she went on of course i have a peculiar feeling about it so that i wouldnt like to get it ready and let it furnished in the ordinary way i would rather lend it to some one if i could be sure of any one who would appreciate it but i cant not one and its very much the same when one comes to think about selling it yes i should like to give it away for some good purpose if there is any in this wretched state of things what do you say aristide  she always used the french form of my name because she said it sounded ridiculous in english for a white man though i told her that the english was nearer the greek in sound  by all means give it away i said give it for some public purpose that will at least be better than any private purpose and put it somehow in the control of the state beyond the reach of individuals or corporations why not make it the foundation of a free school for the study of the altrurian polity  she laughed at this as if she thought i must be joking it would be droll wouldnt it to have tammany appointees teaching altrurianism then she said after a moment of reflection why not it neednt be in the hands of tammany it could be in the hands of the united states i will ask my lawyer if it couldnt and i will endow it with money enough to support the school handsomely aristide you have hit it  i began you can give all your money to it my dear but i stopped at the bewildered look she turned on me  all she repeated but what should we have to live on then  we shall need no money to live on in altruria i answered  oh in altruria but when we come back to new york  it was an agonizing moment and i felt that shutting of the heart which blinds the eyes and makes the brain reel eveleth i gasped did you expect to return to new york  why certainly she cried not at once of course but after you had seen your friends and made a good long visitwhy surely aristide you dont understand that iyou didnt mean to live in altruria  ah i answered where else could i live did you think for an instant that i could live in such a land as this i saw that she was hurt and i hastened to say i know that it is the best part of the world outside of altruria but oh my dear you cannot imagine how horrible the notion of living here seems to me forgive me i am going from bad to worse i dont mean to wound you after all it is your country and you must love it but indeed i could not think of living here i could not take the burden of its wilful misery on my soul i must live in altruria and you when you have once seen my country our country will never consent to live in any other  yes she said i know it must be very beautiful but i hadnt supposedand yet i ought  no dearest no it was i who was to blame for not being clearer from the first but that is the way with us we cant imagine any people willing to live anywhere else when once they have seen altruria and i have told you so much of it and we have talked of it together so often that i must have forgotten you had not actually known it but listen eveleth we will agree to this after we have been a year in altruria if you wish to return to america i will come back and live with you here  no indeed she answered generously if you are to be my husband and here she began with the solemn words of the bible so beautiful in their quaint english whither thou goest i will go and i will not return from following after thee thy country shall be my country and thy god my god  i caught her to my heart in a rapture of tenderness and the evening that had begun for us so forbiddingly ended in a happiness such as not even our love had known before i insisted upon the conditions i had made as to our future home and she agreed to them gayly at last as a sort of reparation which i might make my conscience if i liked for tearing her from a country which she had willingly lived out of for the far greater part of the last five years  but when we met again i could see that she had been thinking seriously  i wont give the house absolutely away she said i will keep the deed of it myself but i will establish that sort of school of altrurian doctrine in it and i will endow it and when we come back here for our experimental sojourn after weve been in altruria a year well take up our quarters in iti wont give the whole house to the schooland we will lecture on the later phases of altrurian life to the pupils how will that do  she put her arms around my neck and i said that it would do admirably but i had a certain sinking of the heart for i saw how hard it was even for eveleth to part with her property  ill endow it she went on and ill leave the rest of my money at interest here unless you think that some altrurian securities  no there are no such things i cried  that was what i thought she returned and as it will cost us nothing while we are in altruria the interest will be something very handsome by the time we get back even in united states bonds  something handsome i cried but eveleth havent i heard you say yourself that the growth of interest from dead money was like  oh yes that she returned but you know you have to take it you cant let the money lie idle that would be ridiculous and then with the good purpose we have in view it is our duty to take the interest how should we keep up the school and pay the teachers and everything  i saw that she had forgotten the great sum of the principal or that through lifelong training and association it was so sacred to her that she did not even dream of touching it i was silent and she thought that i was persuaded  you are perfectly right in theory dear and i feel just as you do about such things im sure ive suffered enough from them but if we didnt take interest for your money what should we have to live on  not my money eveleth i entreated dont say my money  but whatever is mine is yours she returned with a wounded air  not your money but i hope you will soon have none we should need no money to live on in altruria our share of the daily work of all will amply suffice for our daily bread and shelter  in altruria yes but how about america and you have promised to come back here in a year you know ladies and gentlemen cant share in the daily toil here even if they could get the toil and where there are so many out of work it isnt probable they could  she dropped upon my knee as she spoke laughing and put her hand under my chin to lift my fallen face  now you mustnt be a goose aristide even if you are an angel now listen you know dont you that i hate money just as badly as you  you have made me think so eveleth i answered  i hate it and loathe it i think its the source of all the sin and misery in the world but you cant get rid of it at a blow for if you gave it away you might do more harm than good with it  you could destroy it i said  not unless you were a crank she returned and that brings me just to the point i know that im doing a very queer thing to get married when we know so little really about you and she accented this confession with a laugh that was also a kiss but i want to show people that we are just as practical as anybody and if they can know that i have left my money in united states bonds theyll respect us no matter what i do with the interest dont you see we can come back and preach and teach altrurianism and as long as we pay our way nobody will have a right to say a word why tolstoy himself doesnt destroy his money though he wants other people to do it his wife keeps it and supports the family you have to do it  he doesnt do it willingly  no and we wont and after a whileafter weve got back and compared altruria and america from practical experience if we decide to go and live there altogether i will let you do what you please with the hateful money i suppose we couldnt take it there with us  no more than you could take it to heaven with you i answered solemnly but she would not let me be altogether serious about it  well in either case we could get on without it though we certainly could not get on without it here why aristide it is essential to the influence we shall try to exert for altrurianism for if we came back here and preached the true life without any money to back us no one would pay any attention to us but if we have a good house waiting for us and are able to entertain nicely we can attract the best people andandreally do some good     xxvii   i rose in a distress which i could not hide oh eveleth eveleth i cried you are like all the rest poor child you are the creature of your environment as we all are you cannot escape what you have been it may be that i was wrong to wish or expect you to cast your lot with me in altruria at once and forever it may be that it is my duty to return here with you after a time not only to let you see that altruria is best but to end my days in this unhappy land preaching and teaching altrurianism but we must not come as prophets to the comfortable people and entertain nicely if we are to renew the evangel it must be in the life and the spirit of the first altrurian we must come poor to the poor we must not try to win any one save through his heart and conscience we must be as simple and humble as the least of those that christ bade follow him eveleth perhaps you have made a mistake i love you too much to wish you to suffer even for your good yes i am so weak as that i did not think that this would be the sacrifice for you that it seems and i will not ask it of you i am sorry that we have not understood each other as i supposed we had i could never become an american perhaps you could never become an altrurian think of it dearest think well of it before you take the step which you cannot recede from i hold you to no promise i love you so dearly that i cannot let you hold yourself but you must choose between me and your moneyno not mebut between love and your money you cannot keep both  she had stood listening to me now she cast herself on my heart and stopped my words with an impassioned kiss then there is no choice for me my choice is made once for all she set her hands against my breast and pushed me from her go now but come again tomorrow i want to think it all over again not that i have any doubt but because you wish ityou wish it dont youand because i will not let you ever think i acted upon an impulse and that i regretted it  that is right eveleth that is like you i said and i took her into my arms for goodnight  the next day i came for her decision or rather for her confirmation of it the man who opened the door to me met me with a look of concern and embarrassment he said mrs strange was not at all well and had told him he was to give me the letter he handed me i asked in taking it if i could see mrs gray and he answered that mrs gray had not been down yet but he would go and see i was impatient to read my letter and i made i know not what vague reply and i found myself i know not how on the pavement with the letter open in my hand it began abruptly without date or address  you will believe that i have not slept when you read this  i have thought it all over again as you wished and it is all over between us  i am what you said the creature of my environment i cannot detach myself from it i cannot escape from what i have been  i am writing this with a strange coldness like the chill of death in my very soul i do not ask you to forgive me i have your forgiveness already do not forget me that is what i ask remember me as the unhappy woman who was not equal to her chance when heaven was opened to her who could not choose the best when the best came to her  there is no use writing if i kept on forever it would always be the same cry of shame of love  eveleth strange  i reeled as i read the lines the street seemed to weave itself into a circle around me but i knew that i was not dreaming that this was no delirium of my sleep  it was three days ago and i have not tried to see her again i have written her a line to say that i shall not forget her and to take the blame upon myself i expected the impossible of her  i have yet two days before me until the steamer sails we were to have sailed together and now i shall sail alone  i will try to leave it all behind me forever but while i linger out these last long hours here i must think and i must doubt  was she then the poseuse that they said had she really no hear in our love was it only a pretty drama she was playing and were those generous motives those lofty principles which seemed to actuate her the poetical qualities of the play the graces of her pose i cannot believe it i believe that she was truly what she seemed for she had been that even before she met me i believe that she was pure and lofty in soul as she appeared but that her life was warped to such a form by the false conditions of this sad world that when she came to look at herself again after she had been confronted with the sacrifice before her she feared that she could not make it without in a manner ceasing to be  she  but i shall soon see you again and until then farewell  end of part i     part second     i   i could hardly have believed my dear dorothea that i should be so late in writing to you from altruria but you can easily believe that i am thoroughly ashamed of myself for my neglect it is not for want of thinking of you or talking of you that i have seemed so much more ungrateful than i am my husband and i seldom have any serious talk which doesnt somehow come round to you he admires you and likes you as much as i do and he does his best poor man to understand you but his not understanding you is only a part of his general failure to understand how any american can be kind and good in conditions which he considers so abominable as those of the capitalistic world he is not nearly so severe on us as he used to be at times when he was among us when the other altrurians are discussing us he often puts in a reason for us against their logic and i think he has really forgotten a good deal how bad things are with us or else finds his own memory of them incredible but his experience of the world outside his own country has taught him how to temper the passion of the altrurians for justice with a tolerance of the unjust and when they bring him to book on his own report of us he tries to explain us away and show how we are not so bad as we ought to be  for weeks after we came to altruria i was so unhistorically blest that if i had been disposed to give you a full account of myself i should have had no events to hang the narrative on life here is so subjective if you dont know what that is you poor dear you must get mr twelvemough to explain that there is usually nothing like news in it and i always feel that the difference between altruria and america is so immense that it is altogether beyond me to describe it but now we have had some occurrences recently quite in the american sense and these have furnished me with an incentive as well as opportunity to send you a letter do you remember how one evening after dinner in new york you and i besieged my husband and tried to make him tell us why altruria was so isolated from the rest of the world and why such a great and enlightened continent should keep itself apart i see still his look of horror when mr makely suggested that the united states should send an expedition and open altruria as commodore perry opened japan in 1850 and try to enter into commercial relations with it the best he could do was to say what always seemed so incredible and keep on assuring us that altruria wished for no sort of public relations with europe or america but was very willing to depend for an indefinite time for its communication with those regions on vessels putting into its ports from stress of one kind or other or castaway on its coasts they are mostly tradingships or whalers and they come a great deal oftener than you suppose you do not hear of them afterwards because their crews are poor ignorant people whose stories of their adventures are always distrusted and who know they would be laughed at if they told the stories they could of a country like altruria my husband himself took one of their vessels on her home voyage when he came to us catching the australasian steamer at new zealand and now i am writing you by the same sort of opportunity i shall have time enough to write you a longer letter than you will care to read the ship does not sail for a week yet because it is so hard to get her crew together  now that i have actually made a beginning my mind goes back so strongly to that terrible night when i came to you after aristides i always use the english form of his name now left new york that i seem to be living the tragedy over again and this happiness of mine here is like a dream which i cannot trust it was not all tragedy though and i remember how funny mr makely was trying to keep his face straight when the whole truth had to come out and i confessed that i had expected without really knowing it myself that aristides would disregard that wicked note i had written him and come and make me marry him not against my will but against my word of course i didnt put it in just that way but in a way to let you both guess it the first glimmering of hope that i had was when mr makely said then when a woman tells a man that all is over between them forever she means that she would like to discuss the business with him i was old enough to be ashamed but it seemed to me that you and i had gone back in that awful moment and were two girls together just as we used to be at school i was proud of the way you stood up for me because i thought that if you could tolerate me after what i had confessed i could not be quite a fool i knew that i deserved at least some pity and though i laughed with mr makely i was glad of your indignation with him and of your faith in aristides when it came to the question of what i should do i dont know which of you i owed the most to it was a kind of comfort to have mr makely acknowledge that though he regarded aristides as a myth still he believed that he was a thoroughly good myth and couldnt tell a lie if he wanted to and i loved you and shall love you more than any one else but him for saying that aristides was the most real man you had ever met and that if everything he said was untrue you would trust him to the end of the world  but dolly it wasnt all comedy any more than it was all tragedy and when you and i had laughed and cried ourselves to the point where there was nothing for me to do but to take the next boat for liverpool and mr makely had agreed to look after the tickets and cable aristides that i was coming there was still my poor dear mother to deal with there is no use trying to conceal from you that she was always opposed to my husband she thought there was something uncanny about him though she felt as we did that there was nothing uncanny in him but a man who pretended to come from a country where there was no riches and no poverty could not be trusted with any womans happiness and though she could not help loving him she thought i ought to tear him out of my heart and if i could not do that i ought to have myself shut up in an asylum we had a dreadful time when i told her what i had decided to do and i was almost frantic at last when she saw that i was determined to follow him she yielded not because she was convinced but because she could not give me up i wouldnt have let her if she could i believe that the only thing which reconciled her was that you and mr makely believed in him and thought i had better do what i wanted to if nothing could keep me from it i shall never never forget mr makelys goodness in coming to talk with her and how skillfully he managed without committing himself to altruria to declare his faith in my altrurian even then she was troubled about what she thought the indelicacy of my behavior in following him across the sea and she had all sorts of doubts as to how he would receive me when we met in liverpool it wasnt very reasonable of me to say that if he cast me off i should still love him more than any other human being and his censure would be more precious to me than the praise of the rest of the world  i suppose i hardly knew what i was saying but when once i had yielded to my love for him there was nothing else in life i could not have left my mother behind but in her opposition to me she seemed like an enemy and i should somehow have forced her to go if she had not yielded when she did yield she yielded with her whole heart and soul and so far from hindering me in my preparations for the voyage i do not believe i could have got off without her she thought about everything and it was her idea to leave my business affairs entirely in mr makelys hands and to trust the future for the final disposition of my property i did not care for it myself i hated it because it was that which had stood between me and aristides but she foresaw that if by any wild impossibility he should reject me when we met i should need it for the life i must go back to in new york she behaved like a martyr as well as a heroine for till we reached altruria she was a continual sacrifice to me she stubbornly doubted the whole affair but now i must do her the justice to say that she has been convinced by the fact the best she can say of it is that it is like the world of her girlhood and she has gone back to the simple life here from the artificial life in new york with the joy of a child she works the whole day and she would play if she had ever learned how she is a better altrurian than i am if there could be a bigoted altrurian my mother would be one     ii   i sent you a short letter from liverpool saying that by the unprecedented delays of the urania which i had taken because it was the swiftest boat of the neptune line we had failed to pass the old tenday singlescrew galaxy liner which aristides had sailed in i had only time for a word to you but a million words could not have told the agonies i suffered and when i overtook him on board the orient pacific steamer at plymouth where she touched i could just scribble off the cable sent mr makely before our steamer put off again i am afraid you did not find my cable very expressive but i was glad that i did not try to say more for if i had tried i should simply have gibbered at a shilling a gibber i expected to make amends by a whole volume of letters and i did post a dozen under one cover from colombo if they never reached you i am very sorry for now it is impossible to take up the threads of that time and weave them into any sort of connected pattern you will have to let me off with saying that aristides was everything that i believed he would be and was never really afraid he might not be from the moment we caught sight of each other at plymouth he at the rail of the steamer and i on the deck of the tender we were as completely one as we are now i never could tell how i got aboard to him whether he came down and brought me or whether i was simply rapt through the air to his side it would have been embarrassing if we had not treated the situation frankly but such odd things happen among the english going out to their different colonies that our marriage by a missionary returning to his station was not even a nine days wonder with our fellowpassengers  we were a good deal more than nine days on the steamer before we could get a vessel that would take us on to altruria but we overhauled a ship going there for provisions at last and we were all put off on her bag and baggage with three cheers from the friends we were leaving i think they thought we were going to some of the british islands that the pacific is full of i had been thankful from the first that i had not brought a maid knowing the altrurian prejudice against hireling service but i never was so glad as i was when we got aboard that vessel for when the captains wife who was with him found that i had no one to look after me she looked after me herself just for the fun of it she said but i knew it was the love of it it was a sort of general tradingship stopping at the different islands in the south seas and had been a year out from home where the kind woman had left her little ones she cried over their photographs to me her husband had been in altruria before and he and aristides were old acquaintances and met like brothers some of the crew knew him too and the captain relaxed discipline so far as to let us shake hands with the secondmate as the mens representative  i neednt dwell on the incidents of our homecomingfor that was what it seemed for my mother and me as well as for my husbandbut i must give you one detail of our reception for i still think it almost the prettiest thing that has happened to us among the millions of pretty things aristides had written home of our engagement and he was expected with his american wife and before we came to anchor the captain ran up the emissarys signal which my husband gave him and then three boats left the shore and pulled rapidly out to us as they came nearer i saw the first altrurian costumes in the lovely colors that the people wear here and that make a group of them look like a flowerbed and then i saw that the boats were banked with flowers along the gunwales from stem to stern and that they were each not manned but girled by six rowers who pulled as true a stroke as i ever saw in our boatraces when they caught sight of us leaning over the side and aristides lifted his hat and waved it to them they all stood their oars upright and burst into a kind of welcome song i had been dreading one of those stupid banging salutes of ten or twenty guns and you can imagine what a relief it was they were great splendid creatures as tall as our millionaires tallest daughters and as stronglooking as any of our collegegirl athletes and when we got down over the ships side and aristides said a few words of introduction for my mother and me as we stepped into the largest of the boats i thought they would crush me catching me in their strong brown arms and kissing me on each cheek they never kiss on the mouth in altruria the girls in the other boats kissed their hands to mother and me and shouted to aristides and then when our boat set out for the shore they got on each side of us and sang song after song as they pulled even stroke with our crew halfway we met three other boats really manned these ones and going out to get our baggage and then you ought to have heard the shouting and laughing that ended in more singing when the young fellows voices mixed with the girls till they were lost in the welcome that came off to us from the crowded quay where i should have thought half altruria had gathered to receive us  i was afraid it was going to be too much for my mother but she stood it bravely and almost at a glance people began to take her into consideration and she was delivered over to two young married ladies who saw that she was made comfortable the first of any in the pretty regionic guesthouse where they put us  i wish i could give you a notion of that guesthouse with its cool quiet rooms and its lawned and gardened enclosure and a little fountain purring away among the flowers but what astonished me was that there were no sort of carriages or wheeled conveyances which after our escort from the ship i thought might very well have met the returning emissary and his wife they made my mother get into a litter with soft cushions and with lilac curtains blowing round it and six girls carried her up to the house but they seemed not to imagine my not walking and in fact i could hardly have imagined it myself after the first moment of queerness that walk was full of such rich experience for every one of the senses that i would not have missed a step of it but as soon as i could get aristides alone i asked him about horses and he said that though horses were still used in farm work not a horse was allowed in any city or village of altruria because of their filthiness as for public vehicles they used to have electric trolleys in the year that he had been absent they had substituted electric motors but these were not running because it was a holiday on which we had happened to arrive  there was another incident of my first day which i think will amuse you knowing how i have always shrunk from any sort of public appearances when aristides went to make his report to the people assembled in a sort of convention i had to go too and take part in the proceedings for women are on an entire equality with the men here and people would be shocked if husband and wife were separated in their public life they did not spare me a single thing where aristides was not very clear or rather not full enough in describing america i was called on to supplement and i had to make several speeches of course as i spoke in english he had to put it into altrurian for me and it made the greatest excitement the altrurians are very lively people and as full of the desire to hear some new things as paul said the men of athens were at times they were in a perfect gale of laughter at what we told them about america afterwards some of the women confessed to me that they liked to hear us speaking english together it sounded like the whistling of birds or the shrilling of locusts but they were perfectly kind and though they laughed it was clear that they laughed at what we were saying and never at us or at least never at me  of course there was the greatest curiosity to know what aristides wife looked like as well as sounded like he had written out about our engagement before i broke it and my clothes were of as much interest as myself or more you know how i had purposely left my latest paris things behind so as to come as simply as possible to the simple life of altruria but still with my big legofmutton sleeves and my picturehat and my pinched waist i felt perfectly grotesque and i have no doubt i looked it they had never seen a lady from the capitalistic world before but only now and then a whalingcaptains wife who had come ashore and i knew they were burning to examine my smart clothes down to the last button and bit of braid i had on the short skirts of last year and i could feel ten thousand eyes fastened on my highheeled boots which you know i never went to extremes in i confess my face burned a little to realize what a scarecrow i must look when i glanced round at those altrurian women whose pretty classic fashions made the whole place like a field of lilacs and irises and knew that they were as comfortable as they were beautiful do you remember some of the descriptions of the undergraduate maidens in the princessi know you had it at schoolwhere they are sitting in the palace halls together the effect was something like that  you may be sure that i got out of my things as soon as i could borrow an altrurian costume and now my paris confections are already hung up for monuments as richard iii says in the capitalistic museum where people from the outlying regions may come and study them as objectlessons in what not to wear you remember what you said aristides told you when he spoke that day at the mountains about the regions that altruria is divided into this is the maritime region and the city where we are living for the present is the capital you may think this was rather hard on me and at first it did seem pretty intimate having my things in a long glass case and it gave me a shock to see them as if it had been my ghost whenever i passed them but the fact is i was more ashamed than hurtthey were so ugly and stupid and useless i could have borne my paris dress and my picturehat if it had not been for those ridiculous highheeled pointedtoe shoes which the curatress had stood at the bottom of the skirts they looked the most frantic things you can imagine and the mere sight of them made my poor feet ache in the beautiful sandals i am wearing now when once you have put on sandals you say goodbye and goodriddance to shoes in a single month my feet have grown almost a tenth as large again as they were and my friends here encourage me to believe that they will yet measure nearly the classic size though as you know i am not in my first youth and cant expect them to do miracles                                       i had to leave off abruptly at the last page because aristides had come in with a piece of news that took my mind off everything else i am afraid you are not going to get this letter even at the late date i had set for its reaching you my dear it seems that there has been a sort of mutiny among the crew of our trader which was to sail next week and now there is no telling when she will sail ever since she came the men have been allowed their liberty as they call it by watches but the last watch came ashore this week before another watch had returned to the ship and now not one of the sailors will go back they had been exploring the country by turns at their leisure it seems and their excuse is that they like altruria better than america which they say they wish never to see again  you know though i didnt till aristides explained to me that in any european country the captain in such a case would go to his consul and the consul would go to the police and the police would run the men down and send them back to the ship in irons as deserters or put them in jail till the captain was ready to sail and then deliver them up to him but it seems that there is no law in altruria to do anything of the kind the only law here that would touch the case is one which obliges any citizen to appear and answer the complaint of any other citizen before the justiciary assembly a citizen cannot be imprisoned for anything but the rarest offence like killing a person in a fit of passion and as to seizing upon men who are guilty of nothing worse than wanting to be left to the pursuit of happiness as all the altrurians are there is no statute and no usage for it aristides says that the only thing which can be done is to ask the captain and the men to come to the assembly and each state his case the altrurians are not anxious to have the men stay not merely because they are coarse rude or vicious but because they think they ought to go home and tell the americans what they have seen and heard here and try and get them to found an altrurian commonwealth of their own still they will not compel them to go and the magistrates do not wish to rouse any sort of sentiment against them they feel that the men are standing on their natural rights which they could not abdicate if they would i know this will appear perfectly ridiculous to mr makely and i confess myself that there seems something binding in a contract which ought to act on the mens consciences at least     iii   well my dear dorothea the hearing before the assembly is over and it has left us just where it found us as far as the departure of our trader is concerned  how i wish you could have been there the hearing lasted three days and i would not have missed a minute of it as it was i did not miss a syllable and it was so deeply printed on my mind that i believe i could repeat it word for word if i had to but in the first place i must try and realize the scene to you i was once summoned as a witness in one of our courts you remember and i have never forgotten the horror of it the hot dirty room with its foul air the brutal spectators the policemen stationed among them to keep them in order the lawyers with the plaintiff and defendant seated all at one table the uncouth abruptness of the clerks and janitors or whatever the undignified magistrate who looked as if his lunch had made him drowsy and who seemed half asleep as he slouched in his armchair behind his desk instead of such a setting as this you must imagine a vast marble amphitheatre larger than the metropolitan opera by three or four times all the gradines overflowing that is the word for the liquefaction of the clothes which poured over them and looking like those bermudan waters where the colors of the rainbow seem dropped around the coast on the platform or stage sat the presidents of the assembly and on a tier of seats behind and above them the national magistrates who as this is the capital of the republic for the time being had decided to be present at the hearing because they thought the case so very important in the hollow space just below like that where you remember the chorus stood in that greek play which we saw at harvard ages ago were the captain and the firstmate on one hand and the seamen on the other the secondmate our particular friend was not there because he never goes ashore anywhere and had chosen to remain with the black cook in charge of the ship the captains wife would rather have stayed with them but i persuaded her to come to us for the days of the hearing because the captain had somehow thought we were opposed to him and because i thought she ought to be there to encourage him by her presence she sat next to me in a hat which i wish you could have seen dolly and a dress which would have set your teeth on edge but inside of them i knew she was one of the best souls in the world and i loved her the more for being the sight she was among those wonderful altrurian women  the weather was perfect as it nearly always is at this time of yearwarm yet fresh with a sky of that bleu impossible of the riviera on the clearest day some people had parasols but they put them down as soon as the hearing began and everybody could see perfectly you would have thought they could not hear so well but a sort of immense soundingplane was curved behind the stage so that not a word of the testimony on either side was lost to me in english the altrurian translation was given the second day of the hearing through a megaphone as different in tone from the thing that the man in the grand central station bellows the trains through as the voxhumana stop of an organ is different from the foghorn of a lighthouse the captains wife was bashful in her odd american dress but we had got seats near the tribune rather out of sight and there was nothing to hinder our hearing like the froufrou of stiff silks or starched skirts which i am afraid we poor things in america like to make when we move from the soft filmy tissues that the altrurian women wear but i must confess that there was a good deal of whispering while the captain and the men were telling their stories but no one except the interpreters who were taking their testimony down in shorthand to be translated into altrurian and read at the subsequent hearing could understand what they were saying and so nobody was disturbed by the murmurs the whispering was mostly near me where i sat with the captains wife for everybody i knew got as close as they could and studied my face when they thought anything important or significant had been said they are very quick at reading faces here in fact a great deal of the conversation is carried on in that way or with the visible speech and my altrurian friends knew almost as well as i did when the speakers came to an interesting point it was rather embarrassing for me though with the poor captains wife at my side to tell them in my broken altrurian what the men were accusing the captain of  i talk of the men but it was really only one of them who at first by their common consent spoke for the rest he was a middleaged yankee and almost the only born american among them for you know that our sailors nowadays are of every nationality under the sunportuguese norwegians greeks italians kanucks and kanakas and even cape cod indians he said he guessed his story was the story of most sailors and he had followed the sea his whole life his story was dreadful and i tried to persuade the captains wife not to come to the hearing the next day when it was to be read in altrurian but she would come i was afraid she would be overwhelmed by the public compassion and would not know what to do for when something awful that the sailor had said against the captain was translated the women all about us cooed their sympathy with her and pressed her hand if they could or patted her on the shoulder to show how much they pitied her in altruria they pity the friends of those who have done wrong and sometimes even the wrongdoers themselves and it is quite a luxury for there is so little wrongdoing here i tell them that in america they would have as much pitying to do as they could possibly ask after the hearing that day my friends who were of a good many different refectories as we call them here wanted her to go and lunch with them but i got her quietly home with me and after she had had something to eat i made her lie down awhile  you wont care to have me go fully into the affair the sailors spokesman told how he had been born on a farm where he had shared the family drudgery and poverty till he grew old enough to run away he meant to go to sea but he went first to a factory town and worked three or four years in the mills he never went back to the farm but he sent a little money now and then to his mother and he stayed on till he got into trouble he did not say just what kind of trouble but i fancied it was some sort of lovetrouble he blamed himself for it and when he left that town to get away from the thought of it as much as anything and went to work in another town he took to drink then once in a drunken spree he found himself in new york without knowing how but it was in what he called a sailors boardinghouse and one morning after he had been drinking overnight with a very pleasant gentleman he found himself in the forecastle of a ship bound for holland and when the mate came and cursed him up and cursed him out he found himself in the foretop i give it partly in his own language because i cannot help it and i only wish i could give it wholly in his language it was so graphic and so full of queer yankee humor from that time on he said he had followed the sea and at sea he was always a good temperance man but altruria was the only place he had ever kept sober ashore he guessed that was partly because there was nothing to drink but unfermented grapejuice and partly because there was nobody to drink with anyhow he had not had a drop here everywhere else as soon as he left his ship he made for a sailors boardinghouse and then he did not know much till he found himself aboard ship and bound for somewhere that he did not know of he was always he said a stolen man as much as a negro captured on the west coast of africa and sold to a slaver and he said it was a slaves life he led between drinks whether it was a long time or short he said he would ask his mates if it was very different with them and when he turned to them they all shouted back in their various kinds of foreign accents no it was just the same with them every one then he said that was how he came to ship on our captains vessel and though they could not all say the same they nodded confirmation as far as he was concerned  the captain looked sheepish enough at this but he looked sorrowful too as if he could have wished it had been different and he asked the man if he had been abused since he came on board well the man said not unless you called tainted salthorse and weevilly biscuit abuse and then the captain sat down again and i could feel his poor wife shrinking beside me the man said that he was comparatively well off on the captains ship and the life was not half such a dogs life as he had led on other vessels but it was such that when he got ashore here in altruria and saw how white people lived people that used each other white he made up his mind that he would never go hack to any ship alive he hated a ship so much that if he could go home to america as a firstclass passenger on a cunard liner john d rockefeller would not have money enough to hire him to do it he was going to stay in altruria till he died if they would let him and he guessed they would if what he had heard about them was true he just wanted he said while we were about it to have a few of his mates tell their experience not so much on board the little sally but on shore and since they could remember and one after another did get up and tell their miserable stories they were like the stories you sometimes read in your paper over your coffee or that you can hear any time you go into the congested districts in new york but i assure you my dear they seemed to me perfectly incredible here though i had known hundreds of such stories at home as i realized their facts i forgot where i was i felt that i was back again in that horror where it sometimes seemed to me i had no right to be fed or clothed or warm or clean in the midst of the hunger and cold and nakedness and dirt and where i could only reconcile myself to my comfort because i knew my discomfort would not help others misery  i can hardly tell how but even the first day a sense of something terrible spread through that multitude of people to whom the words themselves were mere empty sounds the captain sat through it with his head drooping till his face was out of sight and the tears ran silently down his wifes cheeks and the women round me were somehow awed into silence when the men ended and there seemed to be no one else to say anything on that side the captain jumped to his feet with a sort of ferocious energy and shouted out are you all through men and their spokesman answered ay ay sir and then the captain flung back his grizzled hair and shook his fist towards the sailors and do you think i wanted to do it do you think i liked to do it do you think that if i hadnt been afraid my whole life long i would have had the heart to lead you the dogs life i know ive led you ive been as poor as the poorest of you and as low down as the lowest i was born in the town poorhouse and ive been so afraid of the poorhouse all my days that i haint had as you may say a minutes peace ask my wife there what sort of a man i am and whether im the man really the man thats been hard and mean to you the way i know i been it was because i was afraid and because a coward is always hard and mean i been afraid ever since i could remember anything of coming to want and i was willing to see other men suffer so i could make sure that me and mine shouldnt suffer thats the way we do at home aint it thats in the days work aint it thats playing the game aint it for everybody you cant say it aint he stopped and the mens spokesman called back ay ay sir as he had done before and as i had often heard the men do when given an order on the ship  the captain gave a kind of sobbing laugh and went on in a lower tone well i know you aint going back i guess i didnt expect it much from the start and i guess im not surprised then he lifted his head and shouted and do you suppose i want to go back dont you suppose i would like to spend the rest of my days too among white people people that use each other white as you say and where there aint any want or whats worse fear of want men there aint a day or an hour or a minute when i dont think how awful it is over there where i got to be either some mans slave or some mans master as much so as if it was down in the ships articles my wife aint so because she aint been ashore here i wouldnt let her i was afraid to let her see what a white mans country really was because i felt so weak about it myself and i didnt want to put the trial on her too and do you know why were going back or want to go i guess some of you know but i want to tell these folks here so theyll understand and i want you mr homos he called to my husband to get it down straight its because weve got two little children over there that we left with their grandmother when my wife come with me this voyage because she had lung difficulty and wanted to see whether she could get her health back nothing else on gods green earth could take me back to america and i guess it couldnt my wife if she knew what altruria was as well as i do but when i went around here and saw how everything was and remembered how it was at home i just said shell stay on the ship now thats all i got to say though i thought i had a lot more i guess itll be enough for these folks and they can judge between us then the captain sat down and to make a long story short the facts of the hearing were repeated in altrurian the next day by megaphone and when the translation was finished there was a general rush for the captain he plainly expected to be lynched and his wife screamed out oh dont hurt him he isnt a bad man but it was only the altrurian way with a guilty person they wanted to let him know how sorry they were for him and since his sin had found him out how hopeful they were for his redemption i had to explain it to the sailors as well as to the captain and his wife but i dont believe any of them quite accepted the fact  the third day of the hearing was for the rendering of the decision first in altrurian and then in english the verdict of the magistrates had to he confirmed by a standing vote of the people and of course the women voted as well as the men the decision was that the sailors should be absolutely free to go or stay but they took into account the fact that it would be cruel to keep the captain and his wife away from their little ones and the sailors might wish to consider this if they still remained true to their love of altruria they could find some means of returning  when the translator came to this point their spokesman jumped to his feet and called out to the captain will you do it do what he asked getting slowly to his own feet come back with us after you have seen the kids the captain shook his fist at the sailors it seemed to be the only gesture he had with them give me the chance all i want is to see the children and bring them out with me to altruria and the old folks with them will you swear it will you say i hope i may find the kids dead and buried when i get home if i dont do it ill take that oath or any oath you want me to shake hands on it then  the two men met in front of the tribunal and clasped hands there and their reconciliation did not need translation such a roar of cheers went up and then the whole assembly burst out in the national altrurian anthem brothers all i wish you could have heard it but when the terms of the agreement were explained the cheering that had gone before was a mere whisper to what followed one orator after another rose and praised the selfsacrifice of the sailors i was the proudest when the last of them referred to aristides and the reports which he had sent home from america and said that without some such study as he had made of the american character they never could have understood such an act as they were now witnessing illogical and insensate as their system was their character sometimes had a beauty a sublimity which was not possible to altrurians even for it was performed in the face of risks and chances which their happy conditions relieved them from at the same time the orator wished his hearers to consider the essential immorality of the act he said that civilized men had no right to take these risks and chances the sailors were perhaps justified in so far as they were homeless wifeless and childless men but it must not be forgotten that their heroism was like the reckless generosity of savages  the men have gone back to the ship and she sails this afternoon i have persuaded the captain to let his wife stay to lunch with me at our refectory where the ladies wish to bid her goodbye and i am hurrying forward this letter so that she can take it on board with her this afternoon she has promised to post it on the first pacific steamer they meet or if they do not meet any to send it forward to you with a specialdelivery stamp as soon as they reach boston she will also forward by express an altrurian costume such as i am now wearing sandals and all do put it on dolly dear for my sake and realize what it is for once in your life to be a free woman  heaven knows when i shall have another chance of getting letters to you but i shall live in hopes and i shall set down my experiences here for your benefit not perhaps as i meet them but as i think of them and you must not mind having a rather cluttered narrative tomorrow we are setting off on our round of the capitals where aristides is to make a sort of public report to the people of the different regions on the working of the capitalistic conditions as he observed them among us but i dont expect to send you a continuous narrative of our adventures goodbye dearest with my mothers love and my husbands as well as my own to both of you think of me as needing nothing but a glimpse of you to complete my happiness how i should like to tell you fully about it you must come to altruria  i came near letting this go without telling you of one curious incident of the affair between the captain and his men before the men returned to the ship they came with their spokesman to say goodbye to aristides and me and he remarked casually that it was just as well maybe to be going back because for one thing they would know then whether it was real or not i asked him what he meant and he said well you know some of the mates think its a dream here or its too good to be true as far forth as i go id be willing to have it a dream that i didnt ever have to wake up from it aint any too good to be true for me anyway im going to get back somehow and give it another chance to be a fact wasnt that charming it had a real touch of poetry in it but it was prose that followed i couldnt help asking him whether there had been nothing to mar the pleasure of their stay in altruria and he answered well i dont know as you could rightly say mar it hadnt ought to have you see it was like this you see some of the mates wanted to lay off and have a regular bange but that dont seem to be the idea here after we had been ashore a day or two they set us to work at different jobs or wanted to the mates didnt take hold very lively and some of em didnt take hold a bit but after that went on a couple of days there want any breakfast one morning and come noontime there want any dinner and as far forth as they could make out they had to go to bed without supper then they called a halt and tackled one of your head men here that could speak some english he didnt answer them right off the reel but he got out his english testament and he read em a verse that said for even when we were with you this we commanded you that if any one would not work neither should he eat that kind of fetched em and after that there want any sojerin well not to speak of they saw he meant business i guess it did more than any one thing to make em think they want dreamin     iv   you must not think dolly from anything i have been telling you that the altrurians are ever harsh sometimes they cannot realize how things really are with us and how what seems grotesque and hideous to them seems charming and beautiful or at least chic to us but they are wonderfully quick to see when they have hurt you the least and in the little sacrifices i have made of my wardrobe to the cause of general knowledge there has not been the least urgence from them when i now look at the things i used to wear where they have been finally placed in the ethnological department of the museum along with the esquiman kyaks and the thlinkeet totems they seem like things i wore in some prehistoric age  when wild in woods the noble savage ran  now am i being unkind well you mustnt mind me dolly you must just say she has got it bad and go on and learn as much about altruria as you can from me some of the things were hard to get used to and at first seemed quite impossible for one thing there was the matter of service which is dishonorable with us and honorable with the altrurians i was a long time getting to understand that though i knew it perfectly well from hearing my husband talk about it in new york i believe he once came pretty near offending you by asking why you did not do your own work or something like that he has confessed as much and i could not wonder at you in your conditions why when we first went to the guesthouse and the pretty young girls who brought in lunch sat down at table to eat it with us i felt the indignation making me hot all over you know how democratic i am and i did not mind those great splendid boatgirls hugging and kissing me but i instinctively drew the line at cooks and waitresses in new york you know i always tried to be kind to my servants but as for letting one of them sit down in my presence much less sit down at table with me i never dreamed of such a thing in my most democratic moments luckily i drew the line subjectively here and later i found that these young ladies were daughters of some of the most distinguished men and women on the continent though you must not understand distinction as giving any sort of social primacy that sort of thing is not allowed in altruria they had drawn lots with the girls in the regionic school here and were proud of having won the honor of waiting on us of course i neednt say they were what we would have felt to be ladies anywhere and their manners were exquisite even to leaving us alone together as soon as we had finished luncheon the meal itself was something i shall always remember for its delicious cooking of the different kinds of mushrooms which took the place of meat and the wonderful salads and the temperate and tropical fruits which we had for dessert  they had to talk mostly with my husband of course and when they did talk to me it was through him they were very intelligent about our world much more than we are about altruria though of course it was by deduction from premises rather than specific information and they wanted to ask a thousand questions but they saw the joke of it and laughed with us when aristides put them off with a promise that if they would have a public meeting appointed we would appear and answer all the questions anybody could think of we were not going to waste our answers on them the first day he wanted them to let us go out and help wash the dishes but they would not hear of it i confess i was rather glad of that for it seemed a lower depth to which i could not descend even after eating with them but they invited us out to look at the kitchen after they had got it in order a little and when we joined them there whom should i see but my own dear old mother with an apron up to her chin wiping the glass and watching carefully through her dear old spectacles that she got everything bright you know she was of a simpler day than ours and when she was young she used to do her own work and she and my father always washed the dishes together after they had company i merely said well mother and she laughed and colored and said she guessed she should like it in altruria for it took her back to the america she used to know  i must mention things as they come into my head and not in any regular order there are too many of them one thing is that i did not notice till afterwards that we had had no meat that first day at luncheonthe mushrooms were so delicious and you know i never was much of a meateater it was not till we began to make our present tour of the regionic capitals where aristides has had to repeat his account of american civilization until i am sick as well as ashamed of america that i first felt a kind of famine which i kept myself from recognizing as long as i could then i had to own to myself long before i owned it to him that i was hungry for meatfor roast for broiled for fried for hashed i did not actually tell him but he found it out and i could not deny it though i felt such an ogre in it he was terribly grieved and blamed himself for not having thought of it and wished he had got some canned meats from the trader before she left the port he was really in despair for nobody since the old capitalistic times had thought of killing sheep or cattle for food they have them for wool and milk and butter and of course when i looked at them in the fields it did seem rather formidable you are so used to seeing them in the butchers shops ready for the range that you never think of what they have to go through before that but at last i managed to gasp out one day if i could only have a chicken and he seemed to think that it could be managed i dont know how he made interest with the authorities or how the authorities prevailed on a farmer to part with one of his precious pullets but the thing was done somehow and two of the farmers children brought it to us at one of the guesthouses where we were staying and then fled howling that was bad enough but what followed was worse i went another day on mushrooms before i had the heart to say chicken again and suggest that aristides should get it killed and dressed the poor fellow did try i believe but we had to fall back upon ourselves for the murderous deed anddid you ever see a chicken have its head cut off and how hideously it behaves it made us both wish we were dead and the sacrifice of that one pullet was quite enough for me we buried the poor thing under the flowers of the guesthouse garden and i went back to my mushrooms after a visit of contrition to the farmer and many attempts to bring his children to forgiveness after all the altrurian mushrooms are wonderfully nourishing and they are in such variety that what with other succulent vegetables and the endless range of fruits and nuts one does not wish for meatmeat that one has killed ones self     v   i wish you could be making tour of the regionic capitals with us dolly there are swift little onerail electric expresses running daily from one capital to another but these are used only when speed is required and we are confessedly in no hurry aristides wanted me to see as much of the country as possible and i am as eager as he the old steamroads of the capitalistic epoch have been disused for generations and their beds are now the country roads which are everywhere kept in beautiful repair there are no horse vehicles the electric motors are employed in the towns though some people travel on horseback but the favorite means of conveyance is by electric van which any citizen may have on proof of his need of it and it is comfortable beyond comparemounted on easy springs and curtained and cushioned like those gypsy vans we see in the country at home aristides drives himself and sometimes we both get out and walk for there is plenty of time  i dont know whether i can make you understand how everything has tended to simplification here they have disused the complicated facilities and conveniences of the capitalistic epoch which we are so proud of and have got back as close as possible to nature people stay at home a great deal more than with us though if any one likes to make a journey or to visit the capitals he is quite free to do it and those who have some useful or beautiful object in view make the sacrifice as they feel it to leave their villages every day and go to the nearest capital to carry on their studies or experiments what we consider modern conveniences they would consider a superfluity of naughtiness for the most part as work is the ideal they do not believe in what we call laborsaving devices  when we approach a village on our journey one of the villagers sometimes a young man and sometimes a girl comes out to meet us and when we pass through they send some one with us on the way a little the people have a perfect inspiration for hospitality they not only know when to do and how much to do but how little and when not at all i cant remember that we have ever once been bored by those nice young things that welcomed us or speeded us on our way and when we have stopped in a village they have shown a genius for leaving us alone after the first welcome that is beautiful they are so regardful of our privacy in fact that if it had not been for aristides who explained their ideal to me i should have felt neglected sometimes and should have been shy of letting them know that we would like their company but he understood it and i must say that i have never enjoyed people and their ways so much their hospitality is a sort of compromise between that of the english houses where you are left free at certain houses to follow your own devices absolutely and that spanish splendor which assures you that the hosts house is yours without meaning it in fact the guesthouse wherever we go is ours for it belongs to the community and it is absolutely a home to us for the time being it is usually the best house in the village the prettiest and cosiest where all the houses are so pretty and cosey there is always another building for public meetings called the temple which is the principal edifice marble and classic and tasteful which we see almost as much of as the guesthouse for the news of the emissarys return has preceded him and everybody is alive with curiosity and he has to stand and deliver in the village temples everywhere of course i am the great attraction and after being scared by it at first i have rather got to like it the people are so kind and unaffected and really delicate  you mustnt get the notion that the altrurians are a solemn people at all they are rather gay and they like other peoples jokes as well as their own i am sure mr makely with his sense of humor would be at home with them at once the one thing that more than any other has helped them to conceive of the american situation is its being the gigantic joke which we often feel it to be i dont know but it appears to them more grotesque than it does to us even at first when aristides would explain some peculiarity of ours they would receive him with a gale of laughing but this might change into cries of horror and pity later one of the things that amused and then revolted them most was our patriotism they thought it the drollest thing in the world that men should be willing to give their own lives and take the lives of other men for the sake of a country which assured them no safety from want and did not even assure them work and in which they had no more logical interest than the country they were going to fight they could understand how a rich man might volunteer for one of our wars but when they were told that most of our volunteers were poor men who left their mothers and sisters or their wives and children without any means of support except their meagre pay they were quite bewildered and stopped laughing as if the thing had passed a joke they asked how if one of these citizen soldiers was killed and they seemed to suppose that in this case the country would provide for his family and give them work or if the children were too young would support them at the public expense it made me creep a little when my husband answered that the family of a crippled or invalided soldier would have a pension of eight or ten or fifteen dollars a month and when they came back with the question why the citizens of such a country should love it enough to die for it i could not have said why for the life of me but aristides who is so magnificently generous tried to give them a notion of the sublimity which is at the bottom of our illogicality and which adjusts so many apparently hopeless points of our anomaly they asked how this sublimity differed from that of the savage who brings in his game and makes a feast for the whole tribe and leaves his wife and children without provision against future want but aristides told them that there were essential differences between the americans and savages which arose from the fact that the savage condition was permanent and the american conditions were unconsciously provisional  they are quite well informed about our life in some respects but they wished to hear at first hand whether certain things were really so or not for instance they wanted to know whether people were allowed to marry and bring children into the world if they had no hopes of supporting them or educating them or whether diseased people were allowed to become parents in altruria you know the families are generally small only two or three children at the most so that the parents can devote themselves to them the more fully and as there is no fear of want here the state interferes only when the parents are manifestly unfit to bring the little ones up they imagined that there was something of that kind with us but when they heard that the state interfered in the family only when the children were unruly and then it punished the children by sending them to a reform school and disgracing them for life instead of holding the parents accountable they seemed to think that it was one of the most anomalous features of our great anomaly here when the father and mother are always quarrelling the children are taken from them and the pair are separated at first for a time but after several chances for reform they are parted permanently  but i must not give you the notion that all our conferences are so serious many have merely the character of social entertainments which are not made here for invited guests but for any who choose to come all are welcome at these there are often plays given by amateurs and improvised from plots which supply the outline while the performers supply the dialogue and action as in the old italian comedies the altrurians are so quick and fine in fact that they often remind me of the italians more than any other people one night there was for my benefit an american play as the altrurians imagined it from what they had read about us and they had costumed it from the pictures of us they had seen in the newspapers aristides had sent home while he was with us the effect was a good deal like that american play which the japanese company of sada yacco gave while it was in new york it was all about a millionaires daughter who was loved by a poor young man and escaped with him to altruria in an open boat from new york the millionaire could be distinctly recognized by the dollarmarks which covered him all over as they do in the caricatures of rich men in our yellow journals it was funny to the last degree in the last act he was seen giving his millions away to poor people whose multitude was represented by the continually coming and going of four or five performers in and out of the door in outrageously ragged clothes the altrurians have not yet imagined the nice degrees of poverty which we have achieved and they could not have understood that a man with a hundred thousand dollars would have seemed poor to that multimillionaire in fact they do not grasp the idea of money at all i heard afterwards that in the usual version the millionaire commits suicide in despair but the piece had been given a happy ending out of kindness to me i must say that in spite of the monstrous misconception the acting was extremely good especially that of some comic characters  but dancing is the great national amusement in altruria where it has not altogether lost its religious nature a sort of march in the temples is as much a part of the worship as singing and so dancing has been preserved from the disgrace which it used to be in with serious people among us in the lovely afternoons you see young people dancing in the meadows and hear them shouting in time to the music while the older men and women watch them from their seats in the shade every sort of pleasure here is improvised and as you pass through a village the first thing you know the young girls and young men start up in a sort of girandole and linking hands in an endless chain stretch the figure along through the street and out over the highway to the next village and the next and the next the work has all been done in the forenoon and every one who chooses is at liberty to join in the fun  the villages are a good deal alike to a stranger and we knew what to expect there after a while but the country is perpetually varied and the unexpected is always happening in it the old railroadbeds on which we travelled are planted with fruit and nut trees and flowering shrubs and our progress is through a fragrant bower that is practically endless except where it takes the shape of a colonnade near the entrance of a village with vines trained about white pillars and clusters of grapes which are ripening just now hanging down the change in the climate created by cutting off the southeastern peninsula and letting in the equatorial current which was begun under the first altrurian president with an unexpended warappropriation and finished for what one of the old capitalistic wars used to cost is something perfectly astonishing aristides says he told you something about it in his speech at the white mountains but you would never believe it without the evidence of your senses whole regions to the southward which were nearest the pole and were sheeted with ice and snow with the temperature and vegetation of labrador now have the climate of italy and the mountains which used to bear nothing but glaciers are covered with olive orchards and plantations of the delicious coffee which they drink here aristides says you could have the same results at homeno in the united statesby cutting off the western shore of alaska and letting in the japanese current and it could be done at the cost of any average war     vi   but i must not get away from my personal experiences in these international statistics sometimes when night overtakes us we stop and camp beside the road and set about getting our supper of eggs and bread and butter and cheese or the fruits that are ripening all round us since my experience with that pullet i go meekly mushrooming in the fields and pastures and when i have set the mushrooms stewing over an open fire aristides makes the coffee and in a little while we have a banquet fit for kingsor for the poor things in every grade below them that serve kings political or financial or industrial there is always water for it is brought down from the snowfields of the mountainsthere is not much rainfalland carried in little concrete channels along the roadside from village to village something like those conduits the italian peasants use to bring down the water from the maritime alps to their fields and orchards and you hear the soft gurgle of it the whole night long and day long too whenever you stop after supper we can read awhile by our electric lamp we tap the current in the telephone wires anywhere or aristides sacrifices himself to me in a lesson of altrurian grammar then we creep back into our van and fall asleep with the southern cross glittering over our heads it is perfectly safe though it was a long time before i could imagine the perfect safety of it in a country where there are no thieves because a thief here would not know what to do with his booty we are secure from human molestation and the land has long been cleared of all sorts of wild beasts without being unpleasantly tamed it is like england in that and yet it has a touch of the sylvan which you feel nowhere as you do in our dear new england hill country there was one night however when we were lured on and on and did not stop to camp till fairly in the dusk then we went to sleep without supper for we had had rather a late lunch and were not hungry and about one oclock in the morning i was awakened by voices speaking altrurian together i recognized my husbands voice which is always so kind but which seemed to have a peculiarly tender and compassionate note in it now the other was lower and of a sadness which wrung my heart though i did not know in the least what the person was saying the talk went on a long time at first about some matter of immediate interest as i fancied and then apparently it branched off on some topic which seemed to concern the stranger whoever he was then it seemed to get more indistinct as if the stranger were leaving us and aristides were going a little way with him presently i heard him coming back and he put his head in at the van curtains as if to see whether i was asleep  well i said and he said how sorry he was for having waked me oh i dont mind i said whom were you talking with he had the saddest voice i ever heard what did he want  oh it seems that we are not far from the ruins of one of the old capitalistic cities which have been left for a sort of warning against the former conditions and he wished to caution us against the malarial influences from it i think perhaps we had better push on a little way if you dont mind  the moon was shining clearly and of course i did not mind and aristides got his hand on the lever and we were soon getting out of the dangerous zone i think he said they ought to abolish that pesthole i doubt if it serves any good purpose now though it has been useful in times past as an objectlesson  but who was your unknown friend i asked a great deal more curious about him than about the capitalistic ruin  oh just a poor murderer he answered easily and i shuddered back a murderer  yes he killed his friend some fifteen years ago in a jealous rage and he is pursued by remorse that gives him no peace  and is the remorse his only punishment i asked rather indignantly  isnt that enough god seemed to think it was in the case of the first murderer who killed his brother all that he did to cain was to set a mark on him but we have not felt sure that we have the right to do this we let god mark him and he has done it with this man in the sorrow of his face i was rather glad you couldnt see him my dear it is an awful face  i confess that this sounded like mere sentimentalism to me and i said really aristides i cant follow you how are innocent people to be protected against this wretch if he wanders about among them at will  they are as safe from him as from any other man in altruria his case was carefully looked into by the medical authorities and it was decided that he was perfectly sane so that he could be safely left at large to expiate his misdeed in the only possible way that such a misdeed can be expiatedby doing good to others what would you have had us do with him  the question rather staggered me but i said he ought to have been imprisoned at least a year for manslaughter  cain was not imprisoned an hour  that was a very different thing but suppose you let a man go at large who has killed his friend in a jealous rage what do you do with other murderers  in altruria there can be no other murderers people cannot kill here for money which prompts every other kind of murder in capitalistic countries as well as every other kind of crime i know my dear that this seems very strange to you but you will accustom yourself to the idea and then you will see the reasonableness of the altrurian plan on the whole i am sorry you could not have seen that hapless man and heard him he had a face like death  and a voice like death too i put in  you noticed that he wanted to talk about his crime with me he wants to talk about it with any one who will listen to him he is consumed with an undying pity for the man he slew that is the first thing the only thing in his mind if he could i believe he would give his life for the life he took at any moment but you cannot recreate one life by destroying another there is no human means of ascertaining justice but we can always do mercy with divine omniscience as he spoke the sun pierced the edge of the eastern horizon and lit up the marble walls and roofs of the regionic capital which we were approaching  at the meeting we had there in the afternoon aristides reported our having been warned against our danger in the night by that murderer and public record of the fact was made the altrurians consider any sort of punishment which is not expiation a far greater sin than the wrong it visits and altogether barren and useless after the record in this case had been made the conference naturally turned upon what aristides had seen of the treatment of criminals in america and when he told of our prisons where people merely arrested and not yet openly accused are kept i did not know which way to look for you know i am still an american at heart dolly did you ever see the inside of one of our policestations at night or smell it i did once when i went to give bail for a wretched girl who had been my servant and had gone wrong but had been arrested for theft and i assure you that the sight and the smell woke me in the night for a month afterwards and i have never quite ceased to dream about it  the altrurians listened in silence and i hoped they could not realize the facts though the story was every word true but what seemed to make them the most indignant was the treatment of the families of the prisoners in what we call our penitentiaries and reformatories at first they did not conceive of it apparently because it was so stupidly barbarous they have no patience with stupidity and when aristides had carefully explained it seemed as if they could not believe it they thought it right that the convicts should be made to work but they could not understand that the state really took away their wages and left their families to suffer for want of the support which it had deprived them of they said this was punishing the mothers and sisters the wives and children of the prisoners and was like putting out the eyes of an offenders innocent relatives as they had read was done in oriental countries they asked if there was never any sort of protest against such an atrocious perversion of justice and when the question was put to me i was obliged to own that i had never heard the system even criticised perhaps it has been but i spoke only from my own knowledge     vii   well to get away from these dismal experiences and come back to our travels with their perpetual novelty and the constantly varying beauty of the country  the human interest of the landscape that is always the great interest of it and i wish i could make you feel it as i have felt it in this wonderful journey of ours it is like the new england landscape at times in its kind of gentle wildness but where it has been taken back into the hand of man how different the human interest is instead of a rheumatic old farmer in his clumsy clothes with some of his gaunt girls to help him or perhaps his ageing wife getting in the hay of one of those sweet meadows and looking like so many animated scarecrows at their work or instead of some young farmer on the seat of his clattering mower or mounted high over his tedder but as much alone as if there were no one else in the neighborhood silent and dull or fierce or sullen as the case might be the work is always going on with companies of mowers or reapers or planters that chatter like birds or sing like them  it is no use my explaining again and again that in a country like this where everybody works nobody over works and that when the few hours of obligatory labor are passed in the mornings people need not do anything unless they choose their workingdresses are very simple but in all sorts of gay colors like those you saw in the greek play at harvard with straw hats for the men and fillets of ribbon for the girls and sandals for both i speak of girls for most of the married women are at home gardening or about the household work but men of every age work in the fields the earth is dear to them because they get their life from it by labor that is not slavery they come to love it every acre every foot because they have known it from childhood and i have seen old men very old pottering about the orchards and meadows during the hours of voluntary work and trimming them up here and there simply because they could not keep away from the place or keep their hands off the trees and bushes sometimes in the long tender afternoons we see far up on some pasture slope groups of girls scattered about on the grass with their sewing or listening to some one reading other times they are giving a little play usually a comedy for life is so happy here that tragedy would not be true to it with the characters coming and going in a grove of small pines for the coulisses and using a level of grass for the stage if we stop one of the audience comes down to us and invites us to come up and see the play which keeps on in spite of the sensation that i can feel i make among them  everywhere the news of us has gone before us and there is a universal curiosity to get a look at aristides capitalistic wife as they call me i made him translate it and he explained that the word was merely descriptive and not characteristic some people distinguished and called me american there was one place where they were having a picnic in the woods up a hillside and they asked us to join them so we turned our van into the roadside and followed the procession it was headed by two old men playing on pipes and after these came children singing and then all sorts of people young and old when we got to an open place in the woods where there was a spring and smooth grass they built fires and began to get ready for the feast while some of them did things to amuse the rest every one could do something if you can imagine a party of artists it was something like that i should say the altrurians had artists manners free friendly and easy with a dash of humor in everything and a wonderful willingness to laugh and make laugh aristides is always explaining that the artist is their ideal type that is some one who works gladly and plays as gladly as he works no one here is asked to do work that he hates unless he seems to hate every kind of work when this happens the authorities find out something for him that he had better like by letting him starve till he works that picnic lasted the whole afternoon and well into the night and then the picnickers went home through the starlight leading the little ones or carrying them when they were too little or too tired but first they came down to our van with us and sang us a serenade after we had disappeared into it and then left us and sent their voices back to us out of the dark  one morning at dawn as we came into a village we saw nearly the whole population mounting the marble steps of the temple all the holiday dress of the voluntaries which they put on here every afternoon when the work is done last of the throng came a procession of children looking something like a mayday party and midway of their line were a young man and a young girl hand in hand who parted at the door of the temple and entered separately aristides called out oh it is a wedding you are in luck eveleth and then and there i saw my first altrurian wedding  within the pillars and the altar and the seats of the elders were garlanded with flowers so fresh and fragrant that they seemed to have blossomed from the marble overnight and there was a soft murmur of altrurian voices that might very well have seemed the hum of bees among the blossoms this subsided as the young couple who had paused just inside the temple door came up the middle side by side and again separated and took their places the youth on the extreme right of the elder and the maiden on the extreme left of the eldresses and stood facing the congregation which was also on foot and joined in the hymn which everybody sang then one of the eldresses rose and began a sort of statement which aristides translated to me afterwards she said that the young couple whom we saw there had for the third time asked to become man and wife after having believed for a year that they loved each other and having statedly come before the marriage authorities and been questioned as to the continuance of their affection she said that probably every one present knew that they had been friends from childhood and none would be surprised that they now wished to be united for life they had been carefully instructed as to the serious nature of the marriage bond and admonished as to the duties they were entering into not only to each other but to the community at each successive visit to the authorities they had been warned separately and together against the danger of trusting to anything like a romantic impulse and they had faithfully endeavored to act upon this advice as they testified in order to prove the reality of their affection they had been parted every third month and had lived during that time in different regions where it was meant they should meet many other young people so that if they felt any swerving of the heart they might not persist in an intention which could only bring them final unhappiness it seems this is the rule in the case of young lovers and people usually marry very young here but if they wish to marry later in life the rule is not enforced so stringently or not at all the bride and groom we saw had both stood these trials and at each return they had been more and more sure that they loved each other and loved no one else now they were here to unite their hands and to declare the union of their hearts before the people  then the eldress sat down and an elder arose who bade the young people come forward to the centre of the line where the elders and eldresses were sitting he took his place behind them and once more and for the last time he conjured them not to persist if they felt any doubt of themselves he warned them that if they entered into the married state and afterwards repented to the point of seeking divorce the divorce would indeed be granted them but on terms as they must realize of lasting grief to themselves through the offence they would commit against the commonwealth they answered that they were sure of themselves and ready to exchange their troth for life and death then they joined hands and declared that they took each other for husband and wife the congregation broke into another hymn and slowly dispersed leaving the bride and groom with their families who came up to them and embraced them pressing their cheeks against the cheeks of the young pair  this ended the solemnity and then the festivity began as it ended with a wedding feast where people sang and danced and made speeches and drank toasts and the fun was kept up till the hours of the obligatories approached and then what do you think the married pair put off their wedding garments with the rest and went to work in the fields later i understood if they wished to take a wedding journey they could freely do so but the first thing in their married life they must honor the altrurian ideal of work by which every one must live in order that every other may live without overwork i believe that the marriage ceremonial is something like that of the quakers but i never saw a quaker wedding and i could only compare this with the crazy romps with which our houseweddings often end with throwing of rice and old shoes and tying ribbons to the bridal carriage and baggage and following the pair to the train with outbreaks of tiresome hilarity which make them conspicuous before their fellowtravellers or with some of our ghastly church weddings in which the religious ceremonial is lost in the social effect and ends with that everlasting thumping march from lohengrin and the outsiders storming about the bridal pair and the guests with the rude curiosity that the fattest policemen at the canopied and carpeted entrance cannot check     viii   we have since been at other weddings and at christenings and at funerals the ceremonies are always held in the temples and are always in the same serious spirit as the altrurians are steadfast believers in immortality there is a kind of solemn elevation in the funeral ceremonies which i cannot give you a real notion of it is helped i think by the custom of not performing the ceremony over the dead a brief rite is reserved for the cemetery where it is wished that the kindred shall not be present lest they think always of the material body and not of the spiritual body which shall be raised in incorruption religious service is held in the temples every day at the end of the obligatories and whenever we are near a village or in any of the capitals we always go it is very simple after a hymn to which the people sometimes march round the interior of the temple each lays on the altar an offering from the fields or woods where they have been working if it is nothing but a head of grain or a wild flower or a leaf then any one is at liberty to speak but any one else may go out without offence there is no ritual sometimes they read a chapter from the new testament preferably a part of the story of christ or a passage from his discourses the idea of coming to the temple at the end of the days labor is to consecrate that days work and they do not call anything work that is not work with the hands when i explained or tried to explain that among us a great many people worked with their brains to amuse others or to get handwork out of them they were unable to follow me i asked if they did not consider composing music or poetry or plays or painting pictures work and they said no that was pleasure and must be indulged only during the voluntaries it was never to be honored like work with the hands for it would not equalize the burden of that but might put an undue share of it on others they said that lives devoted to such pursuits must be very unwholesome and they brought me to book about the lives of most artists literary men and financiers in the capitalistic world to prove what they said they held that people must work with their hands willingly in the artistic spirit but they could only do that when they knew that others differently gifted were working in like manner with their hands  i couldnt begin to tell you all our queer experiences as i have kept saying i am a great curiosity everywhere and i could flatter myself that people were more eager to see me than to hear aristides sometimes i couldnt help thinking that they expected to find me an awful warning a dreadful example of whatever a woman ought not to be and a woman from capitalistic conditions must be logically but sometimes they were very intelligent even the simplest villagers as we should call them though there is such an equality of education and opportunity here that no simplicity of life has the effect of dulling people as it has with us one thing was quite american they always wanted to know how i liked altruria and when i told them as i sincerely could that i adored it they were quite affecting in their pleasure they generally asked if i would like to go back to america and when i said no they were delighted beyond anything they said i must become a citizen and vote and take part in the government for that was every womans duty as well as right it was wrong to leave the whole responsibility to the men they asked if american women took no interest in the government and when i told them there was a very small number who wished to influence politics socially as the englishwomen did but without voting or taking any responsibility they were shocked in one of the regionic capitals they wanted me to speak after aristides but i had nothing prepared at the next i did get off a little speech in english which he translated after me later he put it into altrurian and i memorized it and made myself immensely popular by parroting it  the pronunciation of altrurian is not difficult for it is spelled phonetically and the sounds are very simple where they were once difficult they have been simplified for here the simplification of life extends to everything and the grammar has been reduced in its structure till it is as elemental as english grammar or norwegian the language is greek in origin but the intricate inflections and the declensions have been thrown away and it has kept only the simplest forms you must get mr twelvemough to explain this to you dolly for it would take me too long and i have so much else to tell you a good many of the women have taken up english but they learn it as a dead language and they give it a comical effect by trying to pronounce it as it is spelled  i suppose you are anxious if these letters which are piling up and piling up should ever reach you or even start to do so to know something about the altrurian cities and what they are like well in the first place you must cast all images of american cities out of your mind or any european cities except perhaps the prettiest and stateliest parts of paris where there is a regular skyline and the public buildings and monuments are approached through shaded avenues there are no private houses here in our sensethat is houses which people have built with their own money on their own land and made as ugly outside and as molestive to their neighbors and the passersby as they chose as the buildings belong to the whole people the first requirement is that they shall be beautiful inside and out there are a few grand edifices looking like greek temples which are used for the government offices and these are of course the most dignified but the dwellings are quite as attractive and comfortable they are built round courts with gardens and flowers in the courts and wide grassy spaces round them they are rather tall but never so tall as our great hotels or apartmenthouses and the floors are brought to one level by elevators which are used only in the capitals and generally speaking i should say the villages were pleasanter than the cities in fact the village is the altrurian ideal and there is an effort everywhere to reduce the size of the towns and increase the number of the villages the outlying farms have been gathered into these and now there is not one of those lonely places in the country like those where our farmers toil alone outdoors and their wives alone indoors and both go mad so often in the solitude the villages are almost in sight of each other and the people go to their fields in company while the women carry on their housekeeping cooperatively with a large kitchen which they use in common they have their meals apart or together as they like if any one is sick or disabled the neighbors come in and help do her work as they used with us in the early times and as they still do in country places village life here is preferred just as country life is in england and one thing that will amuse you with your american ideas and your pride in the overgrowth of our cities the altrurian papers solemnly announce from time to time that the population of such or such a capital has been reduced so many hundreds or thousands since the last census that means that the villages in the neighborhood have been increased in number and population  meanwhile i must say the capitals are delightful clean airy quiet with the most beautiful architecture mostly classic and mostly marble with rivers running through them and round them and every real convenience but not a clutter of artificial conveniences as with us in the streets there are noiseless trolleys where they have not been replaced by public automobiles which the long distances of the ample groundplan make rather necessary and the rivers are shot over with swift motorboats for the short distances you always expect to walk or if you dont expect it you walk anyway the carlines and boatlines are public and they are free for the altrurians think that the community owes transportation to every one who lives beyond easy reach of the points which their work calls them to  of course the great government stores are in the capitals and practically there are no stores in the villages except for what you might call emergency supplies but you must not imagine dolly that shopping here is like shopping at homeor in america as i am learning to say for altruria is home now that is you dont fill your purse with banknotes or have things charged you get everything you want within reason and certainly everything you need for nothing you have only to provide yourself with a card something like that you have to show at the army and navy stores in london when you first go to buy there which certifies that you belong to this or that workingphalanx and that you have not failed in the obligatories for such and such a length of time if you are not entitled to this card you had better not go shopping for there is no possible equivalent for it which will enable you to carry anything away or have it sent to your house at first i could not help feeling rather indignant when i was asked to show my workcard in the stores i had usually forgotten to bring it or sometimes i had brought my husbands card which would not do at all unless i could say that i had been ill or disabled for a woman is expected to work quite the same as a man of course her housework counts and as we are on a sort of public mission they count our hours of travel as workinghours especially as aristides has made it a point of good citizenship for us to stop every now and then and join in the obligatories when the villagers were getting in the farm crops or quarrying stone or putting up a house i am never much use in quarrying or building but i come in strong in the hayfields or the apple orchards or the orange groves  the shopping here is not so enslaving as it is with usi mean with youbecause the fashions do not change and you get things only when you need them not when you want them or when other people think you do the costume was fixed long ago when the altrurian era began by a commission of artists and it would be considered very bad form as well as bad morals to try changing it in the least people are allowed to choose their own colors but if one goes very wrong or so far wrong as to offend the public taste she is gently admonished by the local art commission if she insists they let her have her own way but she seldom wants it when she knows that people think her a fright of course the costume is modified somewhat for the age and shape of the wearer but this is not so often as you might think there are no very lean or very stout people though there are old and young just as there are with us but the altrurians keep young very much longer than capitalistic peoples do and the life of work keeps down their weight you know i used to incline a little to overplumpness i really believe because i overate at times simply to keep from thinking of the poor who had to undereat but that is quite past now i have lost at least twentyfive pounds from working outdoors and travelling so much and living very very simply     ix   i have to jot things down as they come into my mind and i am afraid i forget some of the most important everybody is so novel on this famous tour of ours that i am continually interested but one has ones preferences even in altruria and i believe i like best the wives of the artists and literary men whom one finds working in the galleries and libraries of the capitals everywhere they are not more intelligent than other women perhaps but they are more sympathetic and one sees so little of those people in new york for all they abound there  the galleries are not only for the exhibition of pictures but each has numbers of ateliers where the artists work and teach the libraries are the most wonderfully imagined things you do not have to come and study in them but if you are working up any particular subject the books relating to it are sent to your dwelling every morning and brought away every noon so that during the obligatory hours you have them completely at your disposition and during the voluntaries you can consult them with the rest of the public in the library it is not thought best that study should be carried on throughout the day and the results seem to justify this theory if you want to read a book merely for pleasure you are allowed to take it out and live with it as long as you like the copy you have is immediately replaced with another so that you do not feel hurried and are not obliged to ramp through it in a week or a fortnight  the altrurian books are still rather sealed books to me but they are delightful to the eye all in large print on wide margins with flexible bindings and such light paper that you can hold them in one hand indefinitely without tiring i must send you some with this if i ever get my bundle of letters off to you you will see by the dates that i am writing you one every day i had thought of keeping a journal for you but then i should have had left out a good many things that happened during our first days when the impressions were so vivid and i should have got to addressing my records to myself and i think i had better keep to the form of letters if they reach you and you read them at random why that is very much the way i write them  i despair of giving you any real notion of the capitals but if you remember the white city at the columbian fair at chicago in 1893 you can have some idea of the general effect of one only there is nothing heterogeneous in their beauty there is one classic rule in the architecture but each of the different architects may characterize an edifice from himself just as different authors writing the same language characterize it by the diction natural to him there are suggestions of the capitals in some of our cities and if you remember commonwealth avenue in boston you can imagine something like the union of street and garden which every street of them is the trolleys run under the overarching trees between the lawns flanked by gravelled footpaths between flowerbeds and you take the cars or not as you like as there is no hurry they go about as fast as english trams and the clanger from them is practically reduced to nothing by the crossings dipping under them at the street corners the centre of the capital is approached by colonnades which at night bear groups of great bulbous lamps and by day flutter with the altrurian and regionic flags around this centre are the stores and restaurants and theatres and galleries and libraries with arcades over the sidewalks like those in bologna sometimes the arcades are in two stories as they are in chester people are constantly coming and going in an easy way during the afternoon though in the morning the streets are rather deserted  but what is the use i could go on describing and describing and never get in half the differences from american cities with their hideous uproar and their mud in the wet and their clouds of swirling dust in the wind but there is one feature which i must mention because you can fancy it from the fond dream of a great national highway which some of our architects projected while they were still in the fervor of excitement from the beauty of the peristyle and other features of the white city they really have such a highway here crossing the whole altrurian continent and uniting the circle of the regionic capitals as we travelled for a long time by the country roads on the beds of the old railways i had no idea of this magnificent avenue till one day my husband suddenly ran our van into the one leading up to the first capital we were to visit then i found myself between miles and miles of stately white pillars rising and sinking as the road found its natural levels and growing in the perspective before us and dwindling behind us i could not keep out of my mind a colonnade of palmtrees only the fronds were lacking and there were never palms so beautiful each pillar was inscribed with the name of some altrurian who had done something for his country written some beautiful poem or story or history made some scientific discovery composed an opera invented a universal convenience performed a wonderful cure or been a delightful singer or orator or gardener or farmer not one soldier general or admiral among them that seemed very strange to me and i asked aristides how it was like everything else in altruria it was very simple there had been no war for so long that there were no famous soldiers to commemorate but he stopped our van when he came to the first of the many arches which spanned the highway and read out to me in english the altrurian record that it was erected in honor of the first president of the altrurian commonwealth who managed the negotiations when the capitalistic oligarchies to the north and south were peacefully annexed and the descendants of the three nations joined in the commemoration of an event that abolished war forever on the altrurian continent  here i can imagine mr makely asking who footed the bills for this beauty and magnificence and whether these works were constructed at the cost of the nation or the different regions or the abuttors on the different highways but the fact is you poor capitalistic dears they cost nobody a dollar for there is not a dollar in altruria you must worry into the idea somehow that in altruria you cannot buy anything except by working and that work is the current coin of the republic you pay for everything by drops of sweat and off your own brow not somebody elses brow the people built these monuments and colonnades and aqueducts and highways and byways and sweet villages and palatial cities with their own hands after the designs of artists who also took part in the labor but it was a labor that they delighted in so much that they chose to perform it during the voluntaries when they might have been resting and not during the obligatories when they were required to work so it was all joy and all glory they say there never was such happiness in any country since the world began while the work went on it was like a perpetual fourth of july or an everlasting picnic  but i know you hate this sort of economical stuff dolly and i will make haste to get down to business as mr makely would say for i am really coming to something that you will think worth while one morning when we had made half the circle of the capitals and were on the homestretch to the one where we had left our dear motherfor aristides claims her tooand i was letting that dull nether anxiety for her come to the top though we had had the fullest telephonic talks with her every day and knew she was well and happy we came round the shoulder of a wooded cliff and found ourselves on an open stretch of the northern coast at first i could only exclaim at the beauty of the sea lying blue and still beyond a long beach closed by another headland and i did not realize that a large yacht which i saw close to land had gone ashore the beach was crowded with altrurians who seemed to have come to the rescue for they were putting off to the yacht in boats and returning with passengers and jumping out and pulling their boats with them up on to the sand  i was quite bewildered and i dont know what to say i was the next thing when i saw that the stranded yacht was flying the american flag from her peak i supposed she must be one of our cruisers she was so large and the first thing that flashed into my mind was a kind of amused wonder what those poor altrurians would do with a shipofwar and her marines and crew i couldnt ask any coherent questions and luckily aristides was answering my incoherent ones in the best possible way by wheeling our van down on the beach and making for the point nearest the yacht he had time to say he did not believe she was a government vessel and in fact i remembered that once i had seen a boat in the north river getting up steam to go to europe which was much larger and had her decks covered with sailors that i took for bluejackets but she was only the private yacht of some people i knew these stupid things kept going and coming in my mind while my husband was talking with some of the altrurian girls who were there helping with the men they said that the yacht had gone ashore the night before last in one of the sudden fogs that come up on that coast and that some people whom the sailors seemed to obey were camping on the edge of the upland above the beach under a large tent they had brought from the yacht they had refused to go to the guesthouse in the nearest village and as nearly as the girls could make out they expected the yacht to get afloat from tide to tide and then intended to reembark on her in the mean time they had provisioned themselves from the ship and were living in a strange way of their own some of them seemed to serve the others but these appeared to be used with a very ungrateful indifference as if they were of a different race there was one who wore a white apron and white cap who directed the cooking for the rest and had several assistants and from time to time very disagreeable odors came from the camp like burning flesh the altrurians had carried them fruits and vegetables but the menassistants had refused them contemptuously and seemed suspicious of the variety of mushrooms they offered them they called out tostoo and i understood that the strangers were afraid they were bringing toadstools one of the altrurian girls had been studying english in the nearest capital and she had tried to talk with these people pronouncing it in the altrurian way but they could make nothing of one another then she wrote down what she wanted to say but as she spelled it phonetically they were not able to read her english she asked us if i was the american altrurian she had heard of and when i said yes she lost no time in showing us to the camp of the castaways  as soon as we saw their tents we went forward till we were met at the largest by a sort of marine footman who bowed slightly and said to me what name shall i say maam and i answered distinctly so that he might get the name right mr and mrs homos then he held back the flap of the marquee which seemed to serve these people as a drawingroom and called out standing very rigidly upright to let us pass in the way that i remembered so well mr and mrs omos and a severelooking rather elderly lady rose to meet us with an air that was both anxious and forbidding and before she said anything else she burst out you dont mean to say you speak english  i said that i spoke english and had not spoken anything else but rather poor french until six months before and then she demanded have you been cast away on this outlandish place too  i laughed and said i lived here and i introduced my husband as well as i could without knowing her name he explained with his pretty altrurian accent which you used to like so much that we had ventured to come in the hope of being of use to them and added some regrets for their misfortune so sweetly that i wondered she could help responding in kind but she merely said oh and then she seemed to recollect herself and frowning to a very gentlelooking old man to come forward she ignored my husband in presenting me mr thrall mrs   she hesitated for my name and i supplied it homos and as the old man had put out his hand in a kindly way i took it  and this is my husband aristides homos an altrurian i said and then as the lady had not asked us to sit down or shown the least sign of liking our being there the natural woman flamed up in me as she hadnt in all the time i have been away from new york i am glad you are so comfortable here mr thrall you wont need us i see the people about will do anything in their power for you come my dear and i was sweeping out of that tent in a manner calculated to give the eminent millionaires wife a notion of altrurian hauteur which i must own would have been altogether mistaken  i knew who they were perfectly even if i had not once met them i should have known that they were the ultrarich thralls from the multitudinous pictures of them that i had seen in the papers at home not long after they came on to new york  he was beginning oh no oh no but i cut in my husband and i are on our way to the next regionic capital and we are somewhat hurried you will be quite well looked after by the neighbors here and i see that we are rather in your housekeepers way  it was nasty dolly and i wont deny it it was vulgar but what would you have done i could feel aristides mild eye sadly on me and i was sorry for him but i assure him i was not sorry for them till that old man spoke again so timidly it isnt myits my wife mrs homos let me introduce her but havent we met before  perhaps during my first husbands lifetime i was mrs bellington strange  mrs p bellington strange your husband was a dear friend of mine when we were both younga good man if ever there was one the best in the world i am so glad to see you again ahmy dear you remember my speaking of mrs strange  he took my hand again and held it in his soft old hands as if hesitating whether to transfer it to her and my heart melted towards him you may think it very odd dolly but it was what he said of my dear dead husband that softened me it made him seem very fatherly and i felt the affection for him that i felt for my husband when he seemed more like a father aristides and i often talk of it and he has no wish that i should forget him  mrs thrall made no motion to take my hand from him but she said i think i have met mr strange and now i saw in the background sitting on a campstool near a long lank young man stretched in a hammock a very handsome girl who hastily ran through a book and then dropped it at the third mention of my name i suspected that the book was the social register and that the girls search for me had been satisfactory for she rose and came vaguely towards us while the young man unfolded himself from the hammock and stood hesitating but looking as if he rather liked what had happened  mr thrall bustled about for campstools and said do stop and have some breakfast with us its just coming in may i introduce my daughter lady moors andand lord moors the girl took my hand and the young man bowed from his place but if that poor old man had known peace was not to be made so easily between two such badtempered women as mrs thrall and myself we expressed some very stiff sentiments in regard to the weather and the prospect of the yacht getting off with the next tide and my husband joined in with that manly gentleness of his but we did not sit down much less offer to stay to breakfast we had got to the door of the tent the family following us even to the noble soninlaw and as she now realized that we are actually going mrs thrall gasped out but you are not leaving us what shall we do with all these natives  this was again too much and i flamed out at her natives they are cultivated and refined people for they are altrurians and i assure you you will be in much better hands than mine with them for i am only altrurian by marriage  she was one of those leathery egotists that nothing will make a dint in and she came back with but we dont speak the language and they dont speak english and how are we to manage if the yacht doesnt get afloat  oh no doubt you will be looked after from the capital we have just left but i will venture to make a little suggestion with regard to the natives in the mean time they are not proud but they are very sensitive and if you fail in any point of consideration they will understand that you do not want their hospitality  i imagine our own people will be able to look after us she answered quite as nastily we do not propose to be dependent on them we can pay our way here as we do elsewhere  the experiment will be worth trying i said come aristides and i took the poor fellow away with me to our van mr thrall made some hopeless little movements towards us but i would not stop or even look back when we got into the van i made aristides put on the full power and fell back into my seat and cried a while and then i scolded him because he would not scold me and went on in a really scandalous way it must have been a revelation to him but he only smoothed me on the shoulder and said poor eveleth poor eveleth till i thought i should scream but it ended in my falling on his neck and saying i knew i was horrid and what did he want me to do  after i calmed down into something like rationality he said he thought we had perhaps done the best thing we could for those people in leaving them to themselves for they could come to no possible harm among the neighbors he did not believe from what he had seen of the yacht from the shore and from what the altrurians had told him that there was one chance in a thousand of her ever getting afloat but those people would have to convince themselves of the fact and of several other facts in their situation i asked him what he meant and he said he could tell me but that as yet it was a public affair and he would rather not anticipate the private interest i would feel in it i did not insist in fact i wanted to get that odious woman out of my mind as soon as i could for the thought of her threatened to poison the pleasure of the rest of our tour  i believe my husband hurried it a little though he did not shorten it and we got back to the maritime region almost a week sooner than we had first intended i found my dear mother well and still serenely happy in her altrurian surroundings she had begun to learn the language and she had a larger acquaintance in the capital i believe than any other one person she said everybody had called on her and they were the kindest people she had ever dreamed of she had exchanged cookinglessons with one lady who they told her was a distinguished scientist and she had taught another who was a great painter a peculiar embroidery stitch which she had learned from my grandmother and which everybody admired these two ladies had given her most of her grammatical instruction in altrurian but there was a bright little girl who had enlarged her vocabulary more than either in helping her about her housework the mother having lent her for the purpose my mother said she was not ashamed to make blunders before a child and the little witch had taken the greatest delight in telling her the names of things in the house and the streets and the fields outside the town where they went long walks together     x   well my dear dorothea i had been hoping to go more into detail about my mother and about our life in the maritime capital which is to be our home for a year but i had hardly got down the last words when aristides came in with a despatch from the seventh regionic summoning us there on important public business i havent got over the feeling yet of being especially distinguished and flattered at sharing in public business but the altrurian women are so used to it that they do not think anything of it the despatch was signed by an old friend of my husbands cyril chrysostom who had once been emissary in england and to whom my husband wrote his letters when he was in america i hated to leave my mother so soon but it could not be helped and we took the first electric express for the seventh regionic where we arrived in about an hour and forty minutes making the three hundred miles in that time easily i couldnt help regretting our comfortable van but there was evidently haste in the summons and i confess that i was curious to know what the matter was though i had made a shrewd guess the first instant and it turned out that i was not mistaken  the long and the short of it was that there was trouble with the people who had come ashore in that yacht and were destined never to go to sea in her she was hopelessly bedded in the sand and the waves that were breaking over her were burying her deeper and deeper the owners were living in their tent as we had left them and her crew were camped in smaller tents and any shelter they could get along the beach they had brought her stores away but many of the provisions had been damaged and it had become a pressing question what should be done about the people we had been asked to consult with cyril and his wife and the other regionic chiefs and their wives and we threshed the question out nearly the whole night  i am afraid it will appear rather comical in some aspects to you and mr makely but i can assure you that it was a very serious matter with the altrurian authorities if there had been any hope of a vessel from the capitalistic world touching at altruria within a definite time they could have managed for they would have gladly kept the yachts people and owners till they could embark them for australia or new zealand and would have made as little of the trouble they were giving as they could but until the trader that brought us should return with the crew as the captain had promised there was no ship expected and any other wreck in the mean time would only add to their difficulty you may be surprised though i was not that the difficulty was mostly with the yachtowners and above all with mrs thrall who had baffled every effort of the authorities to reduce what they considered the disorder of their life  with the crew it was a different matter as soon as they had got drunk on the wines and spirits they had brought from the wreck and then had got sober because they had drunk all the liquors up they began to be more manageable when their provisions ran short and they were made to understand that they would not be allowed to plunder the fields and woods or loot the villages for something to eat they became almost exemplarily docile at first they were disposed to show fight and the principles of the altrurians did not allow them to use violence in bringing them to subjection but the men had counted without their hosts in supposing that they could therefore do as they pleased unless they pleased to do right after they had made their first foray they were warned by cyril who came from the capital to speak english with them that another raid would not be suffered they therefore attempted it by night but the altrurians were prepared for them with the flexible steel nets which are their only means of defence and half a dozen sailors were taken in one when they attempted to break out and their shipmates attempted to break in to free them a light current of electricity was sent through the wires and the thing was done those who were rescuedthe altrurians will not say capturedhad hoes put into their hands the next morning and were led into the fields and set to work after a generous breakfast of coffee bread and mushrooms the chickens they had killed in their midnight expedition were buried and those which they had not killed lost no time in beginning to lay eggs for the sustenance of the reformed castaways as an extra precaution with the rescued when they were put to work each of them with a kind of shirt of mail worn over his coat which could easily be electrized by a metallic filament connecting with the communal dynamo and under these conditions they each did a full days work during the obligatories  as the short commons grew shorter and shorter both meat and drink at camp famine and the campers found it was useless to attempt thieving from the altrurians they had tried begging from the owners in their large tent but they were told that the provisions were giving out there too and there was nothing for them when they insisted the servants of the owners had threatened them with revolvers and the sailors who had nothing but their knives preferred to attempt living on the country within a week the whole crew had been put to work in the woods and fields and quarries or wherever they could make themselves useful they were on the whole so well fed and sheltered that they were perfectly satisfied and went down with the altrurians on the beach during the voluntaries and helped secure the yachts boats and pieces of wreckage that came ashore until they became accustomed or resigned to the altrurian diet they were allowed to catch shellfish and the crabs that swarmed along the sand and cook them but on condition that they built their fires on the beach and cooked only during an offshore wind so that the fumes of the roasting should not offend the villagers  cyril acknowledged therefore that the question of the crew was for the present practically settled but mr and mrs thrall and their daughter and soninlaw with their servants still presented a formidable problem as yet their provisions had not run out and they were living in their marquee as we had seen them three weeks earlier just after their yacht went ashore it could not be said that they were molestive in the same sense as the sailors but they were even more demoralizing in the spectacle they offered the neighborhood of people dependent on hired service and in their endeavors to supply themselves in perishable provisions like milk and eggs by means of money cyril had held several interviews with them in which he had at first delicately intimated and then explicitly declared that the situation could not be prolonged the two men had been able to get the altrurian point of view in some measure and so had lady moors but mrs thrall had remained stiffly obtuse and obstinate and it was in despair of bringing her to terms without resorting to rescue that he had summoned us to help him  it was not a pleasant job but of course we could not refuse and we agreed that as soon as we had caught a nap and had a bite of breakfast we would go over to their camp with cyril and his wife and see what we could do with the obnoxious woman i confess that i had some little consolation in the hope that i should see her properly humbled     xi   mr thrall and lord moors must have seen us coming for they met us at the door of the tent without the intervention of the footman and gave us quite as much welcome as we could expect in our mission so disagreeable all round mr thrall was as fatherly with me as before and lord moors was as polite to cyril and mrs chrysostom as could have been wished in fact he and cyril were a sort of acquaintances from the time of cyrils visit to england where he met the late earl moors the father of the present peer in some of his visits to toynbee hall and the whitechapel settlements the earl was very much interested in the slums perhaps because he was rather poor himself if not quite slummy the son was then at the university and when he came out and into his title he so far shared his fathers tastes that he came to america it was not slumming exactly but a nobleman no doubt feels it to be something like it after a little while in new york he went out to colorado where so many needy noblemen bring up and there he met the thralls and fell in love with the girl cyril had understoodor rather mrs cyrilthat it was a lovematch on both sides but on mrs thralls side it was business he did not even speak of settlementsthe english are so romantic when they are romanticbut mr thrall saw to all that and the young people were married after a very short courtship they spent their honeymoon partly in colorado springs and partly in san francisco where the thralls yacht was lying and then they set out on a voyage round the world making stops at the interesting places and bringing up on the beach of the seventh region of altruria on route for the eastern coast of south america from that time on cyril said we knew their history  after mr thrall had shaken hands tenderly with me and cordially with aristides he said wont you all come inside and have breakfast with us my wife and daughter  thank you mr thrall cyril answered for us we will sit down here if you please and as your ladies are not used to business we will not ask you to disturb them  im sure lady moors the young nobleman began but cyril waved him silent  we shall be glad later but not now gentlemen i have asked my friends aristides homos and eveleth homos to accompany my wife and me this morning because eveleth is an american and will understand your position and he has lately been in america and will be able to clarify the situation from both sides we wish you to believe that we are approaching you in the friendliest spirit and that nothing could be more painful to us than to seem inhospitable  then why the old man asked with businesslike promptness do you object to our presence here i dont believe i get your idea  because the spectacle which your life offers is contrary to good morals and as faithful citizens we cannot countenance it  but in what way is our life immoral i have always thought that i was a good citizen at home at least i cant remember having been arrested for disorderly conduct  he smiled at me as if i should appreciate the joke and it hurt me to keep grave but suspecting what a bad time he was going to have i thought i had better not join him in any levity  i quite conceive you cyril replied but you present to our people who are offended by it the spectacle of dependence upon hireling service for your daily comfort and convenience  but my dear sir mr thrall returned dont we pay for it do our servants object to rendering us this service  that has nothing to do with the case or rather it makes it worse the fact that your servants do not object shows how completely they are depraved by usage we should not object if they served you from affection and if you repaid them in kindness but the fact that you think you have made them a due return by giving them money shows how far from the right ideal in such a matter the whole capitalistic world is  here to my great delight aristides spoke up  if the american practice were half as depraving as it ought logically to be in their conditions their social system would drop to pieces it was always astonishing to me that a people with their facilities for evil their difficulties for good should remain so kind and just and pure  that is what i understood from your letters to me my dear aristides i am willing to leave the general argument for the present but i should like to ask mr thrall a question and i hope it wont be offensive  mr thrall smiled at any rate i promise not to be offended  you are a very rich man  much richer than i would like to be  how rich  seventy millions eighty a hundred three hundred i dont just know  i dont suppose youve always felt your great wealth a great blessing  a blessing there have been times when i felt it a millstone hanged about my neck and could have wished nothing so much as that i were thrown into the sea man you dont know what a curse i have felt my money to be at such times when i have given it away as i have by millions at a time i have never been sure that i was not doing more harm than good with it i have hired men to seek out good objects for me and i have tried my best to find for myself causes and institutions and persons who might be helped without hindering others as worthy but sometimes it seems as if every dollar of my money carried a blight with it and infected whoever touched it with a moral pestilence it has reached a sum where the wildest profligate couldnt spend it and it grows and grows its as if it were a rising flood that had touched my lips and would go over my head before i could reach the shore i believe i got it honestly and i have tried to share it with those whose labor earned it for me i have founded schools and hospitals and homes for old men and old women and asylums for children and the blind and deaf and dumb and halt and mad wherever i have found one of my old workmen in need and i have looked personally into the matter i have provided for him fully short of pauperization where i have heard of some gifted youth i have had him educated in the line of his gift i have collected a gallery of works of art and opened it on sundays as well as weekdays to the public free if there is a story of famine far or near i send food by the shipload if there is any great public calamity my agents have instructions to come to the rescue without referring the case to me but it is all useless the money grows and grows and i begin to feel that my efforts to employ it wisely and wholesomely are making me a public laughingstock as well as an easy mark for every swindler with a job or a scheme he turned abruptly to me but you must often have heard the same from my old friend strange we used to talk these things over together when our money was not the heap that mine is now and it seems to me i can hear his voice saying the very words i have been using  i too seemed to hear his voice in the words and it was as if speaking from his grave  i looked at aristides and read compassion in his dear face but the face of cyril remained severe and judicial he said then if what you say is true you cannot think it a hardship if we remove your burden for the time you remain with us i have consulted with the national and regional as well as the communal authorities and we cannot let you continue to live in the manner you are living here you must pay your way  i shall be only too glad to do that mr thrall returned more cheerfully we have not a great deal of cash in hand but i can give you my check on london or paris or new york  in altruria cyril returned we have no use for money you must pay your way as soon as your present provision from your yacht is exhausted  mr thrall turned a dazed look on the young lord who suggested i dont think we follow you how can mr thrall pay his way except with money  he must pay with work as soon as you come upon the neighbors here for the necessities of life you must all work tomorrow or the next day or next week at the furthest you must go to work or you must starve  then he came out with that text of scripture which had been so efficient with the crew of the little sally for even when we were with you this we commanded you that if any would not work neither should he eat  lord moors seemed very interested and not so much surprised as i had expected yes i have often thought of that passage and of its susceptibility to a simpler interpretation than we usually give it but  there is but one interpretation of which it is susceptible cyril interrupted the apostle gives that interpretation when he prefaces the text with the words for yourselves know how you ought to follow us for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you neither did we eat any mans bread for nought but wrought with travail night and day that we might not be chargeable to any of you not because we have not power but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us the whole economy of altruria is founded on these passages  literally  literally  but my dear sir the young lord reasoned you surely do not wrench the text from some such meaning as that if a man has money he may pay his way without working  no certainly not but here you have no money and as we cannot suffer any to walk among us disorderly working not at all we must not exempt you from our rule     xii   at this point there came a sound from within the marquee as of skirts sweeping forward sharply imperiously followed by a softer froufrou and mrs thrall put aside the curtain of the tent with one hand and stood challenging our little altrurian group while lady moors peered timidly at us from over her mothers shoulder i felt a lust of battle rising in me at sight of that woman and it was as much as i could do to control myself but in view of the bad time i knew she was going to have i managed to hold in though i joined very scantly in the polite greetings of the chrysostoms and aristides which she ignored as if they had been the salutations of savages she glared at her husband for explanation and he said gently this is a delegation from the altrurian capital my dear and we have been talking over the situation together  but what is this she demanded that i have heard about our not paying do they accuse us of not paying you could buy and sell the whole country  i never imagined so much mildness could be put into such offensive words as cyril managed to get into his answer we accuse you of not paying and we do not mean that you shall become chargeable to us the men and women who served you on shipboard have been put to work and you must go to work too  mr thralllord moorshave you allowed these people to treat you as if you were part of the ships crew why dont you give them what they want and let them go of course its some sort of blackmailing scheme but you ought to get rid of them at any cost then you can appeal to the authorities and tell them that you will bring the matter to the notice of the government at washington they must be taught that they cannot insult american citizens with impunity no one spoke and she added what do they really want  well my dear her husband hesitated i hardly know how to explain but it seems that they think our living here in the way we do is orderly andand they want us to go to work in short  to work she shouted  yes all of us that is so i understand  what nonsense  she looked at us one after another and when her eye rested on me i began to suspect that insolent as she was she was even duller in fact that she was so sodden in her conceit of wealth that she was plain stupid so when she said to me you are an american by birth i believe can you tell me the meaning of this i answered  cyril chrysostom represents the authorities if he asks me to speak i will speak cyril nodded at me with a smile and i went on it is a very simple matter in altruria everybody works with his hands three hours a day after that he works or not as he likes  what have we to do with that she asked  the rule has no exceptions  but we are not altrurians we are americans  i am an american too and i work three hours every day unless i am passing from one point to another on public business with my husband even then we prefer to stop during the workhours and help in the fields or in the shops or wherever we are needed i left my own mother at home doing her kitchen work yesterday afternoon though it was out of hours and she need not have worked  very well then we will do nothing of the kind neither i nor my daughter nor my husband he has worked hard all his life and he has come away for a muchneeded rest i am not going to have him breaking himself down  i could not help suggesting i suppose the men at work in his mines and mills and on his railroads and steamship lines are taking a muchneeded rest too i hope you are not going to let them break themselves down either  aristides gave me a pained glance and cyril and his wife looked grave but she not quite so grave as he lord moors said we dont seem to be getting on what mrs thrall fails to see and i confess i dont quite see it myself is that if we are not here in forma pauperis  but you are here in forma pauperis cyril interposed smilingly  how is that if we are willing to payif mr thralls credit is undeniably good  mr thralls credit is not good in altruria you can pay here only in one currency in the sweat of your faces  you want us to be tolstoys i suppose mrs thrall said contemptuously  cyril replied gently the endeavor of tolstoy in capitalistic conditions is necessarily dramatic your labor here will be for your daily bread and it will be real the inner dullness of the woman came into her eyes again and he addressed himself to lord moors in continuing if a company of indigent people were cast away on an english coast after you had rendered them the first aid what should you do  the young man reflected i suppose we should put them in the way of earning a living until some ship arrived to take them home  that is merely what we propose to do in your case here cyril said  but we are not indigent  yes you are absolutely destitute you have money and credit but neither has any value in altruria nothing but work or love has any value in altruria you cannot realize too clearly that you stand before us in forma pauperis but we require of you nothing that we do not require of ourselves in altruria every one is poor till he pays with work then for that time he is rich and he cannot otherwise lift himself above charity which except in the case of the helpless we consider immoral your life here offers a very corrupting spectacle you are manifestly living without work and you are served by people whose hire you are not able to pay  my dear sir mr thrall said at this point with a gentle smile i think they are willing to take the chances of being paid  we cannot suffer them to do so at present we know of no means of your getting away from altruria we have disused our custom of annually connecting with the australasian steamers and it may be years before a vessel touches on our coast a ship sailed for boston some months ago with the promise of returning in order that the crew may cast in their lot with us permanently we do not confide in that promise and you must therefore conform to our rule of life understand clearly that the willingness of your servants to serve you has nothing to do with the matter that is part of the falsity in which the whole capitalistic world lives as the matter stands with you here there is as much reason why you should serve them as they should serve you if on their side they should elect to serve you from love they will be allowed to do so otherwise you and they must go to work with the neighbors at the tasks they will assign you  do you mean at once lord moors asked  the hours of the obligatory labors are nearly past for the day but if you are interested in learning what you will be set to doing tomorrow the communal authorities will be pleased to instruct you during the voluntaries this afternoon you may be sure that in no case will your weakness or inexperience be overtasked your histories will be studied and appropriate work will be assigned to each of you  mrs thrall burst out if you think i am going into my kitchen  then i burst in i left my mother in her kitchen  and a very fit place for her i dare say she retorted but lady moors caught her mothers arm and murmured in much the same distress as showed in my husbands mild eyes mother mother and drew her within     xiii   well dolly i suppose you will think it was pretty hard for those people and when i got over my temper i confess that i felt sorry for the two men and for the young girl whom the altrurians would not call lady moors but addressed by her christian name as they did each of the american party in his or her turn even mrs thrall had to answer to rebecca they were all rather bewildered and so were the butler and the footmen and the chef and his helpers and the ladies maids these were even more shocked than those they considered their betters and i quite took to my affections lord moors man robert who was in an awestricken way trying to get some light from me on the situation he contributed as much as any one to bring about a peaceful submission to the inevitable for he had been a near witness of what had happened to the crew when they attempted their rebellion to the authorities but he did not profess to understand the matter and from time to time he seemed to question the reality of it  the two masters as you would call mr thrall and lord moors both took an attitude of amiable curiosity towards their fate and accepted it with interest when they had partly chosen and partly been chosen by it mr thrall had been brought up on a farm till his ambition carried him into the world and he found the light gardening assigned him for his first task by no means a hardship he was rather critical of the altrurian style of hoe at first but after he got the hang of it as he said he liked it better and during the three hours of the first mornings obligatoires his ardor to cut all the weeds out at once had to be restrained rather than prompted he could not be persuaded to take five minutes for rest out of every twenty and he could not get over his lifelong habit of working against time the altrurians tried to make him understand that here people must not work against time but must always work with it so as to have enough work to do each day otherwise they must remain idle during the obligatoires and tend to demoralize the workers it seemed that lady moors had a passion for gardening and she was set to work with her father on the border of flowers surrounding the vegetable patch he was hoeing she knew about flowers and from her childhood had amused herself by growing them and so far from thinking it a hardship or disgrace to dig she was delighted to get at them it was easy to see that she and her father were cronies and when i went round in the morning with aristides to ask if we could do anything for them we heard them laughing and talking gayly together before we reached them they said they had looked their job as mr thrall called it over the afternoon before during the voluntaries and had decided how they would manage and they had set to work that morning as soon as they had breakfast lady moors had helped her mother get the breakfast and she seemed to regard the whole affair as a picnic though from the look of mrs thralls back as she turned it on me when i saw her coming to the door of the marquee with a coffeepot in her hand i decided that she was not yet resigned to her new lot in life  lord moors was nowhere to be seen and i felt some little curiosity about him which was not quite anxiety later as we were going back to our quarters in the village we saw him working on the road with a party of altrurians who were repairing a washout from an overnight rain they were having all kinds of a time except a bad time trying to understand each other in their want of a common language it appeared that the altrurians were impressed with his knowledge of roadmaking and were doing something which he had indicated to them by signs we offered our services as interpreters and then he modestly owned in defence of his suggestions that when he was at oxford he had been one of the band of enthusiastic undergraduates who had built a piece of highway under mr ruskins direction the altrurians regarded his suggestions as rather amateurish but they were glad to act upon them when they could out of pure good feeling and liking for him and from time to time they rushed upon him and shook hands with him their affection did not go further and he was able to stand the handshaking though he told us he hoped they would not feel it necessary to keep it up for it was really only a very simple matter like putting a culvert in place of a sluice which they had been using to carry the water off they understood what he was saying from his gestures and they crowded round us to ask whether he would like to join them during the voluntaries that afternoon in getting the stone out of a neighboring quarry and putting in the culvert at once we explained to him and he said he should be very happy all the time he was looking at them admirably and he said its really very good and we understood that he meant their classic workingdress and when he added i should really fancy trying it myself one day and we told them they wanted to go and bring him an altrurian costume at once but we persuaded them not to urge him and in fact he looked very fit for his work in his yachting flannels  i talked him over a long time with aristides and tried to get his point of view i decided finally that an englishman of his ancient lineage and high breeding having voluntarily come down to the level of an american millionaire by marriage could not feel that he was lowering himself any further by working with his hands in fact he probably felt that his merely undertaking a thing dignified the thing but of course this was only speculation on my part and he may have been resigned to working for a living because like poor people elsewhere he was obliged to do it aristides thought there was a good deal in that idea but it is hard for an altrurian to conceive of being ashamed of work for they regard idleness as pauperism and they would look upon our leisure classes so far as we have them very much as we look upon tramps only they would make the excuse for our tramps that they often cannot get work  we had far more trouble with the servants than we had with the masters in making them understand that they were to go to work in the fields and shops quite as the crew of the yacht had done some of them refused outright and stuck to their refusal until the village electrician rescued them with the sort of net and electric filament which had been employed with the recalcitrant sailors others were brought to a better mind by withholding food from them till they were willing to pay for it by working you will be sorry to learn dolly that the worst of the rebels were the ladies maids who for the honor of our sex ought not to have required the application of the net and filament but they had not such appetites as the menservants and did not mind starving so much however in a very short time they were at work too and more or less resigned though they did not profess to understand it  you will think me rather fickle i am afraid but after i made the personal acquaintance of mr thralls chef anatole i found my affections dividing themselves between him and his lordships man robert my first love but anatole was magnificent a gaunt little aquiline man with a branching mustache and gallant goatee and having held an exalted position at a salary of ten thousand a year from mr thrall he could easily stoop from it while poor robert was tormented with misgivings not for himself but for lord and lady moors and mr thrall it became my pleasing office to explain the situation to monsieur anatole who when he imagined it gave a cry of joy and confessed what he had never liked to tell mr thrall knowing the misconceptions of americans on the subject that he had belonged in france to a party of which the political and social ideal was almost identical with that of the altrurians he asked for an early opportunity of addressing the village assembly and explaining this delightful circumstance in public and he profited by the occasion to embrace the first altrurian we met and kiss him on both cheeks  his victim was a messenger from the commune who had been sent to inquire whether anatole had a preference as to the employment which should be assigned to him and i had to reply for him that he was a man of science that he would be happy to serve the republic in whatever capacity his concitizens chose but that he thought he could be most useful in studying the comestible vegetation of the neighborhood and the substitution of the more succulent herbs for the fleshmeats to the use of which he understood from me the altrurians were opposed in the course of his preparation for the rôle of chef which he had played both in france and america he had made a specialty of edible fungi and the result was that anatole was set to mushrooming and up to this moment he has discovered no less than six species hitherto unknown to the altrurian table this has added to their dietary in several important particulars the fungi he has discovered being among those highly decorative and extremely poisonouslooking sorts which flourish in the deep woods and offer themselves almost inexhaustibly in places near the ruins of the old capitalistic cities where hardly any other foods will grow anatole is very proud of his success and at more than one communal assembly has lectured upon his discoveries and treated of their preparation for the table with sketches of them as he found them growing colored after nature by his own hand he has himself become a fanatical vegetarian having he confesses always had a secret loathing for the meats he stooped to direct the cooking of among the french and american bourgeoisie in the days which he already looks back upon as among the most benighted of his history     xiv   the scene has changed again dolly and six months have elapsed without your knowing it aristides and i long ago completed the tour of the capitals which the thrall incident interrupted and we have been settled for many months in the maritime capital where it has been decided we had better fill out the first two years of my husbands repatriation i have become more and more thoroughly naturalized and if i am not yet a perfect altrurian it is not for not loving better and better the best altrurian of them all and not for not admiring and revering this wonderful civilization  during the obligatories of the forenoons i do my housework with my own hands and as my mother lives with us we have long talks together and try to make each other believe that the american conditions were a sort of nightmare from which we have happily awakened you see how terribly frank i am my dear but if i were not i could not make you understand how i feel my heart aches for you there and the more because i know that you do not want to live differently that you are proud of your economic and social illogicality and that you think america is the best country under the sun i can never persuade you but if you could only come here once and see for yourselves seeing would be believing and believing would be the wish never to go away but to be at home here always  i can imagine your laughing at me and asking mr makely whether the little sally has ever returned to altruria and how i can account for the captains failure to keep his word i confess that is a sore point with me it is now more than a year since she sailed and of course we have not had a sign or whisper from her i could almost wish that the crew were willing to stay away but i am afraid it is the captain who is keeping them it has become almost a mania with me and every morning the first thing when i wake i go for my beforebreakfast walk along the marble terrace that overlooks the sea and scan the empty rounding for the recreant ship i do not want to think so badly of human nature as i must if the little sally never comes back and i am sure you will not blame me if i should like her to bring me some word from you i know that if she ever reached boston you got my letters and presents and that you have been writing me as faithfully as i have been writing you and what a sheaf of letters from you there will be if her masts ever pierce the horizon to tell the truth i do long for a little american news do you still keep on murdering and divorcing and drowning and burning and mommicking and maiming people by sea and land has there been any war since i left is the financial panic as great as ever and is there as much hunger and cold i know that whatever your crimes and calamities are your heroism and martyrdom your wild generosity and selfdevotion are equal to them  it is no use to pretend that in little over a year i can have become accustomed to the eventlessness of life in altruria i go on for a good many days together and do not miss the exciting incidents you have in america and then suddenly i am wolfishly hungry for the old sensations just as now and then i want meat though i know i should loathe the sight and smell of it if i came within reach of it you would laugh i dare say at the altrurian papers and what they print for news most of the space is taken up with poetry and character study in the form of fiction and scientific inquiry of every kind but now and then there is a report of the production of a new play in one of the capitals or an account of an openair pastoral in one of the communes or the progress of some public work like the extension of the national colonnade or the wonderful liberation of some section from malaria or the story of some good man or womans life ended at the patriarchal age they reach here they also print selected passages of capitalistic history from the earliest to the latest times showing how in war and pestilence and needless disaster the world outside altruria remains essentially the same that it was at the beginning of civilization with some slight changes through the changes of human nature for the better in its slow approaches to the altrurian ideal in noting these changes the writers get some sad amusement out of the fact that the capitalistic world believes human nature cannot be changed though cannibalism and slavery and polygamy have all been extirpated in the socalled christian countries and these things were once human nature which is always changing while brute nature remains the same now and then they touch very guardedly on that slavery worse than war worse than any sin or shame conceivable to the altrurians in which uncounted myriads of women are held and bought and sold and they have to note that in this the capitalistic world is without the hope of better things you know what i mean dolly every good woman knows the little she cannot help knowing but if you had ever inquired into that horror as i once felt obliged to do you would think it the blackest horror of the state of things where it must always exist as long as there are riches and poverty now when so many things in america seem bad dreams i cannot take refuge in thinking that a bad dream the reality was so deeply burnt into my brain by the words of some of the slaves and when i think of it i want to grovel on the ground with my mouth in the dust but i know this can only distress you for you cannot get away from the fact as i have got away from it that there it is in the next street perhaps in the next house and that any night when you leave your home with your husband you may meet it at the first step from your door  you can very well imagine what a godsend the reports of aristides and the discussions of them have been to our papers they were always taken down stenographically and they were printed like dialogue so that at a little distance you would take them at first for murder trials or divorce cases but when you look closer you find them questions and answers about the state of things in america there are often humorous passages for the altrurians are inextinguishably amused by our illogicality and what they call the perpetual non sequiturs of our lives and laws in the discussions they frequently burlesque these but as they present them they seem really beyond the wildest burlesque perhaps you will be surprised to know that a nation of workingpeople like these feel more compassion than admiration for our workingpeople they pity them but they blame them more than they blame the idle rich for the existing condition of things in america they ask why if the american workmen are in the immense majority they do not vote a true and just state and why they go on striking and starving their families instead they cannot distinguish in principle between the confederations of labor and the combinations of capital between the trusts and the tradesunions and they condemn even more severely the oppressions and abuses of the unions my husband tries to explain that the unions are merely provisional and are a temporary means of enabling the employees to stand up against the tyranny of the employers but they always come back and ask him if the workmen have not most of the votes and if they have why they do not protect themselves peacefully instead of organizing themselves in fighting shape and making a warfare of industry  there is not often anything so much like news in the altrurian papers as the grounding of the thrall yacht on the coast of the seventh region and the incident has been treated and discussed in every possible phase by the editors and their correspondents they have been very frank about it as they are about everything in altruria and they have not concealed their anxieties about their unwelcome guests they got on without much trouble in the case of the few sailors of the little sally but the crew of the saraband is so large that it is a different matter in the first place they do not like the application of force even in the mild electrical form in which they employ it and they fear that the effect with themselves will be bad however good it is for their guests besides they dread the influence which a number of people invested with the charm of strangeness may have with the young men and especially the young girls of the neighborhood the hardest thing the altrurians have to grapple with is feminine curiosity and the play of this about the strangers is what they seek the most anxiously to control of course you will think it funny and i must say that it seemed so to me at first but i have come to think it is serious the altrurian girls are cultivated and refined but as they have worked all their lives with their hands they cannot imagine the difference that work makes in americans that it coarsens and classes them especially if they have been in immediate contact with rich people and been degraded or brutalized by the knowledge of the contempt in which labor is held among us by those who are not compelled to it some of my altrurian friends have talked it over with me and i could take their point of view though secretly i could not keep my poor american feelings from being hurt when they said that to have a large number of people from the capitalistic world thrown upon their hands was very much as it would be with us if we had the same number of indians with all their tribal customs and ideals thrown upon our hands they say they will not shirk their duty in the matter and will study it carefully but all the same they wish the incident had not happened    xv   i am glad that i was called away from the disagreeable point i left in my last and that i have got back temporarily to the scene of the altrurianization of mr thrall and his family so far as it has gone it is perfect if i may speak from the witness of happiness in those concerned except perhaps mrs thrall she is as yet only partially reconstructed but even she has moments of forgetting her lost grandeur and of really enjoying herself in her work she is an excellent housekeeper and she has become so much interested in making the marquee a simple home for her family that she is rather proud of showing it off as the effect of her unaided efforts she was allowed to cater to them from the canned meats brought ashore from the yacht as long as they would stand it but the wholesome openair conditions have worked a wonderful change in them and neither mr thrall nor lord and lady moors now have any taste for such dishes here mrs thralls oldtime skill as an excellent vegetable cook when she was the wife of a young mechanic has come into play and she believes that she sets the best table in the whole neighborhood with fruits and many sorts of succulents and the everlasting and everpervading mushrooms  as the altrurians do not wish to annoy their involuntary guests or to interfere with their way of life where they do not consider it immoral their control has ended with setting them to work for a living they have not asked them to the communal refectory but as long as they have been content to serve each other have allowed them their private table of course their adaptation to their new way of life has proceeded more slowly than it otherwise would but with the exception of mrs thrall they are very intelligent people and i have been charmed in talking the situation over with them the trouble has not been so great with the ships people as was feared such of these as have imagined their stay here permanent or wished it to be so have been received into the neighboring communes and have taken the first steps towards naturalization those who look forward to getting away some time or express the wish for it are allowed to live in a community of their own where they are not molested as long as they work in the three hours of the obligatoires naturally they are kept out of mischief but after their first instruction in the ideas of public property and the impossibility of enriching themselves at the expense of any one else they have behaved very well the greatest trouble they ever gave was in trapping and killing the wild things for food but when they were told that this must not be done and taught to recognize the vast range of edible fungi they took not unwillingly to mushrooms and the ranker tubers and roots from which with unlimited eggs cheese milk and shellfish they have constructed a diet of which they do not complain  this brings me rather tangentially to monsieur anatole who has become a fanatical altrurian and has even had to be restrained in some of his enthusiastic plans for the compulsory naturalization of his fellow castaways his value as a scientist has been cordially recognized and his gifts as an artist in the exquisite watercolor studies of edible fungi has won his notice in the capital of the seventh regional where they have been shown at the spring watercolor exhibition he has printed several poems in the regional gazette villanelles rondeaux and triolets with accompanying versions of the french into altrurian by one of the first altrurian poets this is a widow of about monsieur anatoles own age and the literary friendship between them has ripened into something much more serious in fact they are engaged to be married i suppose you will laugh at this dolly and at first i confess that there was enough of the old american in me to be shocked at the idea of a french chef marrying an altrurian lady who could trace her descent to the first altrurian president of the commonwealth and who is universally loved and honored i could not help letting something of the kind escape me by accident to a friend and presently mrs chrysostom was sent to interview me on the subject and to learn just how the case appeared to me this put me on my honor and i was obliged to say how it would appear in america though every moment i grew more and more ashamed of myself and my native country where we pretend that labor is honorable and are always heaping dishonor on it i told how certain of our girls and matrons had married their coachmen and ridingmasters and put themselves at odds with society and i confessed that marrying a cook would be regarded as worse if possible  mrs chrysostom was accompanied by a lady in her second youth very graceful very charmingly dressed and with an expression of winning intelligence whom she named to me simply as cecilia in the altrurian fashion she apparently knew no english and at first mrs chrysostom translated each of her questions and my answers when i had got through this lady began to question me herself in altrurian which i owned to understanding a little she said  you know anatole  yes certainly and i like him as i think every one must who knows him  he is a skillful chef  mr thrall would not have paid him ten thousand dollars a year if he had not been  you have seen some of his watercolors  yes they are exquisite he is unquestionably an artist of rare talent  and it is known to you that he is a man of scientific attainments  that is something i cannot judge of so well as aristides but he says m anatole is learned beyond any man he knows in edible fungi  as an adoptive altrurian and knowing the american ideas from our point of view should you respect their ideas of social inequality  not the least in the world i understand as well as you do that their ideas must prevail wherever one works for a living and another does not hose ideas are practically as much accepted in america as they are in europe but i have fully renounced them  you see dolly how far i have gone  the unknown who could be pretty easily imagined rose up and gave me her hand if you are in the region on the third of may you must come to our wedding  the same afternoon i had a long talk with mr thrall whom i found at work replanting a strawberrypatch during the voluntaries he rose up at the sound of my voice and after an old mans dim moment for getting me mentally in focus he brightened into a genial smile and said oh mrs homos i am glad to see you  i told him to go on with his planting and i offered to get down on my knees beside him and help but he gallantly handed me to a seat in the shade beside his daughters flowerbed and it was there that we had a long talk about conditions in america and altruria and how he felt about the great change in his life  well i can truly say he answered much more at length than i shall report that i have never been so happy since the first days of my boyhood all care has dropped from me i dont feel myself rich and i dont feel myself poor in this perfect safety from want the only thing that gives me any regret is that my present state has not been the effect of my own will and deed if i am now following the greatest and truest of all counsels it has not been because i have sold all and given to the poor but because my money has been mercifully taken from me and i have been released from its responsibilities in a state of things where there is no money  but mr thrall i said dont you ever feel that you have a duty to the immense fortune which you have left in america and which must be disposed of somehow when people are satisfied that you are not going to return and dispose of it yourself  no none i was long ago satisfied that i could really do no good with it perhaps if i had had more faith in it i might have done some good with it but i believe that i never did anything but harm even when i seemed to be helping the most for i was aiding in the perpetuation of a state of things essentially wrong now if i never go backand i never wish to go backlet the law dispose of it as seems best to the authorities i have no kith or kin and my wife has none so there is no one to feel aggrieved by its application to public objects  and how do you imagine it will be disposed of  oh i suppose for charitable and educational purposes of course a good deal of it will go in graft but that cannot be helped  but if you could now dispose of it according to your clearest ideas of justice and if you were forced to make the disposition yourself what would you do with it  well that is something i have been thinking of and as nearly as i can make out i ought to go into the records of my prosperity and ascertain just how and when i made my money then i ought to seek out as fully as possible the workmen who helped me make it by their labor their wages which were always the highest were never a fair share though i forced myself to think differently and it should be my duty to inquire for them and pay them each a fair share or if they are dead then their children or their next of kin but even when i had done this i should not be sure that i had not done them more harm than good  how often i had heard poor mr strange say things like this and heard of other rich men saying them after lives of what is called beneficence mr thrall drew a deep sigh and cast a longing look at his strawberrybed i laughed and said you are anxious to get back to your plants and i wont keep you i wonder if mrs thrall could see me if i called or lady moors  he said he was sure they would and i took my way over to the marquee i was a little surprised to be met at the door by lord moors man robert he told me he was very sorry but her ladyship was helping his lordship at a little job on the roads which they were doing quite in the voluntaries with the hope of having the national colonnade extended to a given point the ladies were helping the gentlemen get the place in shape he was still sorrier but i not so much that mrs thrall was lying down and would like to be excused she was rather tired from putting away the luncheon things  he asked me if i would not sit down and he offered me one of the campstools at the door of the marquee and i did sit down for a moment while he flitted about the interior doing various little things at last i said how is this robert i thought you had been assigned to a place in the communal refectory youre not here on the old terms  he came out and stood respectfully holding a dustingcloth in his hand thank you not exactly maam but the fact is maam that the communal monitors have allowed me to come back here a few hours in the afternoon on what i may call terms of my own  i dont understand but wont you sit down robert  thank you if it is the same to you maam i would rather stand while im here in the refectory of course its different  but about your own terms  thanks you see maam ive thought all along it was a bit awkward for them here they not being so much used to looking after things and i asked leave to come and help now and then of course they said that i could not be allowed to serve for hire in altruria and one thing led to another and i said it would really be a favor to me and i didnt expect money for my work for i did not suppose i should ever be where i could use it again but if they would let me come here and do it for  robert stopped and blushed and looked down and i took the word for love  well maam thats what they called it  dolly it made the tears come into my eyes and i said very solemnly robert do you know i believe you are the sweetest soul even in this and flowing with milk and honey  oh you mustnt say that maam theres mr thrall and his lordship and her ladyship im sure they would do the like for me if i needed their help and there are the altrurians you know  but they are used to it robert androbert be frank with me what do you think of altruria  quite frank maam as if you were not connected with it as you are  quite frank  well maam if you are sure you wouldnt mind it or consider it out of the way for me i should say it wasrum  rum dont you think it is beautiful here to see people living for each other instead of living on each other and the whole nation like one family and the country a paradise  well thats just it maam if you wont mind my saying so thats what i mean by rum  wont you explain  it doesnt seem real every night when i go to sleep and think that there isnt a thief or a policeman on the whole continent and only a few harmless homicides as you call them that wouldnt hurt a fly and not a person hungry or cold and no poor and no rich and no servants and no masters and no soldiers and nodisreputable characters it seems as if i was going to wake up in the morning and find myself on the saraband and it all a dream here  yes robert i had to own that was the way with me too for a long while and even now i have dreams about america and the way matters are there and i wake myself weeping for fear altruria isnt true robert you must be honest with me when you are awake and its broad day and you see how happy every one is here either working or playing and the whole land without an ugly place in it and the lovely villages and the magnificent towns and everything does it still seemrum  its like that maam at times i dont say at all times  and you dont believe that the rest of the worldengland and americawill ever be rum too  i dont see how they can you see the poor are against it as well as the rich everybody wants to have something of his own and the trouble seems to come from that i dont suppose it was brought about in a day altruria wasnt maam  no it was whole centuries coming  that was what i understood from that mr chrysostomcyril he wants me to call him but i cant quite make up my mouth to itwho speaks english and says he has been in england he was telling me about it one day when we were drying the dishes at the refectory together he says they used to have wars and trusts and tradesunions here in the old days just as we do now in civilized countries  and you dont consider altruria civilized  well not in just that sense of the word maam you wouldnt call heaven civilized  well not in just that sense of the word robert  you see its rum here because though everything seems to go so right its against human nature  the altrurians say it isnt  i hope i dont differ from you maam but what would peoplethe best peopleat home say they would say it wasnt reasonable they would say it wasnt even possible thats what makes me think its a dreamthat its rum begging your pardon maam  oh i quite understand robert then you dont believe a camel can ever go through the eye of a needle  i dont quite see how maam  but you are proof of as great a miracle robert  beg your pardon maam  some day i will explain but is there nothing that can make you believe altruria is true here and that it can be true anywhere  i have been thinking a good deal about that maam one doesnt quite like to go about in a dream or think one is dreaming and i have got to saying to myself that if some ship was to come here from england or america or even from germany and we could compare our feelings with the feelings of people who were fresh to it we might somehow get to believe that it was real  yes i had to own we need fresh proofs from time to time there was a ship that sailed from here something over a year ago and the captain promised his crew to let them bring her back but at times i am afraid that was part of the dream too and that were all something i am dreaming about  just so maam robert said and i came away downhearted enough though he called after me mrs thrall will be very sorry maam  back in the maritime capital and oh dolly dolly dolly they have sighted the little sally from the terrace how happy i am there will be letters from you and i shall hear all that has happened in america and i shall never again doubt that altruria is real i dont know how i shall get these letters of mine back to you but somehow it can be managed perhaps the sarabands crew will like to take the little sally home again perhaps when mr thrall knows the ship is here he will want to buy it and go back to his money in america and the misery of it do you believe he will should i like to remind my husband of his promise to take me home on a visit oh my heart misgives me i wonder if the captain of the little sally has brought his wife and children with him and is going to settle among us or whether he has just let his men have the vessel and they have come to altruria without him i dare not ask anything i dare not think anything   the end
