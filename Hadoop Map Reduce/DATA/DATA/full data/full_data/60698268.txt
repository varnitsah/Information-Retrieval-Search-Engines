                   chapter xcvi     chapter i  shewing how wrath began      illustration  when louis trevelyan was twentyfour years old he had all the world before him where to choose and among other things he chose to go to the mandarin islands and there fell in love with emily rowley the daughter of sir marmaduke the governor sir marmaduke rowley at this period of his life was a respectable middleaged public servant in good repute who had however as yet achieved for himself neither an exalted position nor a large fortune he had been governor of many islands and had never lacked employment and now at the age of fifty found himself at the mandarins with a salary of £3000 a year living in a temperature at which 80° in the shade is considered to be cool with eight daughters and not a shilling saved a governor at the mandarins who is social by nature and hospitable on principle cannot save money in the islands even on £3000 a year when he has eight daughters and at the mandarins though hospitality is a duty the gentlemen who ate sir rowleys dinners were not exactly the men whom he or lady rowley desired to welcome to their bosoms as sonsinlaw nor when mr trevelyan came that way desirous of seeing everything in the somewhat indefinite course of his travels had emily rowley the eldest of the flock then twenty years of age seen as yet any mandariner who exactly came up to her fancy and as louis trevelyan was a remarkably handsome young man who was well connected who had been ninth wrangler at cambridge who had already published a volume of poems and who possessed £3000 a year of his own arising from various perfectly secure investments he was not forced to sigh long in vain indeed the rowleys one and all felt that providence had been very good to them in sending young trevelyan on his travels in that direction for he seemed to be a very pearl among men both sir marmaduke and lady rowley felt that there might be objections to such a marriage as that proposed to them raised by the trevelyan family lady rowley would not have liked her daughter to go to england to be received with cold looks by strangers but it soon appeared that there was no one to make objections louis the lover had no living relative nearer than cousins his father a barrister of repute had died a widower and had left the money which he had made to an only child the head of the family was a first cousin who lived in cornwall on a moderate propertya very good sort of stupid fellow as louis said who would be quite indifferent as to any marriage that his cousin might make no man could be more independent or more clearly justified in pleasing himself than was this lover and then he himself proposed that the second daughter nora should come and live with them in london what a lover to fall suddenly from the heavens into such a dovecote  i havent a pennypiece to give to either of them said sir rowley  it is my idea that girls should not have fortunes said trevelyan at any rate i am quite sure that men should never look for money a man must be more comfortable and i think is likely to be more affectionate when the money has belonged to himself  sir rowley was a highminded gentleman who would have liked to have handed over a few thousand pounds on giving up his daughters but having no thousands of pounds to hand over he could not but admire the principles of his proposed soninlaw as it was about time for him to have his leave of absence he and sundry of the girls went to england with mr trevelyan and the wedding was celebrated in london by the rev oliphant outhouse of saint diddulphintheeast who had married sir rowleys sister then a small house was taken and furnished in curzon street mayfair and the rowleys went back to the seat of their government leaving nora the second girl in charge of her elder sister  the rowleys had found on reaching london that they had lighted upon a pearl indeed louis trevelyan was a man of whom all people said all good things he might have been a fellow of his college had he not been a man of fortune he might alreadyso sir rowley was toldhave been in parliament had he not thought it to be wiser to wait awhile indeed he was very wise in many things he had gone out on his travels thus youngnot in search of excitement to kill beasts or to encounter he knew not what novelty and amusementbut that he might see men and know the world he had been on his travels for more than a year when the winds blew him to the mandarins oh how blessed were the winds and moreover sir rowley found that his soninlaw was well spoken of at the clubs by those who had known him during his university career as a man popular as well as wise not a bookworm or a dry philosopher or a prig he could talk on all subjects was very generous a man sure to be honoured and respected and then such a handsome manly fellow with short brown hair a nose divinely chiselled an apollos mouth six feet high with shoulders and legs and arms in proportiona pearl of pearls only as lady rowley was the first to find out he liked to have his own way  but his way is such a good way said sir marmaduke he will be such a good guide for the girls  but emily likes her way too said lady rowley  sir marmaduke argued the matter no further but thought no doubt that such a husband as louis trevelyan was entitled to have his own way he probably had not observed his daughters temper so accurately as his wife had done with eight of them coming up around him how should he have observed their tempers at any rate if there were anything amiss with emilys temper it would be well that she should find her master in such a husband as louis trevelyan  for nearly two years the little household in curzon street went on well or if anything was the matter no one outside of the little household was aware of it and there was a baby a boy a young louis and a baby in such a household is apt to make things go sweetly  the marriage had taken place in july and after the wedding tour there had been a winter and a spring in london and then they passed a month or two at the seaside after which the baby had been born and then there came another winter and another spring nora rowley was with them in london and by this time mr trevelyan had begun to think that he should like to have his own way completely his baby was very nice and his wife was clever pretty and attractive nora was all that an unmarried sister should be butbut there had come to be trouble and bitter words lady rowley had been right when she said that her daughter emily also liked to have her own way  if i am suspected said mrs trevelyan to her sister one morning as they sat together in the little back drawingroom life will not be worth having  how can you talk of being suspected emily  what does he mean then by saying that he would rather not have colonel osborne here a man older than my own father who has known me since i was a baby  he didnt mean anything of that kind emily you know he did not and you should not say so it would be too horrible to think of  it was a great deal too horrible to be spoken i know if he does not beg my pardon i shalli shall continue to live with him of course as a sort of upper servant because of baby but he shall know what i think and feel  if i were you i would forget it  how can i forget it nothing that i can do pleases him he is civil and kind to you because he is not your master but you dont know what things he says to me am i to tell colonel osborne not to come heavens and earth how should i ever hold up my head again if i were driven to do that he will be here today i have no doubt and louis will sit there below in the library and hear his step and will not come up  tell richard to say you are not at home  yes and everybody will understand why and for what am i to deny myself in that way to the best and oldest friend i have if any such orders are to be given let him give them and then see what will come of it  mrs trevelyan had described colonel osborne truly as far as words went in saying that he had known her since she was a baby and that he was an older man than her father colonel osbornes age exceeded her fathers by about a month and as he was now past fifty he might be considered perhaps in that respect to be a safe friend for a young married woman but he was in every respect a man very different from sir marmaduke sir marmaduke blessed and at the same time burdened as he was with a wife and eight daughters and condemned as he had been to pass a large portion of his life within the tropics had become at fifty what many people call quite a middleaged man that is to say he was one from whom the effervescence and elasticity and salt of youth had altogether passed away he was fat and slow thinking much of his wife and eight daughters thinking much also of his dinner now colonel osborne was a bachelor with no burdens but those imposed upon him by his position as a member of parliamenta man of fortune to whom the world had been very easy it was not therefore said so decidedly of him as of sir marmaduke that he was a middleaged man although he had probably already lived more than twothirds of his life and he was a goodlooking man of his age bald indeed at the top of his head and with a considerable sprinkling of grey hair through his bushy beard but upright in his carriage active and quick in his step who dressed well and was clearly determined to make the most he could of what remained to him of the advantages of youth colonel osborne was always so dressed that no one ever observed the nature of his garments being no doubt well aware that no man after twentyfive can afford to call special attention to his coat his hat his cravat or his trousers but nevertheless the matter was one to which he paid much attention and he was by no means lax in ascertaining what his tailor did for him he always rode a pretty horse and mounted his groom on one at any rate as pretty he was known to have an excellent stud down in the shires and had the reputation of going well with hounds poor sir marmaduke could not have ridden a hunt to save either his government or his credit when therefore mrs trevelyan declared to her sister that colonel osborne was a man whom she was entitled to regard with semiparental feelings of veneration because he was older than her father she made a comparison which was more true in the letter than in the spirit and when she asserted that colonel osborne had known her since she was a baby she fell again into the same mistake colonel osborne had indeed known her when she was a baby and had in old days been the very intimate friend of her father but of herself he had seen little or nothing since those baby days till he had met her just as she was about to become mrs trevelyan and though it was natural that so old a friend should come to her and congratulate her and renew his friendship nevertheless it was not true that he made his appearance in her husbands house in the guise of the useful old family friend who gives silver cups to the children and kisses the little girls for the sake of the old affection which he has borne for the parents we all know the appearance of that old gentleman how pleasant and dear a fellow he is how welcome is his face within the gate how free he makes with our wine generally abusing it how he tells our eldest daughter to light his candle for him how he gave silver cups when the girls were born and now bestows teaservices as they get marrieda most useful safe and charming fellow not a year youngerlooking or more nimble than ourselves without whom life would be very blank we all know that man but such a man was not colonel osborne in the house of mr trevelyans young bride  emily rowley when she was brought home from the mandarin islands to be the wife of louis trevelyan was a very handsome young woman tall with a bust rather full for her age with dark eyeseyes that looked to be dark because her eyebrows and eyelashes were nearly black but which were in truth so varying in colour that you could not tell their hue her brown hair was very dark and very soft and the tint of her complexion was brown also though the colour of her cheeks was often so bright as to induce her enemies to say falsely of her that she painted them and she was very strong as are some girls who come from the tropics and whom a tropical climate has suited she could sit on her horse the whole day long and would never be weary with dancing at the government house balls when colonel osborne was introduced to her as the baby whom he had known he thought it would be very pleasant to be intimate with so pleasant a friendmeaning no harm indeed as but few men do mean harm on such occasionsbut still not regarding the beautiful young woman whom he had seen as one of a generation succeeding to that of his own to whom it would be his duty to make himself useful on account of the old friendship which he bore to her father  it was moreover well known in londonthough not known at all to mrs trevelyanthat this ancient lothario had before this made himself troublesome in more than one family he was fond of intimacies with married ladies and perhaps was not averse to the excitement of marital hostility it must be remembered however that the hostility to which allusion is here made was not the hostility of the pistol or the horsewhipnor indeed was it generally the hostility of a word of spoken anger a young husband may dislike the toofriendly bearing of a friend and may yet abstain from that outrage on his own dignity and on his wife which is conveyed by a word of suspicion louis trevelyan having taken a strong dislike to colonel osborne and having failed to make his wife understand that this dislike should have induced her to throw cold water upon the colonels friendship had allowed himself to speak a word which probably he would have willingly recalled as soon as spoken but words spoken cannot be recalled and many a man and many a woman who has spoken a word at once regretted are far too proud to express that regret so it was with louis trevelyan when he told his wife that he did not wish colonel osborne to come so often to his house he had said it with a flashing eye and an angry tone and though she had seen the eye flash before and was familiar with the angry tone she had never before felt herself to be insulted by her husband as soon as the word had been spoken trevelyan had left the room and had gone down among his books but when he was alone he knew that he had insulted his wife he was quite aware that he should have spoken to her gently and have explained to her with his arm round her waist that it would be better for both of them that this friends friendship should be limited there is so much in a turn of the eye and in the tone given to a word when such things have to be saidso much more of importance than in the words themselves as trevelyan thought of this and remembered what his manner had been how much anger he had expressed how far he had been from having his arm round his wifes waist as he spoke to her he almost made up his mind to go upstairs and to apologise but he was one to whose nature the giving of any apology was repulsive he could not bear to have to own himself to have been wrong and then his wife had been most provoking in her manner to him when he had endeavoured to make her understand his wishes by certain disparaging hints which he had thrown out as to colonel osborne saying that he was a dangerous man one who did not show his true character a snake in the grass a man without settled principles and such like his wife had taken up the cudgels for her friend and had openly declared that she did not believe a word of the things that were alleged against him but still for all that it is true the husband had said i have no doubt that you think so the wife had replied men do believe evil of one another very often but you must excuse me if i say that i think you are mistaken i have known colonel osborne much longer than you have done louis and papa has always had the highest opinion of him then mr trevelyan had become very angry and had spoken those words which he could not recall as he walked to and fro among his books downstairs he almost felt that he ought to beg his wifes pardon he knew his wife well enough to be sure that she would not forgive him unless he did so he would do so he thought but not exactly now a moment would come in which it might be easier than at present he would be able to assure her when he went up to dress for dinner that he had meant no harm they were going out to dine at the house of a lady of rank the countess dowager of milborough a lady standing high in the worlds esteem of whom his wife stood a little in awe and he calculated that this feeling if it did not make his task easy would yet take from it some of its difficulty emily would be not exactly cowed by the prospect of lady milboroughs dinner but perhaps a little reduced from her usual selfassertion he would say a word to her when he was dressing assuring her that he had not intended to animadvert in the slightest degree upon her own conduct      illustration shewing how wrath began   luncheon was served and the two ladies went down into the diningroom mr trevelyan did not appear there was nothing in itself singular in that as he was accustomed to declare that luncheon was a meal too much in the day and that a man should eat nothing beyond a biscuit between breakfast and dinner but he would sometimes come in and eat his biscuit standing on the hearthrug and drink what he would call half a quarter of a glass of sherry it would probably have been well that he should have done so now but he remained in his library behind the diningroom and when his wife and his sisterinlaw had gone upstairs he became anxious to learn whether colonel osborne would come on that day and if so whether he would be admitted he had been told that nora rowley was to be called for by another lady a mrs fairfax to go out and look at pictures his wife had declined to join mrs fairfaxs party having declared that as she was going to dine out she would not leave her baby all the afternoon louis trevelyan though he strove to apply his mind to an article which he was writing for a scientific quarterly review could not keep himself from anxiety as to this expected visit from colonel osborne he was not in the least jealous he swore to himself fifty times over that any such feeling on his part would be a monstrous injury to his wife nevertheless he knew that he would be gratified if on that special day colonel osborne should be informed that his wife was not at home whether the man were admitted or not he would beg his wifes pardon but he could he thought do so with more thorough efficacy and affection if she should have shown a disposition to comply with his wishes on this day  do say a word to richard said nora to her sister in a whisper as they were going upstairs after luncheon  i will not said mrs trevelyan  may i do it  certainly not nora i should feel that i were demeaning myself were i to allow what was said to me in such a manner to have any effect upon me  i think you are so wrong emily i do indeed  you must allow me to be the best judge what to do in my own house and with my own husband  oh yes certainly  if he gives me any command i will obey it or if he had expressed his wish in any other words i would have complied but to be told that he would rather not have colonel osborne here if you had seen his manner and heard his words you would not have been surprised that i should feel it as i do it was a gross insultand it was not the first  as she spoke the fire flashed from her eye and the bright red colour of her cheek told a tale of her anger which her sister well knew how to read then there was a knock at the door and they both knew that colonel osborne was there louis trevelyan sitting in his library also knew of whose coming that knock gave notice     chapter ii  colonel osborne   it has been already said that colonel osborne was a bachelor a man of fortune a member of parliament and one who carried his half century of years lightly on his shoulders it will only be necessary to say further of him that he was a man popular with those among whom he lived as a politician as a sportsman and as a member of society he could speak well in the house though he spoke but seldom and it was generally thought of him that he might have been something considerable had it not suited him better to be nothing at all he was supposed to be a conservative and generally voted with the conservative party but he could boast that he was altogether independent and on an occasion would take the trouble of proving himself to be so he was in possession of excellent health had all that the world could give was fond of books pictures architecture and china had various tastes and the means of indulging them and was one of those few men on whom it seems that every pleasant thing has been lavished there was that little slur on his good name to which allusion has been made but those who knew colonel osborne best were generally willing to declare that no harm was intended and that the evils which arose were always to be attributed to mistaken jealousy he had his friends said a free and pleasant way with women which women likea pleasant way of free friendship that there was no more and that the harm which had come had always come from false suspicion but there were certain ladies about the towngood motherly discreet womenwho hated the name of colonel osborne who would not admit him within their doors who would not bow to him in other peoples houses who would always speak of him as a serpent a hyena a kite or a shark old lady milborough was one of these a daughter of a friend of hers having once admitted the serpent to her intimacy  augustus poole was wise enough to take his wife abroad said old lady milborough discussing about this time with a gossip of hers the danger of mrs trevelyans position or there would have been a breakup there and yet there never was a better girl in the world than jane marriott  the reader may be quite certain that colonel osborne had no premeditated evil intention when he allowed himself to become the intimate friend of his old friends daughter there was nothing fiendish in his nature he was not a man who boasted of his conquests he was not a ravening wolf going about seeking whom he might devour and determined to devour whatever might come in his way but he liked that which was pleasant and of all pleasant things the company of a pretty clever woman was to him the pleasantest at this exact period of his life no woman was so pleasantly pretty to him and so agreeably clever as mrs trevelyan  when louis trevelyan heard on the stairs the step of the dangerous man he got up from his chair as though he too would have gone into the drawingroom and it would perhaps have been well had he done so could he have done this and kept his temper with the man he would have paved the way for an easy reconciliation with his wife but when he reached the door of his room and had placed his hand upon the lock he withdrew again he told himself he withdrew because he would not allow himself to be jealous but in truth he did so because he knew he could not have brought himself to be civil to the man he hated so he sat down and took up his pen and began to cudgel his brain about the scientific article he was intent on raising a dispute with some learned pundit about the waves of soundbut he could think of no other sound than that of the light steps of colonel osborne as he had gone upstairs he put down his pen and clenched his fist and allowed a black frown to settle upon his brow what right had the man to come there unasked by him and disturb his happiness and then this poor wife of his who knew so little of english life who had lived in the mandarin islands almost since she had been a child who had lived in one colony or another almost since she had been born who had had so few of those advantages for which he should have looked in marrying a wife how was the poor girl to conduct herself properly when subjected to the arts and practised villanies of this viper and yet the poor girl was so stiff in her temper had picked up such a trick of obstinacy in those tropical regions that louis trevelyan felt that he did not know how to manage her he too had heard how jane marriott had been carried off to naples after she had become mrs poole must he too carry off his wife to naples in order to place her out of the reach of this hyena it was terrible to him to think that he must pack up everything and run away from such a one as colonel osborne and even were he to consent to do this how could he explain it all to that very wife for whose sake he would do it if she got a hint of the reason she would he did not doubt refuse to go as he thought of it and as that visit upstairs prolonged itself he almost thought it would be best for him to be round with her we all know what a husband means when he resolves to be round with his wife he began to think that he would not apologise at all for the words he had spokenbut would speak them again somewhat more sharply than before she would be very wrathful with him there would be a silent enduring indignation which as he understood well would be infinitely worse than any torrent of words but was he a man to abstain from doing that which he believed to be his duty because he was afraid of his wifes anger should he be deterred from saying that which he conceived it would be right that he should say because she was stiffnecked no he would not apologise but would tell her again that it was necessary both for his happiness and for hers that all intimacy with colonel osborne should be discontinued  he was brought to this strongly marital resolution by the length of the mans present visit by that and by the fact that during the latter portion of it his wife was alone with colonel osborne nora had been there when the man came but mrs fairfax had called not getting out of her carriage and nora had been constrained to go down to her she had hesitated a moment and colonel osborne had observed and partly understood the hesitation when he saw it had he been perfectly wellminded in the matter he would have gone too but he probably told himself that nora rowley was a fool and that in such matters it was quite enough for a man to know that he did not intend any harm  you had better go down nora said mrs trevelyan mrs fairfax will be ever so angry if you keep her waiting  then nora had gone and the two were alone together nora had gone and trevelyan had heard her as she was going and knew that colonel osborne was alone with his wife  if you can manage that it will be so nice said mrs trevelyan continuing the conversation  my dear emily he said you must not talk of my managing it or you will spoil it all  he had called them both emily and nora when sir marmaduke and lady rowley were with them before the marriage and taking the liberty of a very old family friend had continued the practice mrs trevelyan was quite aware that she had been so called by him in the presence of her husbandand that her husband had not objected but that was now some months ago before baby was born and she was aware also that he had not called her so latterly in presence of her husband she thoroughly wished that she knew how to ask him not to do so again but the matter was very difficult as she could not make such a request without betraying some fear on her husbands part the subject which they were now discussing was too important to her to allow her to dwell upon this trouble at the moment and so she permitted him to go on with his speech  if i were to manage it as you call itwhich i cant do at allit would be a gross job  thats all nonsense to us colonel osborne ladies always like political jobs and think that theyand they onlymake politics bearable but this would not be a job at all papa could do it better than anybody else think how long he has been at it  the matter in discussion was the chance of an order being sent out to sir marmaduke to come home from his islands at the public expense to give evidence respecting colonial government in general to a committee of the house of commons which was about to sit on the subject the committee had been voted and two governors were to be brought home for the purpose of giving evidence what arrangement could be so pleasant to a governor living in the mandarin islands who had had a holiday lately and who could but ill afford to take any holidays at his own expense colonel osborne was on this committee and moreover was on good terms at the colonial office there were men in office who would be glad to do colonel osborne a service and then if this were a job it would be so very little of a job perhaps sir marmaduke might not be the very best man for the purpose perhaps the government of the mandarins did not afford the best specimen of that colonial lore which it was the business of the committee to master but then two governors were to come and it might be as well to have one of the best sort and one of the second best no one supposed that excellent old sir marmaduke was a paragon of a governor but then he had an infinity of experience for over twenty years he had been from island to island and had at least steered clear of great scrapes  well try it at any rate said the colonel  do colonel osborne mamma would come with him of course  we should leave him to manage all that its not very likely that he would leave lady rowley behind  he never has i know he thinks more of mamma than he ever does of himself fancy having them here in the autumn i suppose if he came for the end of the session they wouldnt send him back quite at once  i rather fancy that our foreign and colonial servants know how to stretch a point when they find themselves in england  of course they do colonel osborne and why shouldnt they think of all that they have to endure out in those horrible places how would you like to live in the mandarins  i should prefer london certainly  of course you would and you mustnt begrudge papa a month or two when he comes i never cared about your being in parliament before but i shall think so much of you now if you can manage to get papa home  there could be nothing more innocent than thisnothing more innocent at any rate as regarded any offence against mr trevelyan but just then there came a word which a little startled mrs trevelyan and made her feel afraid that she was doing wrong  i must make one stipulation with you emily said the colonel  what is that  you must not tell your husband  oh dear and why not  i am sure you are sharp enough to see why you should not a word of this repeated at any club would put an end at once to your project and would be very damaging to me and beyond that i wouldnt wish him to know that i had meddled with it at all i am very chary of having my name connected with anything of the kind and upon my word i wouldnt do it for any living human being but yourself youll promise me emily  she gave the promise but there were two things in the matter as it stood at present which she did not at all like she was very averse to having any secret from her husband with colonel osborne and she was not at all pleased at being told that he was doing for her a favour that he would not have done for any other living human being had he said so to her yesterday before those offensive words had been spoken by her husband she would not have thought much about it she would have connected the mans friendship for herself with his very old friendship for her father and she would have regarded the assurance as made to the rowleys in general and not to herself in particular but now after what had occurred it pained her to be told by colonel osborne that he would make specially on her behalf a sacrifice of his political pride which he would make for no other person living and then as he had called her by her christian name as he had exacted the promise there had been a tone of affection in his voice that she had almost felt to be too warm but she gave the promise and when he pressed her hand at parting she pressed his again in token of gratitude for the kindness to be done to her father and mother  immediately afterwards colonel osborne went away and mrs trevelyan was left alone in her drawingroom she knew that her husband was still downstairs and listened for a moment to hear whether he would now come up to her and he too had heard the colonels step as he went and for a few moments had doubted whether or no he would at once go to his wife though he believed himself to be a man very firm of purpose his mind had oscillated backwards and forwards within the last quarter of an hour between those two purposes of being round with his wife and of begging her pardon for the words which he had already spoken he believed that he would best do his duty by that plan of being round with her but then it would be so much pleasanterat any rate so much easier to beg her pardon but of one thing he was quite certain he must by some means exclude colonel osborne from his house he could not live and continue to endure the feelings which he had suffered while sitting downstairs at his desk with the knowledge that colonel osborne was closeted with his wife upstairs it might be that there was nothing in it that his wife was innocent he was quite sure but nevertheless he was himself so much affected by some feeling which pervaded him in reference to this man that all his energy was destroyed and his powers of mind and body were paralysed he could not and would not stand it rather than that he would follow mr poole and take his wife to naples so resolving he put his hat on his head and walked out of the house he would have the advantage of the afternoons consideration before he took either the one step or the other  as soon as he was gone emily trevelyan went upstairs to her baby she would not stir as long as there had been a chance of his coming to her she very much wished that he would come and had made up her mind in spite of the fierceness of her assertion to her sister to accept any slightest hint at an apology which her husband might offer to her to this state of mind she was brought by the consciousness of having a secret from him and by a sense not of impropriety on her own part but of conduct which some people might have called improper in her mode of parting from the man against whom her husband had warned her the warmth of that handpressing and the affectionate tone in which her name had been pronounced and the promise made to her softened her heart towards her husband had he gone to her now and said a word to her in gentleness all might have been made right but he did not go to her  if he chooses to be cross and sulky he may be cross and sulky said mrs trevelyan to herself as she went up to her baby  has louis been with you nora asked as soon as mrs fairfax had brought her home  i have not seen him since you left me said mrs trevelyan  i suppose he went out before colonel osborne  no indeed he waited till colonel osborne had gone and then he went himself but he did not come near me it is for him to judge of his own conduct but i must say that i think he is very foolish  this the young wife said in a tone which clearly indicated that she had judged her husbands conduct and had found it to be very foolish indeed  do you think that papa and mamma will really come said nora changing the subject of conversation  how can i tell how am i to know after all that has passed i am afraid to say a word lest i should be accused of doing wrong but remember this nora you are not to speak of it to any one  you will tell louis  no i will tell no one  dear dear emily pray do not keep anything secret from him  what do you mean by secret there isnt any secret only in such matters as thatabout politicsno gentleman likes to have his name talked about  a look of great distress came upon noras face as she heard this to her it seemed to be very bad that there should be a secret between her sister and colonel osborne to be kept from her brotherinlaw  i suppose you will suspect me next said mrs trevelyan angrily  emily how can you say anything so cruel  you look as if you did  i only mean that i think it would be wiser to tell all this to louis  how can i tell him colonel osbornes private business when colonel osborne has desired me not to do so for whose sake is colonel osborne doing this for papas and mammas i suppose louis wont bejealous because i want to have papa and mamma home it would not be a bit less unreasonable than the other     chapter iii  lady milboroughs dinner party   louis trevelyan went down to his club in pall mall the acrobats and there heard a rumour that added to his anger against colonel osborne the acrobats was a very distinguished club into which it was now difficult for a young man to find his way and almost impossible for a man who was no longer young and therefore known to many it had been founded some twenty years since with the idea of promoting muscular exercise and gymnastic amusements but the promoters had become fat and lethargic and the acrobats spent their time mostly in playing whist and in ordering and eating their dinners there were supposed to be in some outoftheway part of the building certain poles and sticks and parallel bars with which feats of activity might be practised but no one ever asked for them nowadays and a man when he became an acrobat did so with a view either to the whist or the cook or possibly to the social excellences of the club louis trevelyan was an acrobatas was also colonel osborne  so old rowley is coming home said one distinguished acrobat to another in trevelyans hearing  how the deuce is he managing that he was here a year ago  osborne is getting it done he is to come as a witness for this committee it must be no end of a lounge for him it doesnt count as leave and he has every shilling paid for him down to his cabfares when he goes out to dinner theres nothing like having a friend at court  such was the secrecy of colonel osbornes secret he had been so chary of having his name mentioned in connection with a political job that he had found it necessary to impose on his young friend the burden of a secret from her husband and yet the husband heard the whole story told openly at his club on the same day there was nothing in the story to anger trevelyan had he not immediately felt that there must be some plan in the matter between his wife and colonel osborne of which he had been kept ignorant hitherto indeed his wife as the reader knows could not have told him he had not seen her since the matter had been discussed between her and her friend but he was angry because he first learned at his club that which he thought he ought to have learned at home  as soon as he reached his house he went at once to his wifes room but her maid was with her and nothing could be said at that moment he then dressed himself intending to go to emily as soon as the girl had left her but the girl remainedwas as he believed kept in the room purposely by his wife so that he should have no moment of private conversation he went downstairs therefore and found nora standing by the drawingroom fire  so you are dressed first today he said i thought your turn always came last  emily sent jenny to me first today because she thought you would be home and she didnt go up to dress till the last minute  this was intended well by nora but it did not have the desired effect trevelyan who had no command over his own features frowned and showed that he was displeased he hesitated a moment thinking whether he would ask nora any question as to this report about her father and mother but before he had spoken his wife was in the room  we are all late i fear said emily  you at any rate are the last said her husband  about half a minute said the wife  then they got into the hired brougham which was standing at the door  trevelyan in the sweet days of his early confidence with his wife had offered to keep a carriage for her explaining to her that the luxury though costly would not be beyond his reach but she had persuaded him against the carriage and there had come to be an agreement that instead of the carriage there should always be an autumn tour one learns something from going about but one learns nothing from keeping a carriage emily had said those had been happy days in which it had been intended that everything should always be rosecoloured now he was meditating whether in lieu of that autumn tour it would not be necessary to take his wife away to naples altogether so that she might be removed from the influence ofofof no not even to himself would he think of colonel osborne as his wifes lover the idea was too horrible and yet how dreadful was it that he should have for any reason to withdraw her from the influence of any man  lady milborough lived ever so far away in eccleston square but trevelyan did not say a single word to either of his companions during the journey he was cross and vexed and was conscious that they knew that he was cross and vexed mrs trevelyan and her sister talked to each other the whole way but they did so in that tone which clearly indicates that the conversation is made up not for any interest attached to the questions asked or the answers given but because it is expedient that there should not be silence nora said something about marshall and snellgrove and tried to make believe that she was very anxious for her sisters answer and emily said something about the opera at covent garden which was intended to show that her mind was quite at ease but both of them failed altogether and knew that they failed once or twice trevelyan thought that he would say a word in token as it were of repentance like the naughty child who knew that he was naughty he was trying to be good but he could not do it the fiend was too strong within him she must have known that there was a proposition for her fathers return through colonel osbornes influence as that man at the club had heard it how could she not have known it when they got out at lady milboroughs door he had spoken to neither of them  there was a large dull party made up mostly of old people lady milborough and trevelyans mother had been bosom friends and lady milborough had on this account taken upon herself to be much interested in trevelyans wife but louis trevelyan himself in discussing lady milborough with emily had rather turned his mothers old friend into ridicule and emily had of course followed her husbands mode of thinking lady milborough had once or twice given her some advice on small matters telling her that this or that air would be good for her baby and explaining that a mother during a certain interesting portion of her life should refresh herself with a certain kind of malt liquor of all counsel on such domestic subjects mrs trevelyan was impatientas indeed it was her nature to be in all matters and consequently authorized as she had been by her husbands manner of speaking of his mothers friend she had taken a habit of quizzing lady milborough behind her back and almost of continuing the practice before the old ladys face lady milborough who was the most affectionate old soul alive and goodtempered with her friends to a fault had never resented this but had come to fear that mrs trevelyan was perhaps a little flighty she had never as yet allowed herself to say anything worse of her young friends wife than that and she would always add that that kind of thing would cure itself as the nursery became full it must be understood therefore that mrs trevelyan was not anticipating much pleasure from lady milboroughs party and that she had accepted the invitation as a matter of duty  there was present among the guests a certain honourable charles glascock the eldest son of lord peterborough who made the affair more interesting to nora than it was to her sister it had been whispered into noras ears by more than one personand among others by lady milborough whose own daughters were all marriedthat she might if she thought fit become the honourable mrs charles glascock now whether she might think fit or whether she might not the presence of the gentleman under such circumstances as far as she was concerned gave an interest to the evening and as lady milborough took care that mr glascock should take nora down to dinner the interest was very great mr glascock was a goodlooking man just under forty in parliament heir to a peerage and known to be well off in respect to income lady milborough and mrs trevelyan had told nora rowley that should encouragement in that direction come in her way she ought to allow herself to fall in love with mr glascock a certain amount of encouragement had come in her way but she had not as yet allowed herself to fall in love with mr glascock it seemed to her that mr glascock was quite conscious of the advantages of his own position and that his powers of talking about other matters than those with which he was immediately connected were limited she did believe that he had in truth paid her the compliment of falling in love with her and this is a compliment to which few girls are indifferent nora might perhaps have tried to fall in love with mr glascock had she not been forced to make comparisons between him and another this other one had not fallen in love with her as she well knew and she certainly had not fallen in love with him but still the comparison was forced upon her and it did not result in favour of mr glascock on the present occasion mr glascock as he sat next to her almost proposed to her  you have never seen monkhams he said monkhams was his fathers seat a very grand place in worcestershire of course he knew very well that she had never seen monkhams how should she have seen it  i have never been in that part of england at all she replied  i should so like to show you monkhams the oaks there are the finest in the kingdom do you like oaks  who does not like oaks but we have none in the islands and nobody has ever seen so few as i have  ill show you monkhams some day shall i indeed i hope that some day i may really show you monkhams  now when an unmarried man talks to a young lady of really showing her the house in which it will be his destiny to live he can hardly mean other than to invite her to live there with him it must at least be his purpose to signify that if duly encouraged he will so invite her but nora rowley did not give mr glascock much encouragement on this occasion  im afraid it is not likely that anything will ever take me into that part of the country she said there was something perhaps in her tone which checked mr glascock so that he did not then press the invitation  when the ladies were upstairs in the drawingroom lady milborough contrived to seat herself on a couch intended for two persons only close to mrs trevelyan emily thinking that she might perhaps hear some advice about guinnesss stout prepared herself to be saucy but the matter in hand was graver than that lady milboroughs mind was uneasy about colonel osborne  my dear said she was not your father very intimate with that colonel osborne  he is very intimate with him lady milborough  ah yes i thought i had heard so that makes it of course natural that you should know him  we have known him all our lives said emily forgetting probably that out of the twentythree years and some months which she had hitherto lived there had been a consecutive period of more than twenty years in which she had never seen this man whom she had known all her life  that makes a difference of course and i dont mean to say anything against him  i hope not lady milborough because we are all especially fond of him this was said with so much of purpose that poor dear old lady milborough was stopped in her good work she knew well the terrible strait to which augustus poole had been brought with his wife although nobody supposed that pooles wife had ever entertained a wrong thought in her pretty little heart nevertheless he had been compelled to break up his establishment and take his wife to naples because this horrid colonel would make himself at home in mrs pooles drawingroom in knightsbridge augustus poole with courage enough to take any man by the beard had taking by the beard been possible had found it impossible to dislodge the colonel he could not do so without making a row which would have been disgraceful to himself and injurious to his wife and therefore he had taken mrs poole to naples lady milborough knew the whole story and thought that she foresaw that the same thing was about to happen in the drawingroom in curzon street when she attempted to say a word to the wife she found herself stopped she could not go on in that quarter after the reception with which the beginning of her word had been met but perhaps she might succeed better with the husband after all her friendship was with the trevelyan side and not with the rowleys  my dear louis she said i want to speak a word to you come here and then she led him into a distant corner mrs trevelyan watching her all the while and guessing why her husband was thus carried away i just want to give you a little hint which i am sure i believe is quite unnecessary continued lady milborough then she paused but trevelyan would not speak she looked into his face and saw that it was black but the man was the only child of her dearest friend and she persevered do you know i dont quite like that colonel osborne coming so much to your house the face before her became still blacker but still the man said nothing i dare say it is a prejudice on my part but i have always disliked him i think he is a dangerous friendwhat i call a snake in the grass and though emilys high good sense and love for you and general feelings on such a subject are just what a husband must desireindeed i am quite sure that the possibility of anything wrong has never entered into her head but it is the very purity of her innocence which makes the danger he is a bad man and i would just say a word to her if i were you to make her understand that his coming to her of a morning is not desirable upon my word i believe there is nothing he likes so much as going about and making mischief between men and their wives  thus she delivered herself and louis trevelyan though he was sore and angry could not but feel that she had taken the part of a friend all that she had said had been true all that she had said to him he had said to himself more than once he too hated the man he believed him to be a snake in the grass but it was intolerably bitter to him that he should be warned about his wifes conduct by any living human being that he to whom the world had been so full of good fortunethat he who had in truth taught himself to think that he deserved so much good fortune should be made the subject of care on behalf of his friend because of danger between himself and his wife on the spur of the moment he did not know what answer to make he is not a man whom i like myself he said  just be careful louis that is all said lady milborough and then she was gone  to be cautioned about his wifes conduct cannot be pleasant to any man and it was very unpleasant to louis trevelyan he too had been asked a question about sir marmadukes expected visit to england after the ladies had left the room all the town had heard of it except himself he hardly spoke another word that evening till the brougham was announced and his wife had observed his silence when they were seated in the carriage he together with his wife and nora rowley he immediately asked a question about sir marmaduke emily he said is there any truth in a report i hear that your father is coming home no answer was made and for a moment or two there was silence you must have heard of it then he said perhaps you can tell me nora as emily will not reply have you heard anything of your fathers coming  yes i have heard of it said nora slowly  and why have i not been told  it was to be kept a secret said mrs trevelyan boldly  a secret from me and everybody else knows it and why was it to be a secret  colonel osborne did not wish that it should be known said mrs trevelyan  and what has colonel osborne to do between you and your father in any matter with which i may not be made acquainted i will have nothing more between you and colonel osborne you shall not see colonel osborne do you hear me  yes i hear you louis  and do you mean to obey me by g you shall obey me remember this that i lay my positive order upon you that you shall not see colonel osborne again you do not know it perhaps but you are already forfeiting your reputation as an honest woman and bringing disgrace upon me by your familiarity with colonel osborne  oh louis do not say that said nora  you had better let him speak it all at once said emily  i have said what i have got to say it is now only necessary that you should give me your solemn assurance that you will obey me  if you have said all that you have to say perhaps you will listen to me said his wife  i will listen to nothing till you have given me your promise  then i certainly shall not give it you  dear emily pray pray do what he tells you said nora  she has yet to learn that it is her duty to do as i tell her said trevelyan and because she is obstinate and will not learn from those who know better than herself what a woman may do and what she may not she will ruin herself and destroy my happiness  i know that you have destroyed my happiness by your unreasonable jealousy said the wife have you considered what i must feel in having such words addressed to me by my husband if i am fit to be told that i must promise not to see any man living i cannot be fit to be any mans wife then she burst out into an hysterical fit of tears and in this condition she got out of the carriage entered her house and hurried up to her own room  indeed she has not been to blame said nora to trevelyan on the staircase  why has there been a secret kept from me between her and this man and that too after i had cautioned her against being intimate with him i am sorry that she should suffer but it is better that she should suffer a little now than that we should both suffer much byandby  nora endeavoured to explain to him the truth about the committee and colonel osbornes promised influence and the reason why there was to be a secret but she was too much in a hurry to get to her sister to make the matter plain and he was too much angered to listen to her he shook his head when she spoke of colonel osbornes dislike to have his name mentioned in connection with the matter all the world knows it he said with scornful laughter  it was in vain that nora endeavoured to explain to him that though all the world might know it emily herself had only heard of the proposition as a thing quite unsettled as to which nothing at present should be spoken openly it was in vain to endeavour to make peace on that night nora hurried up to her sister and found that the hysterical tears had again given place to anger she would not see her husband unless he would beg her pardon and he would not see her unless she would give the promise he demanded and the husband and wife did not see each other again on that night     chapter iv  hugh stanbury      illustration  it has been already stated that nora rowley was not quite so well disposed as perhaps she ought to have been to fall in love with the honourable charles glascock there having come upon her the habit of comparing him with another gentleman whenever this duty of falling in love with mr glascock was exacted from her that other gentleman was one with whom she knew that it was quite out of the question that she should fall in love because he had not a shilling in the world and the other gentleman was equally aware that it was not open to him to fall in love with nora rowleyfor the same reason in regard to such matters nora rowley had been properly brought up having been made to understand by the best and most cautious of mothers that in that matter of falling in love it was absolutely necessary that bread and cheese should be considered romance is a very pretty thing lady rowley had been wont to say to her daughters and i dont think life would be worth having without a little of it i should be very sorry to think that either of my girls would marry a man only because he had money but you cant even be romantic without something to eat and drink nora thoroughly understood all this and being well aware that her fortune in the world if it ever was to be made at all could only be made by marriage had laid down for herself certain hard lineslines intended to be as fast as they were hard let what might come to her in the way of likings and dislikings let the temptation to her be ever so strong she would never allow her heart to rest on a man who if he should ask her to be his wife would not have the means of supporting her there were many she knew who would condemn such a resolution as cold selfish and heartless she heard people saying so daily she read in books that it ought to be so regarded but she declared to herself that she would respect the judgment neither of the people nor of the books to be poor alone to have to live without a husband to look forward to a life in which there would be nothing of a career almost nothing to do to await the vacuity of an existence in which she would be useful to no one was a destiny which she could teach herself to endure because it might probably be forced upon her by necessity were her father to die there would hardly be bread for that female flock to eat as it was she was eating the bread of a man in whose house she was no more than a visitor the lot of a woman as she often told herself was wretched unfortunate almost degrading for a woman such as herself there was no path open to her energy other than that of getting a husband nora rowley thought of all this till she was almost sick of the prospect of her lifeespecially sick of it when she was told with much authority by the lady milboroughs of her acquaintance that it was her bounden duty to fall in love with mr glascock as to falling in love with mr glascock she had not as yet quite made up her mind there was so much to be said on that side of the question if such falling in love could only be made possible but she had quite made up her mind that she would never fall in love with a poor man in spite however of all that she felt herself compelled to make comparisons between mr glascock and one mr hugh stanbury a gentleman who had not a shilling  mr hugh stanbury had been at college the most intimate friend of louis trevelyan and at oxford had been in spite of trevelyans successes a bigger man than his friend stanbury had not taken so high a degree as trevelyanindeed had not gone out in honours at all he had done little for the credit of his college and had never put himself in the way of wrapping himself up for life in the scanty lambswool of a fellowship but he had won for himself reputation as a clever speaker as a man who had learned much that college tutors do not profess to teach as a hardheaded readywitted fellow who having the world as an oyster before him which it was necessary that he should open would certainly find either a knife or a sword with which to open it  immediately on leaving college he had come to town and had entered himself at lincolns inn now at the time of our story he was a barrister of four years standing but had never yet made a guinea he had never made a guinea by his work as a barrister and was beginning to doubt of himself whether he ever would do so not as he knew well that guineas are generally made with ease by barristers of four years standing but because as he said to his friends he did not see his way to the knack of it he did not know an attorney in the world and could not conceive how any attorney should ever be induced to apply to him for legal aid he had done his work of learning his trade about as well as other young men but had had no means of distinguishing himself within his reach he went the western circuit because his aunt old miss stanbury lived at exeter but as he declared of himself had he had another aunt living at york he would have had nothing whatsoever to guide him in his choice he sat idle in the courts and hated himself for so sitting so it had been with him for two years without any consolation or additional burden from other employment than that of his profession after that by some chance he had become acquainted with the editor of the daily record and by degrees had taken to the writing of articles he had been told by all his friends and especially by trevelyan that if he did this he might as well sell his gown and wig he declared in reply that he had no objection to sell his gown and wig he did not see how he should ever make more money out of them than he would do by such sale but for the articles which he wrote he received instant payment a process which he found to be most consolatory most comfortable and as he said to trevelyan as warm to him as a blanket in winter  trevelyan who was a year younger than stanbury had taken upon himself to be very angry he professed that he did not think much of the trade of a journalist and told stanbury that he was sinking from the highest to almost the lowest business by which an educated man and a gentleman could earn his bread stanbury had simply replied that he saw some bread on the one side but none on the other and that bread from some side was indispensable to him then there had come to be that famous war between great britain and the republic of patagonia and hugh stanbury had been sent out as a special correspondent by the editor and proprietor of the daily record his letters had been much read and had called up a great deal of newspaper pugnacity he had made important statements which had been flatly denied and found to be utterly false which again had been warmly reasserted and proved to be most remarkably true to the letter in this way the correspondence and he as its author became so much talked about that on his return to england he did actually sell his gown and wig and declare to his friendsand to trevelyan among the numberthat he intended to look to journalism for his future career  he had been often at the house in curzon street in the earliest happy days of his friends marriage and had thus become acquaintedintimately acquaintedwith nora rowley and now again since his return from patagonia that acquaintance had been renewed quite lately since the actual sale of that wig and gown had been effected he had not been there so frequently as before because trevelyan had expressed his indignation almost too openly  that such a man as you should be so fainthearted trevelyan had said is a thing that i can not understand  is a man fainthearted when he finds it improbable that he shall be able to leap his horse over a house  what you had to do had been done by hundreds before you  what i had to do has never yet been done by any man replied stanbury i had to live upon nothing till the lucky hour should strike  i think you have been cowardly said trevelyan  even this had made no quarrel between the two men but stanbury had expressed himself annoyed by his friends language and partly on that account and partly perhaps on another had stayed away from curzon street as nora rowley had made comparisons about him so had he made comparisons about her he had owned to himself that had it been possible that he should marry he would willingly entrust his happiness to miss rowley and he had thought once or twice that trevelyan had wished that such an arrangement might be made at some future day trevelyan had always been much more sanguine in expecting success for his friend at the bar than stanbury had been for himself it might well be that such a man as trevelyan might think that a clever rising barrister would be an excellent husband for his sisterinlaw but that a man earning a precarious living as a writer for a penny paper would be by no means so desirable a connection stanbury as he thought of this declared to himself that he would not care two straws for trevelyan in the matter if he could see his way without other impediments but the other impediments were there in such strength and numbers as to make him feel that it could not have been intended by fate that he should take to himself a wife although those letters of his to the daily record had been so preeminently successful he had never yet been able to earn by writing above twentyfive or thirty pounds a month if that might be continued to him he could live upon it himself but even with his moderate views it would not suffice for himself and family  he had told trevelyan that while living as an expectant barrister he had no means of subsistence in this as trevelyan knew he was not strictly correct there was an allowance of £100 a year coming to him from the aunt whose residence at exeter had induced him to devote himself to the western circuit his father had been a clergyman with a small living in devonshire and had now been dead some fifteen years his mother and two sisters were still living in a small cottage in his late fathers parish on the interest of the money arising from a life insurance some pittance from sixty to seventy pounds a year was all they had among them but there was a rich aunt miss stanbury to whom had come considerable wealth in a manner most romanticthe little tale shall be told before this larger tale is completedand this aunt had undertaken to educate and place out in the world her nephew hugh so hugh had been sent to harrow and then to oxfordwhere he had much displeased his aunt by not accomplishing great thingsand then had been set down to make his fortune as a barrister in london with an allowance of £100 a year his aunt having paid moreover certain fees for entrance tuition and the like the very hour in which miss stanbury learned that her nephew was writing for a penny newspaper she sent off a dispatch to tell him that he must give up her or the penny paper he replied by saying that he felt himself called upon to earn his bread in the only line from which as it seemed to him bread would be forthcoming by return of post he got another letter to say that he might draw for the quarter then becoming due but that that would be the last and it was the last  stanbury made an ineffectual effort to induce his aunt to make over the allowanceor at least a part of itto his mother and sisters but the old lady paid no attention whatever to the request she never had given and at that moment did not intend to give a shilling to the widow and daughters of her brother nor did she intend or had she ever intended to leave a shilling of her money to hugh stanburyas she had very often told him the money was at her death to go back to the people from whom it had come to her  when nora rowley made those comparisons between mr hugh stanbury and mr charles glascock they were always wound up very much in favour of the briefless barrister it was not that he was the handsomer man for he was by no means handsome nor was he the bigger man for mr glascock was six feet tall nor was he better dressed for stanbury was untidy rather than otherwise in his outward person nor had he any air of fashion or special grace to recommend him for he was undoubtedly an awkwardmannered man but there was a glance of sunshine in his eye and a sweetness in the curl of his mouth when he smiled which made nora feel that it would have been all up with her had she not made so very strong a law for her own guidance stanbury was a man about five feet ten with shoulders more than broad in proportion stout limbed rather awkward of his gait with large feet and hands with soft wavy light hair with light grey eyes with a broad but by no means ugly nose his mouth and lips were large and he rarely showed his teeth he wore no other beard than whiskers which he was apt to cut away through heaviness of his hand in shaving till nora longed to bid him be more careful he doesnt care what sort of a guy he makes of himself she once said to her sister almost angrily he is a plain man and he knows it emily had replied mr trevelyan was doubtless a handsome man and it was almost on noras tongue to say something illnatured on the subject hugh stanbury was reputed to be somewhat hot in spirit and manner he would be very sage in argument pounding down his ideas on politics religion or social life with his fist as well as his voice he was quick perhaps at making antipathies and quick too in making friendships impressionable demonstrative eager rapid in his movementssometimes to the great detriment of his shins and knuckles and he possessed the sweetest temper that was ever given to a man for the blessing of a woman this was the man between whom and mr glascock nora rowley found it to be impossible not to make comparisons  on the very day after lady milboroughs dinner party stanbury overtook trevelyan in the street and asked his friend where he was going eastward trevelyan was on his way to call upon his lawyer and said so but he did not say why he was going to his lawyer he had sent to his wife by nora that morning to know whether she would make to him the promise he required the only answer which nora could draw from her sister was a counter question demanding whether he would ask her pardon for the injury he had done her nora had been most eager most anxious most conciliatory as a messenger but no good had come of these messages and trevelyan had gone forth to tell all his trouble to his family lawyer old mr bideawhile had been his fathers ancient and esteemed friend and he could tell things to mr bideawhile which he could not bring himself to tell to any other living man and he could generally condescend to accept mr bideawhiles advice knowing that his father before him had been guided by the same  but you are out of your way for lincolns inn fields said stanbury  i have to call at twinings and where are you going  i have been three times round st jamess park to collect my thoughts said stanbury and now i am on my way to the daily r 250 fleet street it is my custom of an afternoon i am prepared to instruct the british public of tomorrow on any subject as per order from the downfall of a european compact to the price of a london mutton chop  i suppose there is nothing more to be said about it said trevelyan after a pause  not another word how should there be aunt jemima has already drawn tight the purse strings and it would soon be the casual ward in earnest if it were not for the daily r god bless the daily r only think what a thing it is to have all subjects open to one from the destinies of france to the profit proper to a butcher  if you like it  i do like it it may not be altogether honest i dont know what is but its a deal honester than defending thieves and bamboozling juries how is your wife  shes pretty well thank you  stanbury knew at once from the tone of his friends voice that there was something wrong  and louis the less he said asking after trevelyans child  hes all right  and miss rowley when one begins ones inquiries one is bound to go through the whole family  miss rowley is pretty well said trevelyan  previously to this trevelyan when speaking of his sisterinlaw to stanbury had always called her nora and had been wont to speak of her as though she were almost as much the friend of one of them as of the other the change of tone on this occasion was in truth occasioned by the sadness of the mans thoughts in reference to his wife but stanbury attributed it to another cause he need not be afraid of me he said to himself and at least he should not show me that he is then they parted trevelyan going into twinings bank and stanbury passing on towards the office of the daily r  stanbury had in truth been altogether mistaken as to the state of his friends mind on that morning trevelyan although he had according to his custom put in a word in condemnation of the newspaper line of life was at the moment thinking whether he would not tell all his trouble to hugh stanbury he knew that he should not find anywhere not even in mr bideawhile a more friendly or more trustworthy listener when nora rowleys name had been mentioned he had not thought of her he had simply repeated the name with the usual answer he was at the moment cautioning himself against a confidence which after all might not be necessary and which on this occasion was not made when one is in trouble it is a great ease to tell ones trouble to a friend but then one should always wash ones dirty linen at home the latter consideration prevailed and trevelyan allowed his friend to go on without burdening him with the story of that domestic quarrel nor did he on that occasion tell it to mr bideawhile for mr bideawhile was not found at his chambers     chapter v  shewing how the quarrel progressed   trevelyan got back to his own house at about three and on going into the library found on his table a letter to him addressed in his wifes handwriting he opened it quickly hoping to find that promise which he had demanded and resolving that if it were made he would at once become affectionate yielding and gentle to his wife but there was not a word written by his wife within the envelope it contained simply another letter already opened addressed to her this letter had been brought up to her during her husbands absence from the house and was as follows      acrobats thursday     dear emily     i have just come from the colonial office it is all    settled and sir m has been sent for of course you will    tell t now     yours f o   the letter was of course from colonel osborne and mrs trevelyan when she received it had had great doubts whether she would enclose it to her husband opened or unopened she had hitherto refused to make the promise which her husband exacted but nevertheless she was minded to obey him had he included in his demand any requirement that she should receive no letter from colonel osborne she would not have opened this one but nothing had been said about letters and she would not shew herself to be afraid so she read the note and then sent it down to be put on mr trevelyans table in an envelope addressed to him  if he is not altogether blinded it will show him how cruelly he has wronged me said she to her sister she was sitting at the time with her boy in her lap telling herself that the childs features were in all respects the very same as his fathers and that come what come might the child should always be taught by her to love and respect his father and then there came a horrible thought what if the child should be taken away from her if this quarrel out of which she saw no present mode of escape were to lead to a separation between her and her husband would not the law and the judges and the courts and all the lady milboroughs of their joint acquaintance into the bargain say that the child should go with his father the judges and the courts and the lady milboroughs would of course say that she was the sinner and what could she do without her boy would not any humility any grovelling in the dust be better for her than that it is a very poor thing to be a woman she said to her sister  it is perhaps better than being a dog said nora but of course we cant compare ourselves to men  it would be better to be a dog one wouldnt be made to suffer so much when a puppy is taken away from its mother she is bad enough for a few days but she gets over it in a week there was a pause then for a few moments nora knew well which way ran the current of her sisters thoughts and had nothing at the present moment which she could say on that subject it is very hard for a woman to know what to do continued emily but if she is to marry i think she had better marry a fool after all a fool generally knows that he is a fool and will trust some one though he may not trust his wife  i will never wittingly marry a fool said nora  you will marry mr glascock of course i dont say that he is a fool but i do not think he has that kind of strength which shows itself in perversity  if he asked me i should not have himand he will never ask me  he will ask you and of course youll take him why not you cant be otherwise than a woman and you must marry and this man is a gentleman and will be a peer there is nothing on earth against him except that he does not set the thames on fire louis intends to set the thames on fire some day and see what comes of it  all the same i shall not marry mr glascock a woman can die at any rate said nora  no she cant a woman must be decent and to die of want is very indecent she cant die and she mustnt be in want and she oughtnt to be a burden i suppose it was thought necessary that every man should have two to choose from and therefore there are so many more of us than the world wants i wonder whether youd mind taking that downstairs to his table i dont like to send it by the servant and i dont want to go myself  then nora had taken the letter down and left it where louis trevelyan would be sure to find it  he did find it and was sorely disappointed when he perceived that it contained no word from his wife to himself he opened colonel osbornes note and read it and became as he did so almost more angry than before who was this man that he should dare to address another mans wife as dear emily at the moment trevelyan remembered well enough that he had heard the man so call his wife that it had been done openly in his presence and had not given him a thought but lady rowley and sir marmaduke had then been present also and that man on that occasion had been the old friend of the old father and not the wouldbe young friend of the young daughter trevelyan could hardly reason about it but felt that whereas the one was not improper the other was grossly impertinent and even wicked and then again his wife his emily was to show to him to her husband or was not to show to him the letter which she received from this man the letter in which she was addressed as dear emily according to this mans judgment and wish and not according to his judgment and wishnot according to the judgment and wish of him who was her husband her lord and her master of course you will tell t now this was intolerable to him it made him feel that he was to be regarded as second and this man to be regarded as first and then he began to recapitulate all the good things he had done for his wife and all the causes which he had given her for gratitude had he not taken her to his bosom and bestowed upon her the half of all that he had simply for herself asking for nothing more than her love he had possessed money position a nameall that makes life worth having he had found her in a remote corner of the world with no fortune with no advantages of family or social standingso circumstanced that any friend would have warned him against such a marriage but he had given her his heart and his hand and his house and had asked for nothing in return but that he should be all in all to herthat he should be her one god upon earth and he had done more even than this bring your sister he had said the house shall be big enough for her also and she shall be my sister as well as yours who had ever done more for a woman or shown a more absolute confidence and now what was the return he received she was not contented with her one god upon earth but must make to herself other godsanother god and that too out of a lump of the basest clay to be found around her he thought that he could remember to have heard it said in early days long before he himself had had an idea of marrying that no man should look for a wife from among the tropics that women educated amidst the languors of those sunny climes rarely came to possess those high ideas of conjugal duty and feminine truth which a man should regard as the first requisites of a good wife as he thought of all this he almost regretted that he had ever visited the mandarins or ever heard the name of sir marmaduke rowley  he should have nourished no such thoughts in his heart he had indeed been generous to his wife and to his wifes family but we may almost say that the man who is really generous in such matters is unconscious of his own generosity the giver who gives the most gives and does not know that he gives and had not she given too in that matter of giving between a man and his wife if each gives all the two are equal let the things given be what they may king cophetua did nothing for his beggar maid unless she were to him after he had married her as royal a queen as though he had taken her from the oldest stock of reigning families then extant trevelyan knew all this himselfhad said so to himself a score of times though not probably in spoken words or formed sentences but that all was equal between himself and the wife of his bosom had been a thing ascertained by him as a certainty there was no debt of gratitude from her to him which he did not acknowledge to exist also as from him to her but yet in his anger he could not keep himself from thinking of the gifts he had showered upon her and he had been was would ever be if she would only allow it so true to her he had selected no other friend to take her place in his councils there was no dear mary or dear augusta with whom he had secrets to be kept from his wife when there arose with him any question of interestquestion of interest such as was this of the return of sir marmaduke to herhe would show it in all its bearings to his wife he had his secrets too but his secrets had all been made secrets for her also there was not a woman in the world in whose company he took special delight in her absence  and if there had been how much less would have been her ground of complaint let a man have any such friendshipswhat friendships he mayhe does not disgrace his wife he felt himself to be so true of heart that he desired no such friendships but for a man indulging in such friendships there might be excuse even though a man be false a woman is not shamed and brought unto the dust before all the world but the slightest rumour on a womans name is a load of infamy on her husbands shoulders it was not enough for cæsar that his wife should be true it was necessary to cæsar that she should not even be suspected trevelyan told himself that he suspected his wife of no sin god forbid that it should ever come to that both for his sake and for hers and above all for the sake of that boy who was so dear to them both but there would be the vile whispers and dirty slanders would be dropped from envious tongues into envious ears and minds prone to evil would think evil of him and of his had not lady milborough already cautioned him oh that he should have lived to have been cautioned about his wifethat he should be told that eyes outside had looked into the sacred shrine of his heart and seen that things there were fatally amiss and yet lady milborough was quite right had he not in his hand at this moment a document that proved her to be right dear emily he took this note and crushed it in his fist and then pulled it into fragments  but what should he do there was first of all considerations the duty which he owed to his wife and the love which he bore her that she was ignorant and innocent he was sure but then she was so contumacious that he hardly knew how to take a step in the direction of guarding her from the effects of her ignorance and maintaining for her the advantages of her innocence he was her master and she must know that he was her master but how was he to proceed when she refused to obey the plainest and most necessary command which he laid upon her let a man be ever so much his wifes master he cannot maintain his masterdom by any power which the law places in his hands he had asked his wife for a promise of obedience and she would not give it to him what was he to do next he could no doubtat least he thought sokeep the man from her presence he could order the servant not to admit the man and the servant would doubtless obey him but to what a condition would he then have been brought would not the world then be over for himover for him as the husband of a wife whom he could not love unless he respected her better that there should be no such world than call in the aid of a servant to guard the conduct of his wife  as he thought of it all it seemed to him that if she would not obey him and give him this promise they must be separated he would not live with her he would not give her the privileges of his wife if she refused to render to him the obedience which was his privilege the more he thought of it the more convinced he was that he ought not to yield to her let her once yield to him and then his tenderness should begin and there should be no limit to it but he would not see her till she had yielded he would not see her and if he should find that she did see colonel osborne then he would tell her that she could no longer dwell under the same roof with him  his resolution on these points was very strong and yet there came over him a feeling that it was his duty to be gentle there was a feeling also that that privilege of receiving obedience which was so indubitably his own could only be maintained by certain wise practices on his part in which gentleness must predominate wives are bound to obey their husbands but obedience cannot be exacted from wives as it may from servants by aid of law and with penalties or as from a horse by punishments and manger curtailments a man should be master in his own house but he should make his mastery palatable equitable smooth soft to the touch a thing almost unfelt how was he to do all this now when he had already given an order to which obedience had been refused unless under certain stipulationsan agreement with which would be degradation to him he had pointed out to his wife her duty and she had said she would do her duty as pointed out on condition that he would beg her pardon for having pointed it out this he could not and would not do let the heavens falland the falling of the heavens in this case was a separation between him and his wifebut he would not consent to such injustice as that  but what was he to do at this momentespecially with reference to that note which he had destroyed at last he resolved to write to his wife and he consequently did write and send to her the following letter      may 4     dearest emily     if colonel osborne should write to you again it will    be better that you should not open his letter as you    know his handwriting you will have no difficulty in so    arranging should any further letter come from colonel    osborne addressed to you you had better put it under    cover to me and take no notice of it yourself     i shall dine at the club today we were to have gone to    mrs peacocks in the evening you had better write a line    to say that we shall not be there i am very sorry that    nora should lose her evening pray think very carefully    over what i have asked of you my request to you is that    you shall give me a promise that you will not willingly    see colonel osborne again of course you will understand    that this is not supposed to extend to accidental    meetings as to which should they occurand they would    be sure to occuryou would find that they would be    wholly unnoticed by me     but i must request that you will comply with my wish in    this matter if you will send for me i will go to you    instantly and after one word from you to the desired    effect you will find that there will be no recurrence by    me to a subject so hateful as i have done and am doing    what i think to be right i cannot stultify myself by    saying that i think i have been wrong     yours always dearest emily    with the most thorough love     louis trevelyan   this letter he himself put on his wifes dressingroom table and then he went out to his club     chapter vi  shewing how reconciliation was made   look at that said mrs trevelyan when her sister came into her room about an hour before dinnertime nora read the letter and then asked her sister what she meant to do i have written to mrs peacock i dont know what else i can do it is very hard upon youthat you should have been kept at home but i dont suppose mr glascock would have been at mrs peacocks  and what else will you do emily  nothingsimply live deserted and forlorn till he shall choose to find his wits again there is nothing else that a woman can do if he chooses to dine at his club every day i cant help it we must put off all the engagements and that will be hard upon you  dont talk about me it is too terrible to think that there should be such a quarrel  what can i do have i been wrong  simply do what he tells you whether it is wrong or right if its right it ought to be done and if its wrong it will not be your fault  thats very easily said and it sounds logical but you must know its unreasonable  i dont care about reason he is your husband and if he wishes it you should do it and what will be the harm you dont mean to see colonel osborne any more you have already said that hes not to be admitted  i have said that nobody is to be admitted louis has driven me to that how can i look the servant in the face and tell him that any special gentleman is not to be admitted to see me oh dear oh dear have i done anything to deserve it was ever so monstrous an accusation made against any woman if it were not for my boy i would defy him to do his worst  on the day following nora again became a messenger between the husband and wife and before dinnertime a reconciliation had been effected of course the wife gave way at last and of course she gave way so cunningly that the husband received none of the gratification which he had expected in her surrender tell him to come nora had urged of course he can come if he pleases emily had replied then nora had told louis to come and louis had demanded whether if he did so the promise which he had exacted would be given it is to be feared that nora perverted the truth a little but if ever such perversion may be forgiven forgiveness was due to her if they could only be brought together she was sure that there would be a reconciliation they were brought together and there was a reconciliation  dearest emily i am so glad to come to you said the husband walking up to his wife in their bedroom and taking her in his arms      illustration shewing how reconciliation was made   i have been very unhappy louis for the last two days said she very gravelyreturning his kiss but returning it somewhat coldly  we have both been unhappy i am sure said he then he paused that the promise might be made to him he had certainly understood that it was to be made without reserveas an act on her part which she had fully consented to perform but she stood silent with one hand on the dressingtable looking away from him very beautiful and dignified too in her manner but not as far as he could judge either repentant or submissive nora said that you would make me the promise which i ask from you  i cannot think louis how you can want such a promise from me  i think it right to ask it i do indeed  can you imagine that i shall ever willingly see this gentleman again after what has occurred it will be for you to tell the servant i do not know how i can do that but as a matter of course i will encourage no person to come to your house of whom you disapprove it would be exactly the same of any man or of any woman  that is all that i ask  i am surprised that you should have thought it necessary to make any formal request in the matter your word was quite sufficient that you should find cause of complaint in colonel osbornes coming here is of course a different thing  quite a different thing said he  i cannot pretend to understand either your motives or your fears i do not understand them my own selfrespect prevents me from supposing it to be possible that you have attributed an evil thought to me  indeed indeed i never have said the husband  that i can assure you i regard as a matter of course said the wife  but you know emily the way in which the world talks  the world and do you regard the world louis  lady milborough i believe spoke to yourself  lady milborough no she did not speak to me she began to do so but i was careful to silence her at once from you louis i am bound to hear whatever you may choose to say to me but i will not hear from any other lips a single word that may be injurious to your honour this she said very quietly with much dignity and he felt that he had better not answer her she had given him the promise which he had demanded and he began to fear that if he pushed the matter further she might go back even from that amount of submission so he kissed her again and had the boy brought into the room and by the time that he went to dress for dinner he was able at any rate to seem to be well pleased  richard he said to the servant as soon as he was downstairs when colonel osborne calls again say that your mistress isnot at home he gave the order in the most indifferent tone of voice which he could assume but as he gave it he felt thoroughly ashamed of it richard who with the other servants had of course known that there had been a quarrel between his master and mistress for the last two days no doubt understood all about it  while they were sitting at dinner on the next day a saturday there came another note from colonel osborne the servant brought it to his mistress and she when she had looked at it put it down by her plate trevelyan knew immediately from whom the letter had come and understood how impossible it was for his wife to give it up in the servants presence the letter lay there till the man was out of the room and then she handed it to nora will you give that to louis she said it comes from the man whom he supposes to be my lover  emily said he jumping from his seat how can you allow words so horrible and so untrue to fall from your mouth  if it be not so why am i to be placed in such a position as this the servant knows of course from whom the letter comes and sees that i have been forbidden to open it then the man returned to the room and the remainder of the dinner passed off almost in silence it was their custom when they dined without company to leave the diningroom together but on this evening trevelyan remained for a few minutes that he might read colonel osbornes letter he waited standing on the rug with his face to the fireplace till he was quite alone and then he opened it it ran as follows      house of commons saturday     dear emily   trevelyan as he read this cursed colonel osborne between his teeth      dear emily     i called this afternoon but you were out i am afraid you    will be disappointed by what i have to tell you but you    should rather be glad of it they say at the c o that    sir marmaduke would not receive their letter if sent    now till the middle of june and that he could not be    in london let him do what he would till the end of    july they hope to have the session over by that time    and therefore the committee is to be put off till next    session they mean to have lord bowles home from canada    and they think that bowles would like to be here in the    winter sir marmaduke will be summoned for february next    and will of course stretch his stay over the hot months    all this will on the whole be for the best lady rowley    could hardly have packed up her things and come away at a    days notice whatever your father might have done ill    call tomorrow at luncheon time     yours always     f o   there was nothing objectionable in this letterexcepting always the dear emilynothing which it was not imperative on colonel osborne to communicate to the person to whom it was addressed trevelyan must now go upstairs and tell the contents of the letter to his wife but he felt that he had created for himself a terrible trouble he must tell his wife what was in the letter but the very telling of it would be a renewing of the soreness of his wound and then what was to be done in reference to the threatened visit for the sunday morning trevelyan knew very well that were his wife denied at that hour colonel osborne would understand the whole matter he had doubtless in his anger intended that colonel osborne should understand the whole matter but he was calmer now than he had been then and almost wished that the command given by him had not been so definite and imperious he remained with his arm on the mantelpiece thinking of it for some ten minutes and then went up into the drawingroom emily he said walking up to the table at which she was sitting you had better read that letter  i would so much rather not she replied haughtily  then nora can read it it concerns you both equally  nora with hesitating hand took the letter and read it they are not to come after all said she till next february  and why not asked mrs trevelyan  something about the session i dont quite understand  lord bowles is to come from canada said louis and they think he would prefer being here in the winter i dare say he would  but what has that to do with papa  i suppose they must both be here together said nora  i call that very hard indeed said mrs trevelyan  i cant agree with you there said her husband his coming at all is so much of a favour that it is almost a job  i dont see that it is a job at all said mrs trevelyan somebody is wanted and nobody can know more of the service than papa does but as the other man is a lord i suppose papa must give way does he say anything about mamma nora  you had better read the letter yourself said trevelyan who was desirous that his wife should know of the threatened visit  no louis i shall not do that you must not blow hot and cold too till the other day i should have thought that colonel osbornes letters were as innocent as an old newspaper as you have supposed them to be poisoned i will have nothing to do with them  this speech made him very angry it seemed that his wife who had yielded to him was determined to take out the value of her submission in the most disagreeable words which she could utter nora now closed the letter and handed it back to her brotherinlaw he laid it down on the table beside him and sat for a while with his eyes fixed upon his book at last he spoke again colonel osborne says that he will call tomorrow at luncheon time you can admit him if you please and thank him for the trouble he has taken in this matter  i shall not remain in the room if he be admitted said mrs trevelyan  there was silence again for some minutes and the cloud upon trevelyans brow became blacker than before then he rose from his chair and walked round to the sofa on which his wife was sitting i presume said he that your wishes and mine in this matter must be the same  i cannot tell what your wishes are she replied i never was more in the dark on any subject in my life my wishes at present are confined to a desire to save you as far as may be possible from the shame which must be attached to your own suspicions  i have never had any suspicions  a husband without suspicions does not intercept his wifes letters a husband without suspicions does not call in the aid of his servants to guard his wife a husband without suspicions  emily exclaimed nora rowley how can you say such thingson purpose to provoke him  yes on purpose to provoke me said trevelyan  and have i not been provoked have i not been injured you say now that you have not suspected me and yet in what condition do i find myself because an old woman has chosen to talk scandal about me i am placed in a position in my own house which is disgraceful to you and insupportable to myself this man has been in the habit of coming here on sundays and will of course know that we are at home you must manage it as you please if you choose to receive him i will go upstairs  why cant you let him come in and go away just as usual said nora  because louis has made me promise that i will never willingly be in his company again said mrs trevelyan i would have given the world to avoid a promise so disgraceful to me but it was exacted and it shall be kept having so spoken she swept out of the room and went upstairs to the nursery trevelyan sat for an hour with his book before him reading or pretending to read but his wife did not come downstairs then nora went up to her and he descended to his solitude below so far he had hardly gained much by the enforced obedience of his wife  on the next morning the three went to church together and as they were walking home trevelyans heart was filled with returning gentleness towards his wife he could not bear to be at wrath with her after the church service which they had just heard together but he was softerhearted than was she and knowing this was almost afraid to say anything that would again bring forth from her expressions of scorn as soon as they were alone within the house he took her by the hand and led her apart let all this be said he as though it had never been  that will hardly be possible louis she answered i cannot forget that i have beencautioned  but cannot you bring yourself to believe that i have meant it all for your good  i have never doubted it louisnever for a moment but it has hurt me to find that you should think that such caution was needed for my good  it was almost on his tongue to beg her pardon to acknowledge that he had made a mistake and to implore her to forget that he had ever made an objection to colonel osbornes visit he remembered at this moment the painful odiousness of that dear emily but he had to reconcile himself even to that telling himself that after all colonel osborne was an old mana man older even than his wifes father if she would only have met him with gentleness he would have withdrawn his command and have acknowledged that he had been wrong but she was hard dignified obedient and resentful it will i think he said be better for both of us that he should be asked in to lunch today  you must judge of that said emily perhaps upon the whole it will be best i can only say that i will not be present i will lunch upstairs with baby and you can make what excuse for me you please this was all very bad but it was in this way that things were allowed to arrange themselves richard was told that colonel osborne was coming to lunch and when he came something was muttered to him about mrs trevelyan being not quite well it was nora who told the innocent fib and though she did not tell it well she did her very best she felt that her brotherinlaw was very wretched and she was most anxious to relieve him colonel osborne did not stay long and then nora went upstairs to her sister  louis trevelyan felt that he had disgraced himself he had meant to have been strong and he had as he knew been very weak he had meant to have acted in a highminded honest manly manner but circumstances had been so untoward with him that on looking at his own conduct it seemed to him to have been mean and almost false and cowardly as the order for the exclusion of this hated man from his house had been given he should at any rate have stuck to the order at the moment of his vacillation he had simply intended to make things easy for his wife but she had taken advantage of his vacillation and had now clearly conquered him perhaps he respected her more than he had done when he was resolving three or four days since that he would be the master in his own house but it may be feared that the tenderness of his love for her had been impaired  late in the afternoon his wife and sisterinlaw came down dressed for walking and finding trevelyan in the library they asked him to join themit was a custom with them to walk in the park on a sunday afternoonand he at once assented and went out with them emily who had had her triumph was very gracious there should not be a word more said by her about colonel osborne she would avoid that gentleman never receiving him in curzon street and having as little to say to him as possible elsewhere but she would not throw his name in her husbands teeth or make any reference to the injury which had so manifestly been done to her unless louis should be indiscreet it should be as though it had been forgotten as they walked by chesterfield house and stanhope street into the park she began to discuss the sermon they had heard that morning and when she found that that subject was not alluring she spoke of a dinner to which they were to go at mrs fairfaxs house louis trevelyan was quite aware that he was being treated as a naughty boy who was to be forgiven  they went across hyde park into kensington gardens and still the same thing was going on nora found it to be almost impossible to say a word trevelyan answered his wifes questions but was otherwise silent emily worked very hard at her mission of forgiveness and hardly ceased in her efforts at conciliatory conversation women can work so much harder in this way than men find it possible to do she never flagged but continued to be fluent conciliatory and intolerably wearisome on a sudden they came across two men together who as they all knew were barely acquainted with each other these were colonel osborne and hugh stanbury  i am glad to find you are able to be out said the colonel  thanks yes i think my seclusion just now was almost as much due to baby as to anything else mr stanbury how is it we never see you now  it is the d r mrs trevelyannothing else the d r is a most grateful mistress but somewhat exacting i am allowed a couple of hours on sundays but otherwise my time is wholly passed in fleet street  how very unpleasant  well yes the unpleasantness of this world consists chiefly in the fact that when a man wants wages he must earn them the christian philosophers have a theory about it dont they call it the primeval fall original sin and that kind of thing  mr stanbury i wont have irreligion i hope that doesnt come from writing for the newspapers  certainly not with me mrs trevelyan i have never been put on to take that branch yet scrubby does that with us and does it excellently it was he who touched up the ritualists and then the commission and then the low church bishops till he didnt leave one of them a leg to stand upon  what is it then that the daily record upholds  it upholds the daily record believe in that and you will surely be saved then he turned to miss rowley and they two were soon walking on together each manifestly interested in what the other was saying though there was no word of tenderness spoken between them  colonel osborne was now between mr and mrs trevelyan she would have avoided the position had it been possible for her to do so while they were falling into their present places she had made a little mute appeal to her husband to take her away from the spot to give her his arm and return with her to save her in some way from remaining in company with the man to whose company for her he had objected but he took no such step it had seemed to him that he could take no such step without showing his hostility to colonel osborne  they walked on along the broad path together and the colonel was between them  i hope you think it satisfactoryabout sir rowley he said  beggars must not be choosers you know colonel osborne i felt a little disappointed when i found that we were not to see them till february next  they will stay longer then you know than they could now  i have no doubt when the time comes we shall all believe it to be better  i suppose you think emily that a little pudding today is better than much tomorrow  colonel osborne certainly had a caressing wouldbe affectionate mode of talking to women which unless it were reciprocated and enjoyed was likely to make itself disagreeable no possible words could have been more innocent than those he had now spoken but he had turned his face down close to her face and had almost whispered them and then too he had again called her by her christian name trevelyan had not heard the words he had walked on making the distance between him and the other man greater than was necessary anxious to show to his wife that he had no jealousy at such a meeting as this but his wife was determined that she would put an end to this state of things let the cost be what it might she did not say a word to colonel osborne but addressed herself at once to her husband  louis she said will you give me your arm we will go back if you please then she took her husbands arm and turned herself and him abruptly away from their companion  the thing was done in such a manner that it was impossible that colonel osborne should not perceive that he had been left in anger when trevelyan and his wife had gone back a few yards he was obliged to return for nora he did so and then rejoined his wife  it was quite unnecessary emily he said that you should behave like that  your suspicions she said have made it almost impossible for me to behave with propriety  you have told him everything now said trevelyan  and it was requisite that he should be told said his wife then they walked home without interchanging another word when they reached their house emily at once went up to her own room and trevelyan to his they parted as though they had no common interest which was worthy of a moments conversation and she by her step and gait and every movement of her body showed to him that she was not his wife now in any sense that could bring to him a feeling of domestic happiness her compliance with his command was of no use to him unless she could be brought to comply in spirit unless she would be soft to him he could not be happy he walked about his room uneasily for halfanhour trying to shake off his sorrow and then he went up to her room emily he said for gods sake let all this pass away  what is to pass away  this feeling of rancour between you and me what is the world to us unless we can love one another at any rate it will be nothing to me  do you doubt my love said she  no certainly not  nor i yours without love louis you and i can not be happy but love alone will not make us so there must be trust and there must also be forbearance my feeling of annoyance will pass away in time and till it does i will shew it as little as may be possible  he felt that he had nothing more to say and then he left her but he had gained nothing by the interview she was still hard and cold and still assumed a tone which seemed to imply that she had manifestly been the injured person  colonel osborne when he was left alone stood for a few moments on the spot and then with a whistle a shake of the head and a little low chuckle of laughter rejoined the crowd     chapter vii  miss jemima stanbury of exeter      illustration  miss jemima stanbury the aunt of our friend hugh was a maiden lady very much respected indeed in the city of exeter it is to be hoped that no readers of these pages will be so unenglish as to be unable to appreciate the difference between county society and town societythe society that is of a provincial town or so ignorant as not to know also that there may be persons so privileged that although they live distinctly within a provincial town there is accorded to them as though by brevet rank all the merit of living in the county in reference to persons so privileged it is considered that they have been made free from the contamination of contiguous bricks and mortar by certain inner gifts probably of birth occasionally of profession possibly of merit it is very rarely indeed that money alone will bestow this acknowledged rank and in exeter which by the stringency and excellence of its welldefined rules on such matters may perhaps be said to take the lead of all english provincial towns money alone has never availed good blood especially if it be blood good in devonshire is rarely rejected clergymen are allowed within the palethough by no means as certainly as used to be the case and indeed in these days of literates clergymen have to pass harder examinations than those ever imposed upon them by bishops chaplains before they are admitted ad eundem among the chosen ones of the city of exeter the wives and daughters of the old prebendaries see well to that and as has been said special merit may prevail sir peter mancrudy the great exeter physician has won his way innot at all by being sir peter which has stood in his way rather than otherwisebut by the acknowledged excellence of his book about saltzes sir peter mancrudy is supposed to have quite a metropolitan almost a european reputationand therefore is acknowledged to belong to the county set although he never dines out at any house beyond the limits of the city now let it be known that no inhabitant of exeter ever achieved a clearer right to be regarded as county in opposition to town than had miss jemima stanbury there was not a tradesman in exeter who was not aware of it and who did not touch his hat to her accordingly the men who drove the flies when summoned to take her out at night would bring oats with them knowing how probable it was that they might have to travel far a distinct apology was made if she was asked to drink tea with people who were simply town the noels of doddescombe leigh the cliffords of budleigh salterton the powels of haldon the cheritons of alphingtonall county persons but very frequently in the citywere greeted by her and greeted her on terms of equality her most intimate friend was old mrs machugh the widow of the last dean but two who could not have stood higher had she been the widow of the last bishop and then although miss stanbury was intimate with the frenches of heavitree with the wrights of northernhay with the apjohns of helion villaa really magnificent house two miles out of the city on the crediton road and with the crumbies of cronstadt house saint ideswho would have been county people if living in the country made the differencealthough she was intimate with all these families her manner to them was not the same nor was it expected to be the same as with those of her own acknowledged set these things are understood in exeter so well  miss stanbury belonged to the county set but she lived in a large brick house standing in the close almost behind the cathedral indeed it was so close to the eastern end of the edifice that a carriage could not be brought quite up to her door it was a large brick house very old with a door in the middle and five steps ascending to it between high iron rails on each side of the door there were two windows on the ground floor and above that there were three tiers of five windows each and the house was double throughout having as many windows looking out behind into a gloomy courtyard but the glory of the house consisted in this that there was a garden attached to it a garden with very high walls over which the boughs of trees might be seen giving to the otherwise gloomy abode a touch of freshness in the summer and a look of space in the winter which no doubt added something to the reputation even of miss stanbury the factfor it was a factthat there was no gloomier or less attractive spot in the whole city than miss stanburys garden when seen inside did not militate against this advantage there were but halfadozen trees and a few square yards of grass that was never green and a damp ungravelled path on which no one ever walked seen from the inside the garden was not much but from the outside it gave a distinct character to the house and produced an unexpressed acknowledgment that the owner of it ought to belong to the county set  the house and all that was in it belonged to miss stanbury herself as did also many other houses in the neighbourhood she was the owner of the cock and bottle a very decent second class inn on the other side of the close an inn supposed to have clerical tendencies which made it quite suitable for a close the choristers took their beer there and the landlord was a retired verger nearly the whole of one side of a dark passage leading out of the close towards the high street belonged to her and though the passage be narrow and the houses dark the locality is known to be good for trade and she owned two large houses in the high street and a great warehouse at st thomass and had been bought out of land by the railway at st davidsmuch to her own dissatisfaction as she was wont to express herself but undoubtedly at a very high price it will be understood therefore that miss stanbury was wealthy and that she was bound to the city in which she lived by peculiar ties  but miss stanbury had not been born to this wealth nor can she be said to have inherited from her forefathers any of these high privileges which had been awarded to her she had achieved them by the romance of her life and the manner in which she had carried herself amidst its vicissitudes her father had been vicar of nuncombe putney a parish lying twenty miles west of exeter among the moors and on her fathers death her brother also now dead had become vicar of the same parishher brother whose only son hugh stanbury we already know working for the d r up in london when miss stanbury was twentyone she became engaged to a certain mr brooke burgess the eldest son of a banker in exeteror it might perhaps be better said a banker himself for at the time mr brooke burgess was in the firm it need not here be told how various misfortunes arose how mr burgess quarrelled with the stanbury family how jemima quarrelled with her own family how when her father died she went out from nuncombe putney parsonage and lived on the smallest pittance in a city lodging how her lover was untrue to her and did not marry her and how at last he died and left her every shilling that he possessed  the devonshire people at the time had been much divided as to the merits of the stanbury quarrel there were many who said that the brother could not have acted otherwise than he did and that miss stanbury though by force of character and force of circumstances she had weathered the storm had in truth been very indiscreet the results however were as have been described at the period of which we treat miss stanbury was a very rich lady living by herself in exeter admitted without question to be one of the county set and still at variance with her brothers family except to hugh she had never spoken a word to one of them since her brothers death when the money came into her hands she at that time being over forty and her nephew being then just ten years old she had undertaken to educate him and to start him in the world we know how she had kept her word and how and why she had withdrawn herself from any further responsibility in the matter  and in regard to this business of starting the young man she had been careful to let it be known that she would do no more than start him in the formal document by means of which she had made the proposal to her brother she had been careful to let it be understood that simple education was all that she intended to bestow upon himand that only she had added in the event of my surviving till his education be completed and to hugh himself she had declared that any allowance which she made him after he was called to the bar was only made in order to give him room for his foot a spot of ground from whence to make his first leap we know how he made that leap infinitely to the disgust of his aunt who when he refused obedience to her in the matter of withdrawing from the daily record immediately withdrew from him not only her patronage and assistance but even her friendship and acquaintance this was the letter which she wrote to him      i dont think that writing radical stuff for a penny    newspaper is a respectable occupation for a gentleman and    i will have nothing to do with it if you choose to do    such work i cannot help it but it was not for such that    i sent you to harrow and oxford nor yet up to london and    paid £100 a year to mr lambert i think you are treating    me badly but that is nothing to your bad treatment of    yourself you need not trouble yourself to answer this    unless you are prepared to say that you will not write any    more stuff for that penny newspaper only i wish to be    understood i will have no connection that i can help    and no acquaintance at all with radical scribblers and    incendiaries     jemima stanbury     the close exeter april 15 186   hugh stanbury had answered this thanking his aunt for past favours and explaining to heror striving to do sothat he felt it to be his duty to earn his bread as a means of earning it had come within his reach he might as well have spared himself the trouble she simply wrote a few words across his own letter in red inkthe bread of unworthiness should never be earned or eaten and then sent the letter back under a blank envelope to her nephew  she was a thorough tory of the old school had hugh taken to writing for a newspaper that had cost sixpence or even threepence for its copies she might perhaps have forgiven him at any rate the offence would not have been so flagrant and had the paper been conservative instead of liberal she would have had some qualms of conscience before she gave him up but to live by writing for a newspaper and for a penny newspaper and for a penny radical newspaper it was more than she could endure of what nature were the articles which he contributed it was impossible that she should have any idea for no consideration would have induced her to look at a penny newspaper or to admit it within her doors she herself took in the john bull and the herald and daily groaned deeply at the way in which those once great organs of true british public feeling were becoming demoralised and perverted had any reduction been made in the price of either of them she would at once have stopped her subscription in the matter of politics she had long since come to think that everything good was over she hated the name of reform so much that she could not bring herself to believe in mr disraeli and his bill for many years she had believed in lord derby she would fain believe in him still if she could it was the great desire of her heart to have some one in whom she believed in the bishop of her diocese she did believe and annually sent him some little comforting present from her own hand and in two or three of the clergymen around her she believed finding in them a flavour of the unascetic godliness of ancient days which was gratifying to her palate but in politics there was hardly a name remaining to which she could fix her faith and declare that there should be her guide for awhile she thought she would cling to mr lowe but when she made inquiry she found that there was no base there of really wellformed conservative granite the three gentlemen who had dissevered themselves from mr disraeli when mr disraeli was passing his reform bill were doubtless very good in their way but they were not big enough to fill her heart she tried to make herself happy with general peel but general peel was after all no more than a shade to her but the untruth of others never made her untrue and she still talked of the excellence of george iii and the glories of the subsequent reign she had a bust of lord eldon before which she was accustomed to stand with hands closed and to weepor to think that she wept  she was a little woman now nearly sixty years of age with bright grey eyes and a strong roman nose and thin lips and a sharpcut chin she wore a headgear that almost amounted to a mobcap and beneath it her grey hair was always frizzled with the greatest care her dress was invariably of black silk and she had five gownsone for church one for evening parties one for driving out and one for evenings at home and one for mornings the dress when new always went to church nothing she was wont to say was too good for the lords house in the days of crinolines she had protested that she had never worn onea protest however which was hardly true and now in these later days her hatred was especially developed in reference to the headdresses of young women chignon was a word which she had never been heard to pronounce she would talk of those bandboxes which the sluts wear behind their noddles for miss stanbury allowed herself the use of much strong language she was very punctilious in all her habits breakfasting ever at halfpast eight and dining always at six halfpast five had been her time till the bishop who on an occasion was to be her guest once signified to her that such an hour cut up the day and interfered with clerical work her lunch was always of bread and cheese and they who lunched with her either eat thator the bread without the cheese an afternoon tea was a thing horrible to her imagination tea and buttered toast at halfpast eight in the evening was the great luxury of her life she was as strong as a horse and had never hitherto known a days illness as a consequence of this she did not believe in the illness of other peopleespecially not in the illness of women she did not like a girl who could not drink a glass of beer with her bread and cheese in the middle of the day and she thought that a glass of port after dinner was good for everybody indeed she had a thorough belief in port wine thinking that it would go far to cure most miseries but she could not put up with the idea that a woman young or old should want the stimulus of a glass of sherry to support her at any odd time of the day hot concoctions of strong drink at christmas she would allow to everybody and was very strong in recommending such comforts to ladies blessed or about to be blessed with babies she took the sacrament every month and gave away exactly a tenth of her income to the poor she believed that there was a special holiness in a tithe of a thing and attributed the commencement of the downfall of the church of england to rent charges and the commutation of clergymens incomes since judas there had never been to her thinking a traitor so base or an apostate so sinful as colenso and yet of the nature of colensos teaching she was as ignorant as the towers of the cathedral opposite to her  she believed in exeter thinking that there was no other provincial town in england in which a maiden lady could live safely and decently london to her was an abode of sin and though as we have seen she delighted to call herself one of the county set she did not love the fields and lanes and in exeter the only place for a lady was the close southernhay and northernhay might be very well and there was doubtless a respectable neighbourhood on the heavitree side of the town but for the new streets and especially for the suburban villas she had no endurance she liked to deal at dear shops but would leave any shop either dear or cheap in regard to which a printed advertisement should reach her eye she paid all her bills at the end of each six months and almost took a delight in high prices she would rejoice that bread should be cheap and grieve that meat should be dear because of the poor but in regard to other matters no reduction in the cost of an article ever pleased her she had houses as to which she was told by her agent that the rents should be raised but she would not raise them she had others which it was difficult to let without lowering the rents but she would not lower them all change was to her hateful and unnecessary  she kept three maidservants and a man came in every day to clean the knives and boots service with her was well requited and much labour was never exacted but it was not every young woman who could live with her a rigidity as to hours as to religious exercises and as to dress was exacted under which many poor girls altogether broke down but they who could stand this rigidity came to know that their places were very valuable no one belonging to them need want for aught when once the good opinion of miss stanbury had been earned when once she believed in her servant there was nobody like that servant there was not a man in exeter could clean a boot except giles hickbodyand if not in exeter then where else and her own maid martha who had lived with her now for twenty years and who had come with her to the brick house when she first inhabited it was such a woman that no other servant anywhere was fit to hold a candle to her but then martha had great giftswas never ill and really liked having sermons read to her  such was miss stanbury who had now discarded her nephew hugh she had never been tenderly affectionate to hugh or she would hardly have asked him to live in london on a hundred a year she had never really been kind to him since he was a boy for although she had paid for him she had been almost penurious in her manner of doing so and had repeatedly given him to understand that in the event of her death not a shilling would be left to him indeed as to that matter of bequeathing her money it was understood that it was her purpose to let it all go back to the burgess family with the burgess family she had kept up no sustained connection it being quite understood that she was never to be asked to meet the only one of them now left in exeter nor was it as yet known to any one in what manner the money was to go back how it was to be divided or who were to be the recipients but she had declared that it should go back explaining that she had conceived it to be a duty to let her own relations know that they would not inherit her wealth at her death  about a week after she had sent back poor hughs letter with the endorsement on it as to unworthy bread she summoned martha to the back parlour in which she was accustomed to write her letters it was one of the theories of her life that different rooms should be used only for the purposes for which they were intended she never allowed pens and ink up into the bedrooms and had she ever heard that any guest in her house was reading in bed she would have made an instant personal attack upon that guest whether male or female which would have surprised that guest poor hugh would have got on better with her had he not been discovered once smoking in the garden nor would she have writing materials in the drawingroom or diningroom there was a chamber behind the diningroom in which there was an inkbottle and if there was a letter to be written let the writer go there and write it in the writing of many letters however she put no confidence and regarded penny postage as one of the strongest evidences of the coming ruin  martha she said i want to speak to you sit down i think i am going to do something martha sat down but did not speak a word there had been no question asked of her and the time for speaking had not come i am writing to mrs stanbury at nuncombe putney and what do you think i am saying to her  now the question had been asked and it was marthas duty to reply  writing to mrs stanbury maam  yes to mrs stanbury  it aint possible for me to say maam unless its to put mr hugh from going on with the newspapers  when my nephew wont be controlled by me i shant go elsewhere to look for control over him you may be sure of that martha and remember martha i dont want to have his name mentioned again in the house you will tell them all so if you please  he was a very nice gentleman maam  martha i wont have it and theres an end of it i wont have it perhaps i know what goes to the making of a nice gentleman as well as you do  mr hugh maam  i wont have it martha and when i say so let there be an end of it as she said this she got up from her chair and shook her head and took a turn about the room if im not mistress here im nobody  of course youre mistress here maam  and if i dont know whats fit to be done and whats not fit im too old to learn and whats more i wont be taught im not going to have my house crammed with radical incendiary stuff printed with ink that stinks on paper made out of straw if i cant live without penny literature at any rate ill die without it now listen to me  yes maam  i have asked mrs stanbury to send one of the girls over here  to live maam marthas tone as she asked the question showed how deeply she felt its importance  yes martha to live  youll never like it maam  i dont suppose i shall  youll never get on with it maam never the young ladyll be out of the house in a week or if she aint somebody else will  you mean yourself  im only a servant maam and it dont signify about me  youre a fool  thats true maam i dont doubt  ive sent for her and we must do the best we can perhaps she wont come  shell come fast enough said martha but whether shell stay thats a different thing i dont see how its possible shes to stay im told theyre feckless idle young ladies shell be so soft maam and you  well what of me  youll be so hard maam  im not a bit harder than you martha nor yet so hard ill do my duty or at least ill try now you know all about it and you may go away theres the letter and i mean to go out and post it myself     chapter viii  i know it will do   miss stanbury carried her letter all the way to the chief postoffice in the city having no faith whatever in those little subsidiary receiving houses which are established in different parts of the city as for the iron pillar boxes which had been erected of late years for the receipt of letters one of whicha most hateful thing to herstood almost close to her own hall door she had not the faintest belief that any letter put into one of them would ever reach its destination she could not understand why people should not walk with their letters to a respectable postoffice instead of chucking them into an iron stumpas she called itout in the middle of the street with nobody to look after it positive orders had been given that no letter from her house should ever be put into the iron post her epistle to her sisterinlaw of whom she never spoke otherwise than as mrs stanbury was as follows      the close exeter 22nd april 186     my dear sister stanbury     your son hugh has taken to courses of which i do not    approve and therefore i have put an end to my connection    with him i shall be happy to entertain your daughter    dorothy in my house if you and she approve of such a plan    should you agree to this she will be welcome to receive    you or her sisternot her brotherin my house any    wednesday morning between halfpast nine and halfpast    twelve i will endeavour to make my house pleasant to her    and useful and will make her an allowance of £25 per    annum for her clothes as long as she may remain with me i    shall expect her to be regular at meals to be constant in    going to church and not to read modern novels     i intend the arrangement to be permanent but of course i    must retain the power of closing it if and when i shall    see fit its permanence must be contingent on my life i    have no power of providing for any one after my death     yours truly     jemima stanbury     i hope the young lady does not have any false hair about    her   when this note was received at nuncombe putney the amazement which it occasioned was extreme mrs stanbury the widow of the late vicar lived in a little morsel of a cottage on the outskirts of the village with her two daughters priscilla and dorothy their whole income out of which it was necessary that they should pay rent for their cottage was less than £70 per annum during the last few months a fivepound note now and again had found its way to nuncombe putney out of the coffers of the d r but the ladies there were most unwilling to be so relieved thinking that their brothers career was of infinitely more importance than their comforts or even than their living they were very poor but they were accustomed to poverty the elder sister was older than hugh but dorothy the younger to whom this strange invitation was now made was two years younger than her brother and was now nearly twentysix how they had lived and dressed themselves and had continued to be called ladies by the inhabitants of the village was and is and will be a mystery to those who have had the spending of much larger incomes but have still been always poor but they had lived had gone to church every sunday in decent apparel and had kept up friendly relations with the family of the present vicar and with one or two other neighbours  when the letter had been read first by the mother and then aloud and then by each of them separately in the little sittingroom in the cottage there was silence among themfor neither of them desired to be the first to express an opinion nothing could be more natural than the proposed arrangement had it not been made unnatural by a quarrel existing nearly throughout the whole life of the person most nearly concerned priscilla the elder daughter was the one of the family who was generally the ruler and she at last expressed an opinion adverse to the arrangement my dear you would never be able to bear it said priscilla  i suppose not said mrs stanbury plaintively  i could try said dorothy  my dear you dont know that woman said priscilla  of course i dont know her said dorothy  she has always been very good to hugh said mrs stanbury  i dont think she has been good to him at all said priscilla  but think what a saving it would be said dorothy and i could send home half of what aunt stanbury says she would give me  you must not think of that said priscilla because she expects you to be dressed  i should like to try she said before the morning was overif you and mamma dont think it would be wrong  the conference that day ended in a written request to aunt stanbury that a week might be allowed for considerationthe letter being written by priscilla but signed with her mothers nameand with a very long epistle to hugh in which each of the ladies took a part and in which advice and decision were demanded it was very evident to hugh that his mother and dorothy were for compliance and that priscilla was for refusal but he never doubted for a moment of course she will go he said in his answer to priscilla and she must understand that aunt stanbury is a most excellent woman as true as the sun thoroughly honest with no fault but this that she likes her own way of course dolly can go back again if she finds the house too hard for her then he sent another fivepound note observing that dollys journey to exeter would cost money and that her wardrobe would want some improvement  im very glad that it isnt me said priscilla who however did not attempt to oppose the decision of the man of the family dorothy was greatly gratified by the excitement of the proposed change in her life and the following letter the product of the wisdom of the family was written by mrs stanbury      nuncombe putney 1st may 186     my dear sister stanbury     we are all very thankful for the kindness of your offer    which my daughter dorothy will accept with feelings of    affectionate gratitude i think you will find her docile    goodtempered and amiable but a mother of course    speaks well of her own child she will endeavour to comply    with your wishes in all things reasonable she of course    understands that should the arrangement not suit she will    come back home on the expression of your wish that it    should be so and she will of course do the same if she    should find that living in exeter does not suit herself    this sentence was inserted at the instance of priscilla    after much urgent expostulation dorothy will be ready    to go to you on any day you may fix after the 7th of this    month     believe me to remain    your affectionate sisterinlaw     p stanbury   shes going to come said miss stanbury to martha holding the letter in her hand  i never doubted her coming maam said martha  and i mean her to stay unless its her own fault shell have the small room upstairs looking out front next to mine and you must go and fetch her  go and fetch her maam  yes if you wont i must  she aint a child maam shes twentyfive years old and surely she can come to exeter by herself with a railroad all the way from lessboro  theres no place a young woman is insulted in so bad as those railway carriages and i wont have her come by herself if she is to live with me she shall begin decently at any rate  martha argued the matter but was of course beaten and on the day fixed started early in the morning for nuncombe putney and returned in the afternoon to the close with her charge by the time that she had reached the house she had in some degree reconciled herself to the dangerous step that her mistress had taken partly by perceiving that in face dorothy stanbury was very like her brother hugh and partly perhaps by finding that the young womans manner to herself was both gentle and sprightly she knew well that gentleness alone without some backbone of strength under it would not long succeed with miss stanbury as far as i can judge maam shes a sweet young lady said martha when she reported her arrival to her mistress who had retired upstairs to her own room in order that she might thus hear a word of tidings from her lieutenant before she showed herself on the field of action  sweet i hate your sweets said miss stanbury  then why did you send for her maam  because i was an old fool but i must go down and receive her i suppose  then miss stanbury went down almost trembling as she went the matter to her was one of vital importance she was going to change the whole tenour of her life for the sakeas she told herselfof doing her duty by a relative whom she did not even know but we may fairly suppose that there had in truth been a feeling beyond that which taught her to desire to have some one near her to whom she might not only do her duty as guardian but whom she might also love she had tried this with her nephew but her nephew had been too strong for her too far from her too unlike to herself when he came to see her he had smoked a short pipewhich had been shocking to herand he had spoken of reform and trades unions and meetings in the parks as though they had not been devils ordinances and he was very shy of going to churchutterly refusing to be taken there twice on the same sunday and he had told his aunt that owing to a peculiar and unfortunate weakness in his constitution he could not listen to the reading of sermons and then she was almost certain that he had once kissed one of the maids she had found it impossible to manage him in any way and when he positively declared himself as permanently devoted to the degrading iniquities of penny newspapers she had thought it best to cast him off altogether now thus late in life she was going to make another venture to try an altogether new mode of livingin order as she said to herself that she might be of some use to somebodybut no doubt with a further unexpressed hope in her bosom that the solitude of her life might be relieved by the companionship of some one whom she might love she had arrayed herself in a clean cap and her evening gown and she went downstairs looking sternly with a fullydeveloped idea that she must initiate her new duties by assuming a mastery at once but inwardly she trembled and was intensely anxious as to the first appearance of her niece of course there would be a little morsel of a bonnet she hated those vile patchesdirty flat daubs of millinery as she called them but they had become too general for her to refuse admittance for such a thing within her doors but a chignon a bandbox behind the noddleshe would not endure and then there were other details of feminine gear which shall not be specified as to which she was painfully anxiousalmost forgetting in her anxiety that the dress of this young woman whom she was about to see must have ever been regulated by the closest possible economy  the first thing she saw on entering the room was a dark straw hat a straw hat with a strong penthouse flap to it and her heart was immediately softened  my dear she said i am glad to see you  dorothy who on her part was trembling also whose position was one to justify most intense anxiety murmured some reply  take off your hat said the aunt and let me give you a kiss  the hat was taken off and the kiss was given there was certainly no chignon there dorothy stanbury was light haired with almost flaxen ringlets worn after the oldfashioned way which we used to think so pretty when we were young she had very soft grey eyes which ever seemed to beseech you to do something when they looked at you and her mouth was a beseeching mouth there are women who even amidst their strongest efforts at giving assistance to others always look as though they were asking aid themselves and such a one was dorothy stanbury her complexion was pale but there was always present in it a tint of pink running here and there changing with every word she spoke changing indeed with every pulse of her heart nothing ever was softer than her cheek but her hands were thin and hard and almost fibrous with the working of the thread upon them she was rather tall than otherwise but that extreme look of feminine dependence which always accompanied her took away something even from the appearance of her height  these are all real at any rate said her aunt taking hold of the curls and wont be hurt by a little cold water  dorothy smiled but said nothing and was then taken up to her bedroom indeed when the aunt and niece sat down to dinner together dorothy had hardly spoken but miss stanbury had spoken and things upon the whole had gone very well  i hope you like roast chicken my dear said miss stanbury  oh thank you  and bread sauce jane i do hope the bread sauce is hot  if the reader thinks that miss stanbury was indifferent to considerations of the table the reader is altogether ignorant of miss stanburys character when miss stanbury gave her niece the liverwing and picked out from the attendant sausages one that had been well browned and properly broken in the frying she meant to do a real kindness  and now my dear there are mashed potatoes and bread sauce as for green vegetables i dont know what has become of them they tell me i may have green peas from france at a shilling a quart but if i cant have english green peas i wont have any  miss stanbury was standing up as she said thisas she always did on such occasions liking to have a full mastery over the dish  i hope you like it my dear  everything is so very nice  thats right i like to see a young woman with an appetite remember that god sends the good things for us to eat and as long as we dont take more than our share and give away something to those who havent a fair share of their own i for one think it quite right to enjoy my victuals jane this bread sauce isnt hot it never is hot dont tell me i know what hot is  dorothy thought that her aunt was very angry but jane knew miss stanbury better and bore the scolding without shaking in her shoes  and now my dear you must take a glass of port wine it will do you good after your journey  dorothy attempted to explain that she never did drink any wine but her aunt talked down her scruples at once  one glass of port wine never did anybody any harm and as there is port wine it must be intended that somebody should drink it  miss stanbury as she sipped hers out very slowly seemed to enjoy it much although may had come there was a fire in the grate and she sat with her toes on the fender and her silk dress folded up above her knees she sat quite silent in this position for a quarter of an hour every now and then raising her glass to her lips dorothy sat silent also to her in the newness of her condition speech was impossible  i think it will do said miss stanbury at last  as dorothy had no idea what would do she could make no reply to this  im sure it will do said miss stanbury after another short interval youre as like my poor sister as two eggs you dont have headaches do you  dorothy said that she was not ordinarily affected in that way  when girls have headaches it comes from tightlacing and not walking enough and carrying all manner of nasty smells about with them i know what headaches mean how is a woman not to have a headache when she carries a thing on the back of her poll as big as a gardeners wheelbarrow come its a fine evening and well go out and look at the towers youve never even seen them yet i suppose  so they went out and finding the verger at the cathedral door he being a great friend of miss stanburys they walked up and down the aisles and dorothy was instructed as to what would be expected from her in regard to the outward forms of religion she was to go to the cathedral service on the morning of every weekday and on sundays in the afternoon on sunday mornings she was to attend the little church of st margaret on sunday evenings it was the practice of miss stanbury to read a sermon in the diningroom to all of whom her household consisted did dorothy like daily services dorothy who was more patient than her brother and whose life had been much less energetic said that she had no objection to going to church every day when there was not too much to do  there never need be too much to do to attend the lords house said miss stanbury somewhat angrily  only if youve got to make the beds said dorothy  my dear i beg your pardon said miss stanbury i beg your pardon heartily im a thoughtless old woman i know never mind now well go in  later in the evening when she gave her niece a candlestick to go to bed she repeated what she had said before  itll do very well my dear im sure itll do but if you read in bed either night or morning ill never forgive you  this last caution was uttered with so much energy that dorothy gave a little jump as she promised obedience     chapter ix  shewing how the quarrel progressed again   on one sunday morning when the month of may was nearly over hugh stanbury met colonel osborne in curzon street not many yards from trevelyans door colonel osborne had just come from the house and stanbury was going to it hugh had not spoken to osborne since the day now a fortnight since on which both of them had witnessed the scene in the park but on that occasion they had been left together and it had been impossible for them not to say a few words about their mutual friends osborne had expressed his sorrow that there should be any misunderstanding and had called trevelyan a confounded fool stanbury had suggested that there was something in it which they two probably did not understand and that matters would be sure to come all right the truth is trevelyan bullies her said osborne and if he goes on with that hell be sure to get the worst of it nowon this present occasionstanbury asked whether he would find the ladies at home yes they are both there said osborne trevelyan has just gone out in a huff shell never be able to go on living with him anybody can see that with half an eye then he had passed on and hugh stanbury knocked at the door  he was shown up into the drawingroom and found both the sisters there but he could see that mrs trevelyan had been in tears the avowed purpose of his visitthat is the purpose which he had avowed to himselfwas to talk about his sister dorothy he had told miss rowley while walking in the park with her how dorothy had been invited over to exeter by her aunt and how he had counselled his sister to accept the invitation nora had expressed herself very interested as to dorothys fate and had said how much she wished that she knew dorothy we all understand how sweet it is when two such persons as hugh stanbury and nora rowley cannot speak of their love for each other to say these tender things in regard to some one else nora had been quite anxious to know how dorothy had been received by that old conservative warrior as hugh stanbury had called his aunt and hugh had now come to curzon street with a letter from dorothy in his pocket but when he saw that there had been some cause for trouble he hardly knew how to introduce his subject  trevelyan is not at home he asked  no said emily with her face turned away he went out and left us a quarter of an hour since did you meet colonel osborne  i was speaking to him in the street not a moment since as he answered he could see that nora was making some sign to her sister nora was most anxious that emily should not speak of what had just occurred but her signs were all thrown away somebody must tell him said mrs trevelyan and i dont know who can do so better than so old a friend as mr stanbury  tell what and to whom he asked  no no no said nora  then i must tell him myself said she that is all as for standing this kind of life it is out of the question i should either destroy myself or go mad  if i could do any good i should be so happy said stanbury  nobody can do any good between a man and his wife said nora  then mrs trevelyan began to tell her story putting aside with an impatient motion of her hands the efforts which her sister made to stop her she was very angry and as she told it standing up all trace of sobbing soon disappeared from her voice the fact is she said he does not know his own mind or what to fear or what not to fear he told me that i was never to see colonel osborne again  what is the use emily of your repeating that to mr stanbury  why should i not repeat it colonel osborne is papas oldest friend and mine too he is a man i like very muchwho is a real friend to me as he is old enough to be my father one would have thought that my husband could have found no objection  i dont know much about his age said stanbury  it does make a difference it must make a difference i should not think of becoming so intimate with a younger man but however when my husband told me that i was to see him no morethough the insult nearly killed me i determined to obey him an order was given that colonel osborne should not be admitted you may imagine how painful it was but it was given and i was prepared to bear it  but he had been lunching with you on that sunday  yes that is just it as soon as it was given louis would rescind it because he was ashamed of what he had done he was so jealous that he did not want me to see the man and yet he was so afraid that it should be known that he ordered me to see him he ordered him into the house at last and ii went away upstairs  that was on the sunday that we met you in the park asked stanbury  what is the use of going back to all that said nora  then i met him by chance in the park continued mrs trevelyan and because he said a word which i knew would anger my husband i left him abruptly since that my husband has begged that things might go on as they were before he could not bear that colonel osborne himself should think that he was jealous well i gave way and the man has been here as before and now there has been a scene which has been disgraceful to us all i cannot stand it and i wont if he does not behave himself with more manlinessi will leave him  but what can i do  nothing mr stanbury said nora  yes you can do this you can go to him from me and can tell him that i have chosen you as a messenger because you are his friend you can tell him that i am willing to obey him in anything if he chooses i will consent that colonel osborne shall be asked never to come into my presence again it will be very absurd but if he chooses i will consent or i will let things go on as they are and continue to receive my fathers old friend when he comes but if i do i will not put up with an imputation on my conduct because he does not like the way in which the gentleman thinks fit to address me i take upon myself to say that if any man alive spoke to me as he ought not to speak i should know how to resent it myself but i cannot fly into a passion with an old gentleman for calling me by my christian name when he has done so habitually for years  from all this it will appear that the great godsend of a rich marriage with all manner of attendant comforts which had come in the way of the rowley family as they were living at the mandarins had not turned out to be an unmixed blessing in the matter of the quarrel as it had hitherto progressed the husband had perhaps been more in the wrong than his wife but the wife in spite of all her promises of perfect obedience had proved herself to be a woman very hard to manage had she been earnest in her desire to please her lord and master in this matter of colonel osbornes visitsto please him even after he had so vacillated in his own behestsshe might probably have so received the man as to have quelled all feeling of jealousy in her husbands bosom but instead of doing so she had told herself that as she was innocent and as her innocence had been acknowledged and as she had been specially instructed to receive this man whom she had before been specially instructed not to receive she would now fall back exactly into her old manner with him she had told colonel osborne never to allude to that meeting in the park and to ask no creature as to what had occasioned her conduct on that sunday thus having a mystery with him which of course he understood as well as she did and then she had again taken to writing notes to him and receiving notes from himnone of which she showed to her husband she was more intimate with him than ever and yet she hardly ever mentioned his name to her husband trevelyan acknowledging to himself that he had done no good by his former interference feeling that he had put himself in the wrong on that occasion and that his wife had got the better of him had borne with all this with soreness and a moody savageness of general conduct but still without further words of anger with reference to the man himself but now on this sunday when his wife had been closeted with colonel osborne in the back drawingroom leaving him with his sisterinlaw his temper had become too hot for him and he had suddenly left the house declaring that he would not walk with the two women on that day why not louis his wife had said coming up to him never mind why not but i shall not he had answered and then he left the room  what is the matter with him colonel osborne had asked  it is impossible to say what is the matter with him mrs trevelyan had replied after that she had at once gone upstairs to her child telling herself that she was doing all that the strictest propriety could require in leaving the mans society as soon as her husband was gone then there was an awkward minute or two between nora and colonel osborne and he took his leave  stanbury at last promised that he would see trevelyan repeating however very frequently that oftenused assertion that no task is so hopeless as that of interfering between a man and his wife nevertheless he promised and undertook to look for trevelyan at the acrobats on that afternoon at last he got a moment in which to produce the letter from his sister and was able to turn the conversation for a few minutes to his own affairs dorothys letter was read and discussed by both the ladies with much zeal it is quite a strange world to me said dorothy but i am beginning to find myself more at my ease than i was at first aunt stanbury is very goodnatured and when i know what she wants i think i shall be able to please her what you said of her disposition is not so bad to me as of course a girl in my position does not expect to have her own way  why shouldnt she have her share of her own way as well as anybody else said mrs trevelyan  poor dorothy would never want to have her own way said hugh  she ought to want it said mrs trevelyan  she has spirit enough to turn if shes trodden on said hugh  thats more than what most women have said mrs trevelyan  then he went on with the letter she is very generous and has given me £6 5s in advance of my allowance when i said i would send part of it home to mamma she seemed to be angry and said that she wanted me always to look nice about my clothes she told me afterwards to do as i pleased and that i might try my own way for the first quarter so i was frightened and only sent thirty shillings we went out the other evening to drink tea with mrs machugh an old lady whose husband was once dean i had to go and it was all very nice there were a great many clergymen there but many of them were young men poor dorothy exclaimed nora one of them was the minor canon who chants the service every morning he is a bachelor then there is a hope for her said noraand he always talks a little as though he were singing the litany thats very bad said nora fancy having a husband to sing the litany to you always better that perhaps than having him always singing something else said mrs trevelyan  it was decided between them that dorothys state might on the whole be considered as flourishing but that hugh was bound as a brother to go down to exeter and look after her he explained however that he was expressly debarred from calling on his sister even between the hours of halfpast nine and halfpast twelve on wednesday mornings and that he could not see her at all unless he did so surreptitiously  if i were you i would see my sister in spite of all the old viragos in exeter said mrs trevelyan i have no idea of anybody taking so much upon themselves  you must remember mrs trevelyan that she has taken upon herself much also in the way of kindness in doing what perhaps i ought to call charity i wonder what i should have been doing now if it were not for my aunt stanbury  he took his leave and went at once from curzon street to trevelyans club and found that trevelyan had not been there as yet in another hour he called again and was about to give it up when he met the man whom he was seeking on the steps  i was looking for you he said  well here i am  it was impossible not to see in the look of trevelyans face and not to hear in the tone of his voice that he was at the moment in an angry and unhappy frame of mind he did not move as though he were willing to accompany his friend and seemed almost to know beforehand that the approaching interview was to be an unpleasant one  i want to speak to you and perhaps you wouldnt mind taking a turn with me said stanbury  but trevelyan objected to this and led the way into the club waitingroom a club waitingroom is always a gloomy unpromising place for a confidential conversation and so stanbury felt it to be on the present occasion but he had no alternative there they were together and he must do as he had promised trevelyan kept on his hat and did not sit down and looked very gloomy stanbury having to commence without any assistance from outward auxiliaries almost forgot what it was that he had promised to do  i have just come from curzon street he said  well  at least i was there about two hours ago  it doesnt matter i suppose whether it was two hours or two minutes said trevelyan  not in the least the fact is this i happened to come upon the two girls there when they were very unhappy and your wife asked me to come and say a word or two to you  was colonel osborne there  no i had met him in the street a minute or two before  well now look here stanbury if youll take my advice youll keep your hands out of this it is not but that i regard you as being as good a friend as i have in the world but to own the truth i cannot put up with interference between myself and my wife  of course you understand that i only come as a messenger      illustration i only come as a messenger   you had better not be a messenger in such a cause if she has anything to say she can say it to myself  am i to understand that you will not listen to me  i had rather not  i think you are wrong said stanbury  in that matter you must allow me to judge for myself i can easily understand that a young woman like her especially with her sister to back her should induce such a one as you to take her part  i am taking nobodys part you wrong your wife and you especially wrong miss rowley  if you please stanbury we will say nothing more about it this trevelyan said holding the door of the room half open in his hand so that the other was obliged to pass out through it  good evening said stanbury with much anger  good evening said trevelyan with an assumption of indifference  stanbury went away in absolute wrath though the trouble which he had had in the interview was much less than he had anticipated and the result quite as favourable he had known that no good would come of his visit and yet he was now full of anger against trevelyan and had become a partisan in the matterwhich was exactly that which he had resolutely determined that he would not become i believe that no woman on earth could live with him he said to himself as he walked away it was always the same with hima desire for mastery which he did not know how to use when he had obtained it if it were nora instead of the other sister he would break her sweet heart within a month  trevelyan dined at his club and hardly spoke a word to any one during the evening at about eleven he started to walk home but went by no means straight thither taking a long turn through st jamess park and by pimlico it was necessary that he should make up his mind as to what he would do he had sternly refused the interference of a friend and he must be prepared to act on his own responsibility he knew well that he could not begin again with his wife on the next day as though nothing had happened stanburys visit to him if it had done nothing else had made this impossible he determined that he would not go to her room tonight but would see her as early as possible in the morningand would then talk to her with all the wisdom of which he was master  how many husbands have come to the same resolution and how few of them have found the words of wisdom to be efficacious     chapter x  hard words      illustration  it is to be feared that men in general do not regret as they should do any temporary illfeeling or irritating jealousy between husbands and wives of which they themselves have been the cause the author is not speaking now of actual lovemakings of intrigues and devilish villany either perpetrated or imagined but rather of those passing gusts of shortlived and unfounded suspicion to which as to other accidents very wellregulated families may occasionally be liable when such suspicion rises in the bosom of a wife some woman intervening or being believed to intervene between her and the man who is her own that woman who has intervened or been supposed to intervene will either glory in her position or bewail it bitterly according to the circumstances of the case we will charitably suppose that in a great majority of such instances she will bewail it but when such painful jealous doubts annoy the husband the man who is in the way will almost always feel himself justified in extracting a slightly pleasurable sensation from the transaction he will say to himself probably unconsciously indeed and with no formed words that the husband is an ass an ass if he be in a twitter either for that which he has kept or for that which he has been unable to keep that the lady has shewn a good deal of appreciation and that he himself isisisquite a captain bold of halifax all the while he will not have the slightest intention of wronging the husbands honour and will have received no greater favour from the intimacy accorded to him than the privilege of running on one day to marshall and snellgroves the haberdashers and on another to handcocks the jewellers if he be allowed to buy a present or two or to pay a few shillings here or there he has achieved much terrible things now and again do occur even here in england but women with us are slow to burn their household gods it happens however occasionally as we are all aware that the outward garments of a domestic deity will be a little scorched and when this occurs the man who is the interloper will generally find a gentle consolation in his position let its interest be ever so flaccid and unreal and its troubles in running about and the like ever so considerable and timedestructive  it was so certainly with colonel osborne when he became aware that his intimacy with mrs trevelyan had caused her husband uneasiness he was not especially a vicious man and had now as we know reached a time of life when such vice as that in question might be supposed to have lost its charm for him a gentleman over fifty popular in london with a seat in parliament fond of good dinners and possessed of everything which the world has to give could hardly have wished to run away with his neighbours wife or to have destroyed the happiness of his old friends daughter such wickedness had never come into his head but he had a certain pleasure in being the confidential friend of a very pretty woman and when he heard that that pretty womans husband was jealous the pleasure was enhanced rather than otherwise on that sunday as he had left the house in curzon street he had told stanbury that trevelyan had just gone off in a huff which was true enough and he had walked from thence down clarges street and across piccadilly to st jamess street with a jauntier step than usual because he was aware that he himself had been the occasion of that trouble this was very wrong but there is reason to believe that many such men as colonel osborne who are bachelors at fifty are equally malicious  he thought a good deal about it on that evening and was still thinking about it on the following morning he had promised to go up to curzon street on the mondayreally on some most trivial mission on a matter of business which no man could have taken in hand whose time was of the slightest value to himself or any one else but now that mission assumed an importance in his eyes and seemed to require either a special observance or a special excuse there was no real reason why he should not have stayed away from curzon street for the next fortnight and had he done so he need have made no excuse to mrs trevelyan when he met her but the opportunity for a little excitement was not to be missed and instead of going he wrote to her the following note      albany monday     dear emily     what was it all about yesterday i was to have come up    with the words of that opera but perhaps it will be    better to send it if it be not wicked do tell me whether    i am to consider myself as a banished man i thought that    our little meetings were so innocentand so pleasant    the greeneyed monster is of all monsters the most    monstrousand the most unreasonable pray let me have a    line if it be not forbidden     yours always heartily     f o     putting aside all joking i beg you to remember that i    consider myself always entitled to be regarded by you as    your most sincere friend   when this was brought to mrs trevelyan about twelve oclock in the day she had already undergone the infliction of those words of wisdom which her husband had prepared for her and which were threatened at the close of the last chapter her husband had come up to her while she was yet in her bedroom and had striven hard to prevail against her but his success had been very doubtful in regard to the number of words mrs trevelyan certainly had had the best of it as far as any understanding one of another was concerned the conversation had been useless she believed herself to be injured and aggrieved and would continue so to assert let him implore her to listen to him as loudly as he might yesi will listen and i will obey you she had said but i will not endure such insults without telling you that i feel them then he had left her fully conscious that he had failed and went forth out of his house into the city to his club to wander about the streets not knowing what he had best do to bring back that state of tranquillity at home which he felt to be so desirable  mrs trevelyan was alone when colonel osbornes note was brought to her and was at that moment struggling with herself in anger against her husband if he laid any command upon her she would execute it but she would never cease to tell him that he had illused her she would din it into his ears let him come to her as often as he might with his wise words wise words what was the use of wise words when a man was such a fool in nature and as for colonel osborneshe would see him if he came to her three times a day unless her husband gave some clearly intelligible order to the contrary she was fortifying her mind with this resolution when colonel osbornes letter was brought to her she asked whether any servant was waiting for an answer nothe servant who had left it had gone at once she read the note and sat working with it before her for a quarter of an hour and then walked over to her desk and answered it      my dear colonel osborne     it will be best to say nothing whatever about the    occurrence of yesterday and if possible not to    think of it as far as i am concerned i wish for no    changeexcept that people should be more reasonable    you can call of course whenever you please and i am very    grateful for your expression of friendship     yours most sincerely     emily trevelyan     thanks for the words of the opera   when she had written this being determined that all should be open and above board she put a penny stamp on the envelope and desired that the letter should be posted but she destroyed that which she had received from colonel osborne in all things she would act as she would have done if her husband had not been so foolish and there could have been no reason why she should have kept so unimportant a communication  in the course of the day trevelyan passed through the hall to the room which he himself was accustomed to occupy behind the parlour and as he did so saw the note lying ready to be posted took it up and read the address he held it for a moment in his hand then replaced it on the hall table and passed on when he reached his own table he sat down hurriedly and took up in his hand some review that was lying ready for him to read but he was quite unable to fix his mind upon the words before him he had spoken to his wife on that morning in the strongest language he could use as to the unseemliness of her intimacy with colonel osborne and then the first thing she had done when his back was turned was to write to this very colonel osborne and tell him no doubt what had occurred between her and her husband he sat thinking of it all for many minutes he would probably have declared himself that he had thought of it for an hour as he sat there then he got up went upstairs and walked slowly into the drawingroom there he found his wife sitting with her sister nora he said i want to speak to emily will you forgive me if i ask you to leave us for a few minutes nora with an anxious look at emily got up and left the room  why do you send her away said mrs trevelyan  because i wish to be alone with you for a few minutes since what i said to you this morning you have written to colonel osborne  yesi have i do not know how you have found it out but i suppose you keep a watch on me  i keep no watch on you as i came into the house i saw your letter lying in the hall  very well you could have read it if you pleased  emily this matter is becoming very serious and i strongly advise you to be on your guard in what you say i will bear much for you and much for our boy but i will not bear to have my name made a reproach  sir if you think your name is shamed by me we had better part said mrs trevelyan rising from her chair and confronting him with a look before which his own almost quailed  it may be that we had better part he said slowly but in the first place i wish you to tell me what were the contents of that letter  if it was there when you came in no doubt it is there still go and look at it  that is no answer to me i have desired you to tell me what are its contents  i shall not tell you i will not demean myself by repeating anything so insignificant in my own justification if you suspect me of writing what i should not write you will suspect me also of lying to conceal it  have you heard from colonel osborne this morning  i have  and where is his letter  i have destroyed it  again he paused trying to think what he had better do trying to be calm and she stood still opposite to him confronting him with the scorn of her bright angry eyes of course he was not calm he was the very reverse of calm and you refuse to tell me what you wrote he said  the letter is there she answered pointing away towards the door if you want to play the spy go and look at it for yourself  do you call me a spy  and what have you called me because you are a husband is the privilege of vituperation to be all on your side  it is impossible that i should put up with this he saidquite impossible this would kill me anything is better than this my present orders to you are not to see colonel osborne not to write to him or have any communication with him and to put under cover to me unopened any letter that may come from him i shall expect your implicit obedience to these orders  wellgo on  have i your promise  nono you have no promise i will make no promise exacted from me in so disgraceful a manner  you refuse to obey me  i will refuse nothing and will promise nothing  then we must partthat is all i will take care that you shall hear from me before tomorrow morning  so saying he left the room and passing through the hall saw that the letter had been taken away     chapter xi  lady milborough as ambassador   of course i know you are right said nora to her sisterright as far as colonel osborne is concerned but nevertheless you ought to give way  and be trampled upon said mrs trevelyan  yes and be trampled upon if he should trample on youwhich however he is the last man in the world to do  and to endure any insult and any names you yourselfyou would be a griselda i suppose  i dont want to talk about myself said nora nor about griselda but i know that however unreasonable it may seem you had better give way to him now and tell him what there was in the note to colonel osborne  never he has ordered me not to see him or to write to him or to open his lettershaving mind you ordered just the reverse a day or two before and i will obey him absurd as it is i will obey him but as for submitting to him and letting him suppose that i think he is rightnever i should be lying to him then and i will never lie to him he has said that we must part and i suppose it will be better so how can a woman live with a man that suspects her he cannot take my baby from me  there were many such conversations as the above between the two sisters before mrs trevelyan received from her husband the communication with which she had been threatened and nora acting on her own judgment in the matter made an attempt to see mr trevelyan writing to him a pretty little note and beseeching him to be kind to her but he declined to see her and the two women sat at home with the baby between them holding such pleasant conversations as that above narrated when such tempests occur in a family a woman will generally suffer the least during the thick of the tempest while the hurricane is at the fiercest she will be sustained by the most thorough conviction that the right is on her side that she is aggrieved that there is nothing for her to acknowledge and no position that she need surrender whereas her husband will desire a compromise even amidst the violence of the storm but afterwards when the wind has lulled but while the heavens around are still all black and murky then the womans sufferings begin when passion gives way to thought and memory she feels the loneliness of her positionthe loneliness and the possible degradation it is all very well for a man to talk about his name and his honour but it is the womans honour and the womans name that are in truth placed in jeopardy let the woman do what she will the man can in truth show his face in the worldand after awhile does show his face but the woman may be compelled to veil hers either by her own fault or by his mrs trevelyan was now told that she was to be separated from her husband and she did not at any rate believe that she had done any harm but if such separation did come where could she live what could she do what position in the world would she possess would not her face be in truth veiled as effectually as though she had disgraced herself and her husband  and then there was that terrible question about the child mrs trevelyan had said a dozen times to her sister that her husband could not take the boy away from her nora however had never assented to this partly from a conviction of her own ignorance not knowing what might be the power of a husband in such a matter and partly thinking that any argument would be good and fair by which she could induce her sister to avoid a catastrophe so terrible as that which was now threatened  i suppose he could take him if he chose she said at last  i dont believe he is wicked like that said mrs trevelyan he would not wish to kill me  but he will say that he loves baby as well as you do  he will never take my child from me he could never be so bad as that  and you will never be so bad as to leave him said nora after a pause i will not believe that it can come to that you know that he is good at heartthat nobody on earth loves you as he does  so they went on for two days and on the evening of the second day there came a letter from trevelyan to his wife they had neither of them seen him although he had been in and out of the house and on the afternoon of the sunday a new grievance a very terrible grievance was added to those which mrs trevelyan was made to bear her husband had told one of the servants in the house that colonel osborne was not to be admitted and the servant to whom he had given this order was thecook there is no reason why a cook should be less trustworthy in such a matter than any other servant and in mr trevelyans household there was a reason why she should be more soas she and she alone was what we generally call an old family domestic she had lived with her masters mother and had known her master when he was a boy looking about him therefore for some one in his house to whom he could speakfeeling that he was bound to convey the order through some mediumhe called to him the ancient cook and imparted to her so much of his trouble as was necessary to make the order intelligible this he did with various illworded assurances to mrs prodgers that there really was nothing amiss but when mrs trevelyan heard what had been donewhich she did from mrs prodgers herself mrs prodgers having been desired by her master to make the communicationshe declared to her sister that everything was now over she could never again live with a husband who had disgraced his wife by desiring her own cook to keep a guard upon her had the footman been instructed not to admit colonel osborne there would have been in such instruction some apparent adherence to the recognised usages of society if you do not desire either your friend or your enemy to be received into your house you communicate your desire to the person who has charge of the door but the cook  and now nora if it were you do you mean to say that you would remain with him asked mrs trevelyan  nora simply replied that anything under any circumstances would be better than a separation  on the morning of the third day there came the following letter      wednesday june 1 12 midnight     dearest emily     you will readily believe me when i say that i never in my    life was so wretched as i have been during the last two    days that you and i should be in the same house together    and not able to speak to each other is in itself a misery    but this is terribly enhanced by the dread lest this state    of things should be made to continue     i want you to understand that i do not in the least    suspect you of having as yet done anything wrongor    having even said anything injurious either to my position    as your husband or to your position as my wife but i    cannot but perceive that you are allowing yourself to be    entrapped into an intimacy with colonel osborne which if    it be not checked will be destructive to my happiness and    your own after what had passed before you cannot have    thought it right to receive letters from him which i was    not to see or to write letters to him of which i was    not to know the contents it must be manifest to you that    such conduct on your part is wrong as judged by any of    the rules by which a wifes conduct can be measured    and yet you have refused even to say that this shall be    discontinued i need hardly explain to you that if you    persist in this refusal you and i cannot continue to live    together as man and wife all my hopes and prospects in    life will be blighted by such a separation i have not as    yet been able to think what i should do in such wretched    circumstances and for you as also for nora such a    catastrophe would be most lamentable do therefore think    of it well and write me such a letter as may bring me    back to your side     there is only one friend in the world to whom i could    endure to talk of this great grief and i have been to    her and told her everything you will know that i mean    lady milborough after much difficult conversation i    have persuaded her to see you and she will call in    curzon street tomorrow about twelve there can be no    kinderhearted or more gentle woman in the world than    lady milborough nor did any one ever have a warmer friend    than both you and i have in her let me implore you then    to listen to her and be guided by her advice     pray believe dearest emily that i am now as ever your    most affectionate husband and that i have no wish so    strong as that we should not be compelled to part     louis trevelyan   this epistle was in many respects a very injudicious composition trevelyan should have trusted either to the eloquence of his own written words or to that of the ambassador whom he was about to despatch but by sending both he weakened both and then there were certain words in the letter which were odious to mrs trevelyan and must have been odious to any young wife he had said that he did not as yet suspect her of having done anything wrong and then when he endeavoured to explain to her that a separation would be very injurious to herself he had coupled her sister with her thus seeming to imply that the injury to be avoided was of a material kind she had better do what he told her as otherwise she and her sister would not have a roof over their head that was the nature of the threat which his words were supposed to convey  the matter had become so serious that mrs trevelyan haughty and stiffnecked as she was did not dare to abstain from showing the letter to her sister she had no other counsellor at any rate till lady milborough came and the weight of the battle was too great for her own unaided spirit the letter had been written late at night as was shown by the precision of the date and had been brought to her early in the morning at first she had determined to say nothing about it to nora but she was not strong enough to maintain such a purpose she felt that she needed the poor consolation of discussing her wretchedness she first declared that she would not see lady milborough i hate her and she knows that i hate her and she ought not to have thought of coming said mrs trevelyan  but she was at last beaten out of this purpose by noras argument that all the world would be against her if she refused to see her husbands old friend and then though the letter was an odious letter as she declared a dozen times she took some little comfort in the fact that not a word was said in it about the baby she thought that if she could take her child with her into any separation she could endure it and her husband would ultimately be conquered  yes ill see her she said as they finished the discussion as he chooses to send her i suppose i had better see her but i dont think he does much to mend matters when he sends the woman whom he knows i dislike more than any other in all london  exactly at twelve oclock lady milboroughs carriage was at the door trevelyan was in the house at the time and heard the knock at the door during those two or three days of absolute wretchedness he spent most of his hours under the same roof with his wife and sisterinlaw though he spoke to neither of them he had had his doubts as to the reception of lady milborough and was to tell the truth listening with most anxious ear when her ladyship was announced his wife however was not so bitterly contumacious as to refuse admittance to his friend and he heard the rustle of the ponderous silk as the old woman was shown upstairs when lady milborough reached the drawingroom mrs trevelyan was alone  i had better see her by myself she had said to her sister  nora had then left her with one word of prayer that she would be as little defiant as possible  that must depend emily had said with a little shake of her head  there had been a suggestion that the child should be with her but the mother herself had rejected this  it would be stagey she had said and claptrap there is nothing i hate so much as that  she was sitting therefore quite alone and as stiff as a man in armour when lady milborough was shown up to her  and lady milborough herself was not at all comfortable as she commenced the interview she had prepared many wise words to be spoken but was not so little ignorant of the character of the woman with whom she had to deal as to suppose that the wise words would get themselves spoken without interruption she had known from the first that mrs trevelyan would have much to say for herself and the feeling that it would be so became stronger than ever as she entered the room the ordinary feelings between the two ladies were cold and constrained and then there was silence for a few moments when the countess had taken her seat mrs trevelyan had quite determined that the enemy should fire the first shot  this is a very sad state of things said the countess  yes indeed lady milborough  the saddest in the worldand so unnecessaryis it not  very unnecessary indeed as i think  yes my dear yes but of course we must remember  then lady milborough could not clearly bring to her mind what it was that she had to remember  the fact is my dear that all this kind of thing is too monstrous to be thought of goodness gracious me two young people like you and louis who thoroughly love each other and who have got a baby to think of being separated of course it is out of the question  you cannot suppose lady milborough that i want to be separated from my husband  of course not how should it be possible the very idea is too shocking to be thought of i declare i havent slept since louis was talking to me about it but my dear you must remember you know that a husband has a right to expect somesomesomea sort ofsubmission from his wife  he has a right to expect obedience lady milborough  of course that is all one wants  and i will obey mr trevelyanin anything reasonable  but my dear who is to say what is reasonable that you see is always the difficulty you must allow that your husband is the person who ought to decide that  has he told you that i have refused to obey him lady milborough  the countess paused a moment before she replied well yes i think he has she said he asked you to do something about a lettera letter to that colonel osborne who is a man my dear really to be very much afraid of a man who has done a great deal of harmand you declined now in a matter of that kind of course the husband  lady milborough i must ask you to listen to me you have listened to mr trevelyan and i must ask you to listen to me i am sorry to trouble you but as you have come here about this unpleasant business you must forgive me if i insist upon it  of course i will listen to you my dear  i have never refused to obey my husband and i do not refuse now the gentleman of whom you have been speaking is an old friend of my fathers and has become my friend nevertheless had mr trevelyan given me any plain order about him i should have obeyed him a wife does not feel that her chances of happiness are increased when she finds that her husband suspects her of being too intimate with another man it is a thing very hard to bear but i would have endeavoured to bear it knowing how important it is for both our sakes and more especially for our child i would have made excuses and would have endeavoured to think that this horrid feeling on his part is nothing more than a short delusion  but my dear  i must ask you to hear me out lady milborough but when he tells me first that i am not to meet the man and so instructs the servants then tells me that i am to meet him and go on just as i was going before and then again tells me that i am not to see him and again instructs the servantsand above all the cookthat colonel osborne is not to come into the house then obedience becomes rather difficult  just say now that you will do what he wants and then all will be right  i will not say so to you lady milborough it is not to you that i ought to say it but as he has chosen to send you here i will explain to you that i have never disobeyed him when i was free in accordance with mr trevelyans wishes to have what intercourse i pleased with colonel osborne i received a note from that gentleman on a most trivial matter i answered it as trivially my husband saw my letter closed and questioned me about it i told him that the letter was still there and that if he chose to be a spy upon my actions he could open it and read it  my dear how could you bring yourself to use the word spy to your husband  how could he bring himself to accuse me as he did if he cares for me let him come and beg my pardon for the insult he has offered me  oh mrs trevelyan  yes that seems very wrong to you who have not had to bear it it is very easy for a stranger to take a husbands part and help to put down a poor woman who has been illused i have done nothing wrong nothing to be ashamed of and i will not say that i have i never have spoken a word to colonel osborne that all the world might not hear  nobody has accused you my dear  yes he has accused me and you have accused me and you will make all the world accuse me he may put me out of his house if he likes but he shall not make me say i have been wrong when i know i have been right he cannot take my child from me  but he will  no shouted mrs trevelyan jumping up from her chair no he shall never do that i will cling to him so that he cannot separate us he will never be so wickedsuch a monster as that i would go about the world saying what a monster he had been to me the passion of the interview was becoming too great for lady milboroughs power of moderating it and she was beginning to feel herself to be in a difficulty lady milborough continued mrs trevelyan tell him from me that i will bear anything but that that i will not bear  dear mrs trevelyan do not let us talk about it  who wants to talk about it why do you come here and threaten me with a thing so horrible i do not believe you he would not dare to separate me and mychild  but you have only to say that you will submit yourself to him  i have submitted myself to him and i will submit no further what does he want why does he send you here he does not know what he wants he has made himself miserable by an absurd idea and he wants everybody to tell him that he has been right he has been very wrong and if he desires to be wise now he will come back to his home and say nothing further about it he will gain nothing by sending messengers here  lady milborough who had undertaken a most disagreeable task from the purest motives of old friendship did not like being called a messenger but the woman before her was so strong in her words so eager and so passionate that she did not know how to resent the injury and there was coming over her an idea of which she herself was hardly conscious that after all perhaps the husband was not in the right she had come there with the general idea that wives and especially young wives should be submissive she had naturally taken the husbands part and having a preconceived dislike to colonel osborne she had been willing enough to think that precautionary measures were necessary in reference to so eminent and notorious and experienced a lothario she had never altogether loved mrs trevelyan and had always been a little in dread of her but she had thought that the authority with which she would be invested on this occasion the manifest right on her side and the undeniable truth of her grand argument that a wife should obey would carry her if not easily still successfully through all difficulties it was probably the case that lady milborough when preparing for her visit had anticipated a triumph but when she had been closeted for an hour with mrs trevelyan she found that she was not triumphant she was told that she was a messenger and an unwelcome messenger and she began to feel that she did not know how she was to take herself away  i am sure i have done everything for the best she said getting up from her chair  the best will be to send him back and make him feel the truth  the best for you my dear will be to consider well what should be the duty of a wife  i have considered lady milborough it cannot be a wifes duty to acknowledge that she has been wrong in such a matter as this  then lady milborough made her curtsey and got herself away in some manner that was sufficiently awkward and mrs trevelyan curtseyed also as she rang the bell and though she was sore and wretched and in truth sadly frightened she was not awkward in that encounter so far as it had gone she had been the victor  as soon as she was alone and the carriage had been driven well away from the door mrs trevelyan left the drawingroom and went up to the nursery as she entered she clothed her face with her sweetest smile how is his own mothers dearest dearest darling duck she said putting out her arms and taking the boy from the nurse the child was at this time about ten months old and was a strong hearty happy infant always laughing when he was awake and always sleeping when he did not laugh because his little limbs were free from pain and his little stomach was not annoyed by internal troubles he kicked and crowed and sputtered when his mother took him and put up his little fingers to clutch her hair and was to her as a young god upon the earth nothing in the world had ever been created so beautiful so joyous so satisfactory so divine and they told her that this apple of her eye was to be taken away from her nothat must be impossible i will take him into my own room nurse for a little whileyou have had him all the morning she said as though the having baby was a privilege over which there might almost be a quarrel then she took her boy away with her and when she was alone with him went through such a service in babyworship as most mothers will understand divide these two no nobody should do that sooner than that she the mother would consent to be no more than a servant in her husbands house was not her baby all the world to her  on the evening of that day the husband and wife had an interview together in the library which unfortunately was as unsatisfactory as lady milboroughs visit the cause of the failure of them all lay probably in thisthat there was no decided point which if conceded would have brought about a reconciliation trevelyan asked for general submission which he regarded as his right and which in the existing circumstances he thought it necessary to claim and though mrs trevelyan did not refuse to be submissive she would make no promise on the subject but the truth was that each desired that the other should acknowledge a fault and that neither of them would make that acknowledgment emily trevelyan felt acutely that she had been illused not only by her husbands suspicion but by the manner in which he had talked of his suspicion to othersto lady milborough and the cook and she was quite convinced that she was right herself because he had been so vacillating in his conduct about colonel osborne but trevelyan was equally sure that justice was on his side emily must have known his real wishes about colonel osborne but when she had found that he had rescinded his verbal orders about the admission of the man to the housewhich he had done to save himself and her from slander and gossipshe had taken advantage of this and had thrown herself more entirely than ever into the intimacy of which he disapproved when they met each was so sore that no approach to terms was made by them  if i am to be treated in that way i would rather not live with you said the wife it is impossible to live with a husband who is jealous  all i ask of you is that you shall promise me to have no further communication with this man  i will make no promise that implies my own disgrace  then we must part and if that be so this house will be given up you may live where you pleasein the country not in london but i shall take steps that colonel osborne does not see you  i will not remain in the room with you to be insulted thus said mrs trevelyan and she did not remain but left the chamber slamming the door after her as she went  it will be better that she should go said trevelyan when he found himself alone and so it came to pass that that blessing of a rich marriage which had as it were fallen upon them at the mandarins from out of heaven had become after an interval of but two short years anything but an unmixed blessing     chapter xii  miss stanburys generosity   on one wednesday morning early in june great preparations were being made at the brick house in the close at exeter for an event which can hardly be said to have required any preparation at all mrs stanbury and her elder daughter were coming into exeter from nuncombe putney to visit dorothy the reader may perhaps remember that when miss stanburys invitation was sent to her niece she was pleased to promise that such visits should be permitted on a wednesday morning such a visit was now to be made and old miss stanbury was quite moved by the occasion i shall not see them you know martha she had said on the afternoon of the preceding day  i suppose not maam  certainly not why should i it would do no good  it is not for me to say maam of course  no martha it is not and i am sure that i am right its no good going back and undoing in ten minutes what twenty years have done shes a poor harmless creature i believe  the most harmless in the world maam  but she was as bad as poison to me when she was young and whats the good of trying to change it now if i was to tell her that i loved her i should only be lying  then maam i would not say it  and i dont mean but youll take in some wine and cake you know  i dont think theyll care for wine and cake  will you do as i tell you what matters whether they care for it or not they need not take it it will look better for miss dorothy if dorothy is to remain here i shall choose that she should be respected and so the question of the cake and wine had been decided overnight but when the morning came miss stanbury was still in a twitter halfpast ten had been the hour fixed for the visit in consequence of there being a train in from lessboro due at the exeter station at ten as miss stanbury breakfasted always at halfpast eight there was no need of hurry on account of the expected visit but nevertheless she was in a fuss all the morning and spoke of the coming period as one in which she must necessarily put herself into solitary confinement  perhaps your mamma will be cold she said and will expect a fire  oh dear no aunt stanbury  it could be lighted of course it is a pity they should come just so as to prevent you from going to morning service is it not  i could go with you aunt and be back very nearly in time they wont mind waiting a quarter of an hour  what and have them here all alone i wouldnt think of such a thing i shall go upstairs you had better come to me when they are gone dont hurry them i dont want you to hurry them at all and if you require anything martha will wait upon you i have told the girls to keep out of the way they are so giddy theres no knowing what they might be after besidestheyve got their work to mind  all this was very terrible to poor dorothy who had not as yet quite recovered from the original fear with which her aunt had inspired herso terrible that she was almost sorry that her mother and sister were coming to her when the knock was heard at the door precisely as the cathedral clock was striking halfpast tento secure which punctuality and thereby not to offend the owner of the mansion mrs stanbury and priscilla had been walking about the close for the last ten minutesmiss stanbury was still in the parlour  there they are she exclaimed jumping up they havent given a body much time to run away have they my dear half a minute marthajust half a minute then she gathered up her things as though she had been illtreated in being driven to make so sudden a retreat and martha as soon as the last hem of her mistresss dress had become invisible on the stairs opened the front door for the visitors  do you mean to say you like it said priscilla when they had been there about a quarter of an hour  hush whispered mrs stanbury  i dont suppose shes listening at the door said priscilla  indeed shes not said dorothy there cant be a truer honester woman than aunt stanbury  but is she kind to you dolly asked the mother  very kind too kind only i dont understand her quite and then she gets angry with me i know she thinks im a fool and thats the worst of it  then if i were you i would come home said priscilla  shell never forgive you if you do said mrs stanbury  and who need care about her forgiveness said priscilla  i dont mean to go home yet at any rate said dorothy then there was a knock at the door and martha entered with the cake and wine miss stanburys compliments ladies and she hopes youll take a glass of sherry whereupon she filled out the glasses and carried them round  pray give my compliments and thanks to my sister stanbury said dorothys mother but priscilla put down the glass of wine without touching it and looked her sternest at the maid  altogether the visit was not very successful and poor dorothy almost felt that if she chose to remain in the close she must lose her mother and sister and that without really making a friend of her aunt there had as yet been no quarrelnothing that had been plainly recognised as disagreeable but there had not as yet come to be any sympathy or assured signs of comfortable love miss stanbury had declared more than once that it would do but had not succeeded in showing in what the success consisted when she was told that the two ladies were gone she desired that dorothy might be sent to her and immediately began to make anxious inquiries  well my dear and what do they think of it  i dont know aunt that they think very much  and what do they say about it  they didnt say very much aunt i was very glad to see mamma and priscilla perhaps i ought to tell you that mamma gave me back the money i sent her  what did she do that for asked miss stanbury very sharply  because she says that hugh sends her now what she wants miss stanbury when she heard this looked very sour i thought it best to tell you you know  it will never come to any good got in that waynever  but aunt stanbury isnt it good of him to send it  i dont know i suppose its better than drinking and smoking and gambling but i dare say he gets enough for that too when a man born and bred like a gentleman condescends to let out his talents and education for such purposes i dare say they are willing enough to pay him the devil always does pay high wages but that only makes it so much the worse one almost comes to doubt whether any one ought to learn to write at all when it is used for such vile purposes ive said what ive got to say and i dont mean to say anything more whats the use but it has been hard upon mevery it was my money did it and i feel ive misused it its a disgrace to me which i dont deserve  for a couple of minutes dorothy remained quite silent and miss stanbury did not herself say anything further nor during that time did she observe her niece or she would probably have seen that the subject was not to be dropped dorothy though she was silent was not calm and was preparing herself for a crusade in her brothers defence  aunt stanbury hes my brother you know  of course hes your brother i wish he were not  i think him the best brother in the worldand the best son  why does he sell himself to write sedition  he doesnt sell himself to write sedition i dont see why it should be sedition or anything wicked because its sold for a penny  if you are going to cram him down my throat dorothy you and i had better part  i dont want to say anything about him only you oughtnotto abuse himbefore me by this time dorothy was beginning to sob but miss stanburys countenance was still very grim and very stern hes coming home to nuncombe putney and i want toseesee him continued dorothy  hugh stanbury coming to exeter he wont come here  then id rather go home aunt stanbury  very well very well said miss stanbury and she got up and left the room  dorothy was in dismay and began to think that there was nothing for her to do but to pack up her clothes and prepare for her departure she was very sorry for what had occurred being fully alive to the importance of the aid not only to herself but to her mother and sister which was afforded by the present arrangement and she felt very angry with herself in that she had already driven her aunt to quarrel with her but she had found it to be impossible to hear her own brother abused without saying a word on his behalf she did not see her aunt again till dinnertime and then there was hardly a word uttered once or twice dorothy made a little effort to speak but these attempts failed utterly the old woman would hardly reply even by a monosyllable but simply muttered something or shook her head when she was addressed jane who waited at table was very demure and silent and martha who once came into the room during the meal merely whispered a word into miss stanburys ear when the cloth was removed and two glasses of port had been poured out by miss stanbury herself dorothy felt that she could endure this treatment no longer how was it possible that she could drink wine under such circumstances      illustration aunt stanbury at dinner will not speak   not for me aunt stanbury said she with a deploring tone  why not  i couldnt drink it today  why didnt you say so before it was poured out and why not today come drink it do as i bid you and she stood over her niece as a tragedy queen in a play with a bowl of poison dorothy took it and sipped it from mere force of obedience you make as many bones about a glass of port wine as though it were senna and salts said miss stanbury now ive got something to say to you by this time the servant was gone and the two were seated alone together in the parlour dorothy who had not as yet swallowed above half her wine at once put the glass down there was an importance in her aunts tone which frightened her and made her feel that some evil was coming and yet as she had made up her mind that she must return home there was no further evil that she need dread you didnt write any of those horrid articles said miss stanbury  no aunt i didnt write them i shouldnt know how  and i hope youll never learn they say women are to vote and become doctors and if so theres no knowing what devils tricks they maynt do but it isnt your fault about that filthy newspaper how he can let himself down to write stuff that is to be printed on straw is what i cant understand  i dont see how it can make a difference as he writes it  it would make a great deal of difference to me and im told that what they call ink comes off on your fingers like lampblack i never touched one thank god but they tell me so all the same it isnt your fault  ive nothing to do with it aunt stanbury  of course youve not and as he is your brother it wouldnt be natural that you should like to throw him off and my dear i like you for taking his part only you neednt have been so fierce with an old woman  indeedindeed i didnt mean to befierce aunt stanbury  i never was taken up so short in my life but we wont mind that there he shall come and see you i suppose he wont insist on leaving any of his nastiness about  but is he to come here aunt stanbury  he may if he pleases  oh aunt stanbury  when he was here last he generally had a pipe in his mouth and i dare say he never puts it down at all now those things grow upon young people so fast but if he could leave it on the doorstep just while hes here i should be obliged to him  but dear aunt couldnt i see him in the street  out in the street no my dear all the world is not to know that hes your brother and he is dressed in such a rapscallion manner that the people would think you were talking to a housebreaker dorothys face became again red as she heard this and the angry words were very nearly spoken the last time i saw him continued miss stanbury he had on a short rough jacket with enormous buttons and one of those flippertyflopperty things on his head that the butcherboys wear and oh the smell of tobacco as he had been up in london i suppose he thought exeter was no better than a village and he might do just as he pleased but he knew that if im particular about anything it is about a gentlemans hat in the streets and he wanted memeto walk with him across to mrs machughs we should have been hooted about the close like a pair of mad dogsand so i told him  all the young men seem to dress like that now aunt stanbury  no they dont mr gibson doesnt dress like that  but hes a clergyman aunt stanbury  perhaps im an old fool i dare say i am and of course thats what you mean at any rate im too old to change and i dont mean to try i like to see a difference between a gentleman and a housebreaker for the matter of that im told that there is a difference and that the housebreakers all look like gentlemen now it may be proper to make us all stand on our heads with our legs sticking up in the air but i for one dont like being topsyturvey and i wont try it when is he to reach exeter  he is coming on tuesday next by the last train  then you cant see him that night thats out of the question no doubt hell sleep at the nags head as thats the lowest radical publichouse in the city martha shall try to find him she knows more about his doings than i do if he chooses to come here the following morning before he goes down to nuncombe putney well and good i shall wait up till martha comes back from the train on tuesday night and hear dorothy was of course full of gratitude and thanks but yet she felt almost disappointed by the result of her aunts clemency on the matter she had desired to take her brothers part and it had seemed to her as though she had done so in a very lukewarm manner she had listened to an immense number of accusations against him and had been unable to reply to them because she had been conquered by the promise of a visit and now it was out of the question that she should speak of going her aunt had given way to her and of course had conquered her  late on the tuesday evening after ten oclock hugh stanbury was walking round the close with his aunts old servant he had not put up at that dreadfully radical establishment of which miss stanbury was so much afraid but had taken a bedroom at the railway inn from there he had walked up to the close with martha and now was having a few last words with her before he would allow her to return to the house  i suppose shed as soon see the devil as see me said hugh  if you speak in that way mr hugh i wont listen to you  and yet i did everything i could to please her and i dont think any boy ever loved an old woman better than i did her  that was while she used to send you cakes and ham and jam to school mr hugh  of course it was and while she sent me flannel waistcoats to oxford but when i didnt care any longer for cakes or flannel then she got tired of me it is much better as it is if shell only be good to dorothy  she never was bad to anybody mr hugh but i dont think an old lady like her ever takes to a young woman as she does to a young man if only hell let her have a little more of her own way than you would its my belief that you might have had it all for your own some day if youd done as you ought  thats nonsense martha she means to leave it all to the burgesses ive heard her say so  say so yes people dont always do what they say if youd managed rightly you might have it alland so you might now  ill tell you what old girl i shant try live for the next twenty years under her apron strings that i may have the chance at the end of it of cutting some poor devil out of his money do you know the meaning of making a score off your own bat martha  no i dont and if its anything youre like to do i dont think i should be the better for learningby all accounts and now if you please ill go in  good night martha my love to them both and say ill be there tomorrow exactly at halfpast nine youd better take it it wont turn to slatestone it hasnt come from the old gentleman  i dont want anything of that kind mr hughindeed i dont  nonsense if you dont take it youll offend me i believe you think im not much better than a schoolboy still  i dont think youre half so good mr hugh said the old servant sticking the sovereign which hugh had given her in under her glove as she spoke  on the next morning that other visit was made at the brick house and miss stanbury was again in a fuss on this occasion however she was in a much better humour than before and was full of little jokes as to the nature of the visitation of course she was not to see her nephew herself and no message was to be delivered from her and none was to be given to her from him but an accurate report was to be made to her as to his appearance and dorothy was to be enabled to answer a variety of questions respecting him after he was gone of course i dont want to know anything about his money miss stanbury said only i should like to know how much these people can afford to pay for their penny trash on this occasion she had left the room and gone upstairs before the knock came at the door but she managed by peeping over the balcony to catch a glimpse of the flippertyflopperty hat which her nephew certainly had with him on this occasion  hugh stanbury had great news for his sister the cottage in which mrs stanbury lived at nuncombe putney was the tiniest little dwelling in which a lady and her two daughters ever sheltered themselves there was indeed a sittingroom two bedrooms and a kitchen but they were all so diminutive in size that the cottage was little more than a cabin but there was a house in the village not large indeed but eminently respectable three stories high covered with ivy having a garden behind it and generally called the clock house because there had once been a clock upon it this house had been lately vacated and hugh informed his sister that he was thinking of taking it for his mothers accommodation now the late occupants of the clock house at nuncombe putney had been people with five or six hundred a year had other matters been in accordance the house would almost have entitled them to consider themselves as county people a gardener had always been kept thereand a cow  the clock house for mamma  well yes dont say a word about it as yet to aunt stanbury as shell think that ive sold myself altogether to the old gentleman  but hugh how can mamma live there  the fact is dorothy there is a secret i cant tell you quite yet of course youll know it and everybody will know it if the thing comes about but as you wont talk i will tell you what most concerns ourselves  and am i to go back  certainly notif you will take my advice stick to your aunt you dont want to smoke pipes and wear tomandjerry hats and write for the penny newspapers  now hugh stanburys secret was thisthat louis trevelyans wife and sisterinlaw were to leave the house in curzon street and come and live at nuncombe putney with mrs stanbury and priscilla such at least was the plan to be carried out if hugh stanbury should be successful in his present negotiations     chapter xiii  the honourable mr glascock      illustration  by the end of july mrs trevelyan with her sister was established in the clock house at nuncombe putney under the protection of hughs mother but before the reader is made acquainted with any of the circumstances of their life there a few words must be said of an occurrence which took place before those two ladies left curzon street  as to the quarrel between trevelyan and his wife things went from bad to worse lady milborough continued to interfere writing letters to emily which were full of good sense but which as emily said herself never really touched the point of dispute am i who am altogether unconscious of having done anything amiss to confess that i have been in the wrong if it were about a small matter i would not mind for the sake of peace but when it concerns my conduct in reference to another man i would rather die first that had been mrs trevelyans line of thought and argument in the matter but then old lady milborough in her letters spoke only of the duty of obedience as promised at the altar but i didnt promise to tell a lie said mrs trevelyan and there were interviews between lady milborough and trevelyan and interviews between lady milborough and nora rowley the poor dear old dowager was exceedingly busy and full of groans prescribing naples prescribing a course of extra prayers prescribing a general course of letting bygones be bygonesto which however trevelyan would by no means assent without some assurance which he might regard as a guaranteeprescribing retirement to a small town in the west of france if naples would not suffice but she could effect nothing  mrs trevelyan indeed did a thing which was sure of itself to render any steps taken for a reconciliation ineffectual in the midst of all this turmoilwhile she and her husband were still living in the same house but apart because of their absurd quarrel respecting colonel osborne she wrote another letter to that gentleman the argument by which she justified this to herself and to her sister after it was done was the real propriety of her own conduct throughout her whole intimacy with colonel osborne but that is just what louis doesnt want you to do nora had said filled with anger and dismay then let louis give me an order to that effect and behave to me like a husband and i will obey him emily had answered and she had gone on to plead that in her present condition she was under no orders from her husband she was left to judge for herself andjudging for herselfshe knew as she said that it was best that she should write to colonel osborne unfortunately there was no ground for hoping that colonel osborne was ignorant of this insane jealousy on the part of her husband it was better therefore she said that she should write to himwhom on the occasion she took care to name to her sister as papas old friendand explain to him what she would wish him to do and what not to do colonel osborne answered the letter very quickly throwing much more of demonstrative affection than he should have done into his dear emily and his dearest friend of course mrs trevelyan had burned this answer and of course mr trevelyan had been told of the correspondence his wife indeed had been especially careful that there should be nothing secret about the matterthat it should be so known in the house that mr trevelyan should be sure to hear of it and he had heard of it and been driven almost mad by it he had flown off to lady milborough and had reduced his old friend to despair by declaring that after all he began to fear that his wife waswaswasinfatuated by that d scoundrel lady milborough forgave the language but protested that he was wrong in his suspicion to continue to correspond with him after what i have said to her exclaimed trevelyan take her to naples at oncesaid lady milboroughat once and have him after me said trevelyan lady milborough had no answer ready and not having thought of this looked very blank i should find it harder to deal with her there even than here continued trevelyan then it was that lady milborough spoke of the small town in the west of france urging as her reason that such a man as colonel osborne would certainly not follow them there but trevelyan had become indignant at this declaring that if his wifes good name could be preserved in no other manner than that it would not be worth preserving at all then lady milborough had begun to cry and had continued crying for a very long time she was very unhappyas unhappy as her nature would allow her to be she would have made almost any sacrifice to bring the two young people togetherwould have willingly given her time her money her labour in the causewould probably herself have gone to the little town in the west of france had her going been of any service but nevertheless after her own fashion she extracted no small enjoyment out of the circumstances of this miserable quarrel the lady milboroughs of the day hate the colonel osbornes from the very bottoms of their warm hearts and pure souls but they respect the colonel osbornes almost as much as they hate them and find it to be an inestimable privilege to be brought into some contact with these roaring lions  but there arose to dear lady milborough a great trouble out of this quarrel irrespective of the absolute horror of the separation of a young husband from his young wife and the excess of her trouble on this head was great proof of the real goodness of her heart for in this matter the welfare of trevelyan himself was not concernedbut rather that of the rowley family now the rowleys had not given lady milborough any special reason for loving them when she had first heard that her dear young friend louis was going to marry a girl from the mandarins she had been almost in despair it was her opinion that had he properly understood his own position he would have promoted his welfare by falling in love with the daughter of some english country gentlemanor some english peer to which honour with his advantages lady milborough thought that he might have aspired nevertheless when the girl from the mandarins had been brought home as mrs trevelyan lady milborough had received her with open armshad received even the sisterinlaw with arms partly open had either of them shown any tendency to regard her as a mother she would have showered motherly cares upon them for lady milborough was like an old hen in her capacity for taking many under her wings the two sisters had hardly done more than bear with hernora indeed bearing with her more graciously than mrs trevelyan and in return even for this the old dowager was full of motherly regard now she knew well that mr glascock was over head and ears in love with nora rowley it only wanted the slightest management and the easiest discretion to bring him on his knees with an offer of his hand and then how much that hand containedhow much indeed as compared with that other hand which was to be given in return and which wasto speak the truthcompletely empty mr glascock was the heir to a peer was the heir to a rich peer was the heir to a very very old peer he was in parliament the world spoke well of him he was not so to say by any means an old man himself he was goodtempered reasonable easily led and yet by no means despicable on all subjects connected with land he held an opinion that was very much respected and was supposed to be a thoroughly good specimen of an upperclass englishman here was a suitor but it was not to be supposed that such a man as mr glascock would be so violently in love as to propose to a girl whose nearest known friend and female relation was misbehaving herself  only they who have closely watched the natural uneasiness of human hens can understand how great was lady milboroughs anxiety on this occasion marriage to her was a thing always delightful to contemplate though she had never been sordidly a matchmaker the course of the world around her had taught her to regard men as fish to be caught and girls as the anglers who ought to catch them or rather could her mind have been accurately analysed it would have been found that the girl was regarded as halfangler and halfbait any girl that angled visibly with her own hook with a manifestly expressed desire to catch a fish was odious to her and she was very gentlehearted in regard to the fishes thinking that every fish in the river should have the hook and bait presented to him in the mildest pleasantest form but still when the trout was well in the basket her joy was great and then came across her unlaborious mind some halfformed idea that a great ordinance of nature was being accomplished in the teeth of difficulties foras she well knewthere is a difficulty in the catching of fish  lady milborough in her kind anxiety on noras behalfthat the fish should be landed before nora might be swept away in her sisters ruinhardly knew what step she might safely take mrs trevelyan would not see her againhaving already declared that any further interview would be painful and useless she had spoken to trevelyan but trevelyan had declared that he could do nothing what was there that he could have done he could not as he said overlook the gross improprieties of his wifes conduct because his wifes sister had or might possibly have a lover and then as to speaking to mr glascock himselfnobody knew better than lady milborough how very apt fish are to be frightened  but at last lady milborough did speak to mr glascockmaking no allusion whatever to the hook prepared for himself but saying a word or two as to the affairs of that other fish whose circumstances as he floundered about in the bucket of matrimony were not as happy as they might have been the care the discretion nay the wisdom with which she did this were most excellent she had become aware that mr glascock had already heard of the unfortunate affair in curzon street indeed every one who knew the trevelyans had heard of it and a great many who did not know them no harm therefore could be done by mentioning the circumstance lady milborough did mention it explaining that the only person really in fault was that odious destroyer of the peace of families colonel osborne of whom lady milborough on that occasion said some very severe things indeed poor dear mrs trevelyan was foolish obstinate and selfreliantbut as innocent as the babe unborn that things would come right before long no one who knew the affairand she knew it from beginning to endcould for a moment doubt the real victim would be that sweetest of all girls nora rowley mr glascock innocently asked why nora rowley should be a victim dont you understand mr glascock how the most remote connection with a thing of that kind tarnishes a young womans standing in the world mr glascock was almost angry with the wellpleased countess as he declared that he could not see that miss rowleys standing was at all tarnished and old lady milborough when he got up and left her felt that she had done a good mornings work if nora could have known it all nora ought to have been very grateful for mr glascock got into a cab in eccleston square and had himself driven direct to curzon street he himself believed that he was at that moment only doing the thing which he had for some time past resolved that he would do but we perhaps may be justified in thinking that the actual resolution was first fixed by the discretion of lady milboroughs communication at any rate he arrived in curzon street with his mind fully resolved and had spent the minutes in the cab considering how he had better perform the business in hand  he was at once shown into the drawingroom where he found the two sisters and mrs trevelyan as soon as she saw him understood the purpose of his coming there was an air of determination about him a manifest intention of doing something an absence of that vagueness which almost always flavours a morning visit this was so strongly marked that mrs trevelyan felt that she would have been almost justified in getting up and declaring that as this visit was paid to her sister she would retire but any such declaration on her part was unnecessary as mr glascock had not been in the room three minutes before he asked her to go by some clever device of his own he got her into the back room and whispered to her that he wanted to say a few words in private to her sister  oh certainly said mrs trevelyan smiling  i dare say you may guess what they are said he i dont know what chance i may have  i can tell you nothing about that she replied as i know nothing but you have my good wishes  and then she went  it may be presumed that gradually some idea of mr glascocks intention had made its way into noras mind by the time that she found herself alone with that gentleman why else had he brought into the room with him that manifest air of a purpose why else had he taken the very strong step of sending the lady of the house out of her own drawingroom nora beginning to understand this put herself into an attitude of defence she had never told herself that she would refuse mr glascock she had never acknowledged to herself that there was another man whom she liked better than she liked mr glascock but had she ever encouraged any wish for such an interview her feelings at this moment would have been very different from what they were as it was she would have given much to postpone it so that she might have asked herself questions and have discovered whether she could reconcile herself to do that which no doubt all her friends would commend her for doing of course it was clear enough to the mind of the girl that she had her fortune to make and that her beauty and youth were the capital on which she had to found it she had not lived so far from all taint of corruption as to feel any actual horror at the idea of a girl giving herself to a mannot because the man had already by his own capacities in that direction forced her heart from herbut because he was one likely to be at all points a good husband had all this affair concerned any other girl any friend of her own and had she known all the circumstances of the case she would have had no hesitation in recommending that other girl to marry mr glascock a girl thrown out upon the world without a shilling must make her hay while the sun shines but nevertheless there was something within her bosom which made her long for a better thing than this she had dreamed if she had not thought of being able to worship a man but she could hardly worship mr glascock she had dreamed if she had not thought of leaning upon a man all through life with her whole weight as though that man had been specially made to be her staff her prop her support her wall of comfort and protection she knew that if she were to marry mr glascock and become lady peterborough in due course she must stand a good deal by her own strength and live without that comfortable leaning nevertheless when she found herself alone with the man she by no means knew whether she would refuse him or not but she knew that she must pluck up courage for an important moment and she collected herself braced her muscles as it were for a fight and threw her mind into an attitude of contest  mr glascock as soon as the door was shut behind mrs trevelyans back took a chair and placed it close beside the head of the sofa on which nora was sitting miss rowley he said you and i have known each other now for some months and i hope you have learned to regard me as a friend  oh yes indeed said nora with some spirit  it has seemed to me that we have met as friends and i can most truly say for myself that i have taken the greatest possible pleasure in your acquaintance it is not only that i admire you very muchhe looked straight before him as he said this and moved about the point of the stick which he was holding in both his handsit is not only thatperhaps not chiefly that though i do admire you very much but the truth is that i like everything about you  nora smiled but she said nothing it was better she thought to let him tell his story but his mode of telling it was not without its efficacy it was not the simple praise which made its way with her but a certain tone in the words which seemed to convince her that they were true if he had really found her or fancied her to be what he said there was a manliness in his telling her so in the plainest words that pleased her much  i know continued he that this is a very bald way of tellingof pleadingmy cause but i dont know whether a bald way may not be the best if it can only make itself understood to be true of course miss rowley you know what i mean as i said before you have all those things which not only make me love you but which make me like you also if you think that you can love me say so and as long as i live i will do my best to make you happy as my wife  there was a clearness of expression in this and a downright surrender of himself which so flattered her and so fluttered her that she was almost reduced to the giving of herself up because she could not reply to such an appeal in language less courteous than that of agreement after a moment or two she found herself remaining silent with a growing feeling that silence would be taken as conveying consent there floated quickly across her brain an idea of the hardness of a womans lot in that she should be called upon to decide her future fate for life in half a minute he had had weeks to think of thisweeks in which it would have been almost unmaidenly in her so to think of it as to have made up her mind to accept the man had she so made up her mind and had he not come to her where would she have been then but he had come to her there he was still poking about with his stick waiting for her and she must answer him and he was the eldest son of a peeran enormous match for her very proper in all respects such a man that if she should accept him everybody around her would regard her fortune in life as miraculously successful he was not such a man that any one would point at her and saythere see another of them who has sold herself for money and a title mr glascock was not an apollo not an admirable crichton but he was a man whom any girl might have learned to love now he had asked her to be his wife and it was necessary that she should answer him he sat there waiting for her very patiently still poking about the point of his stick  did she really love him though she was so pressed by consideration of time she did find a moment in which to ask herself the question with a quick turn of an eye she glanced at him to see what he was like up to this moment though she knew him well she could have given no details of his personal appearance he was a betterlooking man than hugh stanburyso she told herself with a passing thought but he lackedhe lacked what was it that he lacked was it youth or spirit or strength or was it some outward sign of an inward gift of mind was it that he was heavy while hugh was light was it that she could find no fire in his eye while hughs eyes were full of flashing or was it that for her especially for her hugh was the appointed staff and appropriate wall of protection be all that as it might she knew at the moment that she did love not this man but that other who was writing articles for the daily record she must refuse the offer that was so brilliant and give up the idea of reigning as queen at monkhams  oh mr glascock she said i ought to answer you more quickly  no dearest not more quickly than suits you nothing ever in this world can be more important both to you and to me if you want more time to think of it take more time  no mr glascock i do not i dont know why i should have paused is not the truth best  yescertainly the truth is best  i do notlove you pray pray understand me  i understand it too well miss rowley the stick was still going and the eyes more intently fixed than ever on something opposite  i do like you i like you very much and i am so grateful i cannot understand why such a man as you should want to make me your wife  because i love you better than all the others simply that that reason and that only justifies a man in wanting to marry a girl what a good fellow he was and how flattering were his words did he not deserve what he wanted even though it could not be given without a sacrifice but yet she did not love him as she looked at him again she could not there recognise her staff as she looked at him she was more than ever convinced that that other staff ought to be her staff may i come againafter a month say he asked when there had been another short period of silence  no no why should you trouble yourself i am not worth it  it is for me to judge of that miss rowley  all the same i know that i am not worth it and i could not tell you to do that  then i will wait and come again without your telling me  oh mr glascock i did not mean that indeed i did not pray do not think that take what i say as final i like you more than i can say and i feel a gratitude to you that i cannot expresswhich i shall never forget i have never known any one who has seemed to be so good as you but it is just what i said before and then she fairly burst into tears  miss rowley he said very slowly pray do not think that i want to ask any question which it might embarrass you to answer but my happiness is so greatly at stake and if you will allow me to say so your happiness too is so greatly concerned that it is most important that we should not come to a conclusion too quickly if i thought that your heart were vacant i would wait patiently i have been thinking of you as my possible wife for weeks pastfor months past of course you have not had such thoughts about me as he said this she almost loved him for his considerate goodness it has sometimes seemed to me odd that girls should love men in such a hurry if your heart be free i will wait and if you esteem me you can see and try whether you cannot learn to love me  i do esteem you  it depends on that question then he said slowly  she sat silent for fully a minute with her hands clasped and then she answered him in a whisper i do not know she said  he also was silent for a while before he spoke again he ceased to poke with his stick and got up from his chair and stood a little apart from her not looking at her even yet  i see he said at last i understand well miss rowley i quite perceive that i cannot press my suit any further now but i shall not despair altogether i know this that if i might possibly succeed i should be a very happy man goodbye miss rowley  she took his offered hand and pressed it so warmly that had he not been manly and bighearted he would have taken such pressure as a sign that she wished him to ask her again but such was his nature  god bless you he said and make you happy whatever you may choose to do  then he left her and she heard him walk down the stairs with heavy slow steps and she thought that she could perceive from the sound that he was sad at heart but that he was resolved not to show his sadness outwardly  when she was alone she began to think in earnest of what she had done if the reader were told that she regretted the decision which she had been forced to make so rapidly a wrong impression would be given of the condition of her thoughts but there came upon her suddenly a strange capacity for counting up and making a mental inventory of all that might have been hers she knewand where is the girl so placed that does not knowthat it is a great thing to be an english peeress now as she stood there thinking of it all she was nora rowley without a shilling in the world and without a prospect of a shilling she had often heard her mother speak fearful words of future possible days when colonial governing should no longer be within the capacity of sir marmaduke she had been taught from a very early age that all the material prosperity of her life must depend on matrimony she could never be comfortably disposed of in the world unless some fitting man who possessed those things of which she was so bare should wish to make her his wife now there had come a man so thoroughly fitting so marvellously endowed that no worldly blessing would have been wanting mr glascock had more than once spoken to her of the glories of monkhams she thought of monkhams now more than she had ever thought of the place before it would have been a great privilege to be the mistress of an old timehonoured mansion to call oaks and elms her own to know that acres of gardens were submitted to her caprices to look at herds of cows and oxen and be aware that they lowed on her own pastures and to have been the mother of a future peer of england to have the nursing and sweet custody and very making of a future senatorwould not that have been much and the man himself who would have been her husband was such a one that any woman might have trusted herself to him with perfect confidence now that he was gone she almost fancied that she did love him then she thought of hugh stanbury sitting as he had described himself in a little dark closet at the office of the d r in a very old inky shootingcoat with a tarnished squarecut cloth cap upon his head with a short pipe in his mouth writing at midnight for the next mornings impression this or that article according to the order of his master the tallowchandlerfor the editor of the daily record was a gentleman whose father happened to be a grocer in the city and hugh had been accustomed thus to describe the family trade and she might certainly have had the peer and the acres of garden and the big house and the senatorial honours whereas the tallowchandlers journeyman had never been so outspoken she told herself from moment to moment that she had done right that she would do the same a dozen times if a dozen times the experiment could be repeated but still still there was the remembrance of all that she had lost how would her mother look at her her anxious heavilyladen mother when the story should be told of all that had been offered to her and all that had been refused      illustration to have been the mother of a future peer   as she was thinking of this mrs trevelyan came into the room nora felt that though she might dread to meet her mother she could be bold enough on such an occasion before her sister emily had not done so well with her own affairs as to enable her to preach with advantage about marriage  he has gone said mrs trevelyan as she opened the door  yes he has gone  well do not pretend nora that you will not tell me  there is nothing worth the telling emily  what do you mean i am sure he has proposed he told me in so many words that it was his intention  whatever has happened dear you may be quite sure that i shall never be mrs glascock  then you have refused himbecause of hugh stanbury  i have refused him emily because i did not love him pray let that be enough  then she walked out of the room with something of stateliness in her gaitas might become a girl who had had it in her power to be the future lady peterborough but as soon as she reached the sacredness of her own chamber she gave way to an agony of tears it would indeed be much to be a lady peterborough and she had in truth refused it all because of hugh stanbury was hugh stanbury worth so great a sacrifice     chapter xiv  the clock house at nuncombe putney   it was not till a fortnight had passed after the transaction recorded in the last chapter that mrs trevelyan and nora rowley first heard the proposition that they should go to live at nuncombe putney from bad to worse the quarrel between the husband and the wife had gone on till trevelyan had at last told his friend lady milborough that he had made up his mind that they must live apart she is so selfwilledand perhaps i am the same he had said that it is impossible that we should live together lady milborough had implored and called to witness all testimonies profane and sacred against such a stephad almost gone down on her knees go to napleswhy not naples or to the quiet town in the west of france which was so dull that a wicked roaring lion fond of cities and gambling and eating and drinking could not live in such a place oh why not go to the quiet town in the west of france was not anything better than this flying in the face of god and man perhaps trevelyan did not himself like the idea of the quiet dull french town perhaps he thought that the flying in the face of god and man was all done by his wife not by him and that it was right that his wife should feel the consequences after many such entreaties many such arguments it was at last decided that the house in curzon street should be given up and that he and his wife live apart  and what about nora rowley asked lady milborough who had become aware by this time of noras insane folly in having refused mr glascock  she will go with her sister i suppose  and who will maintain her dear dear dear it does seem as though some young people were bent upon cutting their own throats and all their familys  poor lady milborough just at this time went as near to disliking the rowleys as was compatible with her nature it was not possible to her to hate anybody she thought that she hated the colonel osbornes but even that was a mistake she was very angry however with both mrs trevelyan and her sister and was disposed to speak of them as though they had been born to create trouble and vexation  trevelyan had not given any direct answer to that question about nora rowleys maintenance but he was quite prepared to bear all necessary expense in that direction at any rate till sir marmaduke should have arrived at first there had been an idea that the two sisters should go to the house of their aunt mrs outhouse mrs outhouse was the wifeas the reader may perhaps rememberof a clergyman living in the east of london st diddulphsintheeast was very much in the east indeed it was a parish outside the city lying near the river very populous very poor very low in character and very uncomfortable there was a rectoryhouse queerly situated at the end of a little blind lane with a gate of its own and a socalled garden about twenty yards square but the rectory of st diddulphs cannot be said to have been a comfortable abode the neighbourhood was certainly not alluring of visiting society within a distance of three or four miles there was none but what was afforded by the families of other eastend clergymen and then mr outhouse himself was a somewhat singular man he was very religious devoted to his work most kind to the poor but he was unfortunately a stronglybiased man and at the same time very obstinate withal he had never allied himself very cordially with his wifes brother sir marmaduke allowing himself to be carried away by a prejudice that people living at the westend who frequented clubs and were connected in any way with fashion could not be appropriate companions for himself the very title which sir marmaduke had acquired was repulsive to him and had induced him to tell his wife more than once that sir this or sir that could not be fitting associates for a poor eastend clergyman then his wifes niece had married a man of fashiona man supposed at st diddulphs to be very closely allied to fashion and mr outhouse had never been induced even to dine in the house in curzon street when therefore he heard that mr and mrs trevelyan were to be separated within two years of their marriage it could not be expected that he should be very eager to lend to the two sisters the use of his rectory  there had been interviews between mr outhouse and trevelyan and between mrs outhouse and her niece and then there was an interview between mr outhouse and emily in which it was decided that mrs trevelyan would not go to the parsonage of st diddulphs she had been very outspoken to her uncle declaring that she by no means intended to carry herself as a disgraced woman mr outhouse had quoted st paul to her wives obey your husbands then she had got up and had spoken very angrily i look for support from you she said as the man who is the nearest to me till my father shall come but i cannot support you in what is wrong said the clergyman then mrs trevelyan had left the room and would not see her uncle again  she carried things altogether with a high hand at this time when old mr bideawhile called upon her her husbands ancient family lawyer she told that gentleman that if it was her husbands will that they should live apart it must be so she could not force him to remain with her she could not compel him to keep up the house in curzon street she had certain rights she believed she spoke then she said of pecuniary rightsnot of those other rights which her husband was determined and was no doubt able to ignore she did not really know what those pecuniary rights might be nor was she careful to learn their exact extent she would thank mr bideawhile to see that things were properly arranged but of this her husband and mr bideawhile might be quite sureshe would take nothing as a favour she would not go to her uncles house she declined to tell mr bideawhile why she had so decided but she had decided she was ready to listen to any suggestion that her husband might make as to her residence but she must claim to have some choice in the matter as to her sister of course she intended to give nora a home as long as such a home might be wanted it would be very sad for nora but in existing circumstances such an arrangement would be expedient she would not go into details as to expense her husband was driving her away from him and it was for him to say what proportion of his income he would choose to give for her maintenancefor hers and for that of their child she was not desirous of anything beyond the means of decent living but of course she must for the present find a home for her sister as well as for herself when speaking of her baby she had striven hard so to speak that mr bideawhile should find no trace of doubt in the tones of her voice and yet she had been full of doubtfull of fear as mr bideawhile had uttered nothing antagonistic to her wishes in this matterhad seemed to agree that wherever the mother went thither the child would go alsomrs trevelyan had considered herself to be successful in this interview  the idea of a residence at nuncombe putney had occurred first to trevelyan himself and he had spoken of it to hugh stanbury there had been some difficulty in this because he had snubbed stanbury grievously when his friend had attempted to do some work of gentle interference between him and his wife and when he began the conversation he took the trouble of stating in the first instance that the separation was a thing fixedso that nothing might be urged on that subject it is to be you will understand that he said and if you think that your mother would agree to the arrangement it would be satisfactory to me and might i think be made pleasant to her of course your mother would be made to understand that the only fault with which my wife is charged is that of indomitable disobedience to my wishes  incompatibility of temper suggested stanbury  you may call it that if you pleasethough i must say for myself that i do not think that i have displayed any temper to which a woman has a right to object then he had gone on to explain what he was prepared to do about money he would pay through stanburys hands so much for maintenance and so much for house rent on the understanding that the money was not to go into his wifes hands i shall prefer he said to make myself on her behalf what disbursements may be necessary i will take care that she receives a proper sum quarterly through mr bideawhile for her own clothesand for those of our poor boy then stanbury had told him of the clock house and there had been an agreement made between theman agreement which was then of course subject to the approval of the ladies at nuncombe putney when the suggestion was made to mrs trevelyanwith a proposition that the clock house should be taken for one year and that for that year at least her boy should remain with hershe assented to it she did so with all the calmness that she was able to assume but in truth almost everything seemed to have been gained when she found that she was not to be separated from her baby i have no objection to living in devonshire if mr trevelyan wishes it she said in her most stately manner and certainly no objection to living with mr stanburys mother then mr bideawhile explained to her that nuncombe putney was not a large townwas in fact a very small and a very remote village that will make no difference whatsoever as far as i am concerned she answered and as for my sister she must put up with it till my father and my mother are here i believe the scenery at nuncombe putney is very pretty lovely said mr bideawhile who had a general idea that devonshire is supposed to be a picturesque county with such a life before me as i must lead continued mrs trevelyan an ugly neighbourhood one that would itself have had no interest for a stranger would certainly have been an additional sorrow so it had been settled and by the end of july mrs trevelyan with her sister and baby was established at the clock house under the protection of mrs stanbury mrs trevelyan had brought down her own maid and her own nurse and had found that the arrangements made by her husband had in truth been liberal the house in curzon street had been given up the furniture had been sent to a warehouse and mr trevelyan had gone into lodgings there never were two young people so insane since the world began said lady milborough to her old friend mrs fairfax when the thing was done  they will be together again before next april mrs fairfax had replied but mrs fairfax was a jolly dame who made the best of everything lady milborough raised her hands in despair and shook her head i dont suppose though that mr glascock will go to devonshire after his lady love said mrs fairfax lady milborough again raised her hands and again shook her head  mrs stanbury had given an easy assent when her son proposed to her this new mode of life but priscilla had had her doubts like all women she thought that when a man was to be separated from his wife the woman must be in the wrong and though it must be doubtless comfortable to go from the cottage to the clock house it would she said with much prudence be very uncomfortable to go back from the clock house to the cottage hugh replied very cavalierlygenerously that is rashly and somewhat impetuouslythat he would guarantee them against any such degradation  we dont want to be a burden upon you my dear said the mother  you would be a great burden on me he replied if you were living uncomfortably while i am able to make you comfortable  mrs stanbury was soon won over by mrs trevelyan by nora and especially by the baby and even priscilla after a week or two began to feel that she liked their company priscilla was a young woman who read a great deal and even had some gifts of understanding what she read she borrowed books from the clergyman and paid a penny a week to the landlady of the stag and antlers for the hire during half a day of the weekly newspaper but now there came a box of books from exeter and a daily paper from london andto improve all thisboth the new comers were able to talk with her about the things she read she soon declared to her mother that she liked miss rowley much the best of the two mrs trevelyan was too fond of having her own way she began to understand she would say to her mother that a man might find it difficult to live with mrs trevelyan she hardly ever yields about anything said priscilla as miss priscilla stanbury was also very fond of having her own way it was not surprising that she should object to that quality in this lady who had come to live under the same roof with her  the country about nuncombe putney is perhaps as pretty as any in england it is beyond the river teign between that and dartmoor and is so lovely in all its variations of rivers rivulets broken ground hills and dales old broken battered timeworn timber green knolls rich pastures and heathy common that the wonder is that english lovers of scenery know so little of it at the stag and antlers old mrs crocket than whom no old woman in the public line was ever more generous more peppery or more kind kept two clean bedrooms and could cook a leg of dartmoor mutton and make an apple pie against any woman in devonshire drat your fish she would say when some selfindulgent and exacting traveller would wish for more than these accustomed viands cock you up with dainties if you cant eat your victuals without fish you must go to exeter and then youll get it stinking mayhap now priscilla stanbury and mrs crocket were great friends and there had been times of deep want in which mrs crockets friendship had been very serviceable to the ladies at the cottage the three young women had been to the inn one morning to ask after a conveyance from nuncombe putney to princetown and had found that a fourwheeled open carriage with an old horse and a very young driver could be hired there we have never dreamed of such a thing priscilla stanbury had said and the only time i was at princetown i walked there and back so they had called at the stag and antlers and mrs crocket had told them her mind upon several matters  what a dear old woman said nora as they came away having made their bargain for the open carriage  i think she takes quite enough upon herself you know said mrs trevelyan  she is a dear old woman said priscilla not attending at all to the last words that had been spoken she is one of the best friends i have in the world if i were to say the best out of my own family perhaps i should not be wrong  but she uses such very odd language for a woman said mrs trevelyan now mrs crocket had certainly dratted and darned the boy who wouldnt come as fast as she had wished and had laughed at mrs trevelyan very contemptuously when that lady had suggested that the urchin who was at last brought forth might not be a safe charioteer down some of the hills  i suppose im used to it said priscilla at any rate i know i like it and i like her  i dare say shes a good sort of woman said mrs trevelyan only  i am not saying anything about her being a good woman now said priscilla interrupting the other with some vehemence but only that she is my friend  i liked her of all things said nora has she lived here always  yes all her life the house belonged to her father and to her grandfather before her and i think she says she has never slept out of it a dozen times in her life her husband is dead and her daughters are married away and she has the great grief and trouble of a neerdowell son hes away now and shes all alone then after a pause she continued i dare say it seems odd to you mrs trevelyan that we should speak of the innkeeper as a dear friend but you must remember that we have been poor among the poorestand are so indeed now we only came into our present house to receive you that is where we used to live and she pointed to the tiny cottage which now that it was dismantled and desolate looked to be doubly poor there have been times when we should have gone to bed very hungry if it had not been for mrs crocket  later in the day mrs trevelyan finding priscilla alone had apologized for what she had said about the old woman i was very thoughtless and forgetful but i hope you will not be angry with me i will be ever so fond of her if you will forgive me  very well said priscilla smiling on those conditions i will forgive you and from that time there sprang up something like a feeling of friendship between priscilla and mrs trevelyan nevertheless priscilla was still of opinion that the clock house arrangement was dangerous and should never have been made and mrs stanbury always timid of her own nature began to fear that it must be so as soon as she was removed from the influence of her son she did not see much even of the few neighbours who lived around her but she fancied that people looked at her in church as though she had done that which she ought not to have done in taking herself to a big and comfortable house for the sake of lending her protection to a lady who was separated from her husband it was not that she believed that mrs trevelyan had been wrong but that knowing herself to be weak she fancied that she and her daughter would be enveloped in the danger and suspicion which could not but attach themselves to the ladys condition instead of raising the lady out of the cloudas would have been the case had she herself been strong mrs trevelyan who was sharpsighted and clearwitted soon saw that it was so and spoke to priscilla on the subject before she had been a fortnight in the house i am afraid your mother does not like our being here she said  how am i to answer that priscilla replied  just tell the truth  the truth is so uncivil at first i did not like it i disliked it very much  why did you give way  i didnt give way hugh talked my mother over mamma does what i tell her except when hugh tells her something else i was afraid because down here knowing nothing of the world i didnt wish that we little people should be mixed up in the quarrels and disagreements of those who are so much bigger  i dont know who it is that is big in this matter  you are bigat any rate by comparison but now it must go on the house has been taken and my fears are over as regards you what you observe in mamma is only the effect not yet quite worn out of what i said before you came you may be quite sure of thisthat we neither of us believe a word against you your position is a very unfortunate one but if it can be remedied by your staying here with us pray stay with us  it cannot be remedied said emily but we could not be anywhere more comfortable than we are here     chapter xv  what they said about it in the close   when miss stanbury in the close at exeter was first told of the arrangement that had been made at nuncombe putney she said some very hard words as to the thing that had been done she was quite sure that mrs trevelyan was no better than she should be ladies who were separated from their husbands never were any better than they should be and what was to be thought of any woman who when separated from her husband would put herself under the protection of such a paladin as hugh stanbury she heard the tidings of course from dorothy and spoke her mind even to dorothy plainly enough but it was to martha that she expressed herself with her fullest vehemence  we always knew she said that my brother had married an addlepated silly woman one of the most unsuited to be the mistress of a clergymans house that ever a man set eyes on but i didnt think shed allow herself to be led into such a stupid thing as this  i dont suppose the lady has done anything amissany more than combing her husbands hair and the like of that said martha  dont tell me why by their own story she has got a lover  but he aint to come after her down here i suppose and as for lovers maam im told that the most of em have em up in london but it dont mean much only just idle talking and gallivanting  when women cant keep themselves from idle talking with strange gentlemen they are very far gone on the road to the devil thats my notion and that was everybodys notion a few years ago but now what with divorce bills and womens rights and penny papers and false hair and married women being just like giggling girls and giggling girls knowing just as much as married women when a woman has been married a year or two she begins to think whether she maynt have more fun for her money by living apart from her husband  miss dorothy says  oh bother what miss dorothy says miss dorothy only knows what it has suited that scamp her brother to tell her i understand this woman has come away because of a lover and if thats so my sisterinlaw is very wrong to receive her the temptation of the clock house has been too much for her its not my doing thats all  that evening miss stanbury and dorothy went out to tea at the house of mrs machugh and there the matter was very much discussed the family of the trevelyans was known by name in these parts and the fact of mrs trevelyan having been sent to live in a devonshire village with devonshire ladies who had a relation in exeter so well esteemed as miss stanbury of the close were circumstances of themselves sufficient to ensure a considerable amount of prestige at the city teatable for the tidings of this unfortunate family quarrel some reticence was of course necessary because of the presence of miss stanbury and of dorothy to miss stanbury herself mrs machugh and mrs crumbie of cronstadt house did not scruple to express themselves very plainly and to whisper a question as to what was to be done should the lover make his appearance at nuncombe putney but they who spoke of the matter before dorothy were at first more charitable or at least more forbearing mr gibson who was one of the minor canons and the two miss frenches from heavitree who had the reputation of hunting unmarried clergymen in couples seemed to have heard all about it when mrs machugh and miss stanbury with mr and mrs crumbie had seated themselves at their whisttable the younger people were able to express their opinions without danger of interruption or of rebuke it was known to all exeter by this time that dorothy stanburys mother had gone to the clock house and that she had done so in order that mrs trevelyan might have a home but it was not yet known whether anybody had called upon them there was mrs merton the wife of the present parson of nuncombe who had known the stanburys for the last twenty years and there was mrs ellison of lessboro who lived only four miles from nuncombe and who kept a ponycarriage it would be a great thing to know how these ladies had behaved in so difficult and embarrassing a position mrs trevelyan and her sister had now been at nuncombe putney for more than a fortnight and something in that matter of calling must have been doneor have been left undone in answer to an ingeniouslyframed question asked by camilla french dorothy at once set the matter at rest mrs merton said camilla french must find it a great thing to have two new ladies come to the village especially now that she has lost you miss stanbury  mamma tells me said dorothy that mrs trevelyan and miss rowley do not mean to know anybody they have given it out quite plainly so that there should be no mistake  dear dear said camilla french  i dare say its for the best said arabella french who was the elder and who looked very meek and soft miss french almost always looked meek and soft  im afraid it will make it very dull for your mothernot seeing her old friends said mr gibson  mamma wont feel that at all said dorothy  mrs stanbury i suppose will see her own friends at her own house just the same said camilla  there would be great difficulty in that when there is a lady who is to remain unknown said arabella dont you think so mr gibson mr gibson replied that perhaps there might be a difficulty but he wasnt sure the difficulty he thought might be got over if the ladies did not always occupy the same room  you have never seen mrs trevelyan have you miss stanbury asked camilla  never  she is not an old family friend thenor anything of that sort  oh dear no  because said arabella it is so odd how different people get together sometimes then dorothy explained that mr trevelyan and her brother hugh had long been friends  ohof mr trevelyan said camilla then it is he that has sent his wife to nuncombe not she that has come there  i suppose there has been some agreement said dorothy  just so just so said arabella the meek i should like to see her they say that she is very beautiful dont they  my brother says that she is handsome  exceedingly lovely im told said camilla i should like to see hershouldnt you mr gibson  i always like to see a pretty woman said mr gibson with a polite bow which the sisters shared between them  i suppose shell go to church said camilla  very likely not said arabella ladies of that sort very often dont go to church i dare say youll find that shell never stir out of the place at all and that not a soul in nuncombe will ever see her except the gardener it is such a thing for a woman to be separated from her husband dont you think so mr gibson  of course it is said he with a shake of his head which was intended to imply that the censure of the church must of course attend any sundering of those whom the church had bound together but which implied also by the absence from it of any intense clerical severity that as the separated wife was allowed to live with so very respectable a lady as mrs stanbury there must probably be some mitigating circumstances attending this special separation  i wonder what he is like said camilla after a pause  who asked arabella  the gentleman said camilla  what gentleman demanded arabella  i dont mean mr trevelyan said camilla  i dont believe there really isehis there said mr gibson very timidly  oh dear yes said arabella  im afraid theres something of the kind said camilla ive heard that there is and ive heard his name then she whispered very closely into the ear of mr gibson the words colonel osborne as though her lips were by far too pure to mention aloud any sound so full of iniquity  indeed said mr gibson  but hes quite an old man said dorothy and knew her father intimately before she was born and as far as i can understand her husband does not suspect her in the least and its only because theres a misunderstanding between them and not at all because of the gentleman  oh exclaimed camilla  ah exclaimed arabella  that would make a difference said mr gibson  but for a married woman to have her name mentioned at all with a gentlemanit is so bad is it not mr gibson and then arabella also had her whisper into the clergymans earvery closely im afraid theres not a doubt about the colonel im afraid not i am indeed  two by honours and the odd and its my deal said miss stanbury briskly and the sharp click with which she put the markers down upon the table was heard all through the room i dont want anybody to tell me she said that when a young woman is parted from her husband the chances are ten to one that she has been very foolish  but whats a woman to do if her husband beats her said mrs crumbie  beat him again said mrs machugh  and the husband will be sure to have the worst of it said mr crumbie well i declare if you havent turned up an honour again miss stanbury  it was your wife that cut it to me mr crumbie then they were again at once immersed in the play and the name neither of trevelyan nor osborne was heard till miss stanbury was marking her double under the candlestick but during all pauses in the game the conversation went back to the same topic and when the rubber was over they who had been playing it lost themselves for ten minutes in the allurements of the interesting subject it was so singular a coincidence that the lady should have gone to nuncombe putney of all villages in england and to the house of mrs stanbury of all ladies in england and then was she innocent or was she guilty and if guilty in what degree that she had been allowed to bring her baby with her was considered to be a great point in her favour mr crumbies opinion was that it was only a few words mrs crumbie was afraid that she had been a little light mrs machugh said that there was never fire without smoke and miss stanbury as she took her departure declared that the young women of the present day didnt know what they were after they think that the world should be all frolic and dancing and they have no more idea of doing their duty and earning their bread than a boy home for the holidays has of doing lessons  then as she went home with dorothy across the close she spoke a word which she intended to be very serious i dont mean to say anything against your mother for what she has done as yet somebody must take the woman in and perhaps it was natural but if that colonel whatshisname makes his way down to nuncombe putney your mother must send her packing if she has any respect either for herself or for priscilla     chapter xvi  dartmoor      illustration  the wellweighed decision of miss stanbury respecting the stanburytrevelyan arrangement at nuncombe putney had been communicated to dorothy as the two walked home at night across the close from mrs machughs house and it was accepted by dorothy as being wise and proper it amounted to this if mrs trevelyan should behave herself with propriety in her retirement at the clock house no further blame in the matter should be attributed to mrs stanbury for receiving herat any rate in dorothys hearing the existing scheme whether wise or foolish should be regarded as an accepted scheme but if mrs trevelyan should be indiscreetif for instance colonel osborne should show himself at nuncombe putneythen for the sake of the family miss stanbury would speak out and would speak out very loudly all this dorothy understood and she could perceive that her aunt had strong suspicion that there would be indiscretion  i never knew one like her said miss stanbury who when shed got away from one man didnt want to have another dangling after her  a week had hardly passed after the party at mrs machughs and mrs trevelyan had hardly been three weeks at nuncombe putney before the tidings which miss stanbury almost expected reached her ears  the colonels been at the clock house maam said martha  now it was quite understood in the close by this time that the colonel meant colonel osborne  no  im told he has though maam for sure and certain  who says so  giles hickbody was down at lessboro and seed him hisselfa portly middleaged mannot one of your young scampishlike lovers  thats the man  oh yes he went over to nuncombe putney as sure as anythinghired mrs cleggs chaise and pair and asked for mrs trevelyans house as open as anything when giles asked in the yard they told him as how that was the married ladys young man  id like to be at his tailso i wouldwith a mophandle said miss stanbury whose hatred for those sins by which the comfort and respectability of the world are destroyed was not only sincere but intense well and what then  he came back and slept at mrs cleggs that nightat least that was what he said he should do  miss stanbury however was not so precipitate or uncharitable as to act strongly upon information such as this before she even said a word to dorothy she made further inquiry she made very minute inquiry writing even to her very old and intimate friend mrs ellison of lessborowriting to that lady a most cautious and guarded letter at last it became a fact proved to her mind that colonel osborne had been at the clock house had been received there and had remained there for hourshad been allowed access to mrs trevelyan and had slept the night at the inn at lessboro the thing was so terrible to miss stanburys mind that even false hair dr colenso and penny newspapers did not account for it  i shall begin to believe that the evil one has been allowed to come among us in person because of our sins she said to marthaand she meant it  in the meantime mrs trevelyan as may be remembered had hired mrs crockets open carriage and the three young women mrs trevelyan nora and priscilla made a little excursion to princetown somewhat after the fashion of a picnic at princetown in the middle of dartmoor about nine miles from nuncombe putney is the prison establishment at which are kept convicts undergoing penal servitude it is regarded by all the country round with great interest chiefly because the prisoners now and again escape and then there comes a period of interesting excitement until the escaped felon shall have been again taken how can you tell where he may be or whether it may not suit him to find his rest in your own cupboard or under your own bed and then as escape without notice will of course be the felons object to attain that he will probably cut your throat and the throat of everybody belonging to you all which considerations give an interest to princetown and excite in the hearts of the devonians of these parts a strong affection for the dartmoor prison of those who visit princetown comparatively few effect an entrance within the walls of the gaol they look at the gloomy place with a mysterious interest feeling something akin to envy for the prisoners who have enjoyed the privilege of solving the mysteries of prison life and who know how men feel when they have their hair cut short and are free from moral responsibility for their own conduct and are moved about in gangs and treated like wild beasts  but the journey to princetown from whatever side it is approached has the charm of wild and beautiful scenery the spot itself is ugly enough but you can go not thither without breathing the sweetest freshest air and encountering that delightful sense of romance which moorland scenery always produces the idea of our three friends was to see the moor rather than the prison to learn something of the country around and to enjoy the excitement of eating a sandwich sitting on a hillock in exchange for the ordinary comforts of a good dinner with chairs and tables a bottle of sherry and water and a paper of sandwiches contained their whole banquet for ladies though they like good things at picnics and indeed at other times almost as well as men like them very seldom prepare dainties for themselves alone men are wiser and more thoughtful and are careful to have the good things even if they are to be enjoyed without companionship  mrs crockets boy though he was only about three feet high was a miracle of skill and discretion he used the machine as the patent drag is called in going down the hills with the utmost care he never forced the beast beyond a walk if there was the slightest rise in the ground and as there was always a rise the journey was slow but the three ladies enjoyed it thoroughly and mrs trevelyan was in better spirits than she herself had thought to be possible for her in her present condition most of us have recognised the fact that a dram of spirits will createthat a socalled nip of brandy will create hilarity or at least alacrity and that a glass of sherry will often pick up and set in order the prostrate animal and mental faculties of the drinker but we are not sufficiently alive to the fact that copious draughts of fresh airof air fresh and unaccustomedwill have precisely the same effect we do know that now and again it is very essential to change the air but we generally consider that to do that with any chance of advantage it is necessary to go far afield and we think also that such change of the air is only needful when sickness of the body has come upon us or when it threatens to come we are seldom aware that we may imbibe long potations of pleasure and healthy excitement without perhaps going out of our own county that such potations are within a days journey of most of us and that they are to be had for halfacrown a head all expenses told mrs trevelyan probably did not know that the cloud was lifted off her mind and the load of her sorrow made light to her by the special vigour of the air of the moor but she did know that she was enjoying herself and that the world was pleasanter to her than it had been for months past  when they had sat upon their hillocks and eaten their sandwichesregretting that the basket of provisions had not been biggerand had drunk their sherry and water out of the little horn mug which mrs crocket had lent them nora started off across the moorland alone the horse had been left to be fed in princetown and they had walked back to a bush under which they had rashly left their basket of provender concealed it happened however that on that day there was no escaped felon about to watch what they had done and the food and the drink had been found secure nora had gone off and as her sister and priscilla sat leaning against their hillocks with their backs to the road she could be seen standing now on one little eminence and now on another thinking doubtless as she stood on the one how good it would be to be lady peterborough and as she stood on the other how much better to be mrs hugh stanbury onlybefore she could be mrs hugh stanbury it would be necessary that mr hugh stanbury should share her opinionand necessary also that he should be able to maintain a wife i should never do to be a very poor mans wife she said to herself and remembered as she said it that in reference to the prospect of her being lady peterborough the man who was to be lord peterborough was at any rate ready to make her his wife and on that side there were none of those difficulties about house and money and position which stood in the way of the hugh stanbury side of the question she was not she thought fit to be the wife of a very poor man but she conceived of herself that she would do very well as a future lady peterborough in the drawingrooms of monkhams she was so far vain as to fancy that she could look and speak and move and have her being after the fashion which is approved for the lady peterboroughs of the world it was not clear to her that nature had not expressly intended her to be a lady peterborough whereas as far as she could see nature had not intended her to be a mrs hugh stanbury with a precarious income of perhaps ten guineas a week when journalism was doing well so she moved on to another little eminence to think of it there it was clear to her that if she should accept mr glascock she would sell herself and not give herself away and she had told herself scores of times before this that a young woman should give herself away and not sell herselfshould either give herself away or keep herself to herself as circumstances might go she had been quite sure that she would never sell herself but this was a lesson which she had taught herself when she was very young before she had come to understand the world and its hard necessities nothing she now told herself could be worse than to hang like a millstone round the neck of a poor man it might be a very good thing to give herself away for lovebut it would not be a good thing to be the means of ruining the man she loved even if that man were willing to be so ruined and then she thought that she could also love that other man a littlecould love him sufficiently for comfortable domestic purposes and it would undoubtedly be very pleasant to have all the troubles of her life settled for her if she were mrs glascock known to the world as the future lady peterborough would it not be within her power to bring her sister and her sisters husband again together the tribute of the monkhams authority and influence to her sisters side of the question would be most salutary she tried to make herself believe that in this way she would be doing a good deed upon the whole she thought that if mr glascock should give her another chance she would accept him and he had distinctly promised that he would give her another chance it might be that this unfortunate quarrel in the trevelyan family would deter him people do not wish to ally themselves with family quarrels but if the chance came in her way she would accept it she had made up her mind to that when she turned round from off the last knoll on which she had stood to return to her sister and priscilla stanbury      illustration nora tries to make herself believe   they two had sat still under the shade of a thorn bush looking at nora as she was wandering about and talking together more freely than they had ever done before on the circumstances that had brought them together how pretty she looks priscilla had said as nora was standing with her figure clearly marked by the light  yes she is very pretty and has been much admired this terrible affair of mine is a cruel blow to her  you mean that it is bad for her to come and live herewithout society  not exactly thatthough of course it would be better for her to go out and i dont know how a girl is ever to get settled in the world unless she goes out but it is always an injury to be connected in any way with a woman who is separated from her husband it must be bad for you  it wont hurt me said priscilla nothing of that kind can hurt me  i mean that people say such illnatured things  i stand alone and can take care of myself said priscilla i defy the evil tongues of all the world to hurt me my personal cares are limited to an old gown and bread and cheese i like a pair of gloves to go to church with but that is only the remnant of a prejudice the world has so very little to give me that i am pretty nearly sure that it will take nothing away  and you are contented  well no i cant say that i am contented i hardly think that anybody ought to be contented should my mother die and dorothy remain with my aunt or get married i should be utterly alone in the world providence or whatever you call it has made me a lady after a fashion so that i cant live with the ploughmens wives and at the same time has so used me in other respects that i cant live with anybody else  why should not you get married as well as dorothy  who would have me and if i had a husband i should want a good onea man with a head on his shoulders and a heart even if i were young and goodlooking or rich i doubt whether i could please myself as it is i am as likely to be taken bodily to heaven as to become any mans wife  i suppose most women think so of themselves at some time and yet they are married  i am not fit to marry i am often cross and i like my own way and i have a distaste for men i never in my life saw a man whom i wished even to make my intimate friend i should think any man an idiot who began to make soft speeches to me and i should tell him so  ah you might find it different when he went on with it  but i think said priscilla that when a woman is married there is nothing to which she should not submit on behalf of her husband  you mean that for me  of course i mean it for you how should i not be thinking of you living as you are under the same roof with us and i am thinking of louey louey was the baby what are you to do when after a year or two his father shall send for him to have him under his own care  nothing shall separate me from my child said mrs trevelyan eagerly  that is easily said but i suppose the power of doing as he pleased would be with him  why should it be with him i do not at all know that it would be with him i have not left his house it is he that has turned me out  there can i think be very little doubt what you should do said priscilla after a pause during which she had got up from her seat under the thorn bush  what should i do asked mrs trevelyan  go back to him  i will tomorrow if he will write and ask me nay how could i help myself i am his creature and must go or come as he bids me i am here only because he has sent me  you should write and ask him to take you  ask him to forgive me because he has illtreated me  never mind about that said priscilla standing over her companion who was still lying under the bush all that is twopennyhalfpenny pride which should be thrown to the winds the more right you have been hitherto the better you can afford to go on being right what is it that we all live upon but selfesteem when we want praise it is only because praise enables us to think well of ourselves every one to himself is the centre and pivot of all the world  its a very poor world that goes round upon my pivot said mrs trevelyan  i dont know how this quarrel came up exclaimed priscilla and i dont care to know but it seems a trumpery quarrelas to who should beg each others pardon first and all that kind of thing sheer and simple nonsense ask him to let it all be forgotten i suppose he loves you  how can i know he did once  and you love him  yes i love him certainly  i dont see how you can have a doubt here is jack with the carriage and if we dont mind hell pass us by without seeing us  then mrs trevelyan got up and when they had succeeded in diverting jacks attention for a moment from the horse they called to nora who was still moving about from one knoll to another and who showed no desire to abandon the contemplations in which she had been engaged  it had been midday before they left home in the morning and they were due to be at home in time for teawhich is an epoch in the day generally allowed to be more elastic than some others when mrs stanbury lived in the cottage her hour for tea had been six this had been stretched to halfpast seven when she received mrs trevelyan at the clock house and it was halfpast eight before jack landed them at their door it was manifest to them all as they entered the house that there was an air of mystery in the face of the girl who had opened the door for them she did not speak however till they were all within the passage then she uttered a few words very solemnly there be a gentleman come she said  a gentleman said mrs trevelyan thinking in the first moment of her husband and in the second of colonel osborne  he be for you miss said the girl bobbing her head at nora  upon hearing this nora sank speechless into the chair which stood in the passage     chapter xvii  a gentleman comes to nuncombe putney   it soon became known to them all as they remained clustered in the hall that mr glascock was in the house mrs stanbury came out to them and informed them that he had been at nuncombe putney for the last five hours and that he had asked for mrs trevelyan when he called it became evident as the affairs of the evening went on that mrs stanbury had for a few minutes been thrown into a terrible state of amazement thinking that the colonel had appeared the strange gentleman however having obtained admittance explained who he was saying that he was very desirous of seeing mrs trevelyanand miss rowley it may be presumed that a glimmer of light did make its way into mrs stanburys mind on the subject but up to the moment at which the three travellers arrived she had been in doubt on the subject mr glascock had declared that he would take a walk and in the course of the afternoon had expressed high approval of mrs crockets culinary skill when mrs crocket heard that she had entertained the son of a lord she was very loud in her praise of the manner in which he had eaten two mutton chops and called for a third he had thought it no disgrace to apply himself to the second half of an apple pie and had professed himself to be an ardent admirer of devonshire cream its them counterskippers as turns up their little noses at the victuals as is set before them said mrs crocket  after his dinner mr glascock had returned to the clock house and had been sitting there for an hour with mrs stanbury not much to her delight or to his when the carriage was driven up to the door  he is to go back to lessboro tonight said mrs stanbury in a whisper  of course you must see him before he goes said mrs trevelyan to her sister there had as was natural been very much said between the two sisters about mr glascock nora had abstained from asserting in any decided way that she disliked the man and had always absolutely refused to allow hugh stanburys name to be mixed up with the question whatever might be her own thoughts about hugh stanbury she had kept them even from her sister when her sister had told her that she had refused mr glascock because of hugh she had shown herself to be indignant and had since that said one or two fine things as to her capacity to refuse a brilliant offer simply because the man who had made it was indifferent to her mrs trevelyan had learned from her that her suitor had declared his intention to persevere and here was perseverance with a vengeance of course you must see himat once said mrs trevelyan nora for a few seconds had remained silent and then had run up to her room her sister followed her instantly  what is the meaning of it all said priscilla to her mother  i suppose he is in love with miss rowley said mrs stanbury  but who is he  then mrs stanbury told all that she knew she had seen from his card that he was an honourable mr glascock she had collected from what he had said that he was an old friend of the two ladies her conviction was strong in mr glascocks favourthinking as she expressed herself that everything was right and properbut she could hardly explain why she thought so  i do wish that they had never come said priscilla who could not rid herself of an idea that there must be danger in having to do with women who had men running after them  of course ill see him said nora to her sister i have not refused to see him why do you scold me  i have not scolded you nora but i do want you to think how immensely important this is  of course it is important  and so much the more so because of my misfortunes think how good he must be how strong must be his attachment when he comes down here after you in this way  but i have to think of my own feelings  you know you like him you have told me so and only fancy what mamma will feel such a position and the man so excellent everybody says that he hasnt a fault in any way  i hate people without faults  oh nora nora that is foolish there there you must go down praypray do not let any absurd fancy stand in your way and destroy everything it will never come again nora and only think it is all now your own if you will only whisper one word  ahone wordand that a falsehood  nono say you will try to love him and that will be enough and you do love him  do i  yes you do it is only the opposition of your nature that makes you fight against him will you go now  let me be for two minutes by myself said nora and then ill come down tell him that im coming mrs trevelyan stooped over her kissed her and then left her  nora as soon as she was alone stood upright in the middle of the room and held her hands up to her forehead she had been far from thinking when she was considering the matter easily among the hillocks that the necessity for an absolute decision would come upon her so instantaneously she had told herself only this morning that it would be wise to accept the man if he should ever ask a second timeand he had come already he had been waiting for her in the village while she had been thinking whether he would ever come across her path again she thought that it would have been easier for her now to have gone down with a yes in her mouth if her sister had not pressed her so hard to say that yes the very pressure from her sister seemed to imply that such pressure ought to be resisted why should there have been pressure unless there were reasons against her marrying him and yet if she chose to take him who would have a right to complain of her hugh stanbury had never spoken to her a word that would justify her in even supposing that he would consider himself to be illused all others of her friends would certainly rejoice would applaud her pat her on the back cover her with caresses and tell her that she had been born under a happy star and she did like the man nayshe thought she loved him she withdrew her hands from her brow assured herself that her lot in life was cast and with hurrying fingers attempted to smooth her hair and to arrange her ribbons before the glass she would go to the encounter boldly and accept him honestly it was her duty to do so what might she not do for brothers and sisters as the wife of lord peterborough of monkhams she saw that that arrangement before the glass could be of no service and she stepped quickly to the door if he did not like her as she was he need not ask her her mind was made up and she would do it but as she went down the stairs to the room in which she knew that he was waiting for her there came over her a cold feeling of selfaccusationalmost of disgrace i do not care she said i know that im right she opened the door quickly that there might be no further doubt and found that she was alone with him  miss rowley he said i am afraid you will think that i am persecuting you  i have no right to think that she answered  ill tell you why i have come my dear father who has always been my best friend is very ill he is at naples and i must go to him he is very old you knowover eighty and will never live to come back to england from what i hear i think it probable that i may remain with him till everything is over  i did not know that he was so old as that  they say that he can hardly live above a month or two he will never see my wifeif i can have a wife but i should like to tell him if it were possiblethatthat  i understand you mr glascock  i told you that i should come to you again and as i may possibly linger at naples all the winter i could not go without seeing you miss rowley may i hope that you can love me  she did not answer him a word but stood looking away from him with her hands clasped together had he asked her whether she would be his wife it is possible that the answer which she had prepared would have been spoken but he had put the question in another form did she love him if she could only bring herself to say that she could love him she might be lady of monkhams before the next summer had come round  nora he said do you think that you can love me  no she said and there was something almost of fierceness in the tone of her voice as she answered him  and must that be your final answer to me  mr glascock what can i say she replied i will tell you the honest truthi will tell you everything i came into this room determined to accept you but you are so good and so kind and so upright that i cannot tell you a falsehood i do not love you i ought not to take what you offer me if i did it would be because you are rich and a lord and not because i love you i love some one else therepray pray do not tell of me but i do then she flung away from him and hid her face in a corner of the sofa out of the light  her lover stood silent not knowing how to go on with the conversation not knowing how to bring it to an end after what she had now said to him it was impossible that he should press her further it was almost impossible that he should wish to do so when a lady is frank enough to declare that her heart is not her own to give a man can hardly wish to make further prayer for the gift if so he said of course i have nothing to hope  she was sobbing and could not answer him she was half repentant partly proud of what she had donehalf repentant in that she had lost what had seemed to her to be so good and full of remorse in that she had so unnecessarily told her secret  perhaps said he i ought to assure you that what you have told me shall never be repeated by my lips  she thanked him for this by a motion of her head and hand not by wordsand then he was gone how he managed to bid adieu to mrs stanbury and her sister or whether he saw them as he left the house she never knew in her corner of the sofa weeping in the dark partly proud and partly repentant she remained till her sister came to her emily she said jumping up say nothing about it not a word it is of no use the thing is done and over and let it altogether be forgotten  it is done and over certainly said mrs trevelyan  exactlyand i suppose a girl may do what she likes with herself in that way if i choose to decline to take anything that is pleasant and nice and comfortable nobody has a right to scold me and i wont be scolded  but my child who is scolding you  you mean to scold me but it is of no use the man has gone and there is an end of it nothing that you can say or i can think will bring him back again i dont want anybody to tell me that it would be better to be lady peterborough with everything that the world has to give than to live here without a soul to speak to and to have to go back to those horrible islands next year you cant think that i am very comfortable  but what did you say to him nora  what did i say to him what could i say to him why didnt he ask me to be his wife without saying anything about love he asked me if i loved him of course i dont love him i would have said i did but it stuck in my throat i am willing enough i believe to sell myself to the devil but i dont know how to do it never mind its done and now ill go to bed  she did go to bed and mrs trevelyan explained to the two ladies as much as was necessary of what had occurred when mrs stanbury came to understand that the gentleman who had been closeted with her would probably in a few months be a lord himself that he was a very rich man a member of parliament and one of those who are decidedly born with gold spoons in their mouths and understood also that nora rowley had refused him she was lost in amazement mr glascock was about forty years of age and appeared to nora rowley who was nearly twenty years his junior to be almost an old man but to mrs stanbury who was over sixty mr glascock seemed to be quite in the flower of his age the bald place at the top of his head simply showed that he had passed his boyhood and the grey hairs at the back of his whiskers were no more than outward signs of manly discretion she could not understand why any girl should refuse such an offer unless the man were himself bad in morals or in temper but mrs trevelyan had told her while nora and mr glascock were closeted together that he was believed by them all to be good and gentle nevertheless she felt a considerable increase of respect for a young lady who had refused the eldest son of a lord priscilla when she heard what had occurred expressed to her mother a moderated approval according to her views a girl would much more often be right to refuse an offer of marriage than to accept it let him who made the offer be who he might and the fact of the man having been sent away with a refusal somewhat softened priscillas anger at his coming there at all  i suppose he is a goose said she to her mother and i hope there wont be any more of this kind running after them while they are with us  nora when she was alone wept till her heart was almost broken it was done and the man was gone and the thing was over she had quite sufficient knowledge of the world to realise perfectly the difference between such a position as that which had been offered to her and the position which in all probability she would now be called upon to fill she had had her chance and fortune had placed great things at her disposal it must be said of her also that the great things which fortune had offered to her were treasures very valuable in her eyes whether it be right and wise to covet or to despise wealth and rank there was no doubt but that she coveted them she had been instructed to believe in them and she did believe in them in some mysterious manner of which she herself knew nothing taught by some preceptor the nobility of whose lessons she had not recognised though she had accepted them she had learned other things alsoto revere truth and love and to be ambitious as regarded herself of conferring the gift of her whole heart upon some one whom she could worship as a hero she had spoken the simple truth when she had told her sister that she had been willing to sell herself to the devil but that she had failed in her attempt to execute the contract but now as she lay weeping on her bed tearing herself with remorse picturing to herself in the most vivid colours all that she had thrown away telling herself of all that she might have done and all that she might have been had she not allowed the insane folly of a moment to get the better of her she received little or no comfort from the reflection that she had been true to her better instincts she had told the man that she had refused him because she loved hugh stanburyat least as far as she could remember what had passed she had so told him and how mean it was of her to allow herself to be actuated by an insane passion for a man who had never spoken to her of love and how silly of her afterwards to confess it of what service could such a passion be to her life even were it returned she could not marry such a one as hugh stanbury she knew enough of herself to be quite sure that were he to ask her to do so tomorrow she would refuse him better go and be scorched and bored to death and buried at the mandarins than attempt to regulate a poor household which as soon as she made one of its number would be on the sure road to ruin  for a moment there came upon her not a thought hardly an ideasomething of a waking dream that she would write to mr glascock and withdraw all that she had said were she to do so he would probably despise her and tell her that he despised herbut there might be a chance it was possible that such a declaration would bring him back to herand did it not bring him back to her she would only be where she was a poor lost shipwrecked creature who had flung herself upon the rocks and thrown away her only chance of a prosperous voyage across the ocean of life her only chance for she was not like other girls who at any rate remain on the scene of action and may refit their spars and still win their way for there were to be no more seasons in london no more living in curzon street no renewed power of entering the ballrooms and crowded staircases in which highborn wealthy lovers can be conquered a great prospect had been given to her and she had flung it aside that letter of retractation was however quite out of the question the reader must not suppose that she had ever thought that she could write it she thought of nothing but of coming misery and remorse in her wretchedness she fancied that she had absolutely disclosed to the man who loved her the name of him whom she had been mad enough to say that she loved but what did it matter let it be as it might she was destroyed  the next morning she came down to breakfast pale as a ghost and they who saw her knew at once that she had done that which had made her a wretched woman     chapter xviii  the stanbury correspondence   half an hour after the proper time when the others had finished their tea and bread and butter nora rowley came down among them pale as a ghost her sister had gone to her while she was dressing but she had declared that she would prefer to be alone she would be down directly she had said and had completed her toilet without even the assistance of her maid she drank her cup of tea and pretended to eat her toast and then sat herself down very wretchedly to think of it all again it had been all within her graspall of which she had ever dreamed and now it was gone each of her three companions strove from time to time to draw her into conversation but she seemed to be resolute in her refusal at first till her utter prostration had become a fact plainly recognised by them all she made some little attempt at an answer when a direct question was asked of her but after a while she only shook her head and was silent giving way to absolute despair  late in the evening she went out into the garden and priscilla followed her it was now the end of july and the summer was in its glory the ladies during the day would remain in the drawingroom with the windows open and the blinds down and would sit in the evening reading and working or perhaps pretending to read and work under the shade of a cedar which stood upon the lawn no retirement could possibly be more secluded than was that of the garden of the clock house no stranger could see into it or hear sounds from out of it though it was not extensive it was so well furnished with those charming garden shrubs which in congenial soils become large trees that one party of wanderers might seem to be lost from another amidst its walls on this evening mrs stanbury and mrs trevelyan had gone out as usual but priscilla had remained with nora rowley after a while nora also got up and went through the window all alone priscilla having waited for a few minutes followed her and caught her in a long green walk that led round the bottom of the orchard  what makes you so wretched she said  why do you say i am wretched  because its so visible how is one to go on living with you all day and not notice it  i wish you wouldnt notice it i dont think it kind of you to notice it if i wanted to talk of it i would say so  it is better generally to speak of a trouble than to keep it to oneself said priscilla  all the same i would prefer not to speak of mine said nora  then they parted one going one way and one the other and priscilla was certainly angry at the reception which had been given to the sympathy which she had proffered the next day passed almost without a word spoken between the two mrs stanbury had not ventured as yet to mention to her guest the subject of the rejected lover and had not even said much on the subject to mrs trevelyan between the two sisters there had been of course some discussion on the matter it was impossible that it should be allowed to pass without it but such discussions always resulted in an assertion on the part of nora that she would not be scolded mrs trevelyan was very tender with her and made no attempt to scold hertried at last simply to console her but nora was so continually at work scolding herself that every word spoken to her on the subject of mr glascocks visit seemed to her to carry with it a rebuke  but on the second day she herself accosted priscilla stanbury come into the garden she said when they two were for a moment alone together i want to speak to you priscilla without answering folded up her work and put on her hat come down to the green walk said nora i was savage to you last night and i want to beg your pardon  you were savage said priscilla smiling and you shall have my pardon who would not pardon you any offence if you asked it  i am so miserable she said  but why  i dont know i cant tell and it is of no use talking about it now for it is all over but i ought not to have been cross to you and i am very sorry  that does not signify a straw only so far that when i have been cross and have begged a persons pardonwhich i dont do as often as i oughti always feel that it begets kindness if i could help you in your trouble i would  you cant fetch him back again  you mean mr glascock shall i go and try  nora smiled and shook her head i wonder what he would say if you asked him but if he came i should do the same thing  i do not in the least know what you have done my dear i only see that you mope about and are more down in the mouth than any one ought to be unless some great trouble has come  a great trouble has come  i suppose you have had your choiceeither to accept your lover or to reject him  no i have not had my choice  it seems to me that no one has dictated to you or at least that you have obeyed no dictation  of course i cant explain it to you it is impossible that i should  if you mean that you regret what you have done because you have been false to the man i can sympathise with you no one has ever a right to be false and if you are repenting a falsehood i will willingly help you to eat your ashes and to wear your sackcloth but if you are repenting a truth  i am  then you must eat your ashes by yourself for me and i do not think that you will ever be able to digest them  i do not want anybody to help me said nora proudly  nobody can help you if i understand the matter rightly you have got to get the better of your own covetousness and evil desires and you are in the fair way to get the better of them if you have already refused to be this mans wife because you could not bring yourself to commit the sin of marrying him when you did not love him i suppose that is about the truth of it and indeed indeed i do sympathise with you if you have done that though it is no more than the plainest duty i will love you for it one finds so few people that will do any duty that taxes their selfindulgence  but he did not ask me to marry him  then i do not understand anything about it  he asked me to love him  but he meant you to be his wife  oh yeshe meant that of course  and what did you say asked priscilla  that i didnt love him replied nora  and that was the truth  yesit was the truth  and what do you regretthat you didnt tell him a lie  nonot that said nora slowly  what then you cannot regret that you have not basely deceived a man who has treated you with a loving generosity they walked on silent for a few yards and then priscilla repeated her question you cannot mean that you are sorry that you did not persuade yourself to do evil  i dont want to go back to the islands and to lose myself there and to be nobodythat is what i mean and i might have been so much could one step from the very highest rung of the ladder to the very lowest and not feel it  but you have gone up the ladderif you only knew it said priscilla there was a choice given to you between the foulest mire of the clay of the world and the sunlight of the very god you have chosen the sunlight and you are crying after the clay i cannot pity you but i can esteem you and love you and believe in you and i do youll get yourself right at last and theres my hand on it if youll take it nora took the hand that was offered to her held it in her own for some seconds and then walked back to the house and up to her own room in silence  the post used to come into nuncombe putney at about eight in the morning carried thither by a woodenlegged man who rode a donkey there is a general understanding that the woodenlegged men in country parishes should be employed as postmen owing to the great steadiness of demeanour which a wooden leg is generally found to produce it may be that such men are slower in their operations than would be biped postmen but as all private employers of labour demand labourers with two legs it is well that the lame and halt should find a refuge in the less exacting service of the government the onelegged man who rode his donkey into nuncombe putney would reach his postoffice not above half an hour after his proper time but he was very slow in stumping round the village and seldom reached the clock house much before ten on a certain morning two or three days after the conversation just recorded it was past ten when he brought two letters to the door one for mrs trevelyan and one for mrs stanbury the ladies had finished their breakfast and were seated together at an open window as was usual the letters were given into priscillas hands and the newspaper which accompanied them into those of mrs trevelyan its undoubted owner when her letter was handed to her she looked at the address closely and then walked away with it into her own room  i think its from louis said nora as soon as the door was closed if so he is telling her to come back  mamma this is for you said priscilla it is from aunt stanbury i know her handwriting  from your aunt what can she be writing about there is something wrong with dorothy mrs stanbury held the letter but did not open it you had better read it my dear if she is ill pray let her come home  but the letter spoke of nothing amiss as regarded dorothy and did not indeed even mention dorothys name luckily priscilla read the letter in silence for it was an angry letter what is it priscilla why dont you tell me is anything wrong said mrs stanbury  nothing is wrong mammaexcept that my aunt is a silly woman  goodness me what is it  it is a family matter said nora smiling and i will go  what can it be demanded mrs stanbury again as soon as nora had left the room  you shall hear what it can be i will read it you said priscilla it seems to me that of all the women that ever lived my aunt stanbury is the most prejudiced the most unjust and the most given to evil thinking of her neighbours this is what she has thought fit to write to you mamma then priscilla read her aunts letter which was as follows      the close exeter july 31 186     dear sister stanbury     i am informed that the lady who is living with you because    she could not continue to live under the same roof with    her lawful husband has received a visit at your house    from a gentleman who was named as her lover before she    left her own i am given to understand that it was because    of this gentlemans visits to her in london and because    she would not give up seeing him that her husband would    not live with her any longer   but the man has never been here at all said mrs stanbury in dismay  of course he has not been here but let me go on      i have got nothing to do with your visitors continued    the letter and i should not interfere but for the credit    of the family there ought to be somebody to explain to    you that much of the abominable disgrace of the whole    proceeding will rest upon you if you permit such goings    on in your house i suppose it is your house at any rate    you are regarded as the mistress of the establishment and    it is for you to tell the lady that she must go elsewhere    i do hope that you have done so or at least that you    will do so now it is intolerable that the widow of my    brothera clergymanshould harbour a lady who is    separated from her husband and who receives visits from    a gentleman who is reputed to be her lover i wonder    much that your eldest daughter should countenance such a    proceeding     yours truly     jemima stanbury   mrs stanbury when the letter had been read to her held up both her hands in despair dear dear she exclaimed oh dear  she had such pleasure in writing it said priscilla that one ought hardly to begrudge it her the blackest spot in the character of priscilla stanbury was her hatred for her aunt in exeter she knew that her aunt had high qualities and yet she hated her aunt she was well aware that her aunt was regarded as a shining light by very many good people in the county and yet she hated her aunt she could not but acknowledge that her aunt had been generous to her brother and was now very generous to her sister and yet she hated her aunt it was now a triumph to her that her aunt had fallen into so terrible a quagmire and she was by no means disposed to let the sinning old woman easily out of it  it is as pretty a specimen she said as i ever knew of malice and eavesdropping combined  dont use such hard words my dear  look at her words to us said priscilla what business has she to talk to you about the credit of the family and abominable disgrace you have held your head up in poverty while she has been rolling in money  she has been very good to hughand now to dorothy  if i were dorothy i would have none of her goodness she likes some one to trample onsome one of the name to patronise she shant trample on you and me mamma  then there was a discussion as to what should be done or rather a discourse in which priscilla explained what she thought fit to do nothing she decided should be said to mrs trevelyan on the subject but an answer should be sent to aunt stanbury priscilla herself would write this answer and herself would sign it there was some difference of opinion on this point as mrs stanbury thought that if she might be allowed to put her name to it even though priscilla should write it the wording of it would be made in some degree mildto suit her own character but her daughter was imperative and she gave way  it shall be mild enough in words said priscilla and very short  then she wrote her letter as follows      nuncombe putney august 1 186     dear aunt stanbury     you have found a mares nest the gentleman you speak of    has never been here at all and the people who bring you    news have probably hoaxed you i dont think that mamma    has ever disgraced the family and you can have no reason    for thinking that she ever will you should at any rate    be sure of what you are saying before you make such cruel    accusations     yours truly     priscilla stanbury     psanother gentleman did call herenot to see mrs    trevelyan but i suppose mammas house need not be closed    against all visitors   poor dorothy had passed evil hours from the moment in which her aunt had so far certified herself as to colonel osbornes visit to nuncombe as to make her feel it to be incumbent on her to interfere after much consideration miss stanbury had told her niece the dreadful news and had told also what she intended to do dorothy who was in truth horrified at the iniquity of the fact which was related and who never dreamed of doubting the truth of her aunts information hardly knew how to interpose i am sure mamma wont let there be anything wrong she had said  and you dont call this wrong said miss stanbury in a tone of indignation  but perhaps mamma will tell them to go  i hope she will i hope she has but he was allowed to be there for hours and now three days have passed and there is no sign of anything being done he came and went and may come again when he pleases still dorothy pleaded i shall do my duty said miss stanbury  i am quite sure mamma will do nothing wrong said dorothy but the letter was written and sent and the answer to the letter reached the house in the close in due time  when miss stanbury had read and reread the very short reply which her niece had written she became at first pale with dismay and then red with renewed vigour and obstinacy she had made herself as she thought quite certain of her facts before she had acted on her information there was some equivocation some most unworthy deceit in priscillas letter or could it be possible that she herself had been mistaken another gentleman had been therenot however with the object of seeing mrs trevelyan so said priscilla but she had made herself sure that the man in question was a man from london a middleaged man from london who had specially asked for mrs trevelyan and who had at once been known to mrs clegg at the lessboro inn to be mrs trevelyans lover miss stanbury was very unhappy and at last sent for giles hickbody giles hickbody had never pretended to know the name he had seen the man and had described him quite a swell maam and a lononer and one asd be up to anything but not a young un no not just a young un zartainly he was crossexamined again now and said that all he knew about the mans name was that there was a handle to it this was ended by miss stanbury sending him down to lessboro to learn the very name of the gentleman and by his coming back with that of the honourable george glascock written on a piece of paper they says now as he was arter the other young ooman said giles hickbody then was the confusion of miss stanbury complete  it was late when giles returned from lessboro and nothing could be done that night it was too late to write a letter for the next mornings post miss stanbury who was as proud of her own discrimination as she was just and true felt that a day of humiliation had indeed come for her she hated priscilla almost as vigorously as priscilla hated her to priscilla she would not write to own her fault but it was incumbent on her to confess it to mrs stanbury it was incumbent on her also to confess it to dorothy all that night she did not sleep and the next morning she went about abashed wretched hardly mistress of her own maids she must confess it also to martha and martha would be very stern to her martha had poohpoohed the whole story of the lover seeming to think that there could be no reasonable objection to a lover past fifty  dorothy she said at last about noon i have been over hasty about your mother and this man i am sorry for it and mustbegeverybodyspardon  i knew mamma would do nothing wrong said dorothy  to do wrong is human and she i suppose is not more free than others but in this matter i was misinformed i shall write and beg her pardon and now i beg your pardon  not mine aunt stanbury  yes yours and your mothers and the ladys alsofor against her has the fault been most grievous i shall write to your mother and express my contrition she put off the evil hour of writing as long as she could but before dinner the painful letter had been written and carried by herself to the post it was as follows      the close august 3 186     dear sister stanbury     i have now learned that the information was false on which    my former letter was based i am heartily sorry for any    annoyance i may have given you i can only inform you    that my intentions were good and upright nevertheless i    humbly beg your pardon     yours truly     jemima stanbury   mrs stanbury when she received this was inclined to let the matter drop that her sisterinlaw should express such abject contrition was to her such a lowering of the great ones of the earth that the apology conveyed to her more pain than pleasure she could not hinder herself from sympathising with all that her sisterinlaw had felt when she had found herself called upon to humiliate herself but it was not so with priscilla mrs stanbury did not observe that her daughters name was scrupulously avoided in the apology but priscilla observed it she would not let the matter drop without an attempt at the last word she therefore wrote back again as follows      nuncombe putney august 4 186     dear aunt stanbury     i am glad you have satisfied yourself about the gentleman    who has so much disquieted you i do not know that the    whole affair would be worth a moments consideration were    it not that mamma and i living as we do so secluded a    life are peculiarly apt to feel any attack upon our good    namewhich is pretty nearly all that is left to us if    ever there were women who should be free from attack    at any rate from those of their own family we are such    women we never interfere with you or with anybody and i    think you might abstain from harassing us by accusations     pray do not write to mamma in such a strain again unless    you are quite sure of your ground     yours truly     priscilla stanbury   impudent said miss stanbury to martha when she had read the letter illconditioned impudent vixen  she was provoked miss said martha  well yes yesand i suppose it is right that you should tell me of it i dare say it is part of what i ought to bear for being an old fool and too cautious about my own flesh and blood i will bear it there i was wrong and i will say that i have been justly punished therethere  how very much would miss stanburys tone have been changed had she known that at that very moment colonel osborne was eating his breakfast at mrs crockets inn in nuncombe putney     chapter xix  bozzle the expoliceman      illustration  when mr trevelyan had gone through the miserable task of breaking up his establishment in curzon street and had seen all his furniture packed including his books his pictures and his pet italian ornaments it was necessary that he should go and live somewhere he was very wretched at this timeso wretched that life was a burden to him he was a man who loved his wifeto whom his child was very dear and he was one too to whom the ordinary comforts of domestic life were attractive and necessary there are men to whom release from the constraint imposed by family ties will be at any rate for a time felt as a release but he was not such a man there was no delight to him in being able to dine at his club and being free to go whither he pleased in the evening as it was it pleased him to go no whither in the evenings and his mornings were equally blank to him he went so often to mr bideawhile that the poor old lawyer became quite tired of the trevelyan family quarrel even lady milborough with all her power of sympathising began to feel that she would almost prefer on any morning that her dear young friend louis trevelyan should not be announced nevertheless she always saw him when he came and administered comfort according to her light of course he would have his wife back before long that was the only consolation she was able to offer and she offered it so often that he began gradually to feel that something might be done towards bringing about so desirable an event after what had occurred they could not live again in curzon streetnor even in london for awhile but naples was open to them lady milborough said so much to him of the advantages which always came in such circumstances from going to naples that he began to regard such a trip as almost the natural conclusion of his adventure but then there came that very difficult questionwhat step should be first taken lady milborough proposed that he should go boldly down to nuncombe putney and make the arrangement she will only be too glad to jump into your arms said lady milborough trevelyan thought that if he went to nuncombe putney his wife might perhaps jump into his arms but what would come after that how would he stand then in reference to his authority would she own that she had been wrong would she promise to behave better in future he did not believe that she was yet sufficiently broken in spirit to make any such promise and he told himself again and again that it would be absurd in him to allow her to return to him without such subjection after all that he had gone through in defence of his marital rights if he were to write to her a long letter argumentative affectionate exhaustive it might be better he was inclined to believe of himself that he was good at writing long affectionate argumentative and exhaustive letters but he would not do even this as yet he had broken up his house and scattered all his domestic gods to the winds because she had behaved badly to him and the thing done was too important to allow of redress being found so easily  so he lived on a wretched life in london he could hardly endure to show himself at his club fearing that every one would be talking of him as the man who was separated from his wifeperhaps as the man of whose wife colonel osborne was the dear friend no doubt for a day or two there had been much of such conversation but it had died away from the club long before his consciousness had become callous at first he had gone into a lodging in mayfair but this had been but for a day or two after that he had taken a set of furnished chambers in lincolns inn immediately under those in which stanbury lived and thus it came to pass that he and stanbury were very much thrown together as trevelyan would always talk of his wife this was rather a bore but our friend bore with it and would even continue to instruct the world through the columns of the d r while trevelyan was descanting on the peculiar cruelty of his own position  i wish to be just and even generous and i do love her with all my heart he said one afternoon when hugh was very hard at work  it is all very well for gentlemen to call themselves reformers hugh was writing but have these gentlemen ever realised to themselves the meaning of that word we think that they have never done so as long as of course you love her said hugh with his eyes still on the paper still leaning on his pen but finding by the cessation of sound that trevelyan had paused and therefore knowing that it was necessary that he should speak  as much as ever said trevelyan with energy  as long as they follow such a leader in such a cause into whichever lobby he may choose to take them exactly soexactly said stanbury just as much as ever  you are not listening to a word said trevelyan  i havent missed a single expression you have used said stanbury but a fellow has to do two things at a time when hes on the daily press  i beg your pardon for interrupting you said trevelyan angrily getting up taking his hat and stalking off to the house of lady milborough in this way he became rather a bore to his friends he could not divest his mind of the injury which had accrued to him from his wifes conduct nor could he help talking of the grief with which his mind was laden and he was troubled with sore suspicions which as far as they concerned his wife had certainly not been merited it had seemed to him that she had persisted in her intimacy with colonel osborne in a manner that was not compatible with that wifelike indifference which he regarded as her duty why had she written to him and received letters from him when her husband had plainly told her that any such communication was objectionable she had done so and as far as trevelyan could remember her words had plainly declared that she would continue to do so he had sent her away into the most remote retirement he could find for her but the post was open to her he had heard much of mrs stanbury and of priscilla from his friend hugh and thoroughly believed that his wife was in respectable hands but what was to prevent colonel osborne from going after her if he chose to do so and if he did so choose mrs stanbury could not prevent their meeting he was racked with jealousy and yet he did not cease to declare to himself that he knew his wife too well to believe that she would sin he could not rid himself of his jealousy but he tried with all his might to make the man whom he hated the object of it rather than the woman whom he loved  he hated colonel osborne with all his heart it was a regret to him that the days of duelling were over so that he could not shoot the man and yet had duelling been possible to him colonel osborne had done nothing that would have justified him in calling his enemy out or would even have enabled him to do so with any chance of inducing his enemy to fight circumstances he thought were cruel to him beyond compare in that he should have been made to suffer so great torment without having any of the satisfaction of revenge even lady milborough with all her horror as to the colonel could not tell him that the colonel was amenable to any punishment he was advised that he must take his wife away and live at naples because of this manthat he must banish himself entirely if he chose to repossess himself of his wife and childand yet nothing could be done to the unprincipled rascal by whom all his wrongs and sufferings were occasioned thinking it very possible that colonel osborne would follow his wife he had a watch set upon the colonel he had found a retired policemana most discreet man as he was assuredwho for a consideration undertook the management of interesting jobs of this kind the man was one bozzle who had not lived without a certain reputation in the police courts in these days of his madness therefore he took mr bozzle into his pay and after a while he got a letter from bozzle with the exeter postmark colonel osborne had left london with a ticket for lessboro bozzle also had taken a place by the same train for that small town the letter was written in the railway carriage and as bozzle explained would be posted by him as he passed through exeter a further communication should be made by the next days post in a letter which mr bozzle proposed to address to z a postoffice waterloo place  on receiving this first letter trevelyan was in an agony of doubt as well as misery what should he do should he go to lady milborough or to stanbury or should he at once follow colonel osborne and mr bozzle to lessboro it ended in his resolving at last to wait for the letter which was to be addressed to z a but he spent an interval of horrible suspense and of insane rage let the laws say what they might he would have the mans blood if he found that the man had even attempted to wrong him then at last the second letter reached him colonel osborne and mr bozzle had each of them spent the day in the neighbourhood of lessboro not exactly in each others company but very near to each other the colonel had ordered a gig on the day after his arrival at lessboro for the village of cockchaffington and for all mr bozzle knew the colonel had gone to cockchaffington mr bozzle was ultimately inclined to think that the colonel had really spent his day in going to cockchaffington mr bozzle himself knowing the wiles of such men as colonel osborne and thinking at first that that journey to cockchaffington might only be a deep ruse had walked over to nuncombe putney there he had had a pint of beer and some bread and cheese at mrs crockets house and had asked various questions to which he did not receive very satisfactory answers but he inspected the clock house very minutely and came to a decided opinion as to the point at which it would be attacked if burglary were the object of the assailants and he observed the iron gates and the steps and the shape of the trees and the old pigeonhouselooking fabric in which the clock used to be placed there was no knowing when information might be wanted or what information might not be of use but he made himself tolerably sure that colonel osborne did not visit nuncombe putney on that day and then he walked back to lessboro having done this he applied himself to the little memorandum book in which he kept the records of these interesting duties and entered a claim against his employer for a conveyance to nuncombe putney and back including driver and ostler and then he wrote his letter after that he had a hot supper with three glasses of brandy and water and went to bed with a thorough conviction that he had earned his bread on that day  the letter to z a did not give all these particulars but it did explain that colonel osborne had gone off apparently to cockchaffington and that hebozzlehad himself visited nuncombe putney the hawk hasnt been nigh the dovecot as yet said mr bozzle in his letter meaning to be both mysterious and facetious  it would be difficult to say whether the wit or the mystery disgusted trevelyan the most he had felt that he was defiling himself with dirt when he first went to mr bozzle he knew that he was having recourse to means that were base and lowwhich could not be other than base or low let the circumstances be what they might but mr bozzles conversation had not been quite so bad as mr bozzles letters as it may have been that mr bozzles successful activity was more insupportable than his futile attempts but nevertheless something must be done it could not be that colonel osborne should have gone down to the close neighbourhood of nuncombe putney without the intention of seeing the lady whom his obtrusive pertinacity had driven to that seclusion it was terrible to trevelyan that colonel osborne should be there and not the less terrible because such a one as mr bozzle was watching the colonel on his behalf should he go to nuncombe putney himself and if so when he got to nuncombe putney what should he do there at last in his suspense and his grief he resolved that he would tell the whole to hugh stanbury  do you mean said hugh that you have put a policeman on his track  the man was a policeman once  what we call a private detective i cant say i think you were right  but you see that it was necessary said trevelyan  i cant say that it was necessary to speak out i cant understand that a wife should be worth watching who requires watching  is a man to do nothing then and even now it is not my wife whom i doubt  as for colonel osborne if he chooses to go to lessboro why shouldnt he nothing that you can do or that bozzle can do can prevent him he has a perfect right to go to lessboro  but he has not a right to go to my wife  and if your wife refuses to see him or having seen himfor a man may force his way in anywhere with a little troubleif she sends him away with a flea in his ear as i believe she would  she is so frightfully indiscreet  i dont see what bozzle can do  he has found out at any rate that osborne is there said trevelyan i am not more fond of dealing with such fellows than you are yourself but i think it is my duty to know what is going on what ought i to do now  i should do nothingexcept dismiss bozzle  you know that that is nonsense stanbury  whatever i did i should dismiss bozzle stanbury was now quite in earnest and as he repeated his suggestion for the dismissal of the policeman pushed his writing things away from him if you ask my opinion you know i must tell you what i think i should get rid of bozzle as a beginning if you will only think of it how can your wife come back to you if she learns that you have set a detective to watch her  but i havent set the man to watch her  colonel osborne is nothing to you except as he is concerned with her this man is now down in her neighbourhood and if she learns that how can she help feeling it as a deep insult of course the man watches her as a cat watches a mouse  but what am i to do i cant write to the man and tell him to come away osborne is down there and i must do something will you go down to nuncombe putney yourself and let me know the truth  after much debating of the subject hugh stanbury said that he would himself go down to nuncombe putney alone there were difficulties about the d r but he would go to the office of the newspaper and overcome them how far the presence of nora rowley at his mothers house may have assisted in bringing him to undertake the journey perhaps need not be accurately stated he acknowledged to himself that the claims of friendship were strong upon him and that as he had loudly disapproved of the bozzle arrangement he ought to lend a hand to some other scheme of action moreover having professed his conviction that no improper visiting could possibly take place under his mothers roof he felt bound to shew that he was not afraid to trust to that conviction himself he declared that he would be ready to proceed to nuncombe putney tomorrowbut only on condition that he might have plenary power to dismiss bozzle  there can be no reason why you should take any notice of the man said trevelyan  how can i help noticing him when i find him prowling about the place of course i shall know who he is  i dont see that you need know anything about him  my dear trevelyan you cannot have two ambassadors engaged in the same service without communication with each other and any communication with mr bozzle except that of sending him back to london i will not have the controversy was ended by the writing of a letter from trevelyan to bozzle which was confided to stanbury in which the expoliceman was thanked for his activity and requested to return to london for the present as we are now aware that colonel osborne is in the neighbourhood said the letter my friend mr stanbury will know what to do  as soon as this was settled stanbury went to the office of the d r and made arrangement as to his work for three days jones could do the article on the irish church upon a pinch like this although he had not given much study to the subject as yet and puddlethwaite who was great in city matters would try his hand on the present state of society in rome a subject on which it was essential that the d r should express itself at once having settled these little troubles stanbury returned to his friend and in the evening they dined together at a tavern  and now trevelyan let me know fairly what it is that you wish said stanbury  i wish to have my wife back again  simply that if she will agree to come back you will make no difficulty  no not quite simply that i shall desire that she shall be guided by my wishes as to any intimacies she may form  that is all very well but is she to give any undertaking do you intend to exact any promise from her it is my opinion that she will be willing enough to come back and that when she is with you there will be no further cause for quarrelling but i dont think she will bind herself by any exacted promise and certainly not through a third person  then say nothing about it let her write a letter to me proposing to comeand she shall come  very well so far i understand and now what about colonel osborne you dont want me to quarrel with him i suppose  i should like to keep that for myself said trevelyan grimly  if you will take my advice you will not trouble yourself about him said stanbury but as far as i am concerned i am not to meddle or make with him of course continued stanbury after a pause if i find that he is intruding himself in my mothers house i shall tell him that he must not come there  but if you find him installed in your mothers house as a visitorhow then  i do not regard that as possible  i dont mean living there said trevelyan but coming backwards and forwardsgoing on in habits of intimacy withwith his voice trembled so as he asked these questions that he could not pronounce the word which was to complete them  with mrs trevelyan you mean  yes with my wife i dont say that it is so but it may be so you will be bound to tell me the truth  i will certainly tell you the truth  and the whole truth  yes the whole truth  should it be so i will never see her againnever and as for himbut never mind then there was another short period of silence during which stanbury smoked his pipe and sipped his whisky toddy you must see continued trevelyan that it is absolutely necessary that i should do something it is all very well for you to say that you do not like detectives neither do i like them but what was i to do when you condemn me you hardly realise the difficulties of my position  it is the deuce of a nuisance certainly said stanbury through the cloud of smokethinking now not at all of mrs trevelyan but of mrs trevelyans sister  it makes a man almost feel that he had better not marry at all said trevelyan  i dont see that of course there may come troubles the tiles may fall on your head you know as you walk through the streets as far as i can see women go straight enough nineteen times out of twenty but they dont like beingwhat i call looked after  and did i look after my wife more than i ought  i dont mean that but if i were marriedwhich i never shall be for i shall never attain to the respectability of a fixed incomei fancy i shouldnt look after my wife at all it seems to me that women hate to be told about their duties  but if you saw your wife quite innocently falling into an improper intimacytaking up with people she ought not to knowdoing that in ignorance which could not but compromise yourselfwouldnt you speak a word then  oh i might just say in an offhand way that jones was a rascal or a liar or a fool or anything of that sort but i would never caution her against jones by george i believe a woman can stand anything better than that  you have never tried it my friend  and i dont suppose i ever shall as for me i believe aunt stanbury was right when she said that i was a radical vagabond i dare say i shall never try the thing myself and therefore its very easy to have a theory but i must be off good night old fellow ill do the best i can and at any rate ill let you know the truth  there had been a question during the day as to whether stanbury should let his sister know by letter that he was expected but it had been decided that he should appear at nuncombe without any previous notification of his arrival trevelyan had thought that this was very necessary and when stanbury had urged that such a measure seemed to imply suspicion he had declared that in no other way could the truth be obtained he trevelyan simply wanted to know the facts as they were occurring it was a fact that colonel osborne was down in the neighbourhood of nuncombe putney that at least had been ascertained it might very possibly be the case that he would be refused admittance to the clock housethat all the ladies there would combine to keep him out butso trevelyan urgedthe truth on this point was desired it was essentially necessary to his happiness that he should know what was being done  your mother and sister said he cannot be afraid of your coming suddenly among them  stanbury so urged had found it necessary to yield but yet he had felt that he himself was almost acting like a detective policeman in purposely falling down upon them without a word of announcement had chance circumstances made it necessary that he should go in such a manner he would have thought nothing of it it would simply have been a pleasant joke to him  as he went down by the train on the following day he almost felt ashamed of the part which he had been called upon to perform     chapter xx  shewing how colonel osborne went to cockchaffington   together with miss stanburys first letter to her sisterinlaw a letter had also been delivered to mrs trevelyan nora rowley as her sister had left the room with this in her hand had expressed her opinion that it had come from trevelyan but it had in truth been written by colonel osborne and when that second letter from miss stanbury had been received at the clock housethat in which she in plain terms begged pardon for the accusation conveyed in her first lettercolonel osborne had started on his deceitful little journey to cockchaffington and mr bozzle the expoliceman who had him in hand had already asked his way to nuncombe putney  when colonel osborne learned that louis trevelyan had broken up his establishment in curzon street and had sent his wife away into a barbarous retirement in dartmoorfor such was the nature of the information on the subject which was spread among trevelyans friends in londonand when he was made aware also that all this was done on his accountbecause he was so closely intimate with trevelyans wife and because trevelyans wife was and persisted in continuing to be so closely intimate with himhis vanity was gratified although it might be trueand no doubt was truethat he said much to his friends and to himself of the deep sorrow which he felt that such a trouble should befall his old friend and his old friends daughter nevertheless as he curled his grey whiskers before the glass and made the most of such remnant of hair as was left on the top of his head as he looked to the padding of his coat and completed a study of the wrinkles beneath his eyes so that in conversation they might be as little apparent as possible he felt more of pleasure than of pain in regard to the whole affair it was very sad that it should be so but it was human had it been in his power to set the whole matter right by a word he would probably have spoken that word but as this was not possible as trevelyan had in his opinion made a gross fool of himself as emily trevelyan was very nice and not the less nice in that she certainly was fond of himself as great tyranny had been used towards her and as he himself had still the plea of old family friendship to protect his conscienceto protect his conscience unless he went so far as to make that plea an additional sting to his consciencehe thought that as a man he must follow up the matter here was a young and fashionable and very pretty woman banished to the wilds of dartmoor for his sake and as far as he could understand she would not have been so banished had she consented to say that she would give up her acquaintance with him in such circumstances as these was it possible that he should do nothing various ideas ran through his head he began to think that if trevelyan were out of the way he mightmight perhaps be almost tempted to make this woman his wife she was so nice that he almost thought that he might be rash enough for that although he knew well the satisfaction of being a bachelor but as the thought suggested itself to him he was well aware that he was thinking of a thing quite distant from him the reader is not to suppose that colonel osborne meditated any makingaway with the husband our colonel was certainly not the man for a murder nor did he even think of running away with his friends daughter though he told himself that he could dispose of his wrinkles satisfactorily still he knew himself and his powers sufficiently to be aware that he was no longer fit to be the hero of such a romance as that he acknowledged to himself that there was much labour to be gone through in running away with another mans wife and that the results in respect to personal comfort are not always happy but what if mrs trevelyan were to divorce herself from her husband on the score of her husbands cruelty various horrors were related as to the mans treatment of his wife by some it was said that she was in the prison on dartmooror if not actually in the prison an arrangement which the prison discipline might perhaps make difficultthat she was in the custody of one of the prison warders who possessed a prim cottage and a grim wife just outside the prison walls colonel osborne did not himself believe even so much as this but he did believe that mrs trevelyan had been banished to some inhospitable region to some dreary comfortless abode of which as the wife of a man of fortune she would have great ground to complain so thinking he did not probably declare to himself that a divorce should be obtained and that in such event he would marry the ladybut ideas came across his mind in that direction trevelyan was a cruel bluebeard emilyas he was studious to call mrs trevelyanwas a dear injured saint and as for himself though he acknowledged to himself that the lumbago pinched him now and again so that he could not rise from his chair with all the alacrity of youth yet when he walked along pall mall with his coat properly buttoned he could not but observe that a great many young women looked at him with admiring eyes  it was thus with no settled scheme that the colonel went to work and made inquiries and ascertained mrs trevelyans address in devonshire when he learned it he thought that he had done much though in truth there had been no secrecy in the matter scores of people knew mrs trevelyans address besides the newsvendor who supplied her paper from whose boy colonel osbornes servant obtained the information but when the information had been obtained it was expedient that it should be used and therefore colonel osborne wrote the following letter      acrobats club july 31 186     dear emily   twice the colonel wrote dearest emily and twice he tore the sheet on which the words were written he longed to be ardent but still it was so necessary to be prudent he was not quite sure of the lady women sometimes tell their husbands even when they have quarrelled with them and although ardent expressions in writing to pretty women are pleasant to male writers it is not pleasant for a gentleman to be asked what on earth he means by that sort of thing at his time of life the colonel gave half an hour to the consideration and then began the letter dear emily if prudence be the soul of valour may it not be considered also the very mainspring or perhaps the pivot of love      dear emily     i need hardly tell you with what dismay i have heard of    all that has taken place in curzon street i fear that you    must have suffered much and that you are suffering now    it is an inexpressible relief to me to hear that you have    your child with you and nora but nevertheless to    have your home taken away from you to be sent out of    london to be banished from all society and for what    the manner in which the minds of some men work is quite    incomprehensible     as for myself i feel that i have lost the company of    a friend whom indeed i can very ill spare i have a    thousand things to say to you and among them one or    two which i feel that i must saythat i ought to say    as it happens an old schoolfellow of mine is vicar of    cockchaffington a village which i find by the map is    very near to nuncombe putney i saw him in town last    spring and he then asked me to pay him a visit there is    something in his church which people go to see and though    i dont understand churches much i shall go and see it    i shall run down on wednesday and shall sleep at the inn    at lessboro i see that lessboro is a market town and    i suppose there is an inn i shall go over to my friend on    the thursday but shall return to lessboro though a man    be ever so eager to see a church doorway he need not    sleep at the parsonage on the following day i will get    over to nuncombe putney and i hope that you will see me    considering my long friendship with you and my great    attachment to your father and mother i do not think    that the strictest martinet would tell you that you need    hesitate in the matter     i have seen mr trevelyan twice at the club but he has    not spoken to me under such circumstances i could not of    course speak to him indeed i may say that my feelings    towards him just at present are of such a nature as    to preclude me from doing so with any appearance of    cordiality     dear emily    believe me now as always your affectionate friend     frederic osborne   when he read that letter over to himself a second time he felt quite sure that he had not committed himself even if his friend were to send the letter to her husband it could not do him any harm he was aware that he might have dilated more on the old friendship between himself and sir marmaduke but he experienced a certain distaste to the mention of things appertaining to years long past it did not quite suit him in his present frame of mind to speak of his regard in those quasipaternal terms which he would have used had it satisfied him to represent himself simply as her fathers friend his language therefore had been a little doubtful so that the lady might if she were so minded look upon him in that tender light in which her husband had certainly chosen to regard him  when the letter was handed to mrs trevelyan she at once took it with her up to her own room so that she might be alone when she read it the handwriting was quite familiar to her and she did not choose that even her sister should see it she had told herself twenty times over that while living at nuncombe putney she was not living under the guardianship of mrs stanbury she would consent to live under the guardianship of no one as her husband did not choose to remain with her and protect her she had done no wrong and she would submit to no other authority than that of her legal lord and master nor according to her views of her own position was it in his power to depute that authority to others he had caused the separation and now she must be the sole judge of her own actions in itself a correspondence between her and her fathers old friend was in no degree criminal or even faulty there was no reason moral social or religious why an old man over fifty who had known her all her life should not write to her but yet she could not say aloud before mrs stanbury and priscilla and her sister that she had received a letter from colonel osborne she felt that the colour had come to her cheek and that she could not even walk out of the room as though the letter had been a matter of indifference to her  and would it have been a matter of indifference had there been nobody there to see her mrs trevelyan was certainly not in love with colonel osborne she was not more so now than she had been when her fathers friend purposely dressed for the occasion had kissed her in the vestry of the church in which she was married and had given her a blessing which was then intended to be semipaternalas from an old man to a young woman she was not in love with himnever would be never could be in love with him reader you may believe in her so far as that but where is the woman who when she is neglected thrown over and suspected by the man that she loves will not feel the desire of some sympathy some solicitude some show of regard from another man this womans life too had not hitherto been of such a nature that the tranquillity of the clock house at nuncombe putney afforded to her all that she desired she had been there now a month and was almost sick from the want of excitement and she was full of wrath against her husband why had he sent her there to break her heart in a disgraceful retirement when she had never wronged him from morning to night she had no employment no amusement nothing to satisfy her cravings why was she to be doomed to such an existence she had declared that as long as she could have her boy with her she would be happy she was allowed to have her boy but she was anything but happy when she received colonel osbornes letterwhile she held it in her hand still unopened she never for a moment thought that that could make her happy but there was in it something of excitement and she painted the man to herself in brighter colours now than she had ever given to him in her former portraits he cared for her he was gracious to her he appreciated her talents her beauty and her conduct he knew that she deserved a treatment very different from that accorded to her by her husband why should she reject the sympathy of her fathers oldest friend because her husband was madly jealous about an old man her husband had chosen to send her away and to leave her so that she must act on her own judgment acting on her own judgment she read colonel osbornes letter from first to last she knew that he was wrong to speak of coming to nuncombe putney but yet she thought that she would see him she had a dim perception that she was standing on the edge of a precipice on broken ground which might fall under her without a moments warning and yet she would not retreat from the danger though colonel osborne was wrong very wrong in coming to see her yet she liked him for coming though she would be half afraid to tell her news to mrs stanbury and more than half afraid to tell priscilla yet she liked the excitement of the fear nora would scold her but noras scolding she thought she could answer and then it was not the fact that colonel osborne was coming down to devonshire to see her he was coming as far as lessboro to see his friend at cockchaffington and when at lessboro was it likely that he should leave the neighbourhood without seeing the daughter of his old ally and why should he do so was he to be unnatural in his conduct uncivil and unfriendly because mr trevelyan had been foolish suspicious and insane  so arguing with herself she answered colonel osbornes letter before she had spoken on the subject to any one in the houseand this was her answer      my dear colonel osborne     i must leave it to your own judgment to decide whether you    will come to nuncombe putney or not there are reasons    which would seem to make it expedient that you should stay    awayeven though circumstances are bringing you into    the immediate neighbourhood but of these reasons i will    leave you to be the judge i will never let it be said    that i myself have had cause to dread the visit of any old    friend nevertheless if you stay away i shall understand    why you do so     personally i shall be glad to see youas i have always    been it seems odd to me that i cannot write in warmer    tones to my fathers and mothers oldest friend of    course you will understand that though i shall readily    see you if you call i cannot ask you to stay in the    first place i am not now living in my own house i am    staying with mrs stanbury and the place is called the    clock house     yours very sincerely     emily trevelyan     the clock house nuncombe putney monday   soon after she had written it nora came into her room and at once asked concerning the letter which she had seen delivered to her sister that morning  it was from colonel osborne said mrs trevelyan  from colonel osborne how very wrong  i dont see that it is wrong at all because louis is foolish and mad that cannot make another man wrong for doing the most ordinary thing in the world  i had hoped it had been from louis said nora  oh dear no he is by no means so considerate i do not suppose i shall hear from him till he chooses to give some fresh order about myself or my child he will hardly trouble himself to write to me unless he takes up some new freak to show me that he is my master  and what does colonel osborne say  he is coming here  coming here almost shouted nora  yes absolutely here does it sound to you as if lucifer himself were about to show his face the fact is he happens to have a friend in the neighbourhood whom he has long promised to visit and as he must be at lessboro he does not choose to go away without the compliment of a call it will be as much to you as to me  i dont want to see him in the least said nora  there is his letter as you seem to be so suspicious you had better read it  then nora read it  and there is a copy of my answer said mrs trevelyan i shall keep both because i know so well what illnatured things people will say  dear emily do not send it said nora  indeed i shall i will not be frightened by bugbears and i will not be driven to confess to any man on earth that i am afraid to see him why should i be afraid of colonel osborne i will not submit to acknowledge that there can be any danger in colonel osborne were i to do so i should be repeating the insult against myself if my husband wished to guide me in such matters why did he not stay with me  then she went out into the village and posted the letter nora meanwhile was thinking whether she would call in the assistance of priscilla stanbury but she did not like to take any such a step in opposition to her sister     chapter xxi  shewing how colonel osborne went to nuncombe putney   colonel osborne was expected at nuncombe putney on the friday and it was thursday evening before either mrs stanbury or priscilla was told of his coming emily had argued the matter with nora declaring that she would make the communication herself and that she would make it when she pleased and how she pleased if mrs stanbury thinks said she that i am going to be treated as a prisoner or that i will not judge myself as to whom i may see or whom i may not see she is very much mistaken nora felt that were she to give information to those ladies in opposition to her sisters wishes she would express suspicion on her own part by doing so and she was silent on that same thursday priscilla had written her last defiant letter to her auntthat letter in which she had cautioned her aunt to make no further accusations without being sure of her facts to priscillas imagination that coming of lucifer in person of which mrs trevelyan had spoken would hardly have been worse than the coming of colonel osborne when therefore mrs trevelyan declared the fact on the thursday evening vainly endeavouring to speak of the threatened visit in an ordinary voice and as of an ordinary circumstance it was as though a thunderbolt had fallen upon them  colonel osborne coming here said priscilla mindful of the stanbury correspondencemindful of the evil tongues of the world  and why not demanded mrs trevelyan who had heard nothing of the stanbury correspondence  oh dear oh dear ejaculated mrs stanbury who of course was aware of all that had passed between the clock house and the house in the close though the letters had been written by her daughter  nora was determined to stand up for her sister whatever might be the circumstances of the case i wish colonel osborne were not coming said she because it makes a foolish fuss but i cannot understand how anybody can suppose it to be wrong that emily should see papas very oldest friend in the world  but why is he coming demanded priscilla  because he wants to see an acquaintance at cockchaffington said mrs trevelyan and there is a wonderful churchdoor there  a churchfiddlestick said priscilla  the matter was debated throughout all the evening at one time there was a great quarrel between the ladies and then there was a reconciliation the point on which mrs trevelyan stood with the greatest firmness was thisthat it did not become her as a married woman whose conduct had always been good and who was more careful as to that than she was even of her name to be ashamed to meet any man why should i not see colonel osborne or colonel anybody else who might call here with the same justification for calling which his old friendship gives him priscilla endeavoured to explain to her that her husbands known wishes ought to hinder her from doing so my husband should have remained with me to express his wishes mrs trevelyan replied  neither could mrs stanbury nor could priscilla bring herself to say that the man should not be admitted into the house in the course of the debate in the heat of her anger mrs trevelyan declared that were any such threat held out to her she would leave the house and see colonel osborne in the street or at the inn  no emily no said nora  but i will i will not submit to be treated as a guilty woman or as a prisoner they may say what they like but i wont be shut up  no one has tried to shut you up said priscilla  you are afraid of that old woman at exeter said mrs trevelyan for by this time the facts of the stanbury correspondence had all been elicited in general conversation and yet you know how uncharitable and malicious she is  we are not afraid of her said priscilla we are afraid of nothing but of doing wrong  and will it be wrong to let an old gentleman come into the house said nora who is nearly sixty and who has known us ever since we were born  if he is nearly sixty priscilla said mrs stanbury that does seem to make a difference mrs stanbury herself was only just sixty and she felt herself to be quite an old woman  they may be devils at eighty said priscilla  colonel osborne is not a devil at all said nora  but mamma is so foolish said priscilla the mans age does not matter in the least  i beg your pardon my dear said mrs stanbury very humbly  at that time the quarrel was raging but afterwards came the reconciliation had it not been for the stanbury correspondence the fact of colonel osbornes threatened visit would have been admitted as a thing necessaryas a disagreeable necessity but how was the visit to be admitted and passed over in the teeth of that correspondence priscilla felt very keenly the peculiar cruelty of her position of course aunt stanbury would hear of the visit indeed any secrecy in the matter was not compatible with priscillas ideas of honesty her aunt had apologised humbly for having said that colonel osborne had been at nuncombe that apology doubtless had been due colonel osborne had not been at nuncombe when the accusation had been made and the accusation had been unjust and false but his coming had been spoken of by priscilla in her own letters as an occurrence which was quite out of the question her anger against her aunt had been for saying that the man had come not for objecting to such a visit and now the man was coming and aunt stanbury would know all about it how great how terrible how crushing would be aunt stanburys triumph  i must write and tell her said priscilla  i am sure i shall not object said mrs trevelyan  and hugh must be told said mrs stanbury  you may tell all the world if you like said mrs trevelyan  in this way it was settled among them that colonel osborne was to be received on the next morning friday morning colonel osborne doubtless having heard something of mrs crocket from his friend at cockchaffington was up early and had himself driven over to nuncombe putney before breakfast the everwatchful bozzle was of course at his heelsor rather not at his heels on the first two miles of the journey for bozzle with painful zeal had made himself aware of all the facts and had started on the nuncombe putney road half an hour before the colonels fly was in motion and when the fly passed him he was lying discreetly hidden behind an old oak the driver however had caught a glimpse of him as he was topping a hill and having seen him about on the previous day and perceiving that he was dressed in a decent coat and trousers and that nevertheless he was not a gentleman began to suspect that he wassomebody there was a great deal said afterwards about bozzle in mrs cleggs yard at lessboro but the lessboro mind was never able to satisfy itself altogether respecting bozzle and his mission as to colonel osborne and his mission the lessboro mind did satisfy itself with much certainty the horse was hardly taken from out of colonel osbornes fly in mrs crockets yard when bozzle stepped into the village by a path which he had already discovered and soon busied himself among the tombs in the churchyard now one corner of the churchyard was immediately opposite to the iron gate leading into the clock house drat un said the woodenlegged postman still sitting on his donkey to mrs crockets ostler if there beant the chap as was here yesterday when i was a starting and i zeed un in lezbro street thick very morning he beant arter no good that un said the ostler after that a close watch was kept upon the watcher      illustration the woodenlegged postman of nuncombe putney   in the meantime colonel osborne had ordered his breakfast at the stag and antlers and had asked questions as to the position of the clock house he was altogether ignorant of mr bozzle although mr bozzle had been on his track now for two days and two nights he had determined as he came on to nuncombe putney that he would not be shamefaced about his visit to mrs trevelyan it is possible that he was not so keen in the matter as he had been when he planned his journey in london and it may be that he really tried to make himself believe that he had come all the way to the confines of dartmoor to see the porch of cockchaffington church the session in london was over and it was necessary for such a man as colonel osborne that he should do something with himself before he went down to the scotch grouse he had long desired to see something of the most picturesque county in england and now as he sat eating his breakfast in mrs crockets parlour he almost looked upon his dear emily as a subsidiary attraction oh thats the clock house he said to mrs crocket no i have not the pleasure of knowing mrs stanbury very respectable lady so i have heard widow of a clergyman ah yes son up in london i know himalways writing books is he very clever i dare say but theres a ladyindeed two ladieswhom i do know mrs trevelyan is there i thinkand miss rowley  you beant muster trevelyan be you said mrs crocket looking at him very hard  no im not mr trevelyan  nor yet the colonel they doo be talking about  well yes i am a colonel i dont know why anybody should talk about me ill just step out now however and see my friends  its madams lover said mrs crocket to herself as sure as eggs is eggs as she said so colonel osborne boldly walked across the village and pulled the bell at the iron gate while bozzle crouching among the tombs saw the handle in his hand there he is said priscilla everybody in the clock house had known that the fly which they had seen had brought the colonel into nuncombe putney everybody had known that he had breakfasted at the stag and antlers and everybody now knew that he was at the gate ringing the bell into the drawingroom said mrs stanbury with a fearful tremulous whisper to the girl who went across the little garden in front to open the iron gate the girl felt as though apollyon were there and as though she were called upon to admit apollyon mrs stanbury having uttered her whisper hurried away upstairs priscilla held her ground in the parlour determined to be near the scene of action if there might be need and it must be acknowledged that she peeped from behind the curtain anxious to catch a glimpse of the terrible man whose coming to nuncombe putney she regarded as so severe a misfortune  the plan of the campaign had all been arranged mrs trevelyan and nora together received colonel osborne in the drawingroom it was understood that nora was to remain there during the whole visit it is horrible to think that such a precaution should be necessary mrs trevelyan had said but perhaps it may be best there is no knowing what the malice of people may not invent  my dear girls said the colonel i am delighted to see you and he gave a hand to each  we are not very cheerful here said mrs trevelyan as you may imagine  but the scenery is beautiful said nora and the people we are living with are kind and nice  i am very glad of that said the colonel then there was a pause and it seemed for a moment or two that none of them knew how to begin a general conversation colonel osborne was quite sure by this time that he had come down to devonshire with the express object of seeing the door of the church at cockchaffington and mrs trevelyan was beginning to think that he certainly had not come to see her have you heard from your father since you have been here asked the colonel  then there was an explanation about sir marmaduke and lady rowley mr trevelyans name was not mentioned but mrs trevelyan stated that she had explained to her mother all the painful circumstances of her present life sir marmaduke as colonel osborne was aware was expected to be in england in the spring and lady rowley would of course come with him nora thought that they might probably now come before that time but mrs trevelyan declared that it was out of the question that they should do so she was sure that her father could not leave the islands except when he did so in obedience to official orders the expense of doing so would be ruinous to him and what good would he do in this way there was a great deal of family conversation in which colonel osborne was able to take a part but not a word was said about mr trevelyan  nor did the colonel find an opportunity of expressing a spark of that sentiment for the purpose of expressing which he had made this journey to devonshire it is not pleasant to make love in the presence of a third person even when that love is all fair and above board but it is quite impracticable to do so to a married lady when that married ladys sister is present no more futile visit than this of colonel osbornes to the clock house was ever made and yet though not a word was spoken to which mr trevelyan himself could have taken the slightest exception the visit futile as it was could not but do an enormous deal of harm mrs crocket had already guessed that the fine gentleman down from london was the lover of the married lady at the clock house who was separated from her husband the woodenlegged postman and the ostler were not long in connecting the man among the tombstones with the visitor to the house trevelyan as we are aware already knew that colonel osborne was in the neighbourhood and poor priscilla stanbury was now exposed to the terrible necessity of owning the truth to her aunt the colonel when he had sat an hour with his young friends took his leave and as he walked back to mrs crockets and ordered that his fly might be got ready for him his mind was heavy with the disagreeable feeling that he had made an ass of himself the whole affair had been a failure and though he might be able to pass off the porch at cockchaffington among his friends he could not but be aware himself that he had spent his time his trouble and his money for nothing he became aware as he returned to lessboro that had he intended to make any pleasant use whatever of his position in reference to mrs trevelyan the tone of his letter and his whole mode of proceeding should have been less patriarchal and he should have contrived a meeting without the presence of nora rowley  as soon as he had left them mrs trevelyan went to her own room and nora at once rejoined priscilla  is he gone asked priscilla  oh yeshe has gone  what would i have given that he had never come  and yet said nora what harm has he done i wish he had not come because of course people will talk but nothing was more natural than that he should come over to see us when he was so near us  nora  what do you mean  you dont believe all that in the neighbourhood i believe he came on purpose to see your sister and i think that it was a dastardly and most ungentlemanlike thing to do  i am quite sure you are wrong thenaltogether wrong said nora  very well we must have our own opinions i am glad you can be so charitable but he should not have come hereto this house even though imperative business had brought him into the very village but men in their vanity never think of the injury they may do to a womans name now i must go and write to my aunt i am not going to have it said hereafter that i deceived her and then i shall write to hugh oh dear oh dear  i am afraid we are a great trouble to you  i will not deceive you because i like you this is a great trouble to me i have meant to be so prudent and with all my prudence i have not been able to keep clear of rocks and i have been so indignant with aunt stanbury now i must go and eat humblepie  then she eat humblepieafter the following fashion      dear aunt stanbury     after what has passed between us i think it right to tell    you that colonel osborne has been at nuncombe putney and    that he called at the clock house this morning we did not    see him but mrs trevelyan and miss rowley together did    see him he remained here perhaps an hour     i should not have thought it necessary to mention this to    you the matter being one in which you are not concerned    were it not for our former correspondence when i last    wrote i had no idea that he was comingnor had mamma    and when you first wrote he was not even expected by    mrs trevelyan the man you wrote about was another    gentlemanas i told you before all this is most    disagreeable and tiresomeand would be quite    nonsensical but that circumstances seem to make it    necessary     as for colonel osborne i wish he had not been here but    his coming would do no harmonly that it will be talked    about     i think you will understand how it is that i feel myself    constrained to write to you i do hope that you will spare    mamma who is disturbed and harassed when she gets angry    letters if you have anything to say to myself i dont    mind it     yours truly     priscilla stanbury     the clock house friday august 5   she wrote also to her brother hugh but hugh himself reached nuncombe putney before the letter reached him  mr bozzle watched the colonel out of the house and watched him out of the village when the colonel was fairly started mr bozzle walked back to lessboro     chapter xxii  shewing how miss stanbury behaved to her two nieces      illustration  the triumph of miss stanbury when she received her nieces letter was certainly very greatso great that in its first flush she could not restrain herself from exhibiting it to dorothy wellwellwhat do you think dolly  about what aunt i dont know who the letter is from  nobody writes to me now so constant as your sister priscilla the letter is from priscilla colonel osborne has been at the clock house after all i knew that he would be there i knew it i knew it  dorothy when she heard this was dumbfounded she had rested her defence of her mother and sister on the impossibility of any such visit being admitted according to her lights the coming of colonel osborne after all that had been said would be like the coming of lucifer himself the colonel was to her imagination a horrible roaring lion she had no idea that the erratic manoeuvres of such a beast might be milder and more innocent than the wooing of any turtledove she would have asked whether the roaring lion had gone away again and if so whether he had taken his prey with him were it not that she was too much frightened at the moment to ask any question that her mother and sister should have been wilfully concerned in such iniquity was quite incredible to her but yet she did not know how to defend them but are you quite sure of it aunt stanbury may there not be another mistake  no mistake this time i think my dear any way priscilla says that he is there now in this there was a mistake priscilla had said nothing of the kind  you dont mean that he is staying at the clock house aunt stanbury  i dont know where he is now im not his keeper and im glad to say im not the ladys keeper either ah me its a bad business you cant touch pitch and not be defiled my dear if your mother wanted the clock house i would sooner have taken it for her myself than that all this should have happenedfor the familys sake  but miss stanbury when she was alone and when she had read her nieces three letters again and again began to understand something of priscillas honesty and began also to perceive that there might have been a great difficulty respecting the colonel for which neither her niece nor her sisterinlaw could fairly be held to be responsible it was perhaps the plainest characteristic of all the stanburys that they were never wilfully dishonest ignorant prejudiced and passionate they might be in her anger miss stanbury of exeter could be almost malicious and her niece at nuncombe putney was very like her aunt each could say most cruel things most unjust things when actuated by a mistaken consciousness of perfect right on her own side but neither of them could lieeven by silence let an error be brought home to either of themso as to be acknowledged at homeand the error would be assuredly confessed aloud and indeed with differences in the shades hugh and dorothy were of the same nature they were possessed of sweeter tempers than their aunt and sister but they were filled with the same eager readiness to believe themselves to be rightand to own themselves to others to be wrong when they had been constrained to make such confession to themselves the chances of life and something probably of inner nature had made dorothy mild and obedient whereas in regard to hugh the circumstances of his life and disposition had made him obstinate and selfreliant but in all was to be found the same belief in selfwhich amounted almost to conceitthe same warmth of affection and the same love of justice  when miss stanbury had again perused the correspondence and had come to see dimly how things had gone at nuncombe putneywhen the conviction came upon her mind that priscilla had entertained a horror as to the coming of this colonel equal to that which she herself had feltwhen her imagination painted to her all that her niece had suffered her heart was softened somewhat she had declared to dorothy that pitch if touched would certainly defile and she had at first intended to send the same opinion couched in very forcible words to her correspondents at the clock house they should not continue to go astray for want of being told that they were going astray it must be acknowledged too that there was a certain amount of ignoble wrath in the bosom of miss stanbury because her sisterinlaw had taken the clock house she had never been told and had not even condescended to ask dorothy whether the house was taken and paid for by her nephew on behalf of his mother or whether it was paid for by mr trevelyan on behalf of his wife in the latter case mrs stanbury would she thought be little more than an upper servant or keeperas she expressed it to herself such an arrangement appeared to her to be quite disgraceful in a stanbury but yet she believed that such must be the existing arrangement as she could not bring herself to conceive that hugh stanbury could keep such an establishment over his mothers head out of money earned by writing for a penny newspaper there would be a triumph of democracy in this which would vanquish her altogether she had therefore been anxious enough to trample on priscilla and upon all the affairs of the clock house but yet she had been unable to ignore the nobility of priscillas truth and having acknowledged it to herself she found herself compelled to acknowledge it aloud she sat down to think in silence and it was not till she had fortified herself by her first draught of beer and till she had finished her first portion of bread and cheese that she spoke i have written to your sister herself this time she said i dont know that i ever wrote a line to her before in my life  poor priscilla dorothy did not mean to be severe on her aunt either in regard to the letters which had not been written or to the one letter which now had been written but dorothy pitied her sister whom she felt to be in trouble  well i dont know about her being so poor priscilla ill be bound thinks as well of herself as any of us do  shed cut her fingers off before shed mean to do wrong said dorothy  but what does that come to whats the good of that it isnt meaning to do right that will save us for aught i know the radicals may mean to do right mr beales means to do rightperhaps  but auntif everybody did the best they could  tush my dear you are getting beyond your depth there are such things still thank god as spiritual pastors and masters entrust yourself to them do what they think right now if aught were known in exeter of miss stanbury this was knownthat if any clergyman volunteered to give to her unasked and uninvited counsel either ghostly or bodily that clergyman would be sent from her presence with a wigging which he would not soon forget the thing had been tried more than once and the wigging had been complete there was no more attentive listener in church than miss stanbury and she would now and again appeal to a clergyman on some knotty point but for the ordinary authority of spiritual pastors and masters she shewed more of abstract reverence than of practical obedience  im sure priscilla does the best she can said dorothy going back to the old subject  ahwellyes what i want to say about priscilla is this it is a thousand pities she is so obstinate so pigheaded so certain that she can manage everything for herself better than anybody else can for her miss stanbury was striving to say something good of her niece but found the task to be difficult and distasteful to her  she has managed for mamma ever so many years and since she took it we have hardly ever been in debt said dorothy  shell do all that i dont doubt i dont suppose she cares much for ribbons and false hair for herself  who priscilla the idea of priscilla with false hair  i dare say noti dare say not i do not think shed spend her mothers money on things of that kind  aunt stanbury you dont know her  ah very well perhaps i dont but come my dear you are very hard upon me and very anxious to take your sisters part and what is it all about ive just written to her as civil a letter as one woman ever wrote to another and if i had chosen i could havecould havehmm miss stanbury as she hesitated for words in which to complete her sentence revelled in the strength of the vituperation which she could have poured upon her nieces head had she chosen to write her last letter about colonel osborne in her severe strain  if you have written kindly to her i am so much obliged to you said dorothy  the truth is priscilla has meant to be right meaning wont go for much when the account is taken unless the meaning comes from a proper source but the poor girl has done as well as she has known how i believe it is hughs fault more than anybody elses this accusation was not pleasant to dorothy but she was too intent just now on priscillas case to defend her brother that man never ought to have been there and that woman never ought to have been there there cannot be a doubt about that if priscilla were sitting there opposite to me she would own as much i am sure she would miss stanbury was quite right if she meant to assert that priscilla had owned as much to herself and because i think so i am willing to forgive her part in the matter to me personally she has always been rudemost uncourteousandandand unlike a younger woman to an older one and an aunt and all that i suppose it is because she hates me  oh no aunt stanbury  my dear i suppose it is why else should she treat me in such a way but i do believe of her that she would rather eat an honest dry crust than dishonest cake and ale  she would rather starve than pick up a crumb that was dishonest said dorothy fairly bursting out into tears  i believe it i do believe it there what more can i say clock house indeed what matter what house you live in so that you can pay the rent of it honestly  but the rent is paidhonestly said dorothy amidst her sobs  its paid i dont doubt i dare say the womans husband and your brother see to that among them oh that my boy hugh as he used to be should have brought us all to this but theres no knowing what they wont do among them reform indeed murder sacrilege adultery treason atheismthats what reform means besides every kind of nastiness under the sun in which latter category miss stanbury intended especially to include bad printers ink and paper made of straw  the reader may as well see the letter which was as civil a letter as ever one woman wrote to another so that the collection of the stanbury correspondence may be made perfect      the close august 6 186     my dear niece     your letter has not astonished me nearly as much as you    expected it would i am an older woman than you and    though you will not believe it i have seen more of the    world i knew that the gentleman would come after the    lady such gentlemen always do go after their ladies    as for yourself i can see all that you have done and    pretty nearly hear all that you have said as plain as a    pikestaff i do you the credit of believing that the plan    is none of your making i know who made the plan and a    very bad plan it is     as to my former letters and the other man i understand    all about it you were very angry that i should accuse you    of having this man at the house and you were right to be    angry i respect you for having been angry but what does    all that say as to his comingnow that he has come     if you will consent to take an old womans advice get rid    of the whole boiling of them i say it in firm love and    friendship for i am     your affectionate aunt     jemima stanbury   the special vaunted courtesy of this letter consisted no doubt in the expression of respect which it contained and in that declaration of affection with which it terminated the epithet was one which miss stanbury would by no means use promiscuously in writing to her nearest relatives she had not intended to use it when she commenced her letter to priscilla but the respect of which she had spoken had glowed and had warmed itself into something of temporary love and feeling at the moment that she was an affectionate aunt miss stanbury had so put herself down in her letter having done such a deed she felt that dorothy though dorothy knew nothing about it ought in her gratitude to listen patiently to anything that she might now choose to say against priscilla  but dorothy was in truth very miserable and in her misery wrote a long letter that afternoon to her motherwhich however it will not be necessary to place entire among the stanbury recordsbegging that she might be informed as to the true circumstances of the case she did not say a word of censure in regard either to her mother or sister but she expressed an opinion in the mildest words which she could use that if anything had happened which had compromised their names since their residence at the clock house she dorothy had better go home and join them the meaning of which was that it would not become her to remain in the house in the close if the house in the close would be disgraced by her presence poor dorothy had taught herself to think that the iniquity of roaring lions spread itself very widely  in the afternoon she made some such proposition to her aunt in ambiguous terms go home said miss stanbury now  if you think it best aunt stanbury  and put yourself in the middle of all this iniquity and abomination i dont suppose you want to know the woman  no indeed  or the man  oh aunt stanbury  its my belief that no decent gentleman in exeter would look at you again if you were to go and live among them at nuncombe putney while all this is going on no no let one of you be saved out of it at least  aunt stanbury had more than once made use of expressions which brought the faintest touch of gentle pink up to her nieces cheeks we must do dorothy the justice of saying that she had never dreamed of being looked at by any gentleman whether decent or indecent her life at nuncombe putney had been of such a nature that though she knew that other girls were looked at and even made love to and that they got married and had children no dim vision of such a career for herself had ever presented itself to her eyes she had known very well that her mother and sister and herself were people apartladies and yet so extremely poor that they could only maintain their rank by the most rigid seclusion to live and work unseen was what the world had ordained for her then her call to exeter had come upon her and she had conceived that she was henceforth to be the humble companion of a very imperious old aunt her aunt indeed was imperious but did not seem to require humility in her companion all the good things that were eaten and drunk were divided between them with the strictest impartiality dorothys cushion and hassock in the church and in the cathedral were the same as her aunts her bedroom was made very comfortable for her her aunt never gave her any orders before company and always spoke of her before the servants as one whom they were to obey and respect gradually dorothy came to understand the meaning of thisbut her aunt would sometimes say things about young men which she did not quite understand could it be that her aunt supposed that any young man would come and wish to marry herher dorothy stanbury she herself had not quite so strong an aversion to men in general as that which priscilla felt but she had not as yet found that any of those whom she had seen at exeter were peculiarly agreeable to her before she went to bed that night her aunt said a word to her which startled her more than she had ever been startled before on that evening miss stanbury had a few friends to drink tea with her there were mr and mrs crumbie and mrs machugh of course and the cheritons from alphington and the miss apjohns from helion villa and old mr powel all the way from haldon and two of the wrights from their house in the northernhay and mr gibsonbut the miss frenches from heavitree were not there why dont you have the miss frenches aunt dorothy had asked  bother the miss frenches im not bound to have them every time theres camilla has been and got herself a bandbox on the back of her head a great deal bigger than the place inside where her brains ought to be but the bandbox at the back of camilla frenchs head was not the sole cause of the omission of the two sisters from the list of miss stanburys visitors on this occasion  the party went off very much as usual there were two whist tables for miss stanbury could not bear to cut out at other houses than her own when there was cutting out it was quite understood that miss stanbury was to be allowed to keep her place ill go away and sit out there by myself if you like she would say but she was never thus banished and at her own house she usually contrived that there should be no system of banishment she would play dummy whist preferring it to the fourhanded game and when hard driven and with a meet opponent would not even despise doubledummy it was told of her and of mrs machugh that they had played doubledummy for a whole evening together and they who were given to calumny had declared that the candles on that evening had been lighted very early on the present occasion a great many sixpenny points were scored and much tea and cake were consumed mr gibson never played whistnor did dorothy that young john wright and mary cheriton should do nothing but talk to each other was a thing of course as they were to be married in a month or two then there was ida cheriton who could not very well be left at home and mr gibson made himself pleasant to dorothy and ida cheriton instead of making himself pleasant to the two miss frenches gentlemen in provincial towns quite understand that from the nature of social circumstances in the provinces they should always be ready to be pleasant at least to a pair at a time at a few minutes before twelve they were all gone and then came the shock  dolly my dear what do you think of mr gibson  think of him aunt stanbury  yes think of himthink of him i suppose you know how to think  he seems to me always to preach very drawling sermons  oh bother his sermons i dont care anything about his sermons now he is a very good clergyman and the dean thinks very much about him  i am glad of that aunt stanbury  then came the shock dont you think it would be a very good thing if you were to become mrs gibson  it may be presumed that miss stanbury had assured herself that she could not make progress with dorothy by beating about the bush there was an inaptitude in her niece to comprehend the advantages of the situations which made some direct explanation absolutely necessary dorothy stood halfsmiling halfcrying when she heard the proposition her cheeks suffused with that pink colour and with both her hands extended with surprise  ive been thinking about it ever since youve been here said miss stanbury  i think he likes miss french said dorothy in a whisper  which of them i dont believe he likes them at all maybe if they go on long enough they may be able to toss up for him but i dont think it of him of course theyre after him but hell be too wise for them and hes more of a fool than i take him to be if he dont prefer you to them dorothy remained quite silent to such an address as this it was impossible that she should reply a word it was incredible to her that any man should prefer herself to either of the young women in question but she was too much confounded for the expression even of her humility at any rate youre wholesome and pleasant and modest said miss stanbury  dorothy did not quite like being told that she was wholesome but nevertheless she was thankful to her aunt  ill tell you what it is continued miss stanbury i hate all mysteries especially with those i love ive saved two thousand pounds which ive put you down for in my will now if you and he can make it up together ill give you the money at once theres no knowing how often an old woman may alter her will but when youve got a thing youve got it mr gibson would know the meaning of a bird in the hand as well as anybody now those girls at heavitree will never have above a few hundreds each and not that while their mother lives dorothy made one little attempt at squeezing her aunts hand wishing to thank her aunt for this affectionate generosity but she had hardly accomplished the squeeze when she desisted feeling strangely averse to any acknowledgment of such a boon as that which had been offered to her and now good night my dear if i did not think you a very sensible young woman i should not trust you by saying all this then they parted and dorothy soon found herself alone in her bedroom  to have a husband of her own a perfect gentleman too and a clergymanand to go to him with a fortune she believed that two thousand pounds represented nearly a hundred a year it was a large fortune in those partsaccording to her understanding of ladies fortunes and that she the humblest of the humble should be selected for so honourable a position she had never quite known quite understood as yet whether she had made good her footing in her aunts house in a manner pleasant to her aunt more than once or twice she had spoken even of going back to her mother and things had been said which had almost made her think that her aunt had been angry with her but now after a month or two of joint residence her aunt was offering to hertwo thousand pounds and a husband  but was it within her aunts power to offer to her the husband mr gibson had always been very civil to her she had spoken more to mr gibson than to any other man in exeter but it had never occurred to her for a moment that mr gibson had any special liking for her was it probable that he would ever entertain any feeling of that kind for her it certainly had occurred to her before now that mr gibson was sometimes bored by the miss frenchesbut then gentlemen do get bored by ladies  and at last she asked herself another questionhad she any special liking for mr gibson as far as she understood such matters everything was blank there thinking of that other question she went to sleep     chapter xxiii  colonel osborne and mr bozzle return to london   hugh stanbury went down on the saturday by the early express to exeter on his road to lessboro he took his ticket through to lessboro not purposing to stay at exeter but from the exigencies of the various trains it was necessary that he should remain for half an hour at the exeter station this took place on the saturday and colonel osbornes visit to the clock house had been made on the friday colonel osborne had returned to lessboro had slept again at mrs cleggs house and returned to london on the saturday it so happened that he also was obliged to spend half an hour at the exeter station and that his halfhour and hugh stanburys halfhour were one and the same they met therefore as a matter of course upon the platform stanbury was the first to see the other and he found that he must determine on the spur of the moment what he would say and what he would do he had received no direct commission from trevelyan as to his meeting with colonel osborne trevelyan had declared that as to the matter of quarrelling he meant to retain the privilege of doing that for himself but stanbury had quite understood that this was only the vague expression of an angry man the colonel had taken a glass of sherry and had lighted a cigar and was quite comfortablehaving thrown aside for a time that consciousness of the futility of his journey which had perplexed himwhen stanbury accosted him  what mr stanburyhow do you do fine day isnt it are you going up or down  im going to see my own people at nuncombe putney a village beyond lessboro said hugh  ahindeed colonel osborne of course perceived at once that as this man was going to the house at which he had just been visiting it would be better that he should himself explain what he had done if he were to allow this mention of nuncombe putney to pass without saying that he himself had been there he would be convicted of at least some purpose of secrecy in what he had been doing very strange said he i was at nuncombe putney myself yesterday  i know you were said stanbury  and how did you know it there had been a tone of anger in stanburys voice which colonel osborne had at once appreciated and which made him assume a similar tone as they spoke there was a man standing in a corner close by the bookstall with his eye upon them and that man was bozzle the expolicemanwho was doing his duty with sedulous activity by seeing the colonel back to london now bozzle did not know hugh stanbury and was angry with himself that he should be so ignorant it is the pride of a detective expoliceman to know everybody that comes in his way  well i had been so informed my friend trevelyan knew that you were thereor that you were going there  i dont care who knew that i was going there said the colonel  i wont pretend to understand how that may be colonel osborne but i think you must be aware after what took place in curzon street that it would have been better that you should not have attempted to see mrs trevelyan whether you have seen her i do not know  what business is it of yours mr stanbury whether i have seen that lady or not  unhappily for me her husband has made it my business  very unhappily for you i should say  and the lady is staying at my mothers house  i presume the lady is not a prisoner in your mothers house and that your mothers hospitality is not so restricted but that her guest may see an old friend under her roof this colonel osborne said with an assumed look of almost righteous indignation which was not at all lost upon bozzle they had returned back towards the bookstall and bozzle with his eyes fixed on a copy of the d r which he had just bought was straining his ears to the utmost to catch what was being said  you best know whether you have seen her or not  i have seen her  then i shall take leave to tell you colonel osborne that you have acted in a most unfriendly way and have done that which must tend to keep an affectionate husband apart from his wife  sir i dont at all understand this kind of thing addressed to me the father of the lady you are speaking of has been my most intimate friend for thirty years after all the colonel was a mean man when he could take pride in his youth and defend himself on the score of his age in one and the same proceeding  i have nothing further to say replied stanbury  you have said too much already mr stanbury  i think not colonel osborne you have i fear done an incredible deal of mischief by going to nuncombe putney and after all that you have heard on the subject you must have known that it would be mischievous i cannot understand how you can force yourself about a mans wife against the mans expressed wish  sir i didnt force myself upon anybody sir i went down to see an old friendand a remarkable piece of antiquity and when another old friend was in the neighbourhood close byone of the oldest friends i have in the worldwasnt i to go and see her god bless my soul what business is it of yours i never heard such impudence in my life let the charitable reader suppose that colonel osborne did not know that he was lyingthat he really thought when he spoke that he had gone down to lessboro to see the remarkable piece of antiquity  good morning said hugh stanbury turning on his heels and walking away colonel osborne shook himself inflated his cheeks and blew forth the breath out of his mouth put his thumbs up to the armholes of his waistcoat and walked about the platform as though he thought it to be incumbent on him to show that he was somebodysomebody that ought not to be insultedsomebody perhaps whom a very pretty woman might prefer to her own husband in spite of a small difference in age he was angry but not quite so much angry as proud and he was safe too he thought that he was safe when he should come to account for himself and his actions to his old friend sir marmaduke he felt that he would be able to show that he had been in all respects true to friendship sir marmaduke had unfortunately given his daughter to a jealous disagreeable fellow and the fault all lay in that as for hugh stanburyhe would simply despise hugh stanbury and have done with it  mr bozzle though he had worked hard in the cause had heard but a word or two eavesdroppers seldom do hear more than that a porter had already told him who was hugh stanburythat he was mr hugh stanbury and that his aunt lived at exeter and bozzle knowing that the lady about whom he was concerned was living with a mrs stanbury at the house he had been watching put two and two together with his natural cleverness god bless my soul what business is it of yours those words were nearly all that bozzle had been able to hear but even those sufficiently indicated a quarrel the lady was living with mrs stanbury having been so placed by her husband and young stanbury was taking the ladys part bozzle began to fear that the husband had not confided in him with that perfect faith which he felt to be essentially necessary to the adequate performance of the duties of his great profession a sudden thought however struck him something might be done on the journey up to london he at once made his way back to the ticketwindow and exchanged his ticketsecondclass for firstclass it was a noble deed the expense falling all upon his own pocket for in the natural course of things he would have charged his employers with the full firstclass fare he had seen colonel osborne seat himself in a carriage and within two minutes he was occupying the opposite place the colonel was aware that he had noticed the mans face lately but did not know where  very fine summer weather sir said bozzle  very fine said the colonel burying himself behind a newspaper  they is getting up their wheat nicely in these parts sir  the answer to this was no more than a grunt but bozzle was not offended not to be offended is the special duty of all policemen in and out of office and the journey from exeter to london was long and was all before him  a very nice little secluded village is nuncombe putney said bozzle as the train was leaving the salisbury station  at salisbury two ladies had left the carriage no one else had got in and bozzle was alone with the colonel  i dare say said the colonel who by this time had relinquished his shield and who had begun to compose himself for sleep or to pretend to compose himself as soon as he heard bozzles voice he had been looking at bozzle and though he had not discovered the mans trade had told himself that his companion was a thing of dangersa thing to be avoided by one engaged as had been he himself on a special and secret mission  saw you therecalling at the clock house said bozzle  very likely said the colonel throwing his head well back into the corner shutting his eyes and uttering a slight preliminary snore  very nice family of ladies at the clock house said bozzle the colonel answered him by a more developed snore particularly mrs t said bozzle  the colonel could not stand this he was so closely implicated with mrs trevelyan at the present moment that he could not omit to notice an address so made to him what the devil is that to you sir said he jumping up and confronting bozzle in his wrath  but policemen have always this advantage in their difficulties that they know to a fraction what the wrath of men is worth and what it can do sometimes it can dismiss a policeman and sometimes break his head sometimes it can give him a long and troublesome job and sometimes it may be wrath to the death but in nineteen out of twenty cases it is not a fearful thing and the policeman knows well when he need not fear it on the present occasion bozzle was not at all afraid of colonel osbornes wrath  well sir not much indeed if you come to that only you was there sir  of course i was there said the colonel  and a very nice young gentleman is mr stanbury said bozzle  to this colonel osborne made no reply but again had resort to his newspaper in the most formal manner  hes going down to his family no doubt continued bozzle  he may be going to the devil for what i know said the colonel who could not restrain himself  i suppose theyre all friends of mrs ts asked bozzle  sir said the colonel i believe that youre a spy  no colonel no no no im no spy i wouldnt demean myself to be such a spy is a man as has no profession and nothing to justify his looking into things things must be looked into colonel or hows a man to know where he is or hows a lady to know where she is but as for spies except in the way of evidence i dont think nothing of em soon after this two more passengers entered the train and nothing more was said between bozzle and the colonel  the colonel as soon as he reached london went home to his lodgings and then to his club and did his best to enjoy himself on the following monday he intended to start for scotland but he could not quite enjoy himselfbecause of bozzle he felt that he was being watched and there is nothing that any man hates so much as that especially when a lady is concerned colonel osborne knew that his visit to nuncombe putney had been very innocent but he did not like the feeling that even his innocence had been made the subject of observation  bozzle went away at once to trevelyan whom he found at his chambers he himself had had no very deeplaid scheme in his addresses to colonel osborne he had begun to think that very little would come of the affairespecially after hugh stanbury had appeared upon the sceneand had felt that there was nothing to be lost by presenting himself before the eyes of the colonel it was necessary that he should make a report to his employer and the report might be made a little more full after a few words with the man whom he had been looking into well mr trewillian he said seating himself on a chair close against the wall and holding his hat between the kneesive seen the parties and know pretty much all about it  all i want to know mr bozzle is whether colonel osborne has been at the clock house  he has been there mr trewillian there is no earthly doubt about that from hour to hour i can tell you pretty nearly where hes been since he left london then bozzle took out his memorandumbook  i dont care about all that said trevelyan  i dare say not sir but it may be wanted all the same any gentleman acting in our way cant be too particularcant have too many facts the smallest littletiddly thingsand bozzle as he said this seemed to enjoy immensely the flavour of his own epithetthe smallest little tiddly things do so often turn up trumps when you get your evidence into court  im not going to get any evidence into court  maybe not sir a gentleman and lady is always best out of court as long as things can hang on any waybut sometimes things wont hang on no way  trevelyan who was conscious that the employment of bozzle was discreditable and whose affairs in devonshire were now in the hands of at any rate a more honourable ally was at present mainly anxious to get rid of the expoliceman i have no doubt youve been very careful mr bozzle said he  there isnt no one in the business could be more so mr trewillian  and you have found out what it was necessary that i should know colonel osborne did go to the clock house  was let in at the front door on friday the 5th by sarah french the housemaid at 1037 am and was let out again by the same young woman at 1141 am perhaps youd like to have a copy of the entry mr trewillian  no no no  it doesnt matter of course itll be with me when its wanted who was with him exactly at that time i cant say there is things mr trewillian one cant see but i dont think as he saw neither mrs stanbury nor miss stanburynot to speak to i did just have one word promiscuous with sarah french after he was gone whether the other young lady was with em or not and if so for how long icantsay there is things mr trewillian which one cant see  how trevelyan hated the man as he went on with his odious detailsdetails not one of which possessed the slightest importance its all right i dare say mr bozzle and now about the account  quite so mr trewillian but there was one questionjust one question  what question said trevelyan almost angrily  and theres another thing i must tell you too mr trewillian i come back to town in the same carriage with the colonel i thought it better  you did not tell him who you were  no mr trewillian i didnt tell him that i dont think hed say if you was to ask him that i told him much of anything no mr trewillian i didnt tell him nothing i dont often tell folks much till the time comes but i thought it better and i did have a word or two with the gentjust a word or two hes not so very downy isnt the colonelfor one thats been at it so long mr trewillian  i dare say not but if you could just let me have the account mr bozzle  the account oh yesthat is necessary aint it these sort of inquiries do come a little expensive mr trewillian because time goes for so much and when one has to be down on a thing sharp you know and sure so that counsel on the other side cant part you from it though he shakes you like a dog does a ratand one has to get oneself up ready for all that you know mr trewillianas i was saying one cant count ones shillings when one has such a job as this in hand clench your nailthats what i say be it even so clench your nailthats what youve got to do  i dare say we shant quarrel about the money mr bozzle  oh dear no i find i never has any words about the money but theres that one question theres a young mr stanbury has gone down as knows all about it whats he up to  hes my particular friend said trevelyan  ohh he do know all about it then  we neednt talk about that if you please mr bozzle  because there was words between him and the colonel upon the platformand very angry words the young man went at the colonel quite openmouthedsavagelike its not the way such things should be done mr trewillian and though of course its not for me to speakshes your ladystill when you has got a thing of this kind in hand one head is better than a dozen as for myself mr trewillian i never wouldnt look at a casenot if i knew itunless i was to have it all to myself but of course there was no bargain and so i says nothing  after considerable delay the bill was made out on the spot mr bozzle copying down the figures painfully from his memorandumbook with his head much inclined on one side trevelyan asked him almost in despair to name the one sum but this bozzle declined to do saying that right was right he had a scale of pilfering of his own to which he had easily reconciled his conscience and beyond that he prided himself on the honesty of his accounts at last the bill was made out was paid and bozzle was gone trevelyan when he was alone threw himself back on a sofa and almost wept in despair to what a depth of degradation had he not been reduced     chapter xxiv  niddon park   as hugh stanbury went over to lessboro and from thence to nuncombe putney he thought more of himself and nora rowley than he did of mr and mrs trevelyan as to mrs trevelyan and colonel osborne he felt that he knew everything that it was necessary that he should know the man had been there and had seen mrs trevelyan of that there could be no doubt that colonel osborne had been wickedly indifferent to the evil consequences of such a visit and that all the women concerned had been most foolish in permitting him to make it was his present conviction but he did not for a moment doubt that the visit had in itself been of all things the most innocent trevelyan had sworn that if his wife received the man at nuncombe putney he would never see her again she had seen him and this oath would be remembered and there would be increased difficulties but these difficulties whatever they might be must be overcome when he had told himself this then he allowed his mind to settle itself on nora rowley  hitherto he had known miss rowley only as a fashionable girl living with the wife of an intimate friend of his own in london he had never been staying in the same house with her circumstances had never given to him the opportunity of assuming the manner of an intimate friend justifying him in giving advice and authorising him to assume that semipaternal tone which is by far the easiest preliminary to lovemaking when a man can tell a young lady what she ought to read what she ought to do and whom she ought to know nothing can be easier than to assure her that of all her duties her first duty is to prefer himself to all the world and any young lady who has consented to receive lessons from such a teacher will generally be willing to receive this special lesson among others but stanbury had hitherto had no such opportunities in london miss rowley had been a fashionable young lady living in mayfair and he had beenwell anything but a fashionable young man nevertheless he had seen her often had sat by her very frequently was quite sure that he loved her dearly and had perhaps some selfflattering idea in his mind that had he stuck to his honourable profession as a barrister and were he possessed of some comfortable little fortune of his own he might perhaps have been able after due siege operations to make this charming young woman his own things were quite changed now for the present miss rowley certainly could not be regarded as a fashionable london young lady the house in which he would see her was in some sort his own he would be sleeping under the same roof with her and would have all the advantages which such a position could give him he would have no difficulty now in asking if he should choose to ask and he thought that she might be somewhat softer somewhat more likely to yield at nuncombe putney than she would have been in london she was at nuncombe in weak circumstances to a certain degree friendless with none of the excitement of society around her with no elder sons buzzing about her and filling her mind if not her heart with the glories of luxurious primogeniture hugh stanbury certainly did not dream that any special elder son had as yet been so attracted as to have made a journey to nuncombe putney on noras behalf but should he on this accountbecause she would be as it were without means of defence from his attackshould he therefore take advantage of her weakness she would of course go back to her london life after some short absence and would again if free have her chance among the favoured ones of the earth what had he to offer to her he had taken the clock house for his mother and it would be quite as much as he could do when mrs trevelyan should have left the village to keep up that establishment and maintain himself in londonquite as much as he could do even though the favours of the d r should flow upon him with their fullest tides in such circumstances would it be honourable in him to ask a girl to love him because he found her defenceless in his mothers house  if there baint another for nuncombe said mrs cleggs ostler to mrs cleggs boots as stanbury was driven off in a gig  that be young stanbury agoing of whome  they be all agoing for the clock house since the old ooman took to thick there house there be folk acomin and agoin every day loike  its along of the madam that they keeps there dick said the boots  i didnt care if thered be madams allays theyre the best as is going for trade anyhow said the ostler what the ostler said was true when there comes to be a feeling that a womans character is in any way tarnished there comes another feeling that everybody on the one side may charge double and that everybody on the other side must pay double for everything hugh stanbury could not understand why he was charged a shilling a mile instead of ninepence for the gig to nuncombe putney he got no satisfactory answer and had to pay the shilling the truth was that gigs to nuncombe putney had gone up since a lady separated from her husband with a colonel running after her had been taken in at the clock house  heres hugh said priscilla hurrying to the front door and mrs stanbury hurried after her her son hugh was the apple of her eye the best son that ever lived generous noble a thorough manalmost a god  dear dear oh dear whod have expected it god bless you my boy why didnt you write priscilla what is there in the house that he can eat  plenty of bread and cheese said priscilla laughing with her hand inside her brothers arm for though priscilla hated all other men she did not hate her brother hugh if you wanted things nice to eat directly you got here you ought to have written  i shall want my dinner like any other christianin due time said hugh and how is mrs trevelyanand how is miss rowley  he soon found himself in company with those two ladies and experienced some immediate difficulty in explaining the cause of his sudden coming but this was soon put aside by mrs trevelyan  when did you see my husband she asked  i saw him yesterday he was quite well  colonel osborne has been here she said  i know that he has been here i met him at the station at exeter perhaps i should not say so but i wish he had remained away  we all wish it said priscilla  then nora spoke but what could we do mr stanbury it seemed so natural that he should call when he was in the neighbourhood we have known him so long and how could we refuse to see him  i will not let any one think that im afraid to see any man on earth said mrs trevelyan if he had ever in his life said a word that he should not have said a word that would have been an insult of course it would have been different but the notion of it is preposterous why should i not have seen him  i think he was wrong to come said hugh  of course he was wrongwickedly wrong said priscilla  stanbury finding that the subject was openly discussed between them declared plainly the mission that had brought him to nuncombe trevelyan heard that he was coming and asked me to let him know the truth  now you can tell him the truth said mrs trevelyan with something of indignation in her tone as though she thought that stanbury had taken upon himself a task of which he ought to be ashamed  but colonel osborne came specially to pay a visit to cockchaffington said nora and not to see us louis ought to know that  nora how can you demean yourself to care about such trash said mrs trevelyan who cares why he came here his visit to me was a thing of course if mr trevelyan disapproves of it let him say so and not send secret messengers  am i a secret messenger said hugh stanbury  there has been a man here inquiring of the servants said priscilla so that odious bozzle had made his foul mission known to them stanbury however thought it best to say nothing of bozzlenot to acknowledge that he had ever heard of bozzle i am sure mrs trevelyan does not mean you said priscilla  i do not know what i mean said mrs trevelyan i am so harassed and fevered by these suspicions that i am driven nearly mad then she left the room for a minute and returned with two letters there mr stanbury i got that note from colonel osborne and wrote to him that reply you know all about it now can you say that i was wrong to see him  i am sure that he was wrong to come said hugh  wickedly wrong said priscilla again  you can keep the letters and show them to my husband said mrs trevelyan then he will know all about it but stanbury declined to keep the letters  he was to remain the sunday at nuncombe putney and return to london on the monday there was therefore but one day on which he could say what he had to say to nora rowley when he came down to breakfast on the sunday morning he had almost made up his mind that he had nothing to say to her as for nora she was in a state of mind much less near to any fixed purpose she had told herself that she loved this manhad indeed done so in the clearest way by acknowledging the fact of her love to another suitor by pleading to that other suitor the fact of her love as an insuperable reason why he should be rejected there was no longer any doubt about it to her when priscilla had declared that hugh stanbury was at the door her heart had gone into her mouth involuntarily she had pressed her hands to her sides and had held her breath why had he come there had he come there for her oh if he had come there for her and if she might dare to forget all the future how sweetsweetest of all things in heaven or earthmight be an august evening with him among the lanes but she too had endeavoured to be very prudent she had told herself that she was quite unfit to be the wife of a poor manthat she would be only a burden round his neck and not an aid to him and in so telling herself she had told herself also that she had been a fool not to accept mr glascock she should have dragged out from her heart the image of this man who had never even whispered a word of love in her ears and should have constrained herself to receive with affection a man in loving whom there ought to be no difficulty but when she had been repeating those lessons to herself hugh stanbury had not been in the house now he was thereand what must be her answer if he should whisper that word of love she had an idea that it would be treason in her to disown the love she felt if questioned concerning her heart by the man to whom it had been given  they all went to church on the sunday morning and up to that time nora had not been a moment alone with the man it had been decided that they should dine early and then ramble out when the evening would be less hot than the day had been to a spot called niddon park this was nearly three miles from nuncombe and was a beautiful wild slope of ground full of ancient blighted blasted but still halfliving oaksoaks that still brought forth leavesoverlooking a bend of the river teign park in the usual sense of the word there was none nor did they who lived round nuncombe putney know whether niddon park had ever been enclosed but of all the spots in that lovely neighbourhood priscilla stanbury swore that it was the loveliest and as it had never yet been seen by mrs trevelyan or her sister it was determined that they would walk there on this august afternoon there were four of themand as was natural they fell into parties of two and two but priscilla walked with nora and hugh stanbury walked with his friends wife nora was talkative but demure in her manner and speaking now and again as though she were giving words and not thoughts she felt that there was something to hide and was suffering from disappointment that their party should not have been otherwise divided had hugh spoken to her and asked her to be his wife she could not have accepted him because she knew that they were both poor and that she was not fit to keep a poor mans house she had declared to herself most plainly that that must be her coursebut yet she was disappointed and talked on with the knowledge that she had something to conceal      illustration niddon park   when they were seated beneath an old riven withered oak looking down upon the river they were still divided in the same way in seating herself she had been very anxious not to disarrange that arrangementalmost equally anxious not to seem to adhere to it with any special purpose she was very careful that there should be nothing seen in her manner that was in any way specialbut in the meantime she was suffering an agony of trouble he did not care for her in the least she was becoming sure of that she had given all her love to a man who had none to give her in return as she thought of this she almost longed for the offer of that which she knew she could not have accepted had it been offered to her but she talked on about the scenery about the weatherdescanting on the pleasure of living where such loveliness was within reach then there came a pause for a moment nora said priscilla i do not know what you are thinking about but it is not of the beauty of niddon park then there came a faint sound as of an hysterical sob and then a gurgle in the throat and then a pretence at laughter  i dont believe i am thinking of anything at all said nora  after which hugh insisted on descending to the bank of the river but as the necessity of reclimbing the slope was quite manifest none of the girls would go with him come miss rowley said he will you not show them that a lady can go up and down a hill as well as a man  i had rather not go up and down the hill said she  then he understood that she was angry with him and in some sort surmised the cause of her anger not that he believed that she loved him but it seemed possible to him that she resented the absence of his attention he went down and scrambled out on the rocks into the bed of the river while the girls above looked down upon him watching the leaps that he made priscilla and mrs trevelyan called to him bidding him beware but nora called not at all he was whistling as he made his jumps but still he heard their voices and knew that he did not hear noras voice he poised himself on the edge of a rock in the middle of the stream and looked up the river and down the river turning himself carefully on his narrow foothold but he was thinking only of nora could there be anything nobler than to struggle on with her if she only would be willing but then she was young and should she yield to such a request from him she would not know what she was yielding he turned again jumping from rock to rock till he reached the bank and then made his way again up to the withered oak  you would not have repented it if you had come down with me he said to nora  i am not so sure of that she answered  when they started to return she stepped on gallantly with priscilla but priscilla was stopped by some chance having some word to say to her brother having some other word to say to mrs trevelyan could it be that her austerity had been softened and that in kindness she contrived that nora should be left some yards behind them with her brother whether it were kindness or an unkind error so it was nora when she perceived what destiny was doing for her would not interfere with destiny if he chose to speak to her she would hear him and would answer him she knew very well what answer she would give him she had her answer quite ready at her fingers ends there was no doubt about her answer  they had walked half a mile together and he had spoken of nothing but the scenery she had endeavoured to appear to be excited oh yes the scenery of devonshire was delightful she hardly wanted anything more to make her happy if only this misery respecting her sister could be set right  and you you yourself said he do you mean that there is nothing you want in leaving london  not much indeed  it sometimes seemed to me that that kind of life waswas very pleasant to you  what kind of life mr stanbury  the life that you were livinggoing out being admired and having the rich and dainty all around you  i dont dislike people because they are rich she said  no nor do i and i despise those who affect to dislike them but all cannot be rich  nor all dainty as you choose to call them  but they who have once been daintyas i call themnever like to divest themselves of their daintiness you have been one of the dainty miss rowley  have i  certainly i doubt whether you would be happy if you thought that your daintiness had departed from you  i hope mr stanbury that nothing nice and pleasant has departed from me if i have ever been dainty dainty i hope i may remain i will never at any rate give it up of my own accord why she said this she could never explain to herself she had certainly not intended to rebuff him when she had been saying it but he spoke not a word to her further as they walked home either of her mode of life or of his own     chapter xxv  hugh stanbury smokes his pipe      illustration  nora rowley when she went to bed after her walk to niddon park in company with hugh stanbury was full of wrath against him but she could not own her anger to herself nor could she even confess to herselfthough she was breaking her heartthat there really existed for her the slightest cause of grief but why had he been so stern to her why had he gone out of his way to be uncivil to her he had called her dainty meaning to imply by the epithet that she was one of the butterflies of the day caring for nothing but sunshine and an opportunity of fluttering her silly wings she had understood well what he meant of course he was right to be cold to her if his heart was cold but he need not have insulted her by his illconcealed rebukes had he been kind to her he might have rebuked her as much as he liked she quite appreciated the delightful intimacy of a loving word of counsel from the man she lovedhow nice it is as it were to play at marriage and to hear beforehand something of the pleasant weight of gentle marital authority but there had been nothing of that in his manner to her he had told her that she was daintyand had so told it her as she thought that she might learn thereby that under no circumstances would he have any other tale to tell her if he had no other tale why had he not been silent did he think that she was subject to his rebuke merely because she lived under his mothers roof she would soon shew him that her residence at the clock house gave him no such authority over her then amidst her wrath and despair she cried herself asleep  while she was sobbing in bed he was sitting with a short black pipe stuck into his mouth on the corner of the churchyard wall opposite before he had left the house he and priscilla had spoken together for some minutes about mrs trevelyan of course she was wrong to see him said priscilla i hesitate to wound her by so saying because she has been illusedthough i did tell her so when she asked me she could have lost nothing by declining his visit  the worst of it is that trevelyan swears that he will never receive her again if she received him  he must unswear it said priscilla that is all it is out of the question that a man should take a girl from her home and make her his wife and then throw her off for so little of an offence as this she might compel him by law to take her back  what would she get by that  little enough said priscilla and it was little enough she got by marrying him she would have had bread and meat and raiment without being married i suppose  but it was a lovematch  yesand now she is at nuncombe putney and he is roaming about in london he has to pay ever so much a year for his lovematch and she is crushed into nothing by it how long will she have to remain here hugh  how can i say i suppose there is no reason against her remaining as far as you are concerned  for me personally none were she much worse than i think she is i should not care in the least for myself if i thought that we were doing her goodhelping to bring her back she cant hurt me i am so fixed and dry and established that nothing anybody says will affect me but mamma doesnt like it  what is it she dislikes  the idea that she is harbouring a married woman of whom people say at least that she has a lover  is she to be turned out because people are slanderers  why should mamma suffer because this woman who is a stranger to her has been imprudent if she were your wife hugh  god forbid  if we were in any way bound to her of course we would do our duty but if it makes mamma unhappy i am sure you will not press it i think mrs merton has spoken to her and then aunt stanbury has written such letters  who cares for aunt jemima  everybody cares for herexcept you and i and now this man who has been here asking the servant questions has upset her greatly even your coming has done so knowing as she does that you have come not to see us but to make inquiries about mrs trevelyan she is so annoyed by it that she does not sleep  do you wish her to be taken away at once asked hugh almost in an angry tone  certainly not that would be impossible we have agreed to take her and must bear with it and i would not have her moved from this if i thought that if she stayed awhile it might be arranged that she might return from us direct to her husband  i shall try that of coursenow  but if he will not have herif he be so obstinate so foolish and so wicked do not leave her here longer than you can help then hugh explained that sir marmaduke and lady rowley were to be in england in the spring and that it would be very desirable that the poor woman should not be sent abroad to look for a home before that if it must be so it must said priscilla but eight months is a long time  hugh went out to smoke his pipe on the churchwall in a moody unhappy state of mind he had hoped to have done so well in regard to mrs trevelyan till he had met colonel osborne he felt sure almost sure that she would have refused to see that pernicious troubler of the peace of families in this he found that he had been disappointed but he had not expected that priscilla would have been so much opposed to the arrangement which he had made about the house and then he had been buoyed up by the anticipation of some delight in meeting nora rowley there was at any rate the excitement of seeing her to keep his spirits from flagging he had seen her and had had the opportunity of which he had so long been thinking he had seen her and had had every possible advantage on his side what could any man desire better than the privilege of walking home with the girl he loved through country lanes of a summer evening they had been an hour togetheror might have been had he chosen to prolong the interview but the words which had been spoken between them had had not the slightest interestunless it were that they had tended to make the interval between him and her wider than ever he had asked herhe thought that he had askedwhether it would grieve her to abandon that delicate dainty mode of life to which she had been accustomed and she had replied that she would never abandon it of her own accord of course she had intended him to take her at her word  he blew forth quick clouds of heavy smoke as he attempted to make himself believe that this was all for the best what would such a one as he was do with a wife or seeing as he did see that marriage itself was quite out of the question how could it be good either for him or her that they should be tied together by a long engagement such a future would not at all suit the purpose of his life in his life absolute freedom would be neededfreedom from unnecessary ties freedom from unnecessary burdens his income was most precarious and he certainly would not make it less so by submission to any closer literary thraldom and he believed himself to be a bohemiantoo much of a bohemian to enjoy a domestic fireside with children and slippers to be free to go where he liked and when he liked to think as he pleased to be driven nowhere by conventional rules to use his days sundays as well as mondays as he pleased to use them to turn republican if his mind should take him that wayor quaker or mormon or red indian if he wished it and in so turning to do no damage to any one but himselfthat was the life which he had planned for himself his aunt stanbury had not read his character altogether wrongly as he thought when she had once declared that decency and godliness were both distasteful to him would it not be destruction to such a one as he was to fall into an interminable engagement with any girl let her be ever so sweet  but yet he felt as he sat there filling pipe after pipe smoking away till past midnight that though he could not bear the idea of trammels though he was totally unfit for matrimony either present or in prospecthe felt that he had within his breast a double identity and that that other division of himself would be utterly crushed if it were driven to divest itself of the idea of love whence was to come his poetry the romance of his life the springs of clear water in which his ignoble thoughts were to be dipped till they should become pure if love was to be banished altogether from the list of delights that were possible to him and then he began to speculate on lovethat love of which poets wrote and of which he found that some sparkle was necessary to give light to his life was it not the one particle of divine breath given to man of which he had heard since he was a boy and how was this love to be come at and was it to be a thing of reality or merely an idea was it a pleasure to be attained or a mystery that charmed by the difficulties of the distancea distance that never could be so passed that the thing should really be reached was love to be ever a delight vague as is that feeling of unattainable beauty which faroff mountains give when you know that you can never place yourself amidst their unseen valleys and if love could be reachedthe love of which the poets sing and of which his own heart was ever singingwhat were to be its pleasures to press a hand to kiss a lip to clasp a waist to hear even the low voice of the vanquished confessing loved one as she hides her blushing cheek upon your shoulderwhat is it all but to have reached the once mysterious valley of your faroff mountain and to have found that it is as other valleysrocks and stones with a little grass and a thin stream of running water but beyond that pressure of the hand and that kissing of the lipsbeyond that shortlived pressure of the plumage which is common to birds and menwhat could love do beyond that there were children with dirty faces and household bills and a wife who must perhaps always darn the stockingsand be sometimes cross was love to lead only to thisa dull life with a woman who had lost the beauty from her cheeks and the gloss from her hair and the music from her voice and the fire from her eye and the grace from her step and whose waist an arm should no longer be able to span did the love of the poets lead to that and that only then through the cloud of smoke there came upon him some dim idea of selfabnegationthat the mysterious valley among the mountains the faroff prospect of which was so charming to himwhich made the poetry of his life was in fact the capacity of caring more for other human beings than for himself the beauty of it all was not so much in the thing loved as in the loving were she a cripple hunchbacked eyeless he said to himself it might be the same only she must be a woman then he blew off a great cloud of smoke and went into bed lost amidst poetry philosophy love and tobacco  it had been arranged overnight that he was to start the next morning at halfpast seven and priscilla had promised to give him his breakfast before he went priscilla of course kept her word she was one of those women who would take a grim pleasure in coming down to make the tea at any possible hourat five at four if it were neededand who would never want to go to bed again when the ceremony was performed but when nora made her appearancenora who had been called daintyboth priscilla and hugh were surprised they could not say why she was therenor could nora tell herself she had not forgiven him she had no thought of being gentle and loving to him she declared to herself that she had no wish of saying goodbye to him once again but yet she was in the room waiting for him when he came down to his breakfast she had been unable to sleep and had reasoned with herself as to the absurdity of lying in bed awake when she preferred to be up and out of the house it was true that she had not been out of her bed at seven any morning since she had been at nuncombe putney but that was no reason why she should not be more active on this special morning there was a noise in the house and she never could sleep when there was a noise she was quite sure that she was not going down because she wished to see hugh stanbury but she was equally sure that it would be a disgrace to her to be deterred from going down simply because the man was there so she descended to the parlour and was standing near the open window when stanbury bustled into the room some quarter of an hour after the proper time priscilla was there also guessing something of the truth and speculating whether these two young people should they love each other would be the better or the worse for such love there must be marriagesif only that the world might go on in accordance with the creators purpose but as far as priscilla could see blessed were they who were not called upon to assist in the scheme to her eyes all days seemed to be days of wrath and all times times of tribulation and it was all mere vanity and vexation of spirit to go on and bear it till one was deadhelping others to bear it if such help might be of availthat was her theory of life to make it pleasant by eating and drinking and dancing or even by falling in love was to her mind a vain crunching of ashes between the teeth not to have ill things said of her and of hers not to be disgraced not to be rendered incapable of some human effort not to have actually to starvesuch was the extent of her ambition in this world and for the nextshe felt so assured of the goodness of god that she could not bring herself to doubt of happiness in a world that was to be eternal her doubt was this whether it was really the next world which would be eternal of eternity she did not doubtbut might there not be many worlds these things however she kept almost entirely to herself you down priscilla had said  well yes i could not sleep when i heard you all moving and the morning is so fine and i thought that perhaps you would go out and walk after your brother has gone priscilla promised that she would walk and then the tea was made  your sister and i are going out for an early walk said nora when she was greeted by stanbury priscilla said nothing but thought she understood it all  i wish i were going with you said hugh nora remembering how very little he had made of his opportunity on the evening before did not believe him  the eggs and fried bacon were eaten in a hurry and very little was said then there came the moment for parting the brother and sister kissed each other and hugh took nora by the hand i hope you make yourself happy here he said  oh yesif it were only for myself i should want nothing  i will do the best i can with trevelyan  the best will be to make him and every one understand that the fault is altogether his and not emilys  the best will be to make each think that there has been no real fault said hugh  there should be no talking of faults said priscilla let the husband take his wife backas he is bound to do  these words occupied hardly a minute in the saying but during that minute hugh stanbury held nora by the hand he held it fast she would not attempt to withdraw it but neither would she return his pressure by the muscle of a single finger what right had he to press her hand or to make any sign of love any pretence of loving when he had gone out of his way to tell her that she was not good enough for him then he started and nora and priscilla put on their hats and left the house  let us go to niddon park said nora  to niddon park again  yes it is so beautiful and i should like to see it by the morning light there is plenty of time  so they walked to niddon park in the morning as they had done on the preceding evening their conversation at first regarded trevelyan and his wife and the old trouble but nora could not keep herself from speaking of hugh stanbury  he would not have come she said unless louis had sent him  he would not have come now i think  of course notwhy should hebefore parliament was hardly over too but he wont remain in town nowwill he  he says somebody must remainand i think he will be in london till near christmas  how disagreeable but i suppose he doesnt care its all the same to a man like him they dont shut the clubs up i dare say will he come here at christmas  either then or for the new yearjust for a day or two  we shall be gone then i suppose said nora  that must depend on mr trevelyan said priscilla  what a life for two women to leadto depend upon the caprice of a man who must be mad do you think that mr trevelyan will care for what your brother says to him  i do not know mr trevelyan  he is very fond of your brother and i suppose men friends do listen to each other they never seem to listen to women dont you think that after all they despise women they look on them as dainty foolish things  sometimes women despise men said priscilla  not very oftendo they and then women are so dependent on men a woman can get nothing without a man  i manage to get on somehow said priscilla  no you dont miss stanburyif you think of it you want mutton and who kills the sheep  but who cooks it  but the mencooks are the best said nora and the mentailors and the men to wait at table and the menpoets and the menpainters and the mennurses all the things that women do men do better  there are two things they cant do said priscilla  what are they  they cant suckle babies and they cant forget themselves  about the babies of course not as for forgetting themselvesi am not quite so sure that i can forget myselfthat is just where your brother went down last night  they had at this moment reached the top of the steep slope below which the river ran brawling among the rocks and nora seated herself exactly where she had sat on the previous evening  i have been down scores of times said priscilla  let us go now  you wouldnt go when hugh asked you yesterday  i didnt care then but do come nowif you dont mind the climb then they went down the slope and reached the spot from whence hugh stanbury had jumped from rock to rock across the stream you have never been out there have you said nora  on the rocks oh dear no i should be sure to fall  but he went just like a goat  thats one of the things that men can do i suppose said priscilla but i dont see any great glory in being like a goat  i do i should like to be able to go and i think ill try it is so mean to be dainty and weak  i dont think it at all dainty to keep dry feet  but he didnt get his feet wet said nora or if he did he didnt mind i can see at once that i should be giddy and tumble down if i tried it  of course you would  but he didnt tumble down  he has been doing it all his life said priscilla  he cant do it up in london when i think of myself miss stanbury i am so ashamed there is nothing that i can do i couldnt write an article for a newspaper  i think i could but i fear no one would read it  they read his said nora or else he wouldnt be paid for writing them then they climbed back again up the hill and during the climbing there were no words spoken the slope was not much of a hillwas no more than the fall from the low ground of the valley to the course which the river had cut for itself but it was steep while it lasted and both the young women were forced to pause for a minute before they could proceed upon their journey as they walked home priscilla spoke of the scenery and of the country and of the nature of the life which she and her mother and sister had passed at nuncombe putney nora said but little till they were just entering the village and then she went back to the subject of her thoughts i would sooner said she write for a newspaper than do anything else in the world  why so  because it is so noble to teach people everything and then a man who writes for a newspaper must know so many things himself i believe there are women who do it but very few one or two have done it i know  go and tell that to aunt stanbury and hear what she will say about such women  i suppose she is veryprejudiced  yes she is but she is a clever woman i am inclined to think women had better not write for newspapers  and why not nora asked  my reasons would take me a week to explain and i doubt whether i have them very clear in my own head in the first place there is that difficulty about the babies most of them must get married you know  but not all said nora  no thank god not all  and if you are not married you might write for a newspaper at any rate if i were you i should be very proud of my brother  aunt stanbury is not at all proud of her nephew said priscilla as they entered the house     chapter xxvi  a third party is so objectionable   hugh stanbury went in search of trevelyan immediately on his return to london and found his friend at his rooms in lincolns inn  i have executed my commission said hugh endeavouring to speak of what he had done in a cheery voice  i am much obliged to you stanbury very muchbut i do not know that i need trouble you to tell me anything about it  and why not  i have learned it all from thatman  what man  from bozzle he has come back and has been with me and has learned everything  look here trevelyanwhen you asked me to go down to devonshire you promised me that there should be nothing more about bozzle i expect you to put that rascal and all that he has told you out of your head altogether you are bound to do so for my sake and you will be very wise to do so for your own  i was obliged to see him when he came  yes and to pay him i do not doubt but that is all done and should be forgotten  i cant forget it is it true or untrue that he found that man down there is it true or untrue that my wife received colonel osborne at your mothers house is it true or untrue that colonel osborne went down there with the express object of seeing her is it true or untrue that they had corresponded it is nonsense to bid me to forget all this you might as well ask me to forget that i had desired her neither to write to him nor to see him  if i understand the matter said trevelyan you are incorrect in one of your assertions  in which  you must excuse me if i am wrong trevelyan but i dont think you ever did tell your wife not to see this man or not to write to him  i never told her i dont understand what you mean  not in so many words it is my belief that she has endeavoured to obey implicitly every clear instruction that you have given her  you are wrongabsolutely and altogether wrong heaven and earth do you mean to tell me now after all that has taken place that she did not know my wishes  i have not said that but you have chosen to place her in such a position that though your word would go for much with her she cannot bring herself to respect your wishes  and you call that being dutiful and affectionate  i call it human and reasonable and i think that it is compatible with duty and affection have you consulted her wishes  always  consult them now then and bid her come back to you  nonever as far as i can see i will never do so the moment she is away from me this man goes to her and she receives him she must have known that she was wrongand you must know it  i do not think that she is half so wrong as you yourself said stanbury to this trevelyan made no answer and they both remained silent some minutes stanbury had a communication to make before he went but it was one which he wished to delay as long as there was a chance that his friends heart might be softenedone which he need not make if trevelyan would consent to receive his wife back to his house there was the days paper lying on the table and stanbury had taken it up and was reading itor pretending to read it  i will tell you what i propose to do said trevelyan  well  it is best both for her and for me that we should be apart  i cannot understand how you can be so mad as to say so  you dont understand what i feel heaven and earth to have a man coming and going but never mind you do not see it and nothing will make you see it and there is no reason why you should  i certainly do not see it i do not believe that your wife cares more for colonel osborne except as an old friend of her fathers than she does for the fellow that sweeps the crossing it is a matter in which i am bound to tell you what i think  very well now if you have freed your mind i will tell you my purpose i am bound to do so because your people are concerned in it i shall go abroad  and leave her in england  certainly she will be safer here than she can be abroadunless she should choose to go back with her father to the islands  and take the boy  noi could not permit that what i intend is this i will give her £800 a year as long as i have reason to believe that she has no communication whatever either by word of mouth or by letter with that man if she does i will put the case immediately into the hands of my lawyer with instructions to him to ascertain from counsel what severest steps i can take  how i hate that word severe when applied to a woman  i dare say you dowhen applied to another mans wife but there will be no severity in my first proposition as for the childif i approve of the place in which she lives as i do at presenthe shall remain with her for nine months in the year till he is six years old then he must come to me and he shall come to me altogether if she sees or hears from that man i believe that £800 a year will enable her to live with all comfort under your mothers roof  as to that said stanbury slowly i suppose i had better tell you at once that the nuncombe putney arrangement cannot be considered as permanent  why not  because my mother is timid and nervous and altogether unused to the world  that unfortunate woman is to be sent awayeven from nuncombe putney  understand me trevelyan  i understand you i understand you most thoroughly nor do i wonder at it in the least do not suppose that i am angry with your mother or with you or with your sister i have no right to expect that they should keep her after that man has made his way into their house i can well conceive that no honest highminded lady would do so  it is not that at all  but it is that how can you tell me that it isnt and yet you would have me believe that i am not disgraced as he said this trevelyan got up and walked about the room tearing his hair with his hands he was in truth a wretched man from whose mind all expectation of happiness was banished who regarded his own position as one of incurable ignominy looking upon himself as one who had been made unfit for society by no fault of his own what was he to do with the wretched woman who could be kept from the evil of her pernicious vanity by no gentle custody whom no most distant retirement would make safe from the effects of her own ignorance folly and obstinacy when is she to go he asked in a low sepulchral toneas though these new tidings that had come upon him had been fatalladen with doom and finally subversive of all chance even of tranquillity  when you and she may please  that is all very wellbut let me know the truth i would not have your mothers housecontaminated but may she remain there for a week  stanbury jumped from his seat with an oath i tell you what it is trevelyanif you speak of your wife in that way i will not listen to you it is unmanly and untrue to say that her presence cancontaminate any house  that is very fine it may be chivalrous in you to tell me on her behalf that i am a liarand that i am not a man  you drive me to it  but what am i to think when you are forced to declare that this unfortunate woman can not be allowed to remain at your mothers housea house which has been especially taken with reference to a shelter for her she has been receivedwith the idea that she would be discreet she has been indiscreet past belief and she is to be turned outmost deservedly heaven and earth where shall i find a roof for her head trevelyan as he said this was walking about the room with his hands stretched up towards the ceiling and as his friend was attempting to make him comprehend that there was no intention on the part of any one to banish mrs trevelyan from the clock house at least for some months to comenot even till after christmas unless some satisfactory arrangement could be sooner madethe door of the room was opened by the boy who called himself a clerk and who acted as trevelyans servant in the chambers and a third person was shown into the room that third person was mr bozzle as no name was given stanbury did not at first know mr bozzle but he had not had his eye on mr bozzle for half a minute before he recognised the expoliceman by the outward attributes and signs of his profession oh is that you mr bozzle said trevelyan as soon as the great man had made his bow of salutation wellwhat is it      illustration that third person was mr bozzle   mr hugh stanbury i think said bozzle making another bow to the young barrister  thats my name said stanbury  exactly so mr s the identity is one as i could prove on oath in any court in england you was on the railway platform at exeter on saturday when we was waiting for the 12 express busswasnt you now mr s  whats that to you  wellas it do happen it is something to me and mr s if you was asked that question in hany court in england or before even one of the metropolitan bekes you wouldnt deny it  why the devil should i deny it whats all this about trevelyan  of course you cant deny it mr s when im down on a fact i am down on it nothing else wouldnt do in my profession  have you anything to say to me mr bozzle asked trevelyan  welli have just a word  about your journey to devonshire  wellin a way it is about my journey to devonshire its all along of the same job mr trewillian  you can speak before my friend here said trevelyan bozzle had taken a great dislike to hugh stanbury regarding the barrister with a correct instinct as one who was engaged for the time in the same service with himself and who was his rival in that service when thus instigated to make as it were a party of three in this delicate and most confidential matter and to take his rival into his confidence he shook his head slowly and looked trevelyan hard in the facemr stanbury is my particular friend said trevelyan and knows well the circumstances of this unfortunate affair you can say anything before him  bozzle shook his head again id rayther not mr trewillian said he indeed id rayther not its something very particular  if you take my advice said stanbury you will not hear him yourself  thats your advice mr s asked mr bozzle  yesthats my advice id never have anything to do with such a fellow as you as long as i could help it  i dare say not mr s i dare say not were hexpensive and were haccurateneither of which is much in your line mr s if i understand about it rightly  mr bozzle if youve got anything to tell tell it said trevelyan angrily  a third party is so objectionable pleaded bozzle  never mind that is my affair  it is your affair mr trewillian theres not a doubt of that the lady is your wife  damnation shouted trevelyan  but the credit sir said bozzle the credit is mine and here is mr s has been down a interfering with me and doing no varsal good as ill undertake to prove by evidence before the affair is over  the affair is over said stanbury  thats as you think mr s thats where your information goes to mr s mine goes a little beyond that mr s ive means as you can know nothing about mr s ive irons in the fire what youre as ignorant on as the babe as isnt born  no doubt you have mr bozzle said stanbury  i has and now if it be that i must speak before a third party mr trewillian im ready it aint that im no ways ashamed ive done my duty and knows how to do it and let a counsel be ever so sharp i never yet was so posed but what i could stand up and hold my own the colonel mr trewillian gota letterfrom your ladythis morning  i dont believe it said stanbury sharply  very likely not mr s it aint in my power to say anything whatever about you believing or not believing but mr ts lady has wrote the letter and the colonelhe has received it you dont look after these things mr s you dont know the ways of em but its my business the lady has wrote the letter and the colonelwhy he has received it trevelyan had become white with rage when bozzle first mentioned this continued correspondence between his wife and colonel osborne it never occurred to him to doubt the correctness of the policemans information and he regarded stanburys assertion of incredulity as being simply of a piece with his general obstinacy in the matter at this moment he began to regret that he had called in the assistance of his friend and that he had not left the affair altogether in the hands of that much more satisfactory but still more painful agent mr bozzle he had again seated himself and for a moment or two remained silent on his chair it aint my fault mr trewillian continued bozzle if this little matter oughtnt never to have been mentioned before a third party  it is of no moment said trevelyan in a low voice what does it signify who knows it now  do not believe it trevelyan said stanbury  very well mr s very well just as you like dont believe it only its true and its my business to find them things out its my business and i finds em out mr trewillian can do as he likes about it if its right why then it is right it aint for me to say nothing about that but theres the fact the lady she has wrote another letter and the colonelwhy he has received it there aint nothing wrong about the postoffice if i was to say what was inside of that billydouwhy then i should be proving what i didnt know and when it came to standing up in court i shouldnt be able to hold my own but as for the letter the lady wrote it and the colonelhe received it  that will do mr bozzle said trevelyan  shall i call again mr trewillian  noyes ill send to you when i want you you shall hear from me  i suppose id better be keeping my eyes open about the colonels place mr trewillian  for gods sake trevelyan do not have anything more to do with this man  thats all very well for you mr s said bozzle the lady aint your wife  can you imagine anything more disgraceful than all this said stanbury  nothing nothing nothing answered trevelyan  and im to keep stirring and be on the move again suggested bozzle who prudently required to be fortified by instructions before he devoted his time and talents even to so agreeable a pursuit as that in which he had been engaged  you shall hear from me said trevelyan  very wellvery well i wish you goodday mr trewillian mr s yours most obedient there was one other point mr trewillian  what point asked trevelyan angrily  if the lady was to join the colonel  that will do mr bozzle said trevelyan again jumping up from his chair that will do so saying he opened the door and bozzle with a bow took his departure what on earth am i to do how am i to save her said the wretched husband appealing to his friend  stanbury endeavoured with all his eloquence to prove that this latter piece of information from the spy must be incorrect if such a letter had been written by mrs trevelyan to colonel osborne it must have been done while he stanbury was staying at the clock house this seemed to him to be impossible but he could hardly explain why it should be impossible she had written to the man before and had received him when he came to nuncombe putney why was it even improbable that she should have written to him again nevertheless stanbury felt sure that she had sent no such letter i think i understand her feelings and her mind said he and if so any such correspondence would be incompatible with her previous conduct trevelyan only smiled at thisor pretended to smile he would not discuss the question but believed implicitly what bozzle had told him in spite of all stanburys arguments i can say nothing further said stanbury  no my dear fellow there is nothing further to be said except this that i will have my unfortunate wife removed from the decent protection of your mothers roof with the least possible delay i feel that i owe mrs stanbury the deepest apology for having sent such an inmate to trouble her repose  nonsense  that is what i feel  and i say that it is nonsense if you had never sent that wretched blackguard down to fabricate lies at nuncombe putney my mothers repose would have been all right as it is mrs trevelyan can remain where she is till after christmas there is not the least necessity for removing her at once i only meant to say that the arrangement should not be regarded as altogether permanent i must go to my work now goodbye  goodbye stanbury  stanbury paused at the door and then once more turned round i suppose it is of no use my saying anything further but i wish you to understand fully that i regard your wife as a woman much illused and i think you are punishing her and yourself too with a cruel severity for an indiscretion of the very slightest kind     chapter xxvii  mr trevelyans letter to his wife   trevelyan when he was left alone sat for above a couple of hours contemplating the misery of his position and endeavouring to teach himself by thinking what ought to be his future conduct it never occurred to him during these thoughts that it would be well that he should at once take back his wife either as a matter of duty or of welfare for himself or for her he had taught himself to believe that she had disgraced him and though this feeling of disgrace made him so wretched that he wished that he were dead he would allow himself to make no attempt at questioning the correctness of his conviction though he were to be shipwrecked for ever even that seemed to be preferable to supposing that he had been wrong nevertheless he loved his wife dearly and in the white heat of his anger endeavoured to be merciful to her when stanbury accused him of severity he would not condescend to defend himself but he told himself then of his great mercy was he not as fond of his own boy as any other father and had he not allowed her to take the child because he had felt that a mothers love was more imperious more craving in its nature than the love of a father had that been severe and had he not resolved to allow her every comfort which her unfortunate positionthe selfimposed misfortune of her positionwould allow her to enjoy she had come to him without a shilling and yet bad as her treatment of him had been he was willing to give enough not only to support her but her sister also with every comfort severe no that at least was an undeserved accusation he had been anything but severe foolish he might have been in taking a wife from a home in which she had been unable to learn the discretion of a matron too trusting he had been and too generousbut certainly not severe but of course as he said to himself a young man like stanbury would take the part of a woman with whose sister he was in love then he turned his thoughts upon bozzle and there came over him a crushing feeling of ignominy shame moral dirt and utter degradation as he reconsidered his dealings with that ingenious gentleman he was paying a rogue to watch the steps of a man whom he hated to pry into the home secrets to read the letters to bribe the servants to record the movements of this rival this successful rival in his wifes affections it was a filthy thingand yet what could he do gentlemen of old his own grandfather or his father would have taken such a fellow as colonel osborne by the throat and have caned him and afterwards would have shot him or have stood to be shot all that was changed nowbut it was not his fault that it was changed he was willing enough to risk his life could any opportunity of risking it in this cause be obtained for him but were he to cudgel colonel osborne he would be simply arrested and he would then be told that he had disgraced himself foully by striking a man old enough to be his father  how was he to have avoided the employment of some such man as bozzle he had also employed a gentleman his friend stanbury and what was the result the facts were not altered even stanbury did not attempt to deny that there had been a correspondence and that there had been a visit but stanbury was so blind to all impropriety or pretended such blindness that he defended that which all the world agreed in condemning of what use had stanbury been to him he had wanted facts not advice stanbury had found out no facts for him but bozzle either by fair means or foul did get at the truth he did not doubt but that bozzle was right about that letter written only yesterday and received on that very morning his wife who had probably been complaining of her wrongs to stanbury must have retired from that conversation to her chamber and immediately have written this letter to her lover with such a woman as that what can be done in these days otherwise than by the aid of such a one as bozzle he could not confine his wife in a dungeon he could not save himself from the disgrace of her misconduct by any rigours of surveillance on his own part as wives are managed nowadays he could not forbid to her the use of the postofficecould not hinder her from seeing this hypocritical scoundrel who carried on his wickedness under the false guise of family friendship he had given her every chance to amend her conduct but if she were resolved on disobedience he had no means of enforcing obedience the facts however it was necessary that he should know  and now what should he do how should he go to work to make her understand that she could not write even a letter without his knowing it and that if she did either write to the man or see him he would immediately take the child from her and provide for her only in such fashion as the law should demand from him for himself and for his own life he thought that he had determined what he would do it was impossible that he should continue to live in london he was ashamed to enter a club he had hardly a friend to whom it was not an agony to speak they who knew him knew also of his disgrace and no longer asked him to their houses for days past he had eaten alone and sat alone and walked alone all study was impossible to him no pursuit was open to him he spent his time in thinking of his wife and of the disgrace which she had brought upon him such a life as this he knew was unmanly and shameful and it was absolutely necessary for him that he should in some way change it he would go out of england and would travelif only he could so dispose of his wife that she might be safe from any possible communication with colonel osborne if that could be effected nothing that money could do should be spared for her if that could not be effected he would remain at homeand crush her  that night before he went to bed he wrote a letter to his wife which was as follows      dear emily     i have learned beyond the shadow of a doubt that you    have corresponded with colonel osborne since you have been    at nuncombe putney and also that you have seen him there    this has been done in direct opposition to my expressed    wishes and i feel myself compelled to tell you that such    conduct is disgraceful to you and disgracing to me i am    quite at a loss to understand how you can reconcile to    yourself so flagrant a disobedience of my instructions    and so perverse a disregard to the opinion of the world at    large     but i do not write now for the sake of finding fault with    you it is too late for me to have any hope that i can do    so with good effect either as regards your credit or my    happiness nevertheless it is my duty to protect both you    and myself from further shame and i wish to tell you what    are my intentions with that view in the first place i    warn you that i keep a watch on you the doing so is very    painful to me but it is absolutely necessary you cannot    see colonel osborne or write to him without my knowing    it i pledge you my word that in either casethat is if    you correspond with him or see himi will at once take    our boy away from you i will not allow him to remain    even with a mother who shall so misconduct herself    should colonel osborne address a letter to you i desire    that you will put it under an envelope addressed to me     if you obey my commands on this head i will leave our boy    with you nine months out of every year till he shall be    six years old such at least is my present idea though    i will not positively bind myself to adhere to it and i    will allow you £800 per year for your own maintenance and    that of your sister i am greatly grieved to find from    my friend mr stanbury that your conduct in reference to    colonel osborne has been such as to make it necessary that    you should leave mrs stanburys house i do not wonder    that it should be so i shall immediately seek for a    future home for you and when i have found one that is    suitable i will have you conveyed to it     i must now further explain my purposesand i must beg    you to remember that i am driven to do so by your direct    disobedience to my expressed wishes should there be any    further communication between you and colonel osborne    not only will i take your child away from you but i will    also limit the allowance to be made to you to a bare    sustenance in such case i shall put the matter into the    hands of a lawyer and shall probably feel myself driven    to take steps towards freeing myself from a connection    which will be disgraceful to my name     for myself i shall live abroad during the greater part of    the year london has become to me uninhabitable and all    english pleasures are distasteful     yours affectionately     louis trevelyan   when he had finished this he read it twice and believed that he had written if not an affectionate at any rate a considerate letter he had no bounds to the pity which he felt for himself in reference to the injury which was being done to him and he thought that the offers which he was making both in respect to his child and the money were such as to entitle him to his wifes warmest gratitude he hardly recognised the force of the language which he used when he told her that her conduct was disgraceful and that she had disgraced his name he was quite unable to look at the whole question between him and his wife from her point of view he conceived it possible that such a woman as his wife should be told that her conduct would be watched and that she should be threatened with the divorce court with an effect that should upon the whole be salutary there be men and not bad men either and men neither uneducated or unintelligent or irrational in ordinary matters who seem to be absolutely unfitted by nature to have the custody or guardianship of others a woman in the hands of such a man can hardly save herself or him from endless trouble it may be that between such a one and his wife events shall flow on so evenly that no ruling no constraint is necessarythat even the giving of advice is never called for by the circumstances of the day if the man be happily forced to labour daily for his living till he be weary and the wife be laden with many ordinary cares the routine of life may run on without stormsbut for such a one if he be without work the management of a wife will be a task full of peril the lesson may be learned at last he may after years come to perceive how much and how little of guidance the partner of his life requires at his hands and he may be taught how that guidance should be givenbut in the learning of the lesson there will be sorrow and gnashing of teeth it was so now with this man he loved his wife to a certain extent he still trusted her he did not believe that she would be faithless to him after the fashion of women who are faithless altogether but he was jealous of authority fearful of slights selfconscious afraid of the world and utterly ignorant of the nature of a womans mind  he carried the letter with him in his pocket throughout the next morning and in the course of the day he called upon lady milborough though he was obstinately bent on acting in accordance with his own views yet he was morbidly desirous of discussing the grievousness of his position with his friends he went to lady milborough asking for her advice but desirous simply of being encouraged by her to do that which he was resolved to do on his own judgment  downafter herto nuncombe putney said lady milborough holding up both her hands  yes he has been there and she has been weak enough to see him  my dear louis take her to naples at onceat once  it is too late for that now lady milborough  too late oh no she has been foolish indiscreet disobedientwhat you will of that kind but louis dont send her away dont send your young wife away from you those whom god has joined together let no man put asunder  i cannot consent to live with a wife with whom neither my wishes nor my word have the slightest effect i may believe of her what i please but think what the world will believe i cannot disgrace myself by living with a woman who persists in holding intercourse with a man whom the world speaks of as her lover  take her to naples said lady milborough with all the energy of which she was capable  i can take her nowhere nor will i see her till she has given proof that her whole conduct towards me has been altered i have written a letter to her and i have brought it will you excuse me if i ask you to take the trouble to read it  then he handed lady milborough the letter which she read very slowly and with much care  i dont think i wouldwouldwould  would what demanded trevelyan  dont you think that what you say is a littlejust a little prone to maketo make the breach perhaps wider  no lady milborough in the first place how can it be wider  you might take her back you know and then if you could only get to naples  how can i take her back while she is corresponding with this man  she wouldnt correspond with him at naples  trevelyan shook his head and became cross his old friend would not at all do as old friends are expected to do when called upon for advice  i think said he that what i have proposed is both just and generous  but louis why should there be any separation  she has forced it upon me she is headstrong and will not be ruled  but this about disgracing you do you think that you must say that  i think i must because it is true if i do not tell her the truth who is there that will do so it may be bitter now but i think that it is for her welfare  dear dear dear  i want nothing for myself lady milborough  i am sure of that louis  my whole happiness was in my home no man cared less for going out than i did my child and my wife were everything to me i dont suppose that i was ever seen at a club in the evening once throughout a season and she might have had anything that she likedanything it is hard lady milborough is it not  lady milborough who had seen the angry brow did not dare to suggest naples again but yet if any word might be spoken to prevent this utter wreck of a home how good a thing it would be he had got up to leave her but she stopped him by holding his hand for better for worse louis remember that  why has she forgotten it  she is flesh of your flesh bone of your bone and for the boys sake think of your boy louis do not send that letter sleep on it louis and think of it  i have slept on it  there is no promise in it of forgiveness after a while it is written as though you intended that she should never come back to you  that shall be as she behaves herself  but tell her so let there be some one bright spot in what you say to her on which her mind may fix itself if she be not altogether hardened that letter will drive her to despair  but trevelyan would not give up the letter nor indicate by a word that he would reconsider the question of its propriety he escaped as soon as he could from lady milboroughs room and almost declared as he did so that he would never enter her doors again she had utterly failed to see the matter in the proper light when she talked of naples she must surely have been unable to comprehend the extent of the illusage to which he the husband had been subjected how was it possible that he should live under the same roof with a wife who claimed to herself the right of receiving visitors of whom he disapproveda visitora gentlemanone whom the world called her lover he gnashed his teeth and clenched his fist as he thought of his old friends ignorance of the very first law in a married mans code of laws  but yet when he was out in the streets he did not post his letter at once but thought of it throughout the whole day trying to prove the weight of every phrase that he had used once or twice his heart almost relented once he had the letter in his hand that he might tear it but he did not tear it he put it back into his pocket and thought again of his grievance surely it was his first duty in such an emergency to be firm  it was certainly a wretched life that he was leading in the evening he went all alone to an eatinghouse for his dinner and then sitting with a miserable glass of sherry before him he again read and reread the epistle which he had written every harsh word that it contained was in some sort pleasant to his ear she had hit him hard and should he not hit her again and then was it not his bounden duty to let her know the truth yes it was his duty to be firm  so he went out and posted the letter     chapter xxviii  great tribulation      illustration  trevelyans letter to his wife fell like a thunderbolt among them at nuncombe putney mrs trevelyan was altogether unable to keep it to herselfindeed she made no attempt at doing so her husband had told her that she was to be banished from the clock house because her present hostess was unable to endure her misconduct and of course she demanded the reasons of the charge that was thus brought against her when she first read the letter which she did in the presence of her sister she towered in her passion  disgraced him i have never disgraced him it is he that has disgraced me correspondence yeshe shall see it all unjust ignorant foolish man he does not remember that the last instructions he really gave me were to bid me see colonel osborne take my boy away yes of course i am a woman and must suffer i will write to colonel osborne and will tell him the truth and will send my letter to louis he shall know how he has illtreated me i will not take a penny of his moneynot a penny maintain you i believe he thinks that we are beggars leave this house because of my conduct what can mrs stanbury have said what can any of them have said i will demand to be told free himself from the connection oh nora nora that it should come to thisthat i should be thus threatened who have been as innocent as a baby if it were not for my child i think that i should destroy myself  nora said what she could to comfort her sister insisting chiefly on the promise that the child should not be taken away there was no doubt as to the husbands power in the mind of either of them and though as regarded herself mrs trevelyan would have defied her husband let his power be what it might yet she acknowledged to herself that she was in some degree restrained by the fear that she would find herself deprived of her only comfort  we must just go where he bids ustill papa comes said nora  and when papa is here what help will there be then he will not let me go back to the islandswith my boy for myself i might die or get out of his way anywhere i can see that priscilla stanbury is right when she says that no woman should trust herself to any man disgraced that i should live to be told by my husband that i had disgraced himby a lover  there was some sort of agreement made between the two sisters as to the manner in which priscilla should be interrogated respecting the sentence of banishment which had been passed they both agreed that it would be useless to make inquiry of mrs stanbury if anything had really been said to justify the statement made in mr trevelyans letter it must have come from priscilla and have reached trevelyan through priscillas brother they both of them had sufficiently learned the ways of the house to be sure that mrs stanbury had not been the person active in the matter they went down therefore together and found priscilla seated at her desk in the parlour mrs stanbury was also in the room and it had been presumed between the sisters that the interrogations should be made in that ladys absence but mrs trevelyan was too hot in the matter for restraint and she at once opened out her budget of grievance  i have a letter from my husband she saidand then paused but priscilla seeing from the fire in her eyes that she was much moved made no reply but turned to listen to what might further be said i do not know why i should trouble you with his suspicions continued mrs trevelyan or read to you what he says aboutcolonel osborne as she spoke she was holding her husbands letter open in her hands there is nothing in it that you do not know he says i have corresponded with him so i haveand he shall see the correspondence he says that colonel osborne visited me he did come to see me and nora  as any other old man might have done said nora  it was not likely that i should openly confess myself to be afraid to see my fathers old friend but the truth is my husband does not know what a woman is  she had begun by declaring that she would not trouble her friend with any statement of her husbands complaints against her but now she had made her way to the subject and could hardly refrain herself priscilla understood this and thought that it would be wise to interrupt her by a word that might bring her back to her original purpose is there anything said she which we can do to help you  to help me nogod only can help me but louis informs me that i am to be turned out of this house because you demand that we should go  who says that exclaimed mrs stanbury  my husband listen this is what he saysi am greatly grieved to hear from my friend mr stanbury that your conduct in reference to colonel osborne has been such as to make it necessary that you should leave mrs stanburys house is that true is that true in her general mode of carrying herself and of enduring the troubles of her life mrs trevelyan was a strong woman but now her grief was too much for her and she burst out into tears i am the most unfortunate woman that ever was born she sobbed out through her tears  i never said that you were to go said mrs stanbury  but your son has told mr trevelyan that we must go said nora who felt that her sense of injury against hugh stanbury was greatly increased by what had taken place to her mind he was the person most important in the matter why had he desired that they should be sent away from the clock house she was very angry with him and declared to herself that she hated him with all her heart for this man she had sent away that other lovera lover who had really loved her and she had even confessed that it was so  there is a misunderstanding about this said priscilla  it must be with your brother then said nora  i think not said priscilla i think that it has been with mr trevelyan then she went on to explain with much difficulty but still with a slow distinctness that was peculiar to her what had really taken place we have endeavoured she said to show youmy mother and ithat we have not misjudged you but it is certainly true that i told my brother that i did not think the arrangement a good onequite as a permanence it was very difficult and her cheeks were red as she spoke and her lips faltered it was an exquisite pain to her to have to give the pain which her words would convey but there was no help for itas she said to herself more than once at the timethere was nothing to be done but to tell the truth  i never said so blurted out mrs stanbury with her usual weakness  no mother it was my saying in discussing what was best for us all with hugh i told himwhat i have just now explained  then of course we must go said mrs trevelyan who had gulped down her sobs and was resolved to be firmto give way to no more tears to bear all without sign of womanly weakness  you will stay with us till your father comes said priscilla  of course you will said mrs stanburyyou and nora we have got to be such friends now  no said mrs trevelyan as to friendship for me it is out of the question we must pack up nora and go somewhere heaven knows where  nora was now sobbing why your brothershould want to turn us outafter he has sent us here  my brother wants nothing of the kind said priscilla your sister has no better friend than my brother  it will be better nora to discuss the matter no further said mrs trevelyan we must go awaysomewhere and the sooner the better to be an unwelcome guest is always bad but to be unwelcome for such a reason as this is terrible  there is no reason said mrs stanbury indeed there is none  mrs trevelyan will understand us better when she is less excited said priscilla i am not surprised that she should be indignant now i can only say again that we hope you will stay with us till sir marmaduke rowley shall be in england  that is not what your brother means said nora  nor is it what i mean said mrs trevelyan nora we had better go to our own room i suppose i must write to my husband indeed of course i must that i may send himthe correspondence i fear i cannot walk out into the street mrs stanbury and make you quit of me till i hear from him and if i were to go to an inn at once people would speak evil of meand i have no money  my dear how can you think of such a thing said mrs stanbury  but you may be quite sure that we shall be gone within three daysor four at the furthest indeed i will pledge myself not to remain longer than thateven though i should have to go to the poorhouse neither i nor my sister will stay in any familyto contaminate it come nora and so speaking she sailed out of the room and her sister followed her  why did you say anything about it oh dear oh dear why did you speak to hugh see what you have done  i am sorry that i did speak replied priscilla slowly  sorry of course you are sorry but what good is that  but mother i do not think that i was wrong i feel sure that the real fault in all this is with mr trevelyan as it has been all through he should not have written to her as he has done  i suppose hugh did tell him  no doubtand i told hugh but not after the fashion in which he has told her i blame myself mostly for thisthat we ever consented to come to this house we had no business here who is to pay the rent  hugh insisted upon taking it  yesand he will pay the rent and we shall be a drag upon him as though he had been fool enough to have a wife and a family of his own and what good have we done we had not strength enough to say that that wicked man should not see her when he camefor he is a wicked man  if we had done that she would have been as bad then as she is now  mother we had no business to meddle either with her badness or her goodness what had we to do with the wife of such a one as mr trevelyan or with any woman who was separated from her husband  it was hugh who thought we should be of service to them  yesand i do not blame him he is in a position to be of service to people he can do work and earn money and has a right to think and to speak we have a right to think only for ourselves and we should not have yielded to him how are we to get back again out of this house to our cottage  they are pulling the cottage down priscilla  to some other cottage mother do you not feel while we are living here that we are pretending to be what we are not after all aunt stanbury was right though it was not her business to meddle with us we should never have come here that poor woman now regards us as her bitter enemies  i meant to do for the best said mrs stanbury  the fault was mine mother  but you meant it for the best my dear  meaning for the best is trash i dont know that i did mean it for the best while we were at the cottage we paid our way and were honest what is it people say of us now  they cant say any harm  they say that we are paid by the husband to keep his wife and paid again by the lover to betray the husband  priscilla  yesit is shocking enough but that comes of people going out of their proper course we were too humble and low to have a right to take any part in such a matter how true it is that while one crouches on the ground one can never fall  the matter was discussed in the clock house all day between mrs stanbury and priscilla and between mrs trevelyan and nora in their rooms and in the garden but nothing could come of such discussions no change could be made till further instructions should have been received from the angry husband nor could any kind of argument be even invented by priscilla which might be efficacious in inducing the two ladies to remain at the clock house even should mr trevelyan allow them to do so they all felt the intolerable injustice as it appeared to themof their subjection to the caprice of an unreasonable and illconditioned man but to all of them it seemed plain enough that in this matter the husband must exercise his own willat any rate till sir marmaduke should be in england there were many difficulties throughout the day mrs trevelyan would not go down to dinner sending word that she was ill and that she would if she were allowed have some tea in her own room and nora said that she would remain with her sister priscilla went to them more than once and late in the evening they all met in the parlour but any conversation seemed to be impossible and mrs trevelyan as she went up to her room at night again declared that she would rid the house of her presence as soon as possible  one thing however was done on that melancholy day mrs trevelyan wrote to her husband and enclosed colonel osbornes letter to herself and a copy of her reply the reader will hardly require to be told that no such further letter had been written by her as that of which bozzle had given information to her husband men whose business it is to detect hidden and secret things are very apt to detect things which have never been done what excuse can a detective make even to himself for his own existence if he can detect nothing mr bozzle was an activeminded man who gloried in detecting and who in the special spirit of his trade had taught himself to believe that all around him were things secret and hidden which would be within his power of unravelling if only the slightest clue were put in his hand he lived by the crookednesses of people and therefore was convinced that straight doings in the world were quite exceptional things dark and dishonest fights fought and races run that they might be lost plants and crosses women false to their husbands sons false to their fathers daughters to their mothers servants to their masters affairs always secret dark foul and fraudulent were to him the normal condition of life it was to be presumed that mrs trevelyan should continue to correspond with her loverthat old mrs stanbury should betray her trust by conniving at the lovers visitthat everybody concerned should be steeped to the hips in lies and iniquity when therefore he found at colonel osbornes rooms that the colonel had received a letter with the lessboro postmark addressed in the handwriting of a woman he did not scruple to declare that colonel osborne had received on that morning a letter from mr trevelyans lady but in sending to her husband what she called with so much bitterness the correspondence mrs trevelyan had to enclose simply the copy of one sheet note from herself  but she now wrote again to colonel osborne and enclosed to her husband not a copy of what she had written but the note itself it was as follows      nuncombe putney wednesday august 10     my dear colonel osborne     my husband has desired me not to see you or to write to    you or to hear from you again i must therefore beg you    to enable me to obey himat any rate till papa comes to    england     yours truly     emily trevelyan   and then she wrote to her husband and in the writing of this letter there was much doubt much labour and many changes we will give it as it was written when completed      i have received your letter and will obey your commands    to the best of my power in order that you may not be    displeased by any further unavoidable correspondence    between me and colonel osborne i have written to him a    note which i now send to you i send it that you may    forward it if you do not choose to do so i cannot be    answerable either for his seeing me or for his writing to    me again     i send also copies of all the correspondence i have had    with colonel osborne since you turned me out of your    house when he came to call on me nora remained with me    while he was here i blush while i write thisnot for    myself but that i should be so suspected as to make such    a statement necessary     you say that i have disgraced you and myself i have    done neither i am disgracedbut it is you that have    disgraced me i have never spoken a word or done a thing    as regards you of which i have cause to be ashamed     i have told mrs stanbury that i and nora will leave her    house as soon as we can be made to know where we are to    go i beg that this may be decided instantly as else we    must walk out into the street without a shelter after    what has been said i cannot remain here     my sister bids me say that she will relieve you of all    burden respecting herself as soon as possible she will    probably be able to find a home with my aunt mrs    outhouse till papa comes to england as for myself i can    only say that till he comes i shall do exactly what you    order     emily trevelyan     nuncombe putney august 10     chapter xxix  mr and mrs outhouse   both mr outhouse and his wife were especially timid in taking upon themselves the cares of other people not on that account is it to be supposed that they were bad or selfish they were both given much to charity and bestowed both in time and money more than is ordinarily considered necessary even from persons in their position but what they gave they gave away from their own quiet hearth had money been wanting to the daughters of his wifes brother mr outhouse would have opened such small coffer as he had with a free hand but he would have much preferred that his benevolence should be used in a way that would bring upon him no further responsibility and no questionings from people whom he did not know and could not understand  the rev oliphant outhouse had been rector of st diddulphsintheeast for the last fifteen years having married the sister of sir marmaduke rowleythen simply mr rowley with a colonial appointment in jamaica of £120 per annumtwelve years before his promotion while he was a curate in one of the populous borough parishes he had thus been a london clergyman all his life but he knew almost as little of london society as though he had held a cure in a westmoreland valley he had worked hard but his work had been altogether among the poor he had no gift of preaching and had acquired neither reputation nor popularity but he could workand having been transferred because of that capability to the temporary curacy of st diddulphsout of one diocese into anotherhe had received the living from the bishops hands when it became vacant  a dreary place was the parsonage of st diddulphsintheeast for the abode of a gentleman mr outhouse had not in his whole parish a parishioner with whom he could consort the greatest men around him were the publicans and the most numerous were men employed in and around the docks dredgers of mud navvies employed on suburban canals excavators loaders and unloaders of cargo cattle drivers whose driving however was done mostly on board shipsuch and such like were the men who were the fathers of the families of st diddulphsintheeast and there was there not far removed from the muddy estuary of a little stream that makes its black way from the essex marshes among the houses of the poorest of the poor into the thames a large commercial establishment for turning the carcasses of horses into manure messrs flowsem and blurt were in truth the great people of st diddulphsintheeast but the closeness of their establishment was not an additional attraction to the parsonage they were liberal however with their money and mr outhouse was disposed to thinkcustom perhaps having made the establishment less objectionable to him than it was at firstthat st diddulphsintheeast would be more of a pandemonium than it now was if by any sanitary law messrs flowsem and blurt were compelled to close their doors non olet he would say with a grim smile when the charitable cheque of the firm would come punctually to hand on the first saturday after christmas  but such a house as his would be as he knew but a poor residence for his wifes nieces indeed without positively saying that he was unwilling to receive them he had when he first heard of the breaking up of the house in curzon street shewn that he would rather not take upon his shoulders so great a responsibility he and his wife had discussed the matter between them and had come to the conclusion that they did not know what kind of things might have been done in curzon street they would think no evil they said but the very idea of a married woman with a lover was dreadful to them it might be that their niece was free from blame they hoped so and even though her sin had been of ever so deep a dye they would take her inif it were indeed necessary but they hoped that such help from them might not be needed they both knew how to give counsel to a poor woman how to rebuke a poor manhow to comfort encourage or to upbraid the poor practice had told them how far they might go with some hope of doing goodand at what stage of demoralisation no good from their hands was any longer within the scope of fair expectation but all this was among the poor with what words to encourage such a one as their niece mrs trevelyanto encourage her or to rebuke her as her conduct might seem to make necessarythey both felt that they were altogether ignorant to them mrs trevelyan was a fine lady to mr outhouse sir marmaduke had ever been a fine gentleman given much to worldly things who cared more for whist and a glass of wine than for anything else and who thought that he had a good excuse for never going to church in england because he was called upon as he said to show himself in the governors pew always once on sundays and frequently twice when he was at the seat of his government sir marmaduke manifestly looked upon church as a thing in itself notoriously disagreeable to mr outhouse it afforded the great events of the week and mrs outhouse would declare that to hear her husband preach was the greatest joy of her life it may be understood therefore that though the family connection between the rowleys and the outhouses had been kept up with a semblance of affection it had never blossomed forth into cordial friendship  when therefore the clergyman of st diddulphs received a letter from his niece nora begging him to take her into his parsonage till sir marmaduke should arrive in the course of the spring and hinting also a wish that her uncle oliphant should see mr trevelyan and if possible arrange that his other niece should also come to the parsonage he was very much perturbed in spirit there was a long consultation between him and his wife before anything could be settled and it may be doubted whether anything would have been settled had not mr trevelyan himself made his way to the parsonage on the second day of the family conference mr and mrs outhouse had both seen the necessity of sleeping upon the matter they had slept upon it and the discourse between them on the second day was so doubtful in its tone that more sleeping would probably have been necessary had not mr trevelyan appeared and compelled them to a decision  you must remember that i make no charge against her said trevelyan after the matter had been discussed for about an hour  then why should she not come back to you said mr outhouse timidly  some day she mayif she will be obedient but it cannot be now she has set me at defiance and even yet it is too clear from the tone of her letter to me that she thinks that she has been right to do so how could we live together in amity when she addresses me as a cruel tyrant  why did she go away at first asked mrs outhouse  because she would compromise my name by an intimacy which i did not approve but i do not come here to defend myself mrs outhouse you probably think that i have been wrong you are her friend and to you i will not even say that i have been right what i want you to understand is this she cannot come back to me now it would not be for my honour that she should do so  but sirwould it not be for your welfare as a christian asked mr outhouse  you must not be angry with me if i say that i will not discuss that just now i did not come here to discuss it  it is very sad for our poor niece said mrs outhouse  it is very sad for me said trevelyan gloomilyvery sad indeed my home is destroyed my life is made solitary i do not even see my own child she has her boy with her and her sister i have nobody  i cant understand for the life of me why you should not live together just like any other people said mrs outhouse whose womans spirit was arising in her bosom when people are married they must put up with somethingat least most always this she added lest it might be for a moment imagined that she had had any cause for complaint with her mr outhouse  pray excuse me mrs outhouse but i cannot discuss that the question between us is thiscan you consent to receive your two nieces till their fathers returnand if so in what way shall i defray the expense of their living you will of course understand that i willingly undertake the expense not only of my wifes maintenance and of her sisters also but that i will cheerfully allow anything that may be required either for their comfort or recreation  i cannot take my nieces into my house as lodgers said mr outhouse  no not as lodgers but of course you can understand that it is for me to pay for my own wife i know i owe you an apology for mentioning itbut how else could i make my request to you  if emily and nora come here they must come as our guests said mrs outhouse  certainly said the clergyman and if i am told they are in want of a home they shall find one here till their father comes but i am bound to say that as regards the elder i think her home should be elsewhere  of course it should said mrs outhouse i dont know anything about the law but it seems to me very odd that a young woman should be turned out in this way you say she has done nothing  i will not argue the matter said trevelyan  thats all very well mr trevelyan said the lady but shes my own niece and if i dont stand up for her i dont know who will i never heard such a thing in my life as a wife being sent away after such a fashion as that we wouldnt treat a cookmaid so that we wouldnt as for coming here she shall come if she pleases but i shall always say that its the greatest shame i ever heard of  nothing came of this visit at last the lady grew in her anger and mr trevelyan in his own defence was driven to declare that his wifes obstinate intimacy with colonel osborne had almost driven him out of his senses before he left the parsonage he was brought even to tears by his own narration of his own miserywhereby mr outhouse was considerably softened although mrs outhouse became more and more stout in the defence of her own sex but nothing at last came of it trevelyan insisted on paying for his wife wherever she might be placed and when he found that this would not be permitted to him at the parsonage he was very anxious to take some small furnished house in the neighbourhood in which the two sisters might live for the next six months under the wings of their uncle and aunt but even mr outhouse was moved to pleasantry by this suggestion as he explained the nature of the tenements which were common at st diddulphs two rooms front and back they might have for about fiveandsixpence a week in a house with three other families but perhaps that is not exactly what youd like said mr outhouse the interview ended with no result and mr trevelyan took his leave declaring to himself that he was worse off than the foxes who have holes in which to lay their headsbut it must be presumed that his sufferings in this respect were to be by attorney as it was for his wife and not for himself that the necessary hole was now required  as soon as he was gone mrs outhouse answered noras letter and without meaning to be explicit explained pretty closely what had taken place the spare bedroom at the parsonage was ready to receive either one or both of the sisters till sir marmaduke should be in london if one or both of them should choose to come and though there was no nursery at the parsonagefor mr and mrs outhouse had been blessed with no childrenstill room should be made for the little boy but they must come as visitorsas our own nieces said mrs outhouse and she went on to say that she would have nothing to do with the quarrel between mr trevelyan and his wife all such quarrels were very badbut as to this quarrel she could take no part either one side or the other then she stated that mr trevelyan had been at the parsonage but that no arrangement had been made because mr trevelyan had insisted on paying for their board and lodging  this letter reached nuncombe putney before any reply was received by mrs trevelyan from her husband this was on the saturday morning and mrs trevelyan had pledged herself to mrs stanbury that she would leave the clock house on the monday of course there was no need that she should do so both mrs stanbury and priscilla would now have willingly consented to their remaining till sir marmaduke should be in england but mrs trevelyans high spirit revolted against this after all that had been said she thought that she should hear from her husband on the morrow but the post on sunday brought no letter from trevelyan on the saturday they had finished packing upso certain was mrs trevelyan that some instructions as to her future destiny would be sent to her by her lord  at last they decided on the sunday that they would both go at once to st diddulphs or perhaps it would be more correct to say that this was the decision of the elder sister nora would willingly have yielded to priscillas entreaties and have remained but emily declared that she could not and would not stay in the house she had a few poundswhat would suffice for her journey and as mr trevelyan had not thought proper to send his orders to her she would go without them mrs outhouse was her aunt and her nearest relative in england upon whom else could she lean in this time of her great affliction a letter therefore was written to mrs outhouse saying that the whole party including the boy and nurse would be at st diddulphs on the monday evening and the last cord was put to the boxes  i suppose that he is very angry mrs trevelyan said to her sister but i do not feel that i care about that now he shall have nothing to complain of in reference to any gaiety on my part i will see no one i will have nocorrespondence but i will not remain here after what he has said to me let him be ever so angry i declare as i think of it it seems to me that no woman was ever so cruelly treated as i have been then she wrote one further line to her husband      not having received any orders from you and having    promised mrs stanbury that i would leave this house    on monday i go with nora to my aunt mrs outhouse    tomorrow     e t   on the sunday evening the four ladies drank tea together and they all made an effort to be civil and even affectionate to each other mrs trevelyan had at last allowed priscilla to explain how it had come to pass that she had told her brother that it would be better both for her mother and for herself that the existing arrangements should be brought to an end and there had come to be an agreement between them that they should all part in amity but the conversation on the sunday evening was very difficult  i am sure we shall always think of you both with the greatest kindness said mrs stanbury  as for me said priscilla your being with us has been a delight that i cannot describeonly it has been wrong  i know too well said mrs trevelyan that in our present circumstances we are unable to carry delight with us anywhere  you hardly understand what our life has been said priscilla but the truth is that we had no right to receive you in such a house as this it has not been our way of living and it cannot continue to be so it is not wonderful that people should talk of us had it been called your house it might have been better  and what will you do now asked nora  get out of this place as soon as we can it is often hard to go back to the right path but it may always be doneor at least attempted  it seems to me that i take misery with me wherever i go said mrs trevelyan  my dear it has not been your fault said mrs stanbury  i do not like to blame my brother said priscilla because he has done his best to be good to us alland the punishment will fall heaviest upon him because he must pay for it  he should not be allowed to pay a shilling said mrs trevelyan  then the morning came and at seven oclock the two sisters with the nurse and child started for lessboro station in mrs crockets open carriage the luggage having been sent on in a cart there were many tears shed and any one looking at the party would have thought that very dear friends were being torn asunder  mother said priscilla as soon as the parlour door was shut and the two were alone together we must take care that we never are brought again into such a mistake as that they who protect the injured should be strong themselves     chapter xxx  dorothy makes up her mind   it was true that most illnatured things had been said at lessboro and at nuncombe putney about mrs stanbury and the visitors at the clock house and that these illnatured things had spread themselves to exeter mrs ellison of lessboro who was not the most goodnatured woman in the world had told mrs merton of nuncombe that she had been told that the colonels visit to the lady had been made by express arrangement between the colonel and mrs stanbury mrs merton who was very goodnatured but not the wisest woman in the world had declared that any such conduct on the part of mrs stanbury was quite impossible what does it matter which it ispriscilla or her mother mrs ellison had said these are the facts mrs trevelyan has been sent there to be out of the way of this colonel and the colonel immediately comes down and sees her at the clock house but when people are very poor they do get driven to do almost anything  mrs merton not being very wise had conceived it to be her duty to repeat this to priscilla and mrs ellison not being very goodnatured had conceived it to be hers to repeat it to mrs machugh at exeter and then bozzles coming had become known  yes mrs machugh a policeman in mufti down at nuncombe i wonder what our friend in the close here will think about it i have always said you know that if she wanted to keep things straight at nuncombe she should have opened her pursestrings  from all which it may be understood that priscilla stanburys desire to go back to their old way of living had not been without reason  it may be imagined that miss stanbury of the close did not receive with equanimity the reports which reached her and of course when she discussed the matter either with martha or with dorothy she fell back upon her own early appreciation of the folly of the clock house arrangement nevertheless she had called mrs ellison very bad names when she learned from her friend mrs machugh what reports were being spread by the lady from lessboro  mrs ellison yes we all know mrs ellison the bitterest tongue in devonshire and the falsest there are some people at lessboro who would be well pleased if she paid her way there as well as those poor women do at nuncombe i dont think much of what mrs ellison says  but it is bad about the policeman said mrs machugh  of course its bad its all bad im not saying that its not bad im glad ive got this other young woman out of it its all that young mans doing if i had a son of my own id sooner follow him to the grave than hear him call himself a radical  then on a sudden there came to the close news that mrs trevelyan and her sister were gone on the very monday on which they went priscilla sent a note on to her sister in which no special allusion was made to aunt stanbury but which was no doubt written with the intention that the news should be communicated  gone are they as it is past wishing that they hadnt come its the best thing they could do now and who is to pay the rent of the house now they have gone as this was a point on which dorothy was not prepared to trouble herself at present she made no answer to the question  dorothy at this time was in a state of very great perturbation on her own account the reader may perhaps remember that she had been much startled by a proposition that had been made to her in reference to her future life her aunt had suggested to her that she should becomemrs gibson she had not as yet given any answer to that proposition and had indeed found it to be quite impossible to speak about it at all but there can be no doubt that the suggestion had opened out to her altogether new views of life up to the moment of her aunts speech to her the idea of her becoming a married woman had never presented itself to her in her humility it had not occurred to her that she should be counted as one among the candidates for matrimony priscilla had taught her to regard herselfindeed they had both so regarded themselvesas born to eat and drink as little as might be and then to die now when she was told that she could if she pleased become mrs gibson she was almost lost in a whirl of new and confused ideas since her aunt had spoken mr gibson himself had dropped a hint or two which seemed to her to indicate that he also must be in the secret there had been a party with a supper at mrs crumbies at which both the miss frenches had been present but mr gibson had taken her dorothy stanbury out to supper leaving both camilla and arabella behind him in the drawingroom during the quarter of an hour afterwards in which the ladies were alone while the gentlemen were eating and drinking both camilla and arabella continued to wreak their vengeance they asked questions about mrs trevelyan and suggested that mr gibson might be sent over to put things right but miss stanbury had heard them and had fallen upon them with a heavy hand  theres a good deal expected of mr gibson my dears she said which it seems to me mr gibson is not inclined to perform  it is quite indifferent to us what mr gibson may be inclined to perform said arabella im sure we shant interfere with miss dorothy  as this was said quite out loud before all the other ladies dorothy was overcome with shame but her aunt comforted her when they were again at home  laws my dear what does it matter when youre mrs gibson youll be proud of it all  was it then really written in the book of the fates that she dorothy stanbury was to become mrs gibson poor dorothy began to feel that she was called upon to exercise an amount of thought and personal decision to which she had not been accustomed hitherto in the things which she had done or left undone she had received instructions which she could obey had her mother and priscilla told her positively not to go to her aunts house she would have remained at nuncombe without complaint had her aunt since her coming given her orders as to her mode of lifeenjoined for instance additional church attendances or desired her to perform menial services in the houseshe would have obeyed from custom without a word but when she was told that she was to marry mr gibson it did seem to her to be necessary to do something more than obey did she love mr gibson she tried hard to teach herself to think that she might learn to love him he was a nicelooking man enough with sandy hair and a head rather bald with thin lips and a narrow nose who certainly did preach drawling sermons but of whom everybody said that he was a very excellent clergyman he had a house and an income and all exeter had long since decided that he was a man who would certainly marry he was one of those men of whom it may be said that they have no possible claim to remain unmarried he was fair game and unless he surrendered himself to be bagged before long would subject himself to just and loud complaint the miss frenches had been aware of this and had thought to make sure of him among them it was a little hard upon them that the old maid of the close as they always called miss stanbury should interfere with them when their booty was almost won and they felt it to be the harder because dorothy stanbury was as they thought so poor a creature that dorothy herself should have any doubt as to accepting mr gibson was an idea that never occurred to them but dorothy had her doubts when she came to think of it she remembered that she had never as yet spoken a word to mr gibson beyond such little trifling remarks as are made over a teatable she might learn to love him but she did not think that she loved him as yet  i dont suppose all this will make any difference to mr gibson said miss stanbury to her niece on the morning after the receipt of priscillas note stating that the trevelyans had left nuncombe  dorothy always blushed when mr gibsons name was mentioned and she blushed now but she did not at all understand her aunts allusion i dont know what you mean aunt she said  well you know my dear what they say about mrs trevelyan and the clock house is not very nice if mr gibson were to turn round and say that the connection wasnt pleasant no one would have a right to complain  the faint customary blush on dorothys cheeks which mr gibsons name had produced now covered her whole face even up to the roots of her hair if he believes bad of mamma im sure aunt stanbury i dont want to see him again  thats all very fine my dear but a man has to think of himself you know  of course he thinks of himself why shouldnt he i dare say he thinks of himself more than i do  dorothy dont be a fool a good husband isnt to be caught every day  aunt stanbury i dont want to catch any man  dorothy dont be a fool  i must say it i dont suppose mr gibson thinks of me the least in the world  psha i tell you he does  but as for mamma and priscilla i never could like anybody for a moment who would be ashamed of them  she was most anxious to declare that as far as she knew herself and her own wishes at present she entertained no partiality for mr gibsonno feeling which could become partiality even if mr gibson was to declare himself willing to accept her mother and her sister with herself but she did not dare to say so there was an instinct within her which made it almost impossible to her to express an objection to a suitor before the suitor had declared himself to be one she could speak out as touching her mother and her sisterbut as to her own feelings she could express neither assent nor dissent  i should like to have it settled soon said miss stanbury in a melancholy voice even to this dorothy could make no reply what did soon mean perhaps in the course of a year or two if it could be arranged by the end of this week it would be a great comfort to me dorothy almost fell off her chair and was stricken altogether dumb i told you i think that brooke burgess is coming here  you said he was to come some day  he is to be here on monday i havent seen him for more than twelve years and now hes to be here next week dear dear when i think sometimes of all the hard words that have been spoken and the harder thoughts that have been in peoples minds i often regret that the money ever came to me at all i could have done without it very wellvery well  but all the unpleasantness is over now aunt  i dont know about that unpleasantness of that kind is apt to rankle long but i wasnt going to give up my rights nobody but a coward does that they talked of going to law and trying the will but they wouldnt have got much by that and then they abused me for two years when they had done and got sick of it i told them they should have it all back again as soon as i am dead it wont be long now this burgess is the elder nephew and he shall have it all  is not he grateful  no why should he be grateful i dont do it for special love of him i dont want his gratitude nor anybodys gratitude look at hugh i did love him  i am grateful aunt stanbury  are you my dear then show it by being a good wife to mr gibson and a happy wife i want to get everything settled while burgess is here if he is to have it why should i keep him out of it whilst i live i wonder whether mr gibson would mind coming and living here dolly  the thing was coming so near to her that dorothy began to feel that she must in truth make up her mind and let her aunt know also how it had been made up she was sensible enough to perceive that if she did not prepare herself for the occasion she would find herself hampered by an engagement simply because her aunt had presumed that it was out of the question that she should not acquiesce she would drift into marriage with mr gibson against her will her greatest difficulty was the fact that her aunt clearly had no doubt on the subject and as for herself hitherto her feelings did not on either side go beyond doubts assuredly it would be a very good thing for her to become mrs gibson if only she could create for herself some attachment for the man at the present moment her aunt said nothing more about mr gibson having her mind much occupied with the coming of mr brooke burgess  i remember him twenty years ago and more as nice a boy as you would wish to see his father was the fourth of the brothers dear dear three of them are gone and the only one remaining is old barty whom no one ever loved  the burgesses had been great people in exeter having been both bankers and brewers there but the light of the family had paled and though bartholomew burgess of whom miss stanbury declared that no one had ever loved him still had a share in the bank it was well understood in the city that the real wealth in the firm of cropper and burgess belonged to the cropper family indeed the most considerable portion of the fortune that had been realised by old mr burgess had come into the possession of miss stanbury herself bartholomew burgess had never forgiven his brothers will and between him and jemima stanbury the feud was irreconcileable the next brother tom burgess had been a solicitor at liverpool and had done well there but miss stanbury knew nothing of the tom burgesses as she called them the fourth brother harry burgess had been a clergyman and this brooke burgess junior who was now coming to the close had been left with a widowed mother the eldest of a large family it need not now be told at length how there had been illblood also between this clergyman and the heiress there had been attempts at friendship and at one time miss stanbury had received the rev harry burgess and all his family at the closebut the attempts had not been successful and though our old friend had never wavered in her determination to leave the money all back to some one of the burgess family and with this view had made a pilgrimage to london some twelve years since and had renewed her acquaintance with the widow and the children still there had been no comfortable relations between her and any of the burgess family old barty burgess whom she met in the close or saw in the high street every day of her life was her great enemy he had tried his bestso at least she was convincedto drive her out of the pale of society years upon years ago by saying evil things of her she had conquered in that combat her victory had been complete and she had triumphed after a most signal fashion but this triumph did not silence bartys tongue nor soften his heart when she prayed to be forgiven as she herself forgave others she always exempted barty burgess from her prayers there are things which flesh and blood cannot do she had not liked harry burgess widow nor for the matter of that harry burgess himself when she had last seen the children she had not liked any of them much and had had her doubts even as to brooke but with that branch of the family she was willing to try again brooke was now coming to the close having received however an intimation that if during his visit to exeter he chose to see his uncle barty any such intercourse must be kept quite in the background while he remained in miss stanburys house he was to remain there as though there were no such person as mr bartholomew burgess in exeter  at this time brooke burgess was a man just turned thirty and was a clerk in the ecclesiastical record office in somerset house no doubt the peculiar nature and name of the public department to which he was attached had done something to recommend him to miss stanbury ecclesiastical records were things greatly to be reverenced in her eyes and she felt that a gentleman who handled them and dealt with them would probably be sedate gentlemanlike and conservative brooke burgess when she had last seen him was just about to enter upon the duties of the office then there had come offence and she had in truth known nothing of him from that day to this the visitor was to be at exeter on the following monday and very much was done in preparation of his coming there was to be a dinner party on that very day and dinner parties were not common with miss stanbury she had however explained to martha that she intended to put her best foot forward martha understood perfectly that mr brooke burgess was to be received as the heir of property sir peter mancrudy the great devonshire chemist was coming to dinner and mr and mrs powel from haldonpeople of great distinction in that part of the countymrs machugh of course and equally of course mr gibson there was a deep discussion between miss stanbury and martha as to asking two of the cliffords and mr and mrs noel from doddiscombeleigh martha had been very much in favour of having twelve miss stanbury had declared that with twelve she must have two waiters from the greengrocers and that two waiters would overpower her own domesticities below stairs martha had declared that she didnt care about them any more than if they were puppy dogs but miss stanbury had been quite firm against twelve she had consented to have tenfor the sake of artistic arrangement at the table they should be pantaloons and petticoats alternate you know she had said to marthaand had therefore asked the cliffords but the cliffords could not come and then she had declined to make any further attempt indeed a new idea had struck her brooke burgess her guest should sit at one end of the table and mr gibson the clergyman at the other in this way the proper alternation would be effected when martha heard this martha quite understood the extent of the good fortune that was in store for dorothy if mr gibson was to be welcomed in that way it could only be in preparation of his becoming one of the family  and dorothy herself became aware that she must make up her mind it was not so declared to her but she came to understand that it was very probable that something would occur on the coming monday which would require her to be ready with her answer on that day and she was greatly tormented by feeling that if she could not bring herself to accept mr gibsonshould mr gibson propose to her as to which she continued to tell herself that the chance of such a thing must be very remote indeedbut that if he should propose to her and if she could not accept him her aunt ought to know that it would be so before the moment came but yet she could not bring herself to speak to her aunt as though any such proposition were possible  it happened that during the week on the saturday priscilla came into exeter dorothy met her sister at the railway station and then the two walked together two miles and back along the crediton road aunt stanbury had consented to priscilla coming to the close even though it was not the day appointed for such visits but the walk had been preferred and dorothy felt that she would be able to ask for counsel from the only human being to whom she could have brought herself to confide the fact that a gentleman was expected to ask her to marry him but it was not till they had turned upon their walk that she was able to open her mouth on the subject even to her sister priscilla had been very full of their own cares at nuncombe and had said much of her determination to leave the clock house and to return to the retirement of some small cottage she had already written to hugh to this effect and during their walk had said much of her own folly in having consented to so great a change in their mode of life at last dorothy struck in with her story  aunt stanbury wants me to make a change too  what change asked priscilla anxiously  it is not my idea priscilla and i dont think that there can be anything in it indeed im sure there isnt i dont see how its possible that there should be  but what is it dolly  i suppose there cant be any harm in my telling you  if its anything concerning yourself i should say not if it concerns aunt stanbury i dare say shed rather you held your tongue  it concerns me most said dorothy  she doesnt want you to leave her does she  well yes no by what she said lasti shouldnt leave her at all in that way only im sure its not possible  i am the worst hand in the world dolly at guessing a riddle  youve heard of that mr gibson the clergymanhavent you  of course i have  well mind you know its only what aunt stanbury says he has never so much as opened his lips to me himself except to say how do you do and that kind of thing  aunt stanbury wants you to marry him  yes  well  of course its out of the question said dorothy sadly  i dont see why it should be out of the question said priscilla proudly indeed if aunt stanbury has said much about it i should say that mr gibson himself must have spoken to her  do you think he has  i do not believe that my aunt would raise false hopes said priscilla  but i havent any hopes that is to say i had never thought about such a thing  but you think about it now dolly  i should never have dreamed about it only for aunt stanbury  but dearest you are dreaming of it now are you not  only because she says that it is to be so you dont know how generous she is she says that if it should be so she will give me ever so much moneytwo thousand pounds  then i am quite sure that she and mr gibson must understand each other  of course said dorothy sadly if he were to think of such a thing at all it would only be because the money would be convenient  not at all said priscilla sternlywith a sternness that was very comfortable to her listener not at all why should not mr gibson love you as well as any man ever loved any woman you are nicelookingdorothy blushed beneath her hat even at her sisters praiseand goodtempered and lovable in every way and i think you are just fitted to make a good wife and you must not suppose dolly that because mr gibson wouldnt perhaps have asked you without the money that therefore he is mercenary it so often happens that a gentleman cant marry unless the lady has some money  but he hasnt asked me at all  i suppose he will dear  i only know what aunt stanbury says  you may be sure that he will ask you  and what must i say priscilla  what must you say nobody can tell you that dear but yourself do you like him  i dont dislike him  is that all  i know him so very little priscilla everybody says he is very goodand then its a great thing isnt it that he should be a clergyman  i dont know about that  i think it is if it were possible that i should ever marry any one i should like a clergyman so much the best  then you do know what to say to him  no i dont priscilla i dont know at all  look here dearest what my aunt offers to you is a very great step in life if you can accept this gentleman i think you would be happyand i think also which should be of more importance for your consideration that you would make him happy it is a brighter prospect dear dolly than to live either with us at nuncombe or even with aunt stanbury as her niece  but if i dont love him priscilla  then give it up and be as you are my own own dearest sister  so i will said dorothy and at that time her mind was made up      illustration dorothy makes up her mind     chapter xxxi  mr brooke burgess      illustration  the hour at which mr brooke burgess was to arrive had come round and miss stanbury was in a twitter partly of expectation and partly it must be confessed of fear why there should be any fear she did not herself know as she had much to give and nothing to expect but she was afraid and was conscious of it and was out of temper because she was ashamed of herself although it would be necessary that she should again dress for dinner at six she had put on a clean cap at four and appeared at that early hour in one of her gowns which was not customarily in use for home purposes at that early hour she felt that she was an old fool for her pains and was consequently cross to poor dorothy and there were other reasons for some display of harshness to her niece mr gibson had been at the house that very morning and dorothy had given herself airs at least so miss stanbury thought and during the last three or four days whenever mr gibsons name had been mentioned dorothy had become silent glum and almost obstructive miss stanbury had been at the trouble of explaining that she was specially anxious to have that little matter of the engagement settled at once she knew that she was going to behave with great generositythat she was going to sacrifice not her money only of which she did not think much but a considerable portion of her authority of which she did think a great deal and that she was about to behave in a manner which demanded much gratitude but it seemed to her that dorothy was not in the least grateful hugh had proved himself to be a mass of ingratitude as she was in the habit of saying none of the burgesses had ever shown to her any gratitude for promises made to them or indeed for any substantial favours conferred upon them and now dorothy to whom a very seventh heaven of happiness had been openeda seventh heaven as it must be computed in comparison with her low expectationsnow dorothy was already shewing how thankless she could become mr gibson had not yet declared his passion but he had freely admitted to miss stanbury that he was prepared to do so priscilla had been quite right in her suggestion that there was a clear understanding between the clergyman and her aunt  i dont think he is come after all said miss stanbury looking at her watch had the train arrived at the moment that it was due had the expectant visitor jumped out of the railway carriage into a fly and had the driver galloped up to the close it might have been possible that the wheels should have been at the door as miss stanbury spoke  its hardly time yet aunt  nonsense it is time the train comes in at four i dare say he wont come at all  he is sure to come aunt  ive no doubt you know all about it better than any one else you usually do then five minutes were passed in silence heaven and earth what shall i do with these people that are coming and i told them especially that it was to meet this young man its the way i am always treated by everybody that i have about me  the train might be ten minutes late aunt stanbury  yesand monkeys might chew tobacco theretheres the omnibus at the cock and bottle the omnibus up from the train now of course he wont come  perhaps hes walking aunt stanbury  walkingwith his luggage on his shoulders is that your idea of the way in which a london gentleman goes about and there are two fliescoming up from the train of course miss stanbury was obliged to fix the side of her chair very close to the window in order that she might see that part of the close in which the vehicles of which she had spoken were able to pass  perhaps they are not coming from the train aunt stanbury  perhaps a fiddlestick you have lived here so much longer than i have done that of course you must know all about it then there was an interval of another ten minutes and even dorothy was beginning to think that mr burgess was not coming ive given him up now said miss stanbury i think ill send and put them all off just at that moment there came a knock at the door but there was no cab dorothys conjecture had been right the london gentleman had walked and his portmanteau had been carried behind him by a boy how did he get here exclaimed miss stanbury as she heard the strange voice speaking to martha downstairs but dorothy knew better than to answer the question  miss stanbury i am very glad to see you said mr brooke burgess as he entered the room miss stanbury courtesied and then took him by both hands you wouldnt have known me i dare say he continued a black beard and a bald head do make a difference  you are not bald at all said miss stanbury  i am beginning to be thin enough at the top i am so glad to come to you and so much obliged to you for having me how well i remember the old room  this is my niece miss dorothy stanbury from nuncombe putney dorothy was about to make some formal acknowledgment of the introduction when brooke burgess came up to her and shook her hand heartily she lives with me continued the aunt  and what has become of hugh said brooke  we never talk of him said miss stanbury gravely  i hope theres nothing wrong i hear of him very often in london  my aunt and he dont agreethats all said dorothy  he has given up his profession as a barristerin which he might have lived like a gentleman said miss stanbury and has taken to writing for apenny newspaper  everybody does that now miss stanbury  i hope you dont mr burgess  i nobody would print anything that i wrote i dont write for anything certainly  im very glad to hear it said miss stanbury  brooke burgess or mr brooke as he came to be called very shortly by the servants in the house was a goodlooking man with black whiskers and black hair which as he said was beginning to be thin on the top of his head and pleasant small bright eyes dorothy thought that next to her brother hugh he was the most goodnatured looking man she had ever seen he was rather below the middle height and somewhat inclined to be stout but he would boast that he could still walk his twelve miles in three hours and would add that as long as he could do that he would never recognise the necessity of putting himself on short commons he had a wellcut nose not quite aquiline but tending that way a chin with a dimple on it and as sweet a mouth as ever declared the excellence of a mans temper dorothy immediately began to compare him with her brother hugh who was to her of all men the most godlike it never occurred to her to make any comparison between mr gibson and mr burgess her brother hugh was the most godlike of men but there was something godlike also about the new comer mr gibson to dorothys eyes was by no means divine  i used to call you aunt stanbury said brooke burgess to the old lady am i to go on doing it now  you may call me what you like said miss stanbury onlydear mei never did see anybody so much altered before she went up to dress herself for dinner miss stanbury was quite restored to her good humour as dorothy could perceive  the dinner passed off well enough mr gibson at the head of the table did indeed look very much out of his element as though he conceived that his position revealed to the outer world those ideas of his in regard to dorothy which ought to have been secret for a while longer there are few men who do not feel ashamed of being paraded before the world as acknowledged suitors whereas ladies accept the position with something almost of triumph the lady perhaps regards herself as the successful angler whereas the gentleman is conscious of some similitude to the unsuccessful fish mr gibson though he was not yet gasping in the basket had some presentiment of this feeling which made his present seat of honour unpleasant to him brooke burgess at the other end of the table was as gay as a lark mrs machugh sat on one side of him and miss stanbury on the other and he laughed at the two old ladies reminding them of his former doings in exeterhow he had hunted mrs machughs cat and had stolen aunt stanburys best apricot jam till everybody began to perceive that he was quite a success even sir peter mancrudy laughed at his jokes and mrs powel from the other side of sir peter stretched her head forward so that she might become one of the gay party  there isnt a word of it true said miss stanbury its all pure invention and a great scandal i never did such a thing in my life  didnt you though said brooke burgess i remember it as well as if it was yesterday and old dr ball the prebendary with the carbuncles on his nose saw it too  dr ball had no carbuncles on his nose said mrs machugh youll say next that i have carbuncles on my nose  he had three i remember each of them quite well and so does sir peter  then everybody laughed and martha who was in the room knew that brooke burgess was a complete success  in the meantime mr gibson was talking to dorothy but dorothy was endeavouring to listen to the conversation at the other end of the table i found it very dirty on the roads today outside the city said mr gibson  very dirty said dorothy looking round at mr burgess as she spoke  but the pavement in the high street was dry enough  quite dry said dorothy then there came a peal of laughter from mrs machugh and sir peter and dorothy wondered whether anybody before had ever made those two steady old people laugh after that fashion  i should so like to get a drive with you up to the top of haldon hill said mr gibson when the weather gets fine that is mrs powel was talking about it  it would be very nice said dorothy  you have never seen the view from haldon hill yet asked mr gibson but to this question dorothy could make no answer miss stanbury had lifted one of the tablespoons as though she was going to strike mr brooke burgess with the bowl of it and this during a dinner party from that moment dorothy turned herself round and became one of the listeners to the fun at the other end of the table poor mr gibson soon found himself nowhere  i never saw a man so much altered in my life said mrs machugh up in the drawingroom i dont remember that he used to be clever  he was a bright boy said miss stanbury  but the burgesses all used to be such serious straitlaced people said mrs machugh excellent people she added remembering the source of her friends wealth but none of them like that  i call him a very handsome man said mrs powel i suppose hes not married yet  oh dear no said miss stanbury theres time enough for him yet  hell find plenty here to set their caps at him said mrs machugh  hes a little old for my girls said mrs powel laughing mrs powel was the happy mother of four daughters of whom the eldest was only twelve  there are others who are more forward said mrs machugh what a chance it would be for dear arabella french  heaven forbid said miss stanbury  and then poor mr gibson wouldnt be any longer like the donkey between two bundles of hay said mrs powel dorothy was quite determined that she would never marry a man who was like a donkey between two bundles of hay  when the gentlemen came up into the drawingroom dorothy was seated behind the urn and teathings at a large table in such a position as to be approached only at one side there was one chair at her left hand but at her right hand there was no room for a seatonly room for some civil gentleman to take away full cups and bring them back empty dorothy was not sufficiently readywitted to see the danger of this position till mr gibson had seated himself in the chair then it did seem cruel to her that she should be thus besieged for the rest of the evening as she had been also at dinner while the tea was being consumed mr gibson assisted at the service asking ladies whether they would have cake or bread and butter but when all that was over dorothy was still in her prison and mr gibson was still the jailer at the gate she soon perceived that everybody else was chatting and laughing and that brooke burgess was the centre of a little circle which had formed itself quite at a distance from her seat once twice thrice she meditated an escape but she had not the courage to make the attempt she did not know how to manage it she was conscious that her aunts eye was upon her and that her aunt would expect her to listen to mr gibson at last she gave up all hope of moving and was anxious simply that mr gibson should confine himself to the dirt of the paths and the noble prospect from haldon hill  i think we shall have more rain before we are done with it he said twice before during the evening he had been very eloquent about the rain  i dare say we shall said dorothy and then there came the sound of loud laughter from sir peter and dorothy could see that he was poking brooke burgess in the ribs there had never been anything so gay before since she had been in exeter and now she was hemmed up in that corner away from it all by mr gibson  this mr burgess seems to be different from the other burgesses said mr gibson  i think he must be very clever said dorothy  wellyes in a sort of a way what people call a merry andrew  i like people who make me laugh and laugh themselves said dorothy  i quite agree with you that laughter is a very good thingin its place i am not at all one of those who would make the world altogether grave there are serious things and there must be serious moments  of course said dorothy  and i think that serious conversation upon the whole has more allurements than conversation which when you come to examine it is found to mean nothing dont you  i suppose everybody should mean something when he talks  just so that is exactly my idea said mr gibson on all such subjects as that i should be so sorry if you and i did not agree i really should then he paused and dorothy was so confounded by what she conceived to be the dangers of the coming moment that she was unable even to think what she ought to say she heard mrs machughs clear sharp merry voice and she heard her aunts tone of pretended anger and she heard sir peters continued laughter and brooke burgess as he continued the telling of some story but her own trouble was too great to allow of her attending to what was going on at the other end of the room there is nothing as to which i am so anxious as that you and i should agree about serious things said mr gibson  i suppose we do agree about going to church said dorothy she knew that she could have made no speech more stupid more senseless more inefficaciousbut what was she to say in answer to such an assurance  i hope so said mr gibson and i think so your aunt is a most excellent woman and her opinion has very great weight with me on all subjectseven as to matters of church discipline and doctrine in which as a clergyman i am of course presumed to be more at home but your aunt is a woman among a thousand  of course i think she is very good  and she is so right about this young man and her property dont you think so  quite right mr gibson  because you know to you of course being her near relative and the one she has singled out as the recipient of her kindness it might have been cause for some discontent  discontent to me mr gibson  i am quite sure your feelings are what they ought to be and for myself if i ever werethat is to say supposing i could be in any way interested but perhaps it is premature to make any suggestion on that head at present  i dont at all understand what you mean mr gibson  i thought that perhaps i might take this opportunity of expressing but after all the levity of the moment is hardly in accordance with the sentiments which i should wish to express  i think that i ought to go to my aunt now mr gibson as perhaps she might want something then she did push back her chair and stand upon her legsand mr gibson after pausing for a moment allowed her to escape soon after that the visitors went and brooke burgess was left in the drawingroom with miss stanbury and dorothy  how well i recollect all the people said brooke sir peter and old mrs machugh and mrs powel who then used to be called the beautiful miss noel and i remember every bit of furniture in the room  nothing changed except the old woman brooke said miss stanbury  upon my word you are the least changed of allexcept that you dont seem to be so terrible as you were then  was i very terrible brooke  my mother had told me i fancy that i was never to make a noise and be sure not to break any of the china you were always very goodnatured and when you gave me a silver watch i could hardly believe the extent of my own bliss  you wouldnt care about a watch from an old woman now brooke  you try me but what rakes you are here its past eleven oclock and i must go and have a smoke  have a what said miss stanbury with a startled air  a smoke you neednt be frightened i dont mean in the house  noi hope you dont mean that  but i may take a turn round the close with a pipemaynt i  i suppose all young men do smoke now said miss stanbury sorrowfully  every one of them and they tell me that the young women mean to take to it before long  if i saw a young woman smoking i should blush for my sex and though she were the nearest and dearest that i had i would never speak to hernever dorothy i dont think mr gibson smokes  im sure i dont know aunt  i hope he doesnt i do hope that he does not i cannot understand what pleasure it is that men take in making chimneys of themselves and going about smelling so that no one can bear to come near them  brooke merely laughed at this and went his way and smoked his pipe out in the close while martha sat up to let him in when he had finished it then dorothy escaped at once to her room fearful of being questioned by her aunt about mr gibson she had she thought now quite made up her mind there was nothing in mr gibson that she liked she was by no means so sure as she had been when she was talking to her sister that she would prefer a clergyman to any one else she had formed no strong ideas on the subject of lovemaking but she did think that any man who really cared for her would find some other way of expressing his love than that which mr gibson had adopted and then mr gibson had spoken to her about her aunts money in a way that was distasteful to her she thought that she was quite sure that if he should ask her she would not accept him  she was nearly undressed nearly safe for the night when there came a knock at the door and her aunt entered the room he has come in said miss stanbury  i suppose he has had his pipe then  i wish he didnt smoke i do wish he didnt smoke but i suppose an old woman like me is only making herself a fool to care about such things if they all do it i cant prevent them he seems to be a very nice young manin other things does he not dolly  very nice indeed aunt stanbury  and he has done very well in his office and as for his saying that he must smoke i like that a great deal better than doing it on the sly  i dont think mr burgess would do anything on the sly aunt  no no i dont think he would dear me hes not at all like what i fancied  everybody seemed to like him very much  didnt they i never saw sir peter so much taken and there was quite a flirtation between him and mrs machugh and now my dear tell me about mr gibson  there is nothing to tell aunt stanbury  isnt there from what i saw going on i thought there would be something to tell he was talking to you the whole evening  as it happened he was sitting next to meof course  indeed he was sitting next to youso much so that i thought everything would be settled  if i tell you something aunt stanbury you mustnt be angry with me  tell me what what is it you have to tell me  i dont think i shall ever care for mr gibsonnot in that way  why not dorothy  im sure he doesnt care for me and i dont think he means it  i tell you he does mean it mean it why i tell you it has all been settled between us since i first spoke to you i have explained to him exactly what i intend to do he knows that he can give up his house and come and live here i am sure he must have said something about it to you tonight  not a word aunt stanbury  then he will  dear aunt i do so wish you would prevent it i dont like him i dont indeed  not like him  noi dont care for him a bit and i never shall i cant help it aunt stanbury i thought i would try but i find it would be impossible you cant want me to marry a man if i dont love him  i never heard of such a thing in my life not love him and why shouldnt you love him hes a gentleman everybody respects him hell have plenty to make you comfortable all your life and then why didnt you tell me before  i didnt know aunt stanbury i thought that perhaps  perhaps what  i could not say all at once that i didnt care for him when i had never so much as thought about it for a moment before  you havent told him this  no i have not told him i couldnt begin by telling him you know  then i must pray that you will think about it again have you imagined what a great thing for you it would be to be established for lifeso that you should never have any more trouble again about a home or about money or anything dont answer me now dorothy but think of it it seemed to me that i was doing such an excellent thing for both of you so saying miss stanbury left the room and dorothy was enabled to obey her at any rate in one matter she did think of it she laid awake thinking of it almost all the night but the more she thought of it the less able was she to realise to herself any future comfort or happiness in the idea of becoming mrs gibson     chapter xxxii  the full moon at st diddulphs   the receipt of mrs trevelyans letter on that monday morning was a great surprise both to mr and mrs outhouse there was no time for any consideration no opportunity for delaying their arrival till they should have again referred the matter to mr trevelyan their two nieces were to be with them on that evening and even the telegraph wires if employed with such purpose would not be quick enough to stop their coming the party as they knew would have left nuncombe putney before the arrival of the letter at the parsonage of st diddulphs there would have been nothing in this to have caused vexation had it not been decided between trevelyan and mr outhouse that mrs trevelyan was not to find a home at the parsonage mr outhouse was greatly afraid of being so entangled in the matter as to be driven to take the part of the wife against the husband and mrs outhouse though she was full of indignation against trevelyan was at the same time not free from anger in regard to her own niece she more than once repeated that most unjust of all proverbs which declares that there is never smoke without fire and asserted broadly that she did not like to be with people who could not live at home husbands with wives and wives with husbands in a decent respectable manner nevertheless the preparations went on busily and when the party arrived at seven oclock in the evening two rooms had been prepared close to each other one for the two sisters and the other for the child and nurse although poor mr outhouse himself was turned out of his own little chamber in order that the accommodation might be given they were all very hot very tired and very dusty when the cab reached the parsonage there had been the preliminary drive from nuncombe putney to lessboro then the railway journey from thence to the waterloo bridge station had been long and it had seemed to them that the distance from the station to st diddulphs had been endless when the cabman was told whither he was to go he looked doubtingly at his poor old horse and then at the luggage which he was required to pack on the top of his cab and laid himself out for his work with a full understanding that it would not be accomplished without considerable difficulty the cabman made it twelve miles from waterloo bridge to st diddulphs and suggested that extra passengers and parcels would make the fare up to ten and six had he named double as much mrs trevelyan would have assented so great was the fatigue and so wretched the occasion that there was sobbing and crying in the cab and when at last the parsonage was reached even the nurse was hardly able to turn her hand to anything the poor wanderers were made welcome on that evening without a word of discussion as to the cause of their coming i hope you are not angry with us uncle oliphant emily trevelyan had said with tears in her eyes angry with you my dearfor coming to our house how could i be angry with you then the travellers were hurried upstairs by mrs outhouse and the master of the parsonage was left alone for a while he certainly was not angry but he was ill at ease and unhappy his guests would probably remain with him for six or seven months he had resolutely refused all payment from mr trevelyan but nevertheless he was a poor man it is impossible to conceive that a clergyman in such a parish as st diddulphs without a private income should not be a poor man it was but a handtomouth existence which he lived paying his way as his money came to him and sharing the proceeds of his parish with the poor he was always more or less in debt that was quite understood among the tradesmen and the butcher who trusted him though he was a bad churchman did not look upon the parsons account as he did on other debts he would often hint to mr outhouse that a little money ought to be paid and then a little money would be paid but it was never expected that the parsonage bill should be settled in such a household the arrival of four guests who were expected to remain for an almost indefinite number of months could not be regarded without dismay on that first evening emily and nora did come down to tea but they went up again to their rooms almost immediately afterwards and mr outhouse found that many hours of solitary meditation were allowed to him on the occasion i suppose your brother has been told all about it he said to his wife as soon as they were together on that evening  yeshe has been told she did not write to her mother till after she had got to nuncombe putney she did not like to speak about her troubles while there was a hope that things might be made smooth  you cant blame her for that my dear  but there was a month lost or nearly letters go only once a month and now they cant hear from marmaduke or bessylady rowleys name was bessytill the beginning of september  that will be in a fortnight  but what can my brother say to them he will suppose that they are still down in devonshire  you dont think he will come at once  how can he my dear he cant come without leave and the expense would be ruinous they would stop his pay and there would be all manner of evils he is to come in the spring and they must stay here till he comes the parson of st diddulphs sighed and groaned would it not have been almost better that he should have put his pride in his pocket and have consented to take mr trevelyans money  on the second morning hugh stanbury called at the parsonage and was closeted for a while with the parson nora had heard his voice in the passage and every one in the house knew who it was that was talking to mr outhouse in the little back parlour that was called a study nora was full of anxiety would he ask to see themto see her and why was he there so long no doubt he has brought a message from mr trevelyan said her sister i dare say he will send word that i ought not to have come to my uncles house then at last both mr outhouse and hugh stanbury came into the room in which they were all sitting the greetings were cold and unsatisfactory and nora barely allowed hugh to touch the tip of her fingers she was very angry with him and yet she knew that her anger was altogether unreasonable that he had caused her to refuse a marriage that had so much to attract her was not his sinnot that but that having thus overpowered her by his influence he should then have stopped and yet nora had told herself twenty times that it was quite impossible that she should become hugh stanburys wifeand that were hugh stanbury to ask her it would become her to be indignant with him for daring to make a proposition so outrageous and now she was sick at heart because he did not speak to her  he had of course come to st diddulphs with a message from trevelyan and his secret was soon told to them all trevelyan himself was upstairs in the sanded parlour of the full moon publichouse round the corner mrs trevelyan when she heard this clasped her hands and bit her lips what was he there for if he wanted to see her why did he not come boldly to the parsonage but it soon appeared that he had no desire to see his wife i am to take louey to him said hugh stanbury if you will allow me  whatto be taken away from me exclaimed the mother but hugh assured her that no such idea had been formed that he would have concerned himself in no such stratagem and that he would himself undertake to bring the boy back again within an hour emily was of course anxious to be informed what other message was to be conveyed to her but there was no other messageno message either of love or of instruction  mr stanbury said the parson has left something in my hands for you this something was given over to her as soon as stanbury had left the house and consisted of cheques for various small sums amounting in all to £200 and he hasnt said what i am to do with it emily asked of her uncle mr outhouse declared that the cheques had been given to him without any instructions on that head mr trevelyan had simply expressed his satisfaction that his wife should be with her uncle and aunt had sent the money and had desired to see the child  the boy was got ready and hugh walked with him in his arms round the corner to the full moon he had to pass by the bar and the barmaid and the potboy looked at him very hard theres a young ooman has to do with that ere little game said the potboy and its two to one the young ooman has the worst of it said the barmaid they mostly does said the potboy not without some feeling of pride in the immunities of his sex here he is said hugh as he entered the parlour my boy theres papa the child at this time was more than a year old and could crawl about and use his own legs with the assistance of a finger to his little hand and could utter a sound which the fond mother interpreted to mean papa for with all her hot anger against her husband the mother was above all things anxious that her child should be taught to love his fathers name she would talk of her separation from her husband as though it must be permanent she would declare to her sister how impossible it was that they should ever again live together she would repeat to herself over and over the tale of the injustice that had been done to her assuring herself that it was out of the question that she should ever pardon the man but yet at the bottom of her heart there was a hope that the quarrel should be healed before her boy would be old enough to understand the nature of quarrelling trevelyan took the child on to his knee and kissed him but the poor little fellow startled by his transference from one male set of arms to another confused by the strangeness of the room and by the absence of things familiar to his sight burst out into loud tears he had stood the journey round the corner in hughs arms manfully and though he had looked about him with very serious eyes as he passed through the bar he had borne that and his carriage up the stairs but when he was transferred to his father whose air as he took the boy was melancholy and lugubrious in the extreme the poor little fellow could endure no longer a mode of treatment so unusual and with a grimace which for a moment or two threatened the coming storm burst out with an infantine howl thats how he has been taught said trevelyan      illustration the full moon at st diddulphs   nonsense said stanbury hes not been taught at all its nature  nature that he should be afraid of his own father he did not cry when he was with you  noas it happened he did not i played with him when i was at nuncombe but of course one cant tell when a child will cry and when it wont  my darling my dearest my own son said trevelyan caressing the child and trying to comfort him but the poor little fellow only cried the louder it was now nearly two months since he had seen his father and when age is counted by months only almost everything may be forgotten in six weeks i suppose you must take him back again said trevelyan sadly  of course i must take him back again come along louey my boy  it is cruelvery cruel said trevelyan no man living could love his child better than i love mineor for the matter of that his wife it is very cruel  the remedy is in your own hands trevelyan said stanbury as he marched off with the boy in his arms  trevelyan had now become so accustomed to being told by everybody that he was wrong and was at the same time so convinced that he was right that he regarded the perversity of his friends as a part of the persecution to which he was subjected even lady milborough who objected to colonel osborne quite as strongly as did trevelyan himself even she blamed him now telling him that he had done wrong to separate himself from his wife mr bideawhile the old family lawyer was of the same opinion trevelyan had spoken to mr bideawhile as to the expediency of making some lasting arrangement for a permanent maintenance for his wife but the attorney had told him that nothing of the kind could be held to be lasting it was clearly the husbands duty to look forward to a reconciliation and mr bideawhile became quite severe in the tone of rebuke which he assumed stanbury treated him almost as though he were a madman and as for his wife herselfwhen she wrote to him she would not even pretend to express any feeling of affection and yet as he thought no man had ever done more for a wife when stanbury had gone with the child he sat waiting for him in the parlour of the publichouse as miserable a man as one could find he had promised himself something that should be akin to pleasure in seeing his boybut it had been all disappointment and pain what was it that they expected him to do what was it that they desired his wife had behaved with such indiscretion as almost to have compromised his honour and in return for that he was to beg her pardon confess himself to have done wrong and allow her to return in triumph that was the light in which he regarded his own position but he promised to himself that let his own misery be what it might he would never so degrade him the only person who had been true to him was bozzle let them all look to it if there were any further intercourse between his wife and colonel osborne he would take the matter into open court and put her away publicly let mr bideawhile say what he might bozzle should see to thatand as to himself he would take himself out of england and hide himself abroad bozzle should know his address but he would give it to no one else nothing on earth should make him yield to a woman who had illtreated himnothing but confession and promise of amendment on her part if she would acknowledge and promise then he would forgive all and the events of the last four months should never again be mentioned by him so resolving he sat and waited till stanbury should return to him  when stanbury got back to the parsonage with the boy he had nothing to do but to take his leave he would fain have asked permission to come again could he have invented any reason for doing so but the child was taken from him at once by its mother and he was left alone with mr outhouse nora rowley did not even show herself and he hardly knew how to express sympathy and friendship for the guests at the parsonage without seeming to be untrue to his friend trevelyan i hope all this may come to an end soon he said  i hope it may mr stanbury said the clergyman but to tell you the truth it seems to me that mr trevelyan is so unreasonable a man so much like a madman indeed that i hardly know how to look forward to any future happiness for my niece this was spoken with the utmost severity that mr outhouse could assume  and yet no man loves his wife more tenderly  tender love should show itself by tender conduct mr stanbury what has he done to his wife he has blackened her name among all his friends and hers he has turned her out of his house he has reviled herand then thinks to prove how good he is by sending her money the only possible excuse is that he must be mad  stanbury went back to the full moon and retraced his steps with his friend towards lincolns inn two minutes took him from the parsonage to the publichouse but during these two minutes he resolved that he would speak his mind roundly to trevelyan as they returned home trevelyan should either take his wife back again at once or else he stanbury would have no more to do with him he said nothing till they had threaded together the maze of streets which led them from the neighbourhood of the church of st diddulphs into the straight way of the commercial road then he began trevelyan said he you are wrong in all this from beginning to end  what do you mean  just what i say if there was anything in what your wife did to offend you a soft word from you would have put it all right  a soft word how do you know what soft words i used  a soft word now would do it you have only to bid her come back to you and let bygones be bygones and all would be right cant you be man enough to remember that you are a man  stanbury i believe you want to quarrel with me  i tell you fairly that i think that you are wrong  they have talked you over to their side  i know nothing about sides i only know that you are wrong  and what would you have me do  go and travel together for six months here was lady milboroughs receipt again travel together for a year if you will then come back and live where you please people will have forgotten itor if they remember it what matters no sane person can advise you to go on as you are doing now  but it was of no avail before they had reached the bank the two friends had quarrelled and had parted then trevelyan felt that there was indeed no one left to him but bozzle on the following morning he saw bozzle and on the evening of the next day he was in paris     chapter xxxiii  hugh stanbury smokes another pipe   trevelyan was gone and bozzle alone knew his address during the first fortnight of her residence at st diddulphs mrs trevelyan received two letters from lady milborough in both of which she was recommended indeed tenderly implored to be submissive to her husband anything said lady milborough is better than separation in answer to the second letter mrs trevelyan told the old lady that she had no means by which she could shew any submission to her husband even if she were so minded her husband had gone away she did not know whither and she had no means by which she could communicate with him and then came a packet to her from her father and mother despatched from the islands after the receipt by lady rowley of the melancholy tidings of the journey to nuncombe putney both sir marmaduke and lady rowley were full of anger against trevelyan and wrote as though the husband could certainly be brought back to a sense of his duty if they only were present this packet had been at nuncombe putney and contained a sealed note from sir marmaduke addressed to mr trevelyan lady rowley explained that it was impossible that they should get to england earlier than in the spring i would come myself at once and leave papa to follow said lady rowley only for the children if i were to bring them i must take a house for them and the expense would ruin us papa has written to mr trevelyan in a way that he thinks will bring him to reason  but how was this letter by which the husband was to be brought to reason to be put into the husbands hands mrs trevelyan applied to mr bideawhile and to lady milborough and to stanbury for trevelyans address but was told by each of them that nothing was known of his whereabouts she did not apply to mr bozzle although mr bozzle was more than once in her neighbourhood but as yet she knew nothing of mr bozzle the replies from mr bideawhile and from lady milborough came by the post but hugh stanbury thought that duty required him to make another journey to st diddulphs and carry his own answer with him  and on this occasion fortune was either very kind to himor very unkind whichever it was he found himself alone for a few seconds in the parsonage parlour with nora rowley mr outhouse was away at the time emily had gone upstairs for the boy and mrs outhouse suspecting nothing had followed her miss rowley said he getting up from his seat if you think it will do any good i will follow trevelyan till i find him  how can you find him besides why should you give up your own business  i would do anythingto serve your sister this he said with hesitation in his voice as though he did not dare to speak all that he desired to have spoken  i am sure that emily is very grateful said nora but she would not wish to give you such trouble as that  i would do anything for your sister he repeated for your sake miss rowley this was the first time that he had ever spoken a word to her in such a strain and it would be hardly too much to say that her heart was sick for some such expression but now that it had come though there was a sweetness about it that was delicious to her she was absolutely silenced by it and she was at once not only silent but stern rigid and apparently cold stanbury could not but feel as he looked at her that he had offended her perhaps i ought not to say as much said he but it is so  mr stanbury said she that is nonsense it is of my sister not of me that we are speaking  then the door was opened and emily came in with her child followed by her aunt there was no other opportunity and perhaps it was well for nora and for hugh that there should have been no other enough had been said to give her comfort and more might have led to his discomposure as to that matter on which he was presumed to have come to st diddulphs he could do nothing he did not know trevelyans address but did know that trevelyan had abandoned the chambers in lincolns inn and then he found himself compelled to confess that he had quarrelled with trevelyan and that they had parted in anger on the day of their joint visit to the east everybody who knows him must quarrel with him said mrs outhouse hugh when he took his leave was treated by them all as a friend who had been gained mrs outhouse was gracious to him mrs trevelyan whispered a word to him of her own trouble if i can hear anything of him you may be sure that i will let you know he said then it was noras turn to bid him adieu there was nothing to be said no word could be spoken before others that should be of any avail but as he took her hand in his he remembered the reticence of her fingers on that former day and thought that he was sure there was a difference  on this occasion he made his journey back to the end of chancery lane on the top of an omnibus and as he lit his little pipe disregarding altogether the scrutiny of the public thoughts passed through his mind similar to those in which he had indulged as he sat smoking on the corner of the churchyard wall at nuncombe putney he declared to himself that he did love this girl and as it was so would it not be better at any rate more manly that he should tell her so honestly than go on groping about with halfexpressed words when he saw her thinking of her and yet hardly daring to go near her bidding himself to forget her although he knew that such forgetting was impossible hankering after the sound of her voice and the touch of her hand and something of the tenderness of returned affectionand yet regarding her as a prize altogether out of his reach why should she be out of his reach she had no money and he had not a couple of hundred pounds in the world but he was earning an income which would give them both shelter and clothes and bread and cheese  what reader is there male or female of such stories as is this who has not often discussed in his or her own mind the different sides of this question of love and marriage on either side enough may be said by any arguer to convince at any rate himself it must be wrong for a man whose income is both insufficient and precarious also not only to double his own cares and burdens but to place the weight of that doubled burden on other shoulders besides his ownon shoulders that are tender and soft and ill adapted to the carriage of any crushing weight and then that doubled burdenthat burden of two mouths to be fed of two backs to be covered of two minds to be satisfied is so apt to double itself again and again the two so speedily become four and six and then there is the feeling that that kind of semipoverty which has in itself something of the pleasantness of independence when it is borne by a man alone entails the miseries of a draggletailed and querulous existence when it is imposed on a woman who has in her own home enjoyed the comforts of affluence as a man thinks of all this if he chooses to argue with himself on that side there is enough in the argument to make him feel that not only as a wise man but as an honest man he had better let the young lady alone she is well as she is and he sees around him so many who have tried the chances of marriage and who are not well look at jones with his wan worn wife and his five children jones who is not yet thirty of whom he happens to know that the wretched man cannot look his doctor in the face and that the doctor is as necessary to the mans house as is the butcher what heart can jones have for his work with such a burden as this upon his shoulders and so the thinker who argues on that side resolves that the young lady shall go her own way for him  but the arguments on the other side are equally cogent and so much more alluring and they are used by the same man with reference to the same passion and are intended by him to put himself right in his conduct in reference to the same dear girl only the former line of thoughts occurred to him on a saturday when he was ending his week rather gloomily and this other way of thinking on the same subject has come upon him on a monday as he is beginning his week with renewed hope does this young girl of his heart love him and if so their affection for each other being thus reciprocal is she not entitled to an expression of her opinion and her wishes on this difficult subject and if she be willing to run the risk and to encounter the dangersto do so on his behalf because she is willing to share everything with himis it becoming in him a man to fear what she does not fear if she be not willing let her say so if there be any speaking he must speak firstbut she is entitled as much as he is to her own ideas respecting their great outlook into the affairs of the world and then is it not manifestly gods ordinance that a man should live together with a woman how poor a creature does the man become who has shirked his duty in this respect who has done nothing to keep the world going who has been willing to ignore all affection so that he might avoid all burdens and who has put into his own belly every good thing that has come to him either by the earning of his own hands or from the bounty and industry of others of course there is a risk but what excitement is there in anything in which there is none so on the tuesday he speaks his mind to the young lady and tells her candidly that there will be potatoes for the two of themsufficient as he hopes of potatoes but no more as a matter of course the young lady replies that she for her part will be quite content to take the parings for her own eating then they rush deliciously into each others arms and the matter is settled for though the convictions arising from the former line of argument may be set aside as often as need be those reached from the latter are generally conclusive that such a settlement will always be better for the young gentleman and the young lady concerned than one founded on a sterner prudence is more than one may dare to say but we do feel sure that that country will be most prosperous in which such leaps in the dark are made with the greatest freedom  our friend hugh as he sat smoking on the knifeboard of the omnibus determined that he would risk everything if it were ordained that prudence should prevail the prudence should be hers why should he take upon himself to have prudence enough for two seeing that she was so very discreet in all her bearings then he remembered the touch of her hand which he still felt upon his palm as he sat handling his pipe and he told himself that after that he was bound to say a word more and moreover he confessed to himself that he was compelled by a feeling that mastered him altogether he could not get through an hours work without throwing down his pen and thinking of nora rowley it was his destiny to love herand there was to his mind a mean pettifogging secrecy amounting almost to daily lying in his thus loving her and not telling her that he loved her it might well be that she should rebuke him but he thought that he could bear that it might well be that he had altogether mistaken that touch of her hand after all it had been the slightest possible motion of no more than one finger but he would at any rate know the truth if she would tell him at once that she did not care for him he thought that he could get over it but life was not worth having while he lived in this shifty dubious and uncomfortable state so he made up his mind that he would go to st diddulphs with his heart in his hand  in the mean time mr bozzle had been twice to st diddulphsand now he made a third journey there two days after stanburys visit trevelyan who in truth hated the sight of the man and who suffered agonies in his presence had nevertheless taught himself to believe that he could not live without his assistance that it should be so was a part of the cruelty of his lot who else was there that he could trust his wife had renewed her intimacy with colonel osborne the moment that she had left him mrs stanbury who had been represented to him as the most correct of matrons had at once been false to him and to her trust in allowing colonel osborne to enter her house mr and mrs outhouse with whom his wife had now located herself not by his orders were of course his enemies his old friend hugh stanbury had gone over to the other side and had quarrelled with him purposely with malice prepense because he would not submit himself to the caprices of the wife who had injured him his own lawyer had refused to act for him and his fast and oldest ally the very person who had sounded in his ear the earliest warning note against that odious villain whose daily work it was to destroy the peace of familieseven lady milborough had turned against him because he would not follow the stupid prescription which she with pigheaded obstinacy persisted in givingbecause he would not carry his wife off to naplesshe was illjudging and inconsistent enough to tell him that he was wrong who was then left to him but bozzle bozzle was very disagreeable bozzle said things and made suggestions to him which were as bad as pins stuck into his flesh but bozzle was true to his employer and could find out facts had it not been for bozzle he would have known nothing of the colonels journey to devonshire had it not been for bozzle he would never have heard of the correspondence and therefore when he left london he gave bozzle a roving commission and when he went to paris and from paris onwards over the alps into italy he furnished bozzle with his address at this time in the midst of all his misery it never occurred to him to inquire of himself whether it might be possible that his old friends were right and that he himself was wrong from morning to night he sang to himself melancholy silent songs of inward wailing as to the cruelty of his own lot in lifeand in the mean time he employed bozzle to find out for him how far that cruelty was carried  mr bozzle was of course convinced that the lady whom he was employed to watch wasno better than she ought to be that is the usual bozzlian language for broken vows secrecy intrigue dirt and adultery it was his business to obtain evidence of her guilt there was no question to be solved as to her innocency the bozzlian mind would have regarded any such suggestion as the product of a green softness the possession of which would have made him quite unfit for his profession he was aware that ladies who are no better than they should be are often very cleverso clever as to make it necessary that the bozzles who shall at last confound them should be firstrate bozzles bozzles quite at the top of their professionand therefore he went about his work with great industry and much caution colonel osborne was at the present moment in scotland bozzle was sure of that he was quite in the north of scotland bozzle had examined his map and had found that wick which was the colonels posttown was very far north indeed he had half a mind to run down to wick as he was possessed by a certain honest zeal which made him long to do something hard and laborious but his experience told him that it was very easy for the colonel to come up to the neighbourhood of st diddulphs whereas the lady could not go down to wick unless she were to decide upon throwing herself into her lovers armswhereby bozzles work would be brought to an end he therefore confined his immediate operations to st diddulphs  he made acquaintance with one or two important persons in and about mr outhouses parsonage he became very familiar with the postman he arranged terms of intimacy i am sorry to say with the housemaid and on the third journey he made an alliance with the potboy at the full moon the potboy remembered well the fact of the child being brought to our ouse as he called the full moon and he was enabled to say that the same gent as had brought the boy backards and forrards had since that been at the parsonage but bozzle was quite quick enough to perceive that all this had nothing to do with the colonel he was led indeed to fear that his governor as he was in the habit of calling trevelyan in his halfspoken soliloquiesthat his governor was not as true to him as he was to his governor what business had that meddling fellow stanbury at st diddulphsfor trevelyan had not thought it necessary to tell his satellite that he had quarrelled with his friend bozzle was grieved in his mind when he learned that stanburys interference was still to be dreaded and wrote to his governor rather severely to that effect but when so writing he was able to give no further information facts in such cases will not unravel themselves without much patience on the part of the investigators     chapter xxxiv  priscillas wisdom      illustration  on the night after the dinner party in the close dorothy was not the only person in the house who laid awake thinking of what had taken place miss stanbury also was full of anxiety and for hour after hour could not sleep as she remembered the fruitlessness of her efforts on behalf of her nephew and niece  it had never occurred to her when she had first proposed to herself that dorothy should become mrs gibson that dorothy herself would have any objection to such a step in life her fear had been that dorothy would have become overradiant with triumph at the idea of having a husband and going to that husband with a fortune of her own that mr gibson might hesitate she had thought very likely it is thus in general that women regard the feelings desires and aspirations of other women you will hardly ever meet an elderly lady who will not speak of her juniors as living in a state of breathless anxiety to catch husbands and the elder lady will speak of the younger as though any kind of choice in such catching was quite disregarded the man must be a gentlemanor at least gentlemanlikeand there must be bread let these things be given and what girl wont jump into what mans arms female reader is it not thus that the elders of your sex speak of the younger when old mrs stanbury heard that nora rowley had refused mr glascock the thing was to her unintelligible and it was now quite unintelligible to miss stanbury that dorothy should prefer a single life to matrimony with mr gibson  it must be acknowledged on aunt stanburys behalf that dorothy was one of those yielding hesitating submissive young women trusting others but doubting ever of themselves as to whom it is natural that their stronger friends should find it expedient to decide for them miss stanbury was almost justified in thinking that unless she were to find a husband for her niece her niece would never find one for herself dorothy would drift into being an old maid like priscilla simply because she would never assert herselfnever put her best foot foremost aunt stanbury had therefore taken upon herself to put out a foot and having carefully found that mr gibson was willing had conceived that all difficulties were over she would be enabled to do her duty by her niece and establish comfortably in life at any rate one of her brothers children and now dorothy was taking upon herself to say that she did not like the gentleman such conduct was almost equal to writing for a penny newspaper  on the following morning after breakfast when brooke burgess was gone out to call upon his unclewhich he insisted upon doing openly and not under the rose in spite of miss stanburys great gravity on the occasionthere was a very serious conversation and poor dorothy had found herself to be almost silenced she did argue for a time but her arguments seemed even to herself to amount to so little why shouldnt she love mr gibson that was a question which she found it impossible to answer and though she did not actually yield though she did not say that she would accept the man still when she was told that three days were to be allowed to her for consideration and that then the offer would be made to her in form she felt that as regarded the antigibson interest she had not a leg to stand upon why should not such an insignificant creature as was she love mr gibsonor any other man who had bread to give her and was in some degree like a gentleman on that night she wrote the following letter to her sister      the close tuesday     dearest priscilla     i do so wish that you could be with me so that i could    talk to you again aunt stanbury is the most affectionate    and kindest friend in the world but she has always been    so able to have her own way because she is both clever    and good that i find myself almost like a baby with her    she has been talking to me again about mr gibson and it    seems that mr gibson really does mean it it is certainly    very strange but i do think now that it is true he is to    come on friday it seems very odd that it should all be    settled for him in that way but then aunt stanbury is so    clever at settling things     he sat next to me almost all the evening yesterday but    he didnt say anything about it except that he hoped i    agreed with him about going to church and all that i    suppose i do and i am quite sure that if i were to be a    clergymans wife i should endeavour to do whatever my    husband thought right about religion one ought to try    to do so even if the clergyman is not ones husband    mr burgess has come and he was so very amusing all the    evening that perhaps that was the reason mr gibson said    so little mr burgess is a very nice man and i think    aunt stanbury is more fond of him than of anybody he is    not at all the sort of person that i expected     but if mr gibson does come on friday and does really    mean it what am i to say to him aunt stanbury will be    very angry if i do not take her advice i am quite sure    that she intends it all for my happiness and then of    course she knows so much more about the world than i do    she asks me what it is that i expect of course i do not    expect anything it is a great compliment from mr gibson    who is a clergyman and thought well of by everybody and    nothing could be more respectable aunt stanbury says    that with the money she would give us we should be quite    comfortable and she wants us to live in this house she    says that there are thirty girls round exeter who would    give their eyes for such a chance and looking at it    in that light of course it is a very great thing for    me only think how poor we have been and then dear    priscilla perhaps he would let me be good to you and dear    mamma     but of course he will ask me whether ilove him and what    am i to say aunt stanbury says that i am to love him    begin to love him at once she said this morning i    would if i could partly for her sake and because i do    feel that it would be so respectable when i think of it    it does seem such a pity that poor i should throw away    such a chance and i must say that mr gibson is very    good and most obliging and everybody says that he has    an excellent temper and that he is a most prudent    welldispositioned man i declare dear priscilla when i    think of it i cannot bring myself to believe that such a    man should want me to be his wife     but what ought i to do i suppose when a girl is in love    she is very unhappy if the gentleman does not propose to    her i am sure it would not make me at all unhappy if i    were told that mr gibson had changed his mind     dearest priscilla you must write at once because he is    to be here on friday oh dear friday does seem to be so    near and i shall never know what to say to him either    one way or the other     your most affectionate sister     dorothy stanbury     psgive my kindest love to mamma but you need not tell    her unless you think it best   priscilla received this letter on the wednesday morning and felt herself bound to answer it on that same afternoon had she postponed her reply for a day it would still have been in dorothys hands before mr gibson could have come to her on the dreaded friday morning but still that would hardly give her time enough to consider the matter with any degree of deliberation after she should have been armed with what wisdom priscilla might be able to send her the post left nuncombe putney at three and therefore the letter had to be written before their early dinner  so priscilla went into the garden and sat herself down under an old cedar that she might discuss the matter with herself in all its bearings she felt that no woman could be called upon to write a letter that should be of more importance the whole welfare in life of the person who was dearest to her would probably depend upon it the weight upon her was so great that she thought for a while she would take counsel with her mother but she felt sure that her mother would recommend the marriage and that if she afterwards should find herself bound to oppose it then her mother would be a miserable woman there could be no use to her in taking counsel with her mother because her mothers mind was known to her beforehand the responsibility was thrown upon her and she alone must bear it  she tried hard to persuade herself to write at once and tell her sister to marry the man she knew her sisters heart so well as to be sure that dorothy would learn to love the man who was her husband it was almost impossible that dorothy should not love those with whom she lived and then her sister was so well adapted to be a wife and a mother her temper was so sweet she was so pure so unselfish so devoted and so healthy withal she was so happy when she was acting for others and so excellent in action when she had another one to think for her she was so trusting and trustworthy that any husband would adore her then priscilla walked slowly into the house got her prayerbook and returning to her seat under the tree read the marriage service it was one oclock when she went upstairs to write her letter and it had not yet struck eleven when she first seated herself beneath the tree her letter when written was as follows      nuncombe putney august 25 186     dearest dorothy     i got your letter this morning and i think it is better    to answer it at once as the time is very short i have    been thinking about it with all my mind and i feel almost    awestricken lest i should advise you wrongly after all    i believe that your own dear sweet truth and honesty would    guide you better than anybody else can guide you you may    be sure of this that whichever way it is i shall think    that you have done right dearest sister i suppose there    can be no doubt that for most women a married life is    happier than a single one it is always thought so as we    may see by the anxiety of others to get married and when    an opinion becomes general i think that the world is most    often right and then my own one i feel sure that you    are adapted both for the cares and for the joys of married    life you would do your duty as a married woman happily    and would be a comfort to your husbandnot a thorn in    his side as are so many women     but my pet do not let that reasoning of aunt stanburys    about the thirty young girls who would give their eyes for    mr gibson have any weight with you you should not take    him because thirty other young girls would be glad to have    him and do not think too much of that respectability    of which you speak i would never advise my dolly to    marry any man unless she could be respectable in her new    position but that alone should go for nothing nor should    our poverty we shall not starve and even if we did that    would be but a poor excuse     i can find no escape from thisthat you should love him    before you say that you will take him but honest loyal    love need not i take it be of that romantic kind which    people write about in novels and poetry you need not    think him to be perfect or the best or grandest of men    your heart will tell you whether he is dear to you and    remember dolly that i shall remember that love itself    must begin at some precise time though you had not    learned to love him when you wrote on tuesday you may    have begun to do so when you get this on thursday     if you find that you love him then say that you will be    his wife if your heart revolts from such a declaration    as being falseif you cannot bring yourself to feel    that you prefer him to others as the partner of your    lifethen tell him with thanks for his courtesy that    it cannot be as he would have it     yours always and ever most affectionately     priscilla     chapter xxxv  mr gibsons good fortune   ill bet you halfacrown my lad youre thrown over at last like the rest of them theres nothing she likes so much as taking some one up in order that she may throw him over afterwards it was thus that mr bartholomew burgess cautioned his nephew brooke  ill take care that she shant break my heart uncle barty i will go my way and she may go hers and she may give her money to the hospital if she pleases  on the morning after his arrival brooke burgess had declared aloud in miss stanburys parlour that he was going over to the bank to see his uncle now there was in this almost a breach of contract miss stanbury when she invited the young man to exeter had stipulated that there should be no intercourse between her house and the bank of course i shall not need to know where you go or where you dont go she had written but after all that has passed there must not be any positive intercourse between my house and the bank and now he had spoken of going over to c and b as he called them with the utmost indifference miss stanbury had looked very grave but had said nothing she had determined to be on her guard so that she should not be driven to quarrel with brooke if she could avoid it  bartholomew burgess was a tall thin illtempered old man as wellknown in exeter as the cathedral and respected after a fashion no one liked him he said illnatured things of all his neighbours and had never earned any reputation for doing goodnatured acts but he had lived in exeter for nearly seventy years and had achieved that sort of esteem which comes from long tenure and he had committed no great iniquities in the course of his fifty years of business the bank had never stopped payment and he had robbed no one he had not swallowed up widows and orphans and had done his work in the firm of cropper and burgess after the oldfashioned safe manner which leads neither to riches nor to ruin therefore he was respected but he was a discontented sour old man who believed himself to have been injured by all his own friends who disliked his own partners because they had bought that which had at any rate never belonged to himand whose strongest passion it was to hate miss stanbury of the close  shes got a parson by the hand now said the uncle as he continued his caution to the nephew  there was a clergyman there last night  no doubt and shell play him off against you and you against him and then shell throw you both over i know her  she has got a right to do what she likes with her own uncle barty  and how did she get it never mind im not going to set you against her if youre her favourite for the moment she has a niece with her therehasnt she  one of her brothers daughters  they say shes going to make that clergyman marry her  whatmr gibson  yes they tell me he was as good as engaged to another girlone of the frenches of heavitree and therefore dear jemima could do nothing better than interfere when she has succeeded in breaking the girls heart  which girls heart uncle barty  the girl the man was to have married when thats done shell throw gibson over youll see shell refuse to give the girl a shilling she took the girls brother by the hand ever so long and then she threw him over and shell throw the girl over too and send her back to the place she came from and then shell throw you over  according to you she must be the most malicious old woman that ever was allowed to live  i dont think there are many to beat her as far as malice goes but youll find out for yourself i shouldnt be surprised if she were to tell you before long that you were to marry the niece  i shouldnt think that such very hard lines either said brooke burgess  ive no doubt you may have her if you like said barty in spite of mr gibson only i should recommend you to take care and get the money first  when brooke went back to the house in the close miss stanbury was quite fussy in her silence she would have given much to have been told something about barty and above all to have learned what barty had said about herself but she was far too proud even to mention the old mans name of her own accord she was quite sure that she had been abused she guessed probably with tolerable accuracy the kind of things that had been said of her and suggested to herself what answer brooke would make to such accusations but she had resolved to cloak it all in silence and pretended for a while not to remember the young mans declared intention when he left the house it seems odd to me said brooke that uncle barty should always live alone as he does he must have a dreary time of it  i dont know anything about your uncle bartys manner of living  noi suppose not you and he are not friends  by no means brooke  he lives there all alone in that poky bankhouse and nobody ever goes near him i wonder whether he has any friends in the city  i really cannot tell you anything about his friends and to tell you the truth brooke i dont want to talk about your uncle of course you can go to see him when you please but id rather you didnt tell me of your visits afterwards  there is nothing in the world i hate so much as a secret said he he had no intention in this of animadverting upon miss stanburys secret enmity nor had he purposed to ask any question as to her relations with the old man he had alluded to his dislike of having secrets of his own but she misunderstood him  if you are anxious to know she said becoming very red in the face  i am not at all curious to know you quite mistake me  he has chosen to believeor to say that he believedthat i wronged him in regard to his brothers will i nursed his brother when he was dyingas i considered it to be my duty to do i cannot tell you all that story it is too long and too sad romance is very pretty in novels but the romance of a life is always a melancholy matter they are most happy who have no story to tell  i quite believe that  but your uncle barty chose to thinkindeed i hardly know what he thought he said that the will was a will of my making when it was made i and his brother were apart we were not even on speaking terms there had been a quarrel and all manner of folly i am not very proud when i look back upon it it is not that i think myself better than others but your uncle brookes will was made before we had come together again when he was ill it was natural that i should go to himafter all that had passed between us eh brooke  it was womanly  but it made no difference about the will mr bartholomew burgess might have known that at once and must have known it afterwards but he has never acknowledged that he was wrongnever even yet  he could not bring himself to do that i should say  the will was no great triumph to me i could have done without it as god is my judge i would not have lifted up my little finger to get either a part or the whole of poor brookes money if i had known that a word would have done it i would have bitten my tongue out before it should have been spoken she had risen from her seat and was speaking with a solemnity that almost filled her listener with awe she was a woman short of stature but now as she stood over him she seemed to be tall and majestic but when the man was dead she continued and the will was therethe property was mine and i was bound in duty to exercise the privileges and bear the responsibilities which the dead man had conferred upon me it was barty then who sent a low attorney to me offering me a compromise what had i to compromise compromise no if it was not mine by all the right the law could give i would sooner have starved than have had a crust of bread out of the money she had now clenched both her fists and was shaking them rapidly as she stood over him looking down upon him  of course it was your own  yes though they asked me to compromise and sent messages to me to frighten meboth barty and your uncle tom ay and your father too brooke they did not dare to go to law to law indeed if ever there was a good will in the world the will of your uncle brooke was good they could talk and malign me and tell lies as to dates and strive to make my name odious in the county but they knew that the will was good they did not succeed very well in what they did attempt  i would try to forget it all now aunt stanbury  forget it how is that to be done how can the mind forget the history of its own life noi cannot forget it i can forgive it  then why not forgive it  i do i have why else are you here  but forgive old uncle barty also  has he forgiven me come now if i wished to forgive him how should i begin would he be gracious if i went to him does he love me do you thinkor hate me uncle barty is a good hater it is the best point about him no brooke we wont try the farce of a reconciliation after a long life of enmity nobody would believe us and we should not believe each other  then i certainly would not try  i do not mean to do so the truth is brooke you shall have it all when im gone if you dont turn against me you wont take to writing for penny newspapers will you brooke as she asked the question she put one of her hands softly on his shoulder  i certainly shant offend in that way  and you wont be a radical  no not a radical  i mean a man to follow beales and bright a republican a putterdown of the church a hater of the throne you wont take up that line will you brooke  it isnt my way at present aunt stanbury but a man shouldnt promise  ah me it makes me sad when i think what the country is coming to im told there are scores of members of parliament who dont pronounce their hs when i was young a member of parliament used to be a gentlemanand theyve taken to ordaining all manner of people it used to be the case that when you met a clergyman you met a gentleman bythebye brooke what do you think of mr gibson  mr gibson to tell the truth i havent thought much about him  but you must think about him perhaps you havent thought about my niece dolly stanbury  i think that shes an uncommonly nice girl  shes not to be nice for you young man shes to be married to mr gibson  are they engaged  well no but i intend that they shall be you wont begrudge that i should give my little savings to one of my own name  you dont know me aunt stanbury if you think that i should begrudge anything that you might do with your money  dolly has been here a month or two i think its three months since she came and i do like her shes soft and womanly and hasnt taken up those vile filthy habits which almost all the girls have adopted have you seen those frenches with the things they have on their heads  i was speaking to them yesterday  nasty sluts you can see the grease on their foreheads when they try to make their hair go back in the dirty french fashion dolly is not like thatis she  she is not in the least like either of the miss frenches  and now i want her to become mrs gibson he is quite taken  is he  oh dear yes didnt you see him the other night at dinner and afterwards of course he knows that i can give her a little bit of money which always goes for something brooke and i do think it would be such a nice thing for dolly  and what does dolly think about it  theres the difficulty she likes him well enough im sure of that and she has no stuckup ideas about herself she isnt one of those who think that almost nothing is good enough for them but  she has an objection  i dont know what it is i sometimes think she is so bashful and modest she doesnt like to talk of being marriedeven to an old woman like me  dear me thats not the way of the ageis it aunt stanbury  its coming to that brooke that the girls will ask the men soon yesand that they wont take a refusal either i do believe that camilla french did ask mr gibson  and what did mr gibson say  ahi cant tell you that he knows too well what hes about to take her hes to come here on friday at eleven and you must be out of the way i shall be out of the way too but if dolly says a word to you before that mind you make her understand that she ought to accept gibson  shes too good for him according to my thinking  dont you be a fool how can any young woman be too good for a gentleman and a clergyman mr gibson is a gentleman do you knowonly you must not mention thisthat i have a kind of idea that we could get nuncombe putney for him my father had the living and my brother and i should like it to go on in the family  no opportunity came in the way of brooke burgess to say anything in favour of mr gibson to dorothy stanbury there did come to be very quickly a sort of intimacy between her and her aunts favourite but she was one not prone to talk about her own affairs and as to such an affair as thisa question as to whether she should or should not give herself in marriage to her suitorshe who could not speak of it even to her own sister without a blush who felt confused and almost confounded when receiving her aunts admonitions and instigations on the subject would not have endured to hear brooke burgess speak on the matter dorothy did feel that a person easier to know than brooke had never come in her way she had already said as much to him as she had spoken to mr gibson in the three months that she had made his acquaintance they had talked about exeter and about mrs machugh and the cathedral and tennysons poems and the london theatres and uncle barty and the family quarrel they had become quite confidential with each other on some matters but on this heavy subject of mr gibson and his proposal of marriage not a word had been said when brooke once mentioned mr gibson on the thursday morning dorothy within a minute had taken an opportunity of escaping from the room  but circumstances did give him an opportunity of speaking to mr gibson on the wednesday afternoon both he and mr gibson were invited to drink tea at mrs frenchs house on that evening such invitations at exeter were wont to be given at short dates and both the gentlemen had said that they would go then arabella french had called in the close and had asked miss stanbury and dorothy it was well understood by arabella that miss stanbury herself would not drink tea at heavitree and it may be that dorothys company was not in truth desired the ladies both declined dont you stay at home for me my dear miss stanbury said to her niece but dorothy had not been out without her aunt since she had been at exeter and understood perfectly that it would not be wise to commence the practice at the house of the frenches mr brooke is coming miss stanbury and mr gibson miss french said and miss stanbury had thought that there was some triumph in her tone mr brooke can go where he pleases my dear miss stanbury replied and as for mr gibson i am not his keeper the tone in which miss stanbury spoke would have implied great imprudence had not the two ladies understood each other so thoroughly and had not each known that it was so  there was the accustomed set of people in mrs frenchs drawingroomthe crumbies and the wrights and the apjohns and mrs machugh came alsoknowing that there would be a rubber their naked shoulders dont hurt me mrs machugh said when her friend almost scolded her for going to the house im not a young man i dont care what they do to themselves you might say as much if they went naked altogether miss stanbury had replied in anger if nobody else complained i shouldnt said mrs machugh mrs machugh got her rubber and as she had gone for her rubber on a distinct promise that there should be a rubber and as there was a rubber she felt that she had no right to say illnatured things what does it matter to me said mrs machugh how nasty she is shes not going to be my wife ugh exclaimed miss stanbury shaking her head both in anger and disgust  camilla french was by no means so bad as she was painted by miss stanbury and brooke burgess rather liked her than otherwise and it seemed to him that mr gibson did not at all dislike arabella and felt no repugnance at either the ladys noddle or shoulders now that he was removed from miss stanburys influence it was clear enough also that arabella had not given up the attempt although she must have admitted to herself that the claims of dorothy stanbury were very strong on this evening it seemed to have been specially permitted to arabella who was the elder sister to take into her own hands the management of the case beholders of the game had hitherto declared that mr gibsons safety was secured by the constant coupling of the sisters neither would allow the other to hunt alone but a common sense of the common danger had made some special strategy necessary and camilla hardly spoke a word to mr gibson during the evening let us hope that she found some temporary consolation in the presence of the stranger  i hope you are going to stay with us ever so long mr burgess said camilla  a month that is ever so longisnt it why i mean to see all devonshire within that time i feel already that i know exeter thoroughly and everybody in it  im sure we are very much flattered  as for you miss french ive heard so much about you all my life that i felt that i knew you before i came here  who can have spoken to you about me  you forget how many relatives i have in the city do you think my uncle barty never writes to me  not about me  does he not and do you suppose i dont hear from miss stanbury  but she hates me i know that  and do you hate her  no indeed ive the greatest respect for her but she is a little odd isnt she now mr burgess we all like her ever so much and weve known her ever so long six or seven yearssince we were quite young things but she has such queer notions about girls  what sort of notions  shed like them all to dress just like herself and she thinks that they should never talk to young men if she was here shed say i was flirting with you because were sitting together  but you are not are you  of course i am not  i wish you would said brooke  i shouldnt know how to begin i shouldnt indeed i dont know what flirting means and i dont know who does know when young ladies and gentlemen go out i suppose they are intended to talk to each other  but very often they dont you know  i call that stupid said camilla and yet when they do all the old maids say that the girls are flirting ill tell you one thing mr burgess i dont care what any old maid says about me i always talk to people that i like and if they choose to call me a flirt they may its my opinion that still waters run the deepest  no doubt the noisy streams are very shallow said brooke  you may call me a shallow stream if you like mr burgess  i meant nothing of the kind  but what do you call dorothy stanbury thats what i call still water she runs deep enough  the quietest young lady i ever saw in my life  exactly so quiet but soclever what do you think of mr gibson  everybody is asking me what i think of mr gibson  you know what they say they say he is to marry dorothy stanbury poor man i dont think his own consent has ever been asked yetbut nevertheless its settled  just at present he seems to me to bewhat shall i sayi oughtnt to say flirting with your sister ought i  miss stanbury would say so if she were here no doubt but the fact is mr burgess weve known him almost since we were infants and of course we take an interest in his welfare there has never been anything more than that arabella is nothing more to him than i am once indeed but however that does not signify it would be nothing to us if he really liked dorothy stanbury but as far as we can seeand we do see a good deal of himthere is no such feeling on his part of course we havent asked we should not think of such a thing mr gibson may do just as he likes for us but i am not quite sure that dorothy stanbury is just the girl that would make him a good wife of course when youve known a person seven or eight years you do get anxious about his happiness do you know we think herperhaps a littlesly  in the meantime mr gibson was completely subject to the individual charms of arabella camilla had been quite correct in a part of her description of their intimacy she and her sister had known mr gibson for seven or eight years but nevertheless the intimacy could not with truth be said to have commenced during the infancy of the young ladies even if the word were used in its legal sense seven or eight years however is a long acquaintance and there was perhaps something of a real grievance in this stanbury intervention if it be a recognised fact in society that young ladies are in want of husbands and that an effort on their part towards matrimony is not altogether impossible it must be recognised also that failure will be disagreeable and interference regarded with animosity miss stanbury the elder was undoubtedly interfering between mr gibson and the frenches and it is neither manly nor womanly to submit to interference with ones dearest prospects it may perhaps be admitted that the miss frenches had shown too much open ardour in their pursuit of mr gibson perhaps there should have been no ardour and no pursuit it may be that the theory of womanhood is right which forbids to women any such attemptswhich teaches them that they must ever be pursued never the pursuers as to that there shall be no discourse at present but it must be granted that whenever the pursuit has been attempted it is not in human nature to abandon it without an effort that the french girls should be very angry with miss stanbury that they should put their heads together with the intention of thwarting her that they should think evil things of poor dorothy that they should half despise mr gibson and yet resolve to keep their hold upon him as a chattel and a thing of value that was almost their own was not perhaps much to their discredit  you are a good deal at the house in the close now said arabella in her lowest voicein a voice so low that it was almost melancholy  well yes miss stanbury you know has always been a staunch friend of mine and she takes an interest in my little church people say that girls are sly but men can be sly too sometimes  it seems that she has taken you so much away from us mr gibson  i dont know why you should say that miss french  perhaps i am wrong one is apt to be sensitive about ones friends we seem to have known you so well there is nobody else in exeter that mamma regards as she does you but of course if you are happy with miss stanbury that is everything  i am speaking of the old lady said mr gibson who in spite of his slyness was here thrown a little off his guard  and i am speaking of the old lady too said arabella of whom else should i be speaking  noof course not  of course continued arabella i hear what people say about the niece one cannot help what one hears you know mr gibson but i dont believe that i can assure you as she said this she looked into his face as though waiting for an answer but mr gibson had no answer ready then arabella told herself that if anything was to be done it must be done at once what use was there in beating round the bush when the only chance of getting the game was to be had by dashing at once into the thicket i own i should be glad she said turning her eyes away from him if i could hear from your own mouth that it is not true  mr gibsons position was one not to be envied were he willing to tell the very secrets of his soul to miss french with the utmost candour he could not answer her question either one way or the other and he was not willing to tell her any of his secrets it was certainly the fact too that there had been tender passages between him and arabella now when there have been such passages and the gentleman is crossexamined by the lady as mr gibson was being crossexamined at the present momentthe gentleman usually teaches himself to think that a little falsehood is permissible a gentleman can hardly tell a lady that he has become tired of her and has changed his mind he feels the matter perhaps more keenly even than she does and though at all other times he may be a very paladin in the cause of truth in such strait as this he does allow himself some latitude  you are only joking of course he said  indeed i am not joking i can assure you mr gibson that the welfare of the friends whom i really love can never be a matter of joke to me mrs crumbie says that you positively are engaged to marry dorothy stanbury  what does mrs crumbie know about it  i dare say nothing it is not sois it  certainly not  and there is nothing in itis there  i wonder why people make these reports said mr gibson prevaricating      illustration i wonder why people make these reports   it is a fabrication from beginning to end then said arabella pressing the matter quite home at this time she was very close to him and though her words were severe the glance from her eyes was soft and the scent from her hair was not objectionable to him as it would have been to miss stanbury and the mode of her headdress was not displeasing to him and the folds of her dress as they fell across his knee were welcome to his feelings he knew that he was as one under temptation but he was not strong enough to bid the tempter avaunt say that it is so mr gibson  of course it is not so said mr gibsonlying  i am so glad for of course mr gibson when we heard it we thought a great deal about it a mans happiness depends so much on whom he marriesdoesnt it and a clergymans more than anybody elses and we didnt think she was quite the sort of woman that you would like you see she has had no advantages poor thing she has been shut up in a little country cottage all her lifejust a labourers hovel no moreand though it wasnt her fault of course and we all pitied her and were so glad when miss stanbury brought her to the closestill you know though one was very glad of her as an acquaintance yet you know as a wifeand for such a dear dear friend she went on and said many other things with equal enthusiasm and then wiped her eyes and then smiled and laughed after that she declared that she was quite happyso happy and so she left him the poor man after the falsehood had been extracted from him said nothing more but sat in patience listening to the raptures and enthusiasm of his friend he knew that he had disgraced himself and he knew also that his disgrace would be known if dorothy stanbury should accept his offer on the morrow and yet how hardly he had been used what answer could he have given compatible both with the truth and with his own personal dignity  about half an hour afterwards he was walking back to exeter with brooke burgess and then brooke did ask him a question or two  nice girls those frenches i think said brooke  very nice said mr gibson  how miss stanbury does hate them says brooke  not hate them i hope said mr gibson  she doesnt love themdoes she  well as for loveyes in one sensei hope she does miss stanbury you know is a woman who expresses herself strongly  what would she say if she were told that you and i were going to marry those two girls we are both favourites you know  dear me what a very odd supposition said mr gibson  for my part i dont think i shall said brooke  i dont suppose i shall either said mr gibson with a gravity which was intended to convey some smattering of rebuke  a fellow might do worse you know said brooke for my part i rather like girls with chignons and all that sort of getup but the worst of it is one cant marry two at a time  that would be bigamy said mr gibson  just so said brooke     chapter xxxvi  miss stanburys wrath   punctually at eleven oclock on the friday morning mr gibson knocked at the door of the house in the close the reader must not imagine that he had ever wavered in his intention with regard to dorothy stanbury because he had been driven into a corner by the pertinacious ingenuity of miss french he never for a moment thought of being false to miss stanbury the elder falseness of that nature would have been ruinous to himwould have made him a marked man in the city all his days and would probably have reached even to the bishops ears he was neither bad enough nor audacious enough nor foolish enough for such perjury as that and moreover though the wiles of arabella had been potent with him he very much preferred dorothy stanbury seven years of flirtation with a young lady is more trying to the affection than any duration of matrimony arabella had managed to awaken something of the old glow but mr gibson as soon as he was alone turned from her mentally in disgust no whatever little trouble there might be in his way it was clearly his duty to marry dorothy stanbury she had the sweetest temper in the world and blushed with the prettiest blush she would have moreover two thousand pounds on the day she married and there was no saying what other and greater pecuniary advantages might follow his mind was quite made up and during the whole morning he had been endeavouring to drive all disagreeable reminiscences of miss french from his memory and to arrange the words with which he would make his offer to dorothy he was aware that he need not be very particular about his words as dorothy from the bashfulness of her nature would be no judge of eloquence at such a time but still for his own sake there should be some form of expression some propriety of diction before eleven oclock he had it all by heart and had nearly freed himself from the uneasiness of his falsehood to arabella he had given much serious thought to the matter and had quite resolved that he was right in his purpose and that he could marry dorothy with a pure conscience and with a true promise of a husbands love dear dolly he said to himself with something of enthusiasm as he walked across the close and he looked up to the house as he came to it there was to be his future home there was not one of the prebends who had a better house and there was a dovelike softness about dorothys eyes and a winning obedience in her manner that were charming his lines had fallen to him in very pleasant places yeshe would go up to her and take her at once by the hand and ask her whether she would be his now and for ever he would not let go her hand till he had brought her so close to him that she could hide her blushes on his shoulder the whole thing had been so well conceived had become so clear to his mind that he felt no hesitation or embarrassment as he knocked at the door arabella french would no doubt hear of it soon wellshe must hear of it after all she could do him no injury  he was shown up at once into the drawingroom and there he foundmiss stanbury the elder oh mr gibson she said at once  is anything the matter withdear dorothy  she is the most obstinate pigheaded young woman i ever came across since the world began  you dont say so but what is it miss stanbury  what is it why just this nothing on earth that i can say to her will induce her to come down and speak to you  have i offended her  offended a fiddlestick offence indeed an offer from an honest man with her friends approval and a fortune at her back as though she had been born with a gold spoon in her mouth and she tells me that she cant and wont and wouldnt and shouldnt as though i were asking her to walk the streets i declare i dont know what has come to the young womenor what it is they want one would have thought that butter wouldnt melt in her mouth  but what is the reason miss stanbury  oh reason you dont suppose people give reasons in these days what reason have they when they dress themselves up with bandboxes on their sconces just simply the old reasoni do not like thee dr fellwhy i cannot tell  may i not see her myself miss stanbury  i cant make her come downstairs to you ive been at her the whole morning mr gibson ever since daylight pretty nearly she came into my room before i was up and told me she had made up her mind ive coaxed and scolded and threatened and criedbut if shed been a milestone it couldnt have been of less use i told her she might go back to nuncombe and she just went off to pack up  but shes not to go  how can i say what such a young woman will do im never allowed a way of my own for a moment theres brooke burgess been scolding me at that rate i didnt know whether i stood on my head or my heels and i dont know now  then there was a pause while mr gibson was endeavouring to decide what would now be his best course of action dont you think shell ever come round miss stanbury  i dont think shell ever come any way that anybody wants her to come mr gibson  i didnt think she was at all like that said mr gibson almost in tears  nonor anybody else ive been seeing it come all the same its just the stanbury perversity if id wanted to keep her by herself to take care of me and had set my back up at her if she spoke to a man and made her understand that she wasnt to think of getting married shed have been making eyes at every man that came into the house its just what one gets for going out of ones way i did think shed be so happy mr gibson living here as your wife she and i between us could have managed for you so nicely  mr gibson was silent for a minute or two during which he walked up and down the roomcontemplating no doubt the picture of married life which miss stanbury had painted for hima picture which as it seemed was not to be realised and what had i better do miss stanbury he asked at last  do i dont know what youre to do im groom enough to bring a mare to water but i cant make her drink  will waiting be any good  how can i say ill tell you one thing not to do dont go and philander with those girls at heavitree its my belief that dorothy has been thinking of them people talk to her of course  i wish people would hold their tongues people are so indiscreet people dont know how much harm they may do  youve given them some excuse you know mr gibson  this was very illnatured and was felt by mr gibson to be so rude that he almost turned upon his patroness in anger he had known dolly for not more than three months and had devoted himself to her to the great anger of his older friends he had come this morning true to his appointment expecting that others would keep their promises to him as he was ready to keep those which he had madeand now he was told that it was his fault i do think thats rather hard miss stanbury he said  so you have said shenasty slatternly girls without an idea inside their noddles but its no use your scolding me  i didnt mean to scold miss stanbury  ive done all that i could  and you think she wont see me for a minute  she says she wont i cant bid martha carry her down  then perhaps i had better leave you for the present said mr gibson after another pause so he went a melancholy blighted man leaving the close he passed through into southernhay and walked across by the new streets towards the heavitree road he had no design in taking this route but he went on till he came in sight of the house in which mrs french lived as he walked slowly by it he looked up at the windows and something of a feeling of romance came across his heart were his young affections buried there or were they not and if so with which of those fair girls were they buried for the last two years up to last night camilla had certainly been in the ascendant but arabella was a sweet young woman and there had been a timewhen those tender passages were going onin which he had thought that no young woman ever was so sweet a period of romance an era of enthusiasm a shortlived delicious holiday of hottongued insanity had been permitted to him in his youthbut all that was now over and yet here he was with three strings to his bowso he told himselfand he had not as yet settled for himself the great business of matrimony he was inclined to think as he walked on that he would walk his life alone an active useful but a melancholy man after such experiences as his how should he ever again speak of his heart to a woman during this walk his mind recurred frequently to dorothy stanbury and doubtless he thought that he had often spoken of his heart to her he was back at his lodgings before three at which hour he ate an early dinner and then took the afternoon cathedral service at four the evening he spent at home thinking of the romance of his early days what would miss stanbury have said had she seen him in his easy chair behind the exeter arguswith a pipe in his mouth  in the meantime there was an uncomfortable scene in progress between dorothy and her aunt brooke burgess as desired had left the house before eleven having taken upon himself when consulted to say in the mildest terms that he thought that in general young women should not be asked to marry if they did not like towhich opinion had been so galling to miss stanbury that she had declared that he had so scolded her that she did not know whether she was standing on her head or her heels as soon as mr gibson left her she sat herself down and fairly cried she had ardently desired this thing and had allowed herself to think of her desire as of one that would certainly be accomplished dorothy would have been so happy as the wife of a clergyman miss stanburys standard for men and women was not high she did not expect others to be as selfsacrificing as charitable and as good as herself it was not that she gave to herself credit for such virtues but she thought of herself as one who from the peculiar circumstances of life was bound to do much for others there was no end to her doing good for othersif only the others would allow themselves to be governed by her she did not think that mr gibson was a great divine but she perceived that he was a clergyman living decentlyof that secret pipe miss stanbury knew nothingdoing his duty punctually and as she thought very much in want of a wife then there was her niece dollysoft pretty feminine without a shilling and much in want of some one to comfort and take care of her what could be better than such a marriage and the overthrow to the girls with the big chignons would be so complete she had set her mind upon it and now dorothy said that it couldnt and it wouldnt and it shouldnt be accomplished she was to be thrown over by this chit of a girl as she had been thrown over by the girls brother and when she complained the girl simply offered to go away  at about twelve dorothy came creeping down into the room in which her aunt was sitting and pretended to occupy herself on some piece of work for a considerable timefor three minutes perhapsmiss stanbury did not speak she had resolved that she would not speak to her niece againat least not for that day she would let the ungrateful girl know how miserable she had been made but at the close of the three minutes her patience was exhausted what are you doing there she said  i am quilting your cap aunt stanbury  put it down you shant do anything for me i wont have you touch my things any more i dont like pretended service  it is not pretended aunt stanbury  i say it is pretended why did you pretend to me that you would have him when you had made up your mind against it all the time  but i hadntmade up my mind  if you had so much doubt about it you might have done what i wanted you  i couldnt aunt stanbury  you mean you wouldnt i wonder what it is you do expect  i dont expect anything aunt stanbury  no and i dont expect anything what an old fool i am ever to look for any comfort why should i think that anybody would care for me  indeed i do care for you  in what sort of way do you show it youre just like your brother hugh ive disgraced myself to that manpromising what i could not perform i declare it makes me sick when i think of it why did you not tell me at once dorothy said nothing further but sat with the cap on her lap she did not dare to resume her needle and she did not like to put the cap aside as by doing so it would seem as though she had accepted her aunts prohibition against her work for half an hour she sat thus during which time miss stanbury dropped asleep she woke with a start and began to scold again whats the good of sitting there all the day with your hands before you doing nothing  but dorothy had been very busy she had been making up her mind and had determined to communicate her resolution to her aunt dear aunt she said i have been thinking of something  its too late now said miss stanbury  i see ive made you very unhappy  of course you have  and you think that im ungrateful im not ungrateful and i dont think that hugh is  never mind hugh  only because it seems so hard that you should take so much trouble about us and that then there should be so much vexation  i find it very hard  so i think that id better go back to nuncombe  thats what you call gratitude  i dont like to stay here and make you unhappy i cant think that i ought to have done what you asked me because i did not feel at all in that way about mr gibson but as i have only disappointed you it will be better that i should go home i have been very happy herevery  bother exclaimed miss stanbury  i haveand i do love you though you wont believe it but i am sure i oughtnt to remain to make you unhappy i shall never forget all that you have done for me and though you call me ungrateful i am not but i know that i ought not to stay as i cannot do what you wish so if you please i will go back to nuncombe  youll not do anything of the kind said miss stanbury  but it will be better  yes of course no doubt i suppose youre tired of us all  it is not that im tired aunt stanbury it isnt that at all dorothy had now become red up to the roots of her hair and her eyes were full of tears but i cannot stay where people think that i am ungrateful if you please aunt stanbury i will go then of course there was a compromise dorothy did at last consent to remain in the close but only on condition that she should be forgiven for her sin in reference to mr gibson and be permitted to go on with her aunts cap     chapter xxxvii  mont cenis      illustration  the night had been fine and warm and it was now noon on a fine september day when the train from paris reached st michael on the route to italy by mont cenisas all the world knows st michael is or was a year or two back the end of railway travelling in that direction at the time mr fells grand project of carrying a line of rails over the top of the mountain was only in preparation and the journey from st michael to susa was still made by the diligencesthose dear old continental coaches which are now nearly as extinct as our own but which did not deserve death so fully as did our abominable vehicles the coupé of a diligence or better still the banquette was a luxurious mode of travelling as compared with anything that our coaches offered there used indeed to be a certain halo of glory round the occupant of the box of a mailcoach the man who had secured that seat was supposed to know something about the world and to be such a one that the passengers sitting behind him would be proud to be allowed to talk to him but the prestige of the position was greater than the comfort a night on the box of a mailcoach was but a bad time and a night inside a mailcoach was a night in purgatory whereas a seat up above on the banquette of a diligence passing over the alps with room for the feet and support for the back with plenty of rugs and plenty of tobacco used to be on the mont cenis and still is on some other mountain passes a very comfortable mode of seeing a mountain route for those desirous of occupying the coupé or the three front seats of the body of the vehicle it must be admitted that difficulties frequently arose and that such difficulties were very common at st michael there would be two or three of those enormous vehicles preparing to start for the mountain whereas it would appear that twelve or fifteen passengers had come down from paris armed with tickets assuring them that this preferable mode of travelling should be theirs and then assertions would be made somewhat recklessly by the officials to the effect that all the diligence was coupé it would generally be the case that some middleaged englishman who could not speak french would go to the wall together with his wife middleaged englishmen with their wives who cant speak french can nevertheless be very angry and threaten loudly when they suppose themselves to be illtreated a middleaged englishman though he cant speak a word of french wont believe a french official who tells him that the diligence is all coupé when he finds himself with his unfortunate partner in a roundabout place behind with two priests a dirty man who looks like a brigand a sick maidservant and three agricultural labourers the attempt however was frequently made and thus there used to be occasionally a little noise round the bureau at st michael  on the morning of which we are speaking two englishmen had just made good their claim each independently of the other each without having heard or seen the other when two american ladies coming up very tardily endeavoured to prove their rights the ladies were without other companions and were not fluent with their french but were clearly entitled to their seats they were told that the conveyance was all coupé but perversely would not believe the statement the official shrugged his shoulders and signified that his ultimatum had been pronounced what can an official do in such circumstances when more coupé passengers are sent to him than the coupés at his command will hold but we have paid for the coupé said the elder american lady with considerable indignation though her french was imperfectfor american ladies understand their rights bah yes you have paid and you shall go what would you have we would have what we have paid for said the american lady then the official rose from his stool and shrugged his shoulders again and made a motion with both his hands intended to shew that the thing was finished it is a robbery said the elder american lady to the younger i should not mind only you are so unwell it will not kill me i dare say said the younger then one of the english gentlemen declared that his place was very much at the service of the invalidand the other englishman declared that his also was at the service of the invalids companion then and not till then the two men recognised each other one was mr glascock on his way to naples and the other was mr trevelyan on his wayhe knew not whither  upon this of course they spoke to each other in london they had been well acquainted each having been an intimate guest at the house of old lady milborough and each knew something of the others recent history mr glascock was aware as was all the world that trevelyan had quarrelled with his wife and trevelyan was aware that mr glascock had been spoken of as a suitor to his own sisterinlaw of that visit which mr glascock had made to nuncombe putney and of the manner in which nora had behaved to her lover trevelyan knew nothing their greetings spoken their first topic of conversation was of course the injury proposed to be done to the american ladies and which would now fall upon them they went into the waitingroom together and during such toilet as they could make there grumbled furiously they would take post horses over the mountain not from any love of solitary grandeur but in order that they might make the company pay for its iniquity but it was soon apparent to them that they themselves had no ground of complaint and as everybody was very civil and as a seat in the banquette over the heads of the american ladies was provided for them and as the man from the bureau came and apologised they consented to be pacified and ended of course by tipping halfadozen of the servants about the yard mr glascock had a man of his own with him who was very nearly being put on to the same seat with his master as an extra civility but this inconvenience was at last avoided having settled these little difficulties they went into breakfast in the buffet  there could be no better breakfast than used to be given in the buffet at the railway terminus at st michael the company might occasionally be led into errors about that question of coupé seats but in reference to their provisions they set an example which might be of great use to us here in england it is probably the case that breakfasts for travellers are not so frequently needed here as they are on the continent but still there is often to be found a crowd of people ready to eat if only the wherewithal were there we are often told in our newspapers that england is disgraced by this and by that by the unreadiness of our army by the unfitness of our navy by the irrationality of our laws by the immobility of our prejudices and what not but the real disgrace of england is the railway sandwichthat whited sepulchre fair enough outside but so meagre poor and spiritless within such a thing of shreds and parings such a dab of food telling us that the poor bone whence it was scraped had been made utterly bare before it was sent into the kitchen for the soup pot in france one does get food at the railway stations and at st michael the breakfast was unexceptional  our two friends seated themselves near to the american ladies and were of course thanked for their politeness american women are taught by the habits of their country to think that men should give way to them more absolutely than is in accordance with the practices of life in europe a seat in a public conveyance in the states when merely occupied by a man used to be regarded by any woman as being at her service as completely as though it were vacant one woman indicating a place to another would point with equal freedom to a man or a space it is said that this is a little altered now and that european views on this subject are spreading themselves our two ladies however who were pretty cleverlooking and attractive even after the nights journey were manifestly more impressed with the villainy of the french officials than they were with the kindness of their english neighbours  and nothing can be done to punish them said the younger of them to mr glascock  nothing i should think said he nothing will at any rate  and you will not get back your money said the elderwho though the elder was probably not much above twenty  wellno time is money they say it would take thrice the value of the time in money and then one would probably fail they have done very well for us and i suppose there are difficulties  it couldnt have taken place in our country said the younger lady all the same we are very much obliged to you it would not have been nice for us to have to go up into the banquette  they would have put you into the interior  and that would have been worse i hate being put anywhereas if i were a sheep it seems so odd to us that you here should be all so tame  do you mean the english or the french or the world in general on this side of the atlantic  we mean europeans said the younger lady who was better after her breakfast but then we think that the french have something of compensation in their manners and their ways of life their climate the beauty of their cities and their general management of things  they are very great in many ways no doubt said mr glascock  they do understand living better than you do said the elder  everything is so much brighter with them said the younger  they contrive to give a grace to everyday existence said the elder  there is such a welcome among them for strangers said the younger  particularly in reference to places taken in the coupé said trevelyan who had hardly spoken before  ah that is an affair of honesty said the elder if we want honesty i believe we must go back to the stars and stripes  mr glascock looked up from his plate almost aghast he said nothing however but called for the waiter and paid for his breakfast nevertheless there was a considerable amount of travelling friendship engendered between the ladies and our two friends before the diligence had left the railway yard they were two miss spaldings going on to florence at which place they had an uncle who was minister from the states to the kingdom of italy and they were not at all unwilling to receive such little civilities as gentlemen can give to ladies when travelling the whole party intended to sleep at turin that night and they were altogether on good terms with each other when they started on the journey from st michael  clever women those said mr glascock as soon as they had arranged their legs and arms in the banquette  yes indeed  american women always are cleverand are almost always pretty  i do not like them said trevelyanwho in these days was in a mood to like nothing they are exigeantand then they are so hard they want the weakness that a woman ought to have  that comes from what they would call your insular prejudice we are accustomed to less selfassertion on the part of women than is customary with them we prefer women to rule us by seeming to yield in the states as i take it the women never yield and the men have to fight their own battles with other tactics  i dont know what their tactics are  they keep their distance the men live much by themselves as though they knew they would not have a chance in the presence of their wives and daughters nevertheless they dont manage these things badly you very rarely hear of an american being separated from his wife  the words were no sooner out of his mouth than mr glascock knew and remembered and felt what he had said there are occasions in which a man sins so deeply against fitness and the circumstances of the hour that it becomes impossible for him to slur over his sin as though it had not been committed there are certain little peccadilloes in society which one can manage to throw behind oneperhaps with some difficulty and awkwardness but still they are put aside and conversation goes on though with a hitch but there are graver offences the gravity of which strikes the offender so seriously that it becomes impossible for him to seem even to ignore his own iniquity ashes must be eaten publicly and sackcloth worn before the eyes of men it was so now with poor mr glascock he thought about it for a momentwhether or no it was possible that he should continue his remarks about the american ladies without betraying his own consciousness of the thing that he had done and he found that it was quite impossible he knew that he was red up to his hairs and hot and that his blood tingled his blushes indeed would not be seen in the seclusion of the banquette but he could not overcome the heat and the tingling there was silence for about three minutes and then he felt that it would be best for him to confess his own fault trevelyan he said i am very sorry for the allusion that i made i ought to have been less awkward and i beg your pardon  it does not matter said trevelyan of course i know that everybody is talking of it behind my back i am not to expect that people will be silent because i am unhappy  nevertheless i beg your pardon said the other  there was but little further conversation between them till they reached lanslebourg at the foot of the mountain at which place they occupied themselves with getting coffee for the two american ladies the miss spaldings took their coffee almost with as much grace as though it had been handed to them by frenchmen and indeed they were very graciousas is the nature of american ladies in spite of that hardness of which trevelyan had complained they assume an intimacy readily with no appearance of impropriety and are at their ease easily when therefore they were handed out of their carriage by mr glascock the bystanders at lanslebourg might have thought that the whole party had been travelling together from new york what should we have done if you hadnt taken pity on us said the elder lady i dont think we could have climbed up into that high place and look at the crowd that have come out of the interior a man has some advantages after all  i am quite in the dark as to what they are said mr glascock  he can give up his place to a lady and can climb up into a banquette  and he can be a member of congress said the younger id sooner be senator from massachusetts than be the queen of england  so would i said mr glascock im glad we can agree about one thing  the two gentlemen agreed to walk up the mountain together and with some trouble induced the conductor to permit them to do so why conductors of diligences should object to such relief to their horses the ordinary englishman can hardly understand but in truth they feel so deeply the responsibility which attaches itself to their shepherding of their sheep that they are always fearing lest some poor lamb should go astray on the mountain side and though the road be broad and very plainly marked the conductor never feels secure that his passenger will find his way safely to the summit he likes to know that each of his flock is in his right place and disapproves altogether of an erratic spirit but mr glascock at last prevailed and the two men started together up the mountain when the permission has been once obtained the walker may be sure that his guide and shepherd will not desert him  of course i know said trevelyan when the third twist up the mountain had been overcome that people talk about me and my wife it is a part of the punishment for the mistake that one makes  it is a sad affair altogether  the saddest in the world lady milborough has no doubt spoken to you about it  wellyes she has  how could she help it i am not such a fool as to suppose that people are to hold their tongues about me more than they do about others intimate as she is with you of course she has spoken to you  i was in hopes that something might have been done by this time  nothing has been done sometimes i think i shall put an end to myself it makes me so wretched  then why dont you agree to forget and forgive and have done with it  that is so easily saidso easily said after this they walked on in silence for a considerable distance mr glascock was not anxious to talk about trevelyans wife but he did wish to ask a question or two about mrs trevelyans sister if only this could be done without telling too much of his own secret theres nothing i think so grand as walking up a mountain he said after a while  its all very well said trevelyan in a tone which seemed to imply that to him in his present miserable condition all recreations exercises and occupations were mere leather and prunella  i dont mean you know in the alpine club way said glascock im too old and too stiff for that but when the path is good and the air not too cold and when it is neither snowing nor thawing nor raining and when the sun isnt hot and youve got plenty of time and know that you can stop any moment you like and be pushed up by a carriage i do think walking up a mountain is very fineif youve got proper shoes and a good stick and it isnt too soon after dinner theres nothing like the air of alps and mr glascock renewed his pace and stretched himself against the hill at the rate of three miles an hour  i used to be very fond of switzerland said trevelyan but i dont care about it now my eye has lost all its taste  it isnt the eye said glascock  well no the truth is that when one is absolutely unhappy one cannot revel in the imagination i dont believe in the miseries of poets  i think myself said glascock that a poet should have a good digestion bythebye mrs trevelyan and her sister went down to nuncombe putney in devonshire  they did go there  have they moved since a very pretty place is nuncombe putney  you have been there then  mr glascock blushed again he was certainly an awkward man saying things that he ought not to say and telling secrets which ought not to have been told wellyes i have been thereas it happens  just lately do you mean  mr glascock paused hoping to find his way out of the scrape but soon perceived that there was no way out he could not lie even in an affair of love and was altogether destitute of those honest subterfugessubterfuges honest in such positionof which a dozen would have been at once at the command of any woman and with one of which sufficient for the moment most men would have been able to arm themselves indeed yes he said almost stammering as he spoke it was latelysince your wife went there trevelyan though he had been told of the possibility of mr glascocks courtship felt himself almost aggrieved by this mans intrusion on his wifes retreat had he not sent her there that she might be private and what right had any one to invade such privacy i suppose i had better tell the truth at once said mr glascock i went to see miss rowley  oh indeed  my secret will be safe with you i know  i did not know that there was a secret said trevelyan i should have thought that they would have told me  i dont see that however it doesnt matter much i got nothing by my journey are the ladies still at nuncombe putney  no they have moved from there to london  not back to curzon street  oh dear no there is no house in curzon street for them now this was said in a tone so sad that it almost made mr glascock weep they are staying with an aunt of theirsout to the east of the city  at st diddulphs  yeswith mr outhouse the clergyman there you cant conceive what it is not to be able to see your own child and yet how can i take the boy from her  of course not hes only a baby  and yet all this is brought on me solely by her obstinacy god knows however i dont want to say a word against her people choose to say that i am to blame and they may say so for me nothing that any one may say can add anything to the weight that i have to bear then they walked to the top of the mountain in silence and in due time were picked up by their proper shepherd and carried down to susa at a pace that would give an english coachman a concussion of the brain  why passengers for turin who reach susa dusty tired and sleepy should be detained at that place for an hour and a half instead of being forwarded to their beds in the great city is never made very apparent all travelling officials on the continent of europe are very slow in their manipulation of luggage but as they are equally correct we will find the excuse for their tardiness in the latter quality the hour and a half however is a necessity and it is very grievous on this occasion the two miss spaldings ate their supper and the two gentlemen waited on them the ladies had learned to regard at any rate mr glascock as their own property and received his services graciously indeed but quite as a matter of course when he was sent from their peculiar corner of the big dirty refreshment room to the suppertable to fetch an apple and then desired to change it because the one which he had brought was spotted he rather liked it and when he sat down with his knees near to theirs actually trying to eat a large italian apple himself simply because they had eaten one and discussed with them the passage over the mont cenis he began to think that susa was after all a place in which an hour and a half might be whiled away without much cause for complaint  we only stay one night at turin said caroline spalding the elder  and we shall have to start at tento get through to florence tomorrow said olivia the younger isnt it cruel wasting all this time when we might be in bed  it is not for me to complain of the cruelty said mr glascock  we should have fared infinitely worse if we hadnt met you said caroline spalding  but our republican simplicity wont allow us to assert that even your society is better than going to bed after a journey of thirty hours said olivia  in the meantime trevelyan was roaming about the station moodily by himself and the place is one not apt to restore cheerfulness to a moody man by any resources of its own when the time for departure came mr glascock sought him and found him but trevelyan had chosen a corner for himself in a carriage and declared that he would rather avoid the ladies for the present dont think me uncivil to leave you he said but the truth is i dont like american ladies  i do rather said mr glascock  you can say that ive got a headache said trevelyan so mr glascock returned to his friends and did say that mr trevelyan had a headache it was the first time that a name had been mentioned between them  mr trevelyan what a pretty name it sounds like a novel said olivia  a very clever man said mr glascock and much liked by his own circle but he has had trouble and is unhappy  he looks unhappy said caroline  the most miserable looking man i ever saw in my life said olivia then it was agreed between them as they went up to trompettas hotel that they would go on together by the ten oclock train to florence     chapter xxxviii  verdict of the jurymad my lord   trevelyan was left alone at turin when mr glascock went on to florence with his fair american friends it was imperatively necessary that he should remain at turin though he had no business there of any kind whatever and did not know a single person in the city and of all towns in italy turin has perhaps less of attraction to offer to the solitary visitor than any other it is new and parallelogrammatic as an american town is very cold in cold weather very hot in hot weather and now that it has been robbed of its life as a capital is as dull and uninteresting as though it were german or english there is the armoury and the river po and a good hotel but what are these things to a man who is forced to live alone in a place for four days or perhaps a week trevelyan was bound to remain at turin till he should hear from bozzle no one but bozzle knew his address and he could do nothing till bozzle should have communicated to him tidings of what was being done at st diddulphs  there is perhaps no great social question so imperfectly understood among us at the present day as that which refers to the line which divides sanity from insanity that this man is sane and that other unfortunately mad we do know well enough and we know also that one man may be subject to various hallucinationsmay fancy himself to be a teapot or what notand yet be in such a condition of mind as to call for no intervention either on behalf of his friends or of the law while another may be in possession of intellectual faculties capable of lucid exertion for the highest purposes and yet be so mad that bodily restraint upon him is indispensable we know that the sane man is responsible for what he does and that the insane man is irresponsible but we do not knowwe only guess wildly at the state of mind of those who now and again act like madmen though no court or council of experts has declared them to be mad the bias of the public mind is to press heavily on such men till the law attempts to touch them as though they were thoroughly responsible and then when the law interferes to screen them as though they were altogether irresponsible the same juryman who would find a man mad who has murdered a young woman would in private life express a desire that the same young man should be hung crucified or skinned alive if he had moodily and without reason broken his faith to the young woman in lieu of killing her now trevelyan was in truth mad on the subject of his wifes alleged infidelity he had abandoned everything that he valued in the world and had made himself wretched in every affair of life because he could not submit to acknowledge to himself the possibility of error on his own part for that in truth was the condition of his mind he had never hitherto believed that she had been false to her vow and had sinned against him irredeemably but he had thought that in her regard for another man she had slighted him and so thinking he had subjected her to a severity of rebuke which no highspirited woman could have borne his wife had not tried to bear itin her indignation had not striven to cure the evil then had come his resolution that she should submit or part from him and having so resolved nothing could shake him though every friend he possessed was now against himincluding even lady milboroughhe was certain that he was right had not his wife sworn to obey him and was not her whole conduct one tissue of disobedience would not the man who submitted to this find himself driven to submit to things worse let her own her fault let her submit and then she should come back to him  he had not considered when his resolutions to this effect were first forming themselves that a separation between a man and his wife once effected cannot be annulled and as it were cured so as to leave no cicatrice behind gradually as he spent day after day in thinking on this one subject he came to feel that even were his wife to submit to own her fault humbly and to come back to him this very coming back would in itself be a new wound could he go out again with his wife on his arm to the houses of those who knew that he had repudiated her because of her friendship with another man could he open again that house in curzon street and let things go on quietly as they had gone before he told himself that it was impossiblethat he and she were ineffably disgracedthat if reunited they must live buried out of sight in some remote distance and he told himself also that he could never be with her again night or day without thinking of the separation his happiness had been shipwrecked  then he had put himself into the hands of mr bozzle and mr bozzle had taught him that women very often do go astray mr bozzles idea of female virtue was not high and he had opportunities of implanting his idea on his clients mind trevelyan hated the man he was filled with disgust by bozzles words and was made miserable by bozzles presence yet he came gradually to believe in bozzle bozzle alone believed in him there were none but bozzle who did not bid him to submit himself to his disobedient wife and then as he came to believe in bozzle he grew to be more and more assured that no one but bozzle could tell him facts his chivalry and love and sense of womans honour with something of manly pride on his own partso he told himselfhad taught him to believe it to be impossible that his wife should have sinned bozzle who knew the world thought otherwise bozzle who had no interest in the matter one way or the other would find out facts what if his chivalry and love and manly pride had deceived him there were women who sinned then he prayed that his wife might not be such a woman and got up from his prayers almost convinced that she was a sinner  his mind was at work upon it always could it be that she was so base as thisso vile a thing so abject such dirt pollution filth but there were such cases nay were they not almost numberless he found himself reading in the papers records of such things from day to day and thought that in doing so he was simply acquiring experience necessary for himself if it were so he had indeed done well to separate himself from a thing so infamous and if it were not so how could it be that that man had gone to her in devonshire he had received from his wifes hands a short note addressed to the man in which the man was desired by her not to go to her or to write to her again because of her husbands commands he had shown this to bozzle and bozzle had smiled its just the sort of thing they does bozzle had said then they writes another by post he had consulted bozzle as to the sending on of that letter and bozzle had been strongly of opinion that it should be forwarded a copy having been duly taken and attested by himself it might be very pretty evidence byandby if the letter were not forwarded bozzle thought that the omission to do so might be given in evidence against his employer bozzle was very careful and full of evidence the letter therefore was sent on to colonel osborne if theres billydous going between em we shall nobble em said bozzle trevelyan tore his hair in despair but believed that there would be billydous  he came to believe everything and though he prayed fervently that his wife might not be led astray that she might be saved at any rate from utter vice yet he almost came to hope that it might be otherwisenot indeed with the hope of the sane man who desires that which he tells himself to be for his advantage but with the hope of the insane man who loves to feed his grievance even though the grief should be his death they who do not understand that a man may be brought to hope that which of all things is the most grievous to him have not observed with sufficient closeness the perversity of the human mind trevelyan would have given all that he had to save his wife would even now have cut his tongue out before he would have expressed to anyonesave to bozzlea suspicion that she could in truth have been guilty was continually telling himself that further life would be impossible to him if he and she and that child of theirs should be thus disgracedand yet he expected it believed it and after a fashion he almost hoped it  he was to wait at turin till tidings should come from bozzle and after that he would go on to venice but he would not move from turin till he should have received his first communication from england when he had been three days at turin they came to him and among other letters in bozzles packet there was a letter addressed in his wifes handwriting the letter was simply directed to bozzles house in what possible way could his wife have found out ought of his dealings with bozzlewhere bozzle lived or could have learned that letters intended for him should be sent to the mans own residence before however we inspect the contents of mr bozzles dispatch we will go back and see how mrs trevelyan had discovered the manner of forwarding a letter to her husband  the matter of the address was indeed very simple all letters for trevelyan were to be redirected from the house in curzon street and from the chambers in lincolns inn to the acrobats club to the porter of the acrobats club had been confided the secret not of bozzles name but of bozzles private address no 55 stony walk union street borough thus all letters reaching the acrobats were duly sent to mr bozzles house it may be remembered that hugh stanbury on the occasion of his last visit to the parsonage of st diddulphs was informed that mrs trevelyan had a letter from her father for her husband and that she knew not whither to send it it may well be that had the matter assumed no other interest in stanburys eyes than that given to it by mrs trevelyans very moderate anxiety to have the letter forwarded he would have thought nothing about it but having resolved as he sat upon the knifeboard of the omnibusthe reader will at any rate remember those resolutions made on the top of the omnibus while hugh was smoking his pipehaving resolved that a deed should be done at st diddulphs he resolved also that it should be done at once he would not allow the heat of his purpose to be cooled by delay he would go to st diddulphs at once with his heart in his hand but it might he thought be as well that he should have an excuse for his visit so he called upon the porter at the acrobats and was successful in learning mr trevelyans address stony walk union street borough he said to himself wondering then it occurred to him that bozzle and bozzle only among trevelyans friends could live at stony walk in the borough thus armed he set out for st diddulphsand as one of the effects of his visit to the east sir marmadukes note was forwarded to louis trevelyan at turin     chapter xxxix  miss nora rowley is maltreated   hugh stanbury when he reached the parsonage found no difficulty in making his way into the joint presence of mrs outhouse mrs trevelyan and nora he was recognised by the st diddulphs party as one who had come over to their side as a friend of trevelyan who had found himself constrained to condemn his friend in spite of his friendship and was consequently very welcome and there was no difficulty about giving the address the ladies wondered how it came to pass that mr trevelyans letters should be sent to such a locality and hugh expressed his surprise also he thought it discreet to withhold his suspicions about mr bozzle and simply expressed his conviction that letters sent in accordance with the directions given by the clubporter would reach their destination then the boy was brought down and they were all very confidential and very unhappy together mrs trevelyan could see no end to the cruelty of her position and declared that her fathers anger against her husband was so great that she anticipated his coming with almost more of fear than of hope mrs outhouse expressed an opinion that mr trevelyan must surely be mad and nora suggested that the possibility of such perversity on the part of a man made it almost unwise in any woman to trust herself to the power of a husband but there are not many like him thank god said mrs outhouse bridling in her wrath thus they were very friendly together and hugh was allowed to feel that he stood upon comfortable terms in the parsonagebut he did not as yet see how he was to carry out his project for the present day  at last mrs trevelyan went away with the child hugh felt that he ought to go but stayed courageously he thought he could perceive that nora suspected the cause of his assiduity but it was quite evident that mrs outhouse did not do so mrs outhouse having reconciled herself to the young man was by no means averse to his presence she went on talking about the wickedness of trevelyan and her brothers anger and the fate of the little boy till at last the little boys mother came back into the room then mrs outhouse went they must excuse her for a few minutes she said if only she would have gone a few minutes sooner how well her absence might have been excused nora understood it all now and though she became almost breathless she was not surprised when hugh got up from his chair and asked her sister to go away mrs trevelyan he said i want to speak a few words to your sister i hope you will give me the opportunity  nora exclaimed mrs trevelyan  she knows nothing about it said hugh  am i to go said mrs trevelyan to her sister but nora said never a word she sat perfectly fixed not turning her eyes from the object on which she was gazing      illustration am i to go   praypray do said hugh  i cannot think that it will be for any good said mrs trevelyan but i know that she may be trusted and i suppose it ought to be so if you wish it  i do wish it of all things said hugh still standing up and almost turning the elder sister out of the room by the force of his look and voice then with another pause of a moment mrs trevelyan rose from her chair and left the room closing the door after her  hugh when he found that the coast was clear for him immediately began his task with a conviction that not a moment was to be lost he had told himself a dozen times that the matter was hopeless that nora had shown him by every means in her power that she was indifferent to him that she with all her friends would know that such a marriage was out of the question and he had in truth come to believe that the mission which he had in hand was one in which success was not possible but he thought that it was his duty to go on with it if a man love a woman even though it be the king and the beggarwoman reversedthough it be a beggar and a queen he should tell her of it if it be so she has a right to know it and to take her choice and he has a right to tell her and to say what he can for himself such was hughs doctrine in the matter and acting upon it he found himself alone with his mistress  nora he said speaking perhaps with more energy than the words required i have come here to tell you that i love you and to ask you to be my wife  nora for the last ten minutes had been thinking that this would comethat it would come at once and yet she was not at all prepared with an answer it was now weeks since she had confessed to herself frankly that nothing else but thisthis one thing which was now happening this one thing which had now happenedthat nothing else could make her happy or could touch her happiness she had refused a man whom she otherwise would have taken because her heart had been given to hugh stanbury she had been bold enough to tell that other suitor that it was so though she had not mentioned the rivals name she had longed for some expression of love from this man when they had been at nuncombe together and had been fiercely angry with him because no such expression had come from him day after day since she had been with her aunt she had told herself that she was a brokenhearted woman because she had given away all that she had to give and had received nothing in return had he said a word that might have given her hope how happy could she have been in hoping now he had come to her with a plainspoken offer telling her that he loved her and asking her to be his wifeand she was altogether unable to answer how could she consent to be his wife knowing as she did that there was no certainty of an income on which they could live how could she tell her father and mother that she had engaged herself to marry a man who might or might not make £400 a year and who already had a mother and sister depending on him  in truth had he come more gently to her his chance of a happy answerof an answer which might be found to have in it something of happinesswould have been greater he might have said a word which she could not but have answered softlyand then from that constrained softness other gentleness would have followed and so he would have won her in spite of her discretion she would have surrendered gradually accepting on the score of her great love all the penalties of a long and precarious engagement but when she was asked to come and be his wife now and at once she felt that in spite of her love it was impossible that she could accede to a request so sudden so violent so monstrous he stood over her as though expecting an instant answer and then when she had sat dumb before him for a minute he repeated his demand tell me nora can you love me if you knew how thoroughly i have loved you you would at least feel something for me  to tell him that she did not love him was impossible to her but how was she to refuse him without telling him either a lie or the truth some answer she must give him and as to that matter of marrying him the answer must be a negative her education had been of that nature which teaches girls to believe that it is a crime to marry a man without an assured income assured morality in a husband is a great thing assured good temper is very excellent assured talent religion amiability truth honesty are all desirable but an assured income is indispensable whereas in truth the income may come hereafter but the other things unless they be there already will hardly be forthcoming mr stanbury she said your suddenness has quite astounded me  ah yes but how should i not be sudden i have come here on purpose to say this to you if i do not say it now  you heard what emily said  nowhat did she say  she said that it would not be for good that you should speak to me thus  why not for good but she is unhappy and looks gloomily at things  yes indeed  but all the world need not be sad for ever because she has been unfortunate  not all the world mr stanburybut you must not be surprised if it affects me  but would that prevent your loving meif you did love me but nora i do not expect you to love menot yet i do not say that i expect itever but if you would nora i can do no more than tell you the simple truth just listen to me for a minute you know how i came to be intimate with you all in curzon street the first day i saw you i loved you and there has come no change yet it is months now since i first knew that i loved you well i told myself more than oncewhen i was down at nuncombe for instancethat i had no right to speak to you what right can a poor devil like me have who lives from hand to mouth to ask such a girl as you to be his wife and so i said nothingthough it was on my lips every moment that i was there nora remembered at the moment how she had looked to his lips and had not seen the words there but i think there is something unmanly in this if you cannot give me a grain of hopeif you tell me that there never can be hope it is my misfortune it will be very grievous but i will bear it but that will be better than puling and moping about without daring to tell my tale i am not ashamed of it i have fallen in love with you nora and i think it best to come for an answer  he held out his arms as though he thought that she might perhaps come to him indeed he had no idea of any such coming on her part but she as she looked at him almost thought that it was her duty to go had she a right to withhold herself from him she who loved him so dearly had he stepped forward and taken her in his arms it might be that all power of refusal would soon have been beyond her power  mr stanbury she said you have confessed yourself that it is impossible  but do you love medo you think that it is possible that you should ever love me  you know mr stanbury that you should not say anything further you know that it cannot be  but do you love me  you are ungenerous not to take an answer without driving me to be uncourteous  i do not care for courtesy tell me the truth can you ever love me with one word of hope i will wait and work and feel myself to be a hero i will not go till you tell me that you cannot love me  then i must tell you so  what is it you will tell me nora speak it say it if i knew that a girl disliked me nothing should make me press myself upon her am i odious to you nora  no not odiousbut very very unfair  i will have the truth if i be ever so unfair he said and by this time probably some inkling of the truth had reached his intelligence there was already a tear in noras eye but he did not pity her she owed it to him to tell him the truth and he would have it from her if it was to be reached nora he said listen to me again all my heart and soul are in this it is everything to me if you can love me you are bound to say so by jove i will believe you do unless you swear to me that it is not so he was now holding her by the hand and looking closely into her face  mr stanbury she said let me go pray pray let me go  not till you say that you love me oh nora i believe that you love me you do yes you do love me dearest dearest nora would you not say a word to make me the happiest man in the world and now he had his arm round her waist  let me go she said struggling through her tears and covering her face with her hands you are very very wicked i will never speak to you again nay but you shall let me go and then she was out of his arms and had escaped from the room before he had managed to touch her face with his lips  as he was thinking how he also might escape nowmight escape and comfort himself with his triumphmrs outhouse returned to the chamber she was very demure and her manner towards him was considerably changed since she had left the chamber mr stanbury she said this kind of thing mustnt go any further indeedat least not in my house  what kind of thing mrs outhouse  wellwhat my elder niece has told me i have not seen miss rowley since she left you i am quite sure she has behaved with discretion  indeed she has mrs outhouse  the fact is my nieces are in grief and trouble and this is no time or place for lovemaking i am sorry to be uncivil but i must ask you not to come here any more  i will stay away from this house certainly if you bid me  i am very sorry but i must bid you sir marmaduke will be home in the spring and if you have anything to say to him of course you can see him  then hugh stanbury took his leave of mrs outhouse but as he went home again on the knifeboard of an omnibus he smoked the pipe of triumph rather than the pipe of contemplation     chapter xl  c g   the miss spaldings were met at the station at florence by their uncle the american minister by their cousin the american secretary of legation and by three or four other dear friends and relations who were there to welcome the newcomers to sunny italy mr glascock therefore who ten minutes since had been and had felt himself to be quite indispensable to their comfort suddenly became as though he were nothing and nobody who is there that has not felt these sudden disruptions to the intimacies and friendships of a long journey he bowed to them and they to him and then they were whirled away in their grandeur he put himself into a small open hackneycarriage and had himself driven to the york hotel feeling himself to be deserted and desolate the two miss spaldings were the daughters of a very respectable lawyer at boston whereas mr glascock was heir to a peerage to an enormous fortune and to one of the finest places in england but he thought nothing of this at the time as he went he was meditating which young woman was the most attractive nora rowley or caroline spalding he had no doubt but that nora was the prettier the pleasanter in manner the better dressed the more engaging in all that concerned the outer woman but he thought that he had never met any lady who talked better than caroline spalding and what was nora rowleys beauty to him had she not told him that she was the property of some one else or for the matter of that what was miss spalding to him they had parted and he was going on to naples in two days he had said some halfdefined word as to calling at the american embassy but it had not been taken up by either of the ladies he had not pressed it and so they had parted without an understanding as to a future meeting  the double journey from turin to bologna and from bologna to florence is very long and forms ample time for a considerable intimacy there had too been a long days journeying together before that and with no women is a speedy intimacy so possible or indeed so profitable as with americans they fear nothingneither you nor themselves and talk with as much freedom as though they were men it may perhaps be assumed to be true as a rule that womens society is always more agreeable to men than that of other menexcept for the lack of ease it undoubtedly is so when the women be young and pretty there is a feeling however among pretty women in europe that such freedom is dangerous and it is withheld there is such danger and more or less of such withholding is expedient but the american woman does not recognise the danger and if she withhold the grace of her countenance and the pearls of her speech it is because she is not desirous of the society which is proffered to her these two american sisters had not withholden their pearls from mr glascock he was much their senior in age he was gentle in his manners and they probably recognised him to be a safe companion they had no idea who he was and had not heard his name when they parted from him but it was not probable that they should have been with him so long and that they should leave him without further thought of him without curiosity or a desire to know more of him they had seen c g in large letters on his dressingbag and that was all they had learned as to his identity he had known their names well and had once called olivia by hers in the hurry of speaking to her sister he had apologised and there had been a little laugh and a discussion about the use of christian namessuch as is very conducive to intimacy between gentlemen and ladies when you can talk to a young lady about her own christian name you are almost entitled for the nonce to use it  mr glascock went to his hotel and was very moody and desolate his name was very soon known there and he received the honours due to his rank and station i should like to travel in america he said to himself if i could be sure that no one would find out who i was he had received letters at turin stating that his father was better and therefore he intended to remain two days at florence the weather was still very hot and florence in the middle of september is much preferable to naples  that night when the two miss spaldings were alone together they discussed their fellowtraveller thoroughly something of course had been said about him to their uncle the minister to their aunt the ministers wife and to their cousin the secretary of legation but travellers will always observe that the dear new friends they have made on their journey are not interesting to the dear old friends whom they meet afterwards there may be some touch of jealousy in this and then though you the traveller are fully aware that there has been something special in the case which has made this new friendship more peculiar than others that have sprung up in similar circumstances fathers and brothers and wives and sisters do not see it in that light they suspect perhaps that the new friend was a bagman or an opera dancer and think that the affair need not be made of importance the american minister had cast his eye on mr glascock during that momentary parting and had not thought much of mr glascock he was certainly a gentleman caroline had said there are a great many english gentlemen the minister had replied  i thought you would have asked him to call olivia said to her sister he did offer  i know he did i heard it  why didnt you tell him he might come  because we are not in boston livy it might be the most horrible thing in the world to do here in florence and it may make a difference because uncle jonas is minister  why should that make a difference do you mean that one isnt to see ones own friends that must be nonsense  but he isnt a friend livy  it seems to me as if id known him for ever that soft monotonous voice which never became excited and never disagreeable is as familiar to me as though i had lived with it all my life  i thought him very pleasant  indeed you did carry and he thought you pleasant too doesnt it seem odd you were mending his glove for him this very afternoon just as if he were your brother  why shouldnt i mend his glove  why not indeed he was entitled to have everything mended after getting us such a good dinner at bologna bythebye you never paid him  yes i didwhen you were not by  i wonder who he is c g that fine man in the brown coat was his servant you know i thought at first that c g must have been cracked and that the tall man was his keeper  i never knew any one less like a madman  nobut the man was so queer he did nothing you know we hardly saw him if you remember at turin all he did was to tie the shawls at bologna what can any man want with another man about with him like that unless he is cracked either in body or mind  youd better ask c g yourself  i shall never see c g again i suppose i should like to see him again i guess you would too carry eh  of course i shouldwhy not  i never knew a man so imperturbable and who had yet so much to say for himself i wonder what he is perhaps hes on business and that man was a kind of a clerk  he had livery buttons on said carry  and does that make a difference  i dont think they put clerks into livery even in england  nor yet mad doctors said olivia well i like him very much and the only thing against him is that he should have a man six feet high going about with him doing nothing  youll make me angry livy if you talk in that way its uncharitable  in what way  about a mad doctor  its my belief said olivia that hes an english swell a lord or a dukeand its my belief too that hes in love with you  its my belief livy that youre a regular assand so the conversation was ended on that occasion  on the next day about noon the american minister as a part of the duty which he owed to his country read in a publication of that day issued for the purpose the names of the new arrivals at florence first and foremost was that of the honourable charles glascock with his suite at the york hotel en route to join his father lord peterborough at naples having read the news first to himself the minister read it out loud in the presence of his nieces  thats our friend c g said livy  i should think not said the minister who had his own ideas about an english lord  im sure it is because of the tall man with the buttons said olivia  its very unlikely said the secretary of legation lord peterborough is a man of immense wealth very old indeed they say he is dying at naples this man is his eldest son  is that any reason why he shouldnt have been civil to us asked olivia  i dont think he is the sort of man likely to sit up in the banquette and he would have posted over the alps moreover he had his suite with him  his suite was buttons said olivia only fancy carry weve been waited on for two days by a lord as is to be and didnt know it and you have mended the tips of his lordships glove but carry said nothing at all  late on that same evening they met mr glascock close to the duomo under the shade of the campanile he had come out as they had done to see by moonlight that loveliest of all works made by mans hands they were with the minister but mr glascock came up and shook hands with them  i would introduce you to my uncle mr spalding said oliviaonlyas it happenswe have never yet heard your name  my name is mr glascock said he smiling then the introduction was made and the american minister took off his hat and was very affable  only think carry said olivia when they were alone that evening if you were to become the wife of an english lord     chapter xli  shewing what took place at st diddulphs      illustration  nora rowley when she escaped from the violence of her lover at once rushed up to her own room and managed to fasten herself in before she had been seen by any one her elder sister had at once gone to her aunt when at hughs request she had left the room thinking it right that mrs outhouse should know what was being done in her own house mrs outhouse had considered the matter patiently for awhile giving the lovers the benefit of her hesitation and had then spoken her mind to stanbury as we have already heard he had upon the whole been so well pleased with what had occurred that he was not in the least angry with the parsons wife when he left the parsonage as soon as he was gone mrs outhouse was at once joined by her elder niece but nora remained for a while alone in her room  had she committed herself and if so did she regret it he had behaved very badly to her certainly taking her by the hand and putting his arm round her waist and then had he not even attempted to kiss her he had done all this although she had been resolute in refusing to speak to him one word of kindnessthough she had told him with all the energy and certainty of which she was mistress that she would never be his wife if a girl were to be subjected to such treatment as this when she herself had been so firm so discreet so decided then indeed it would be unfit that a girl should trust herself with a man she had never thought that he had been such a one as that to illuse her to lay a hand on her in violence to refuse to take an answer she threw herself on the bed and sobbed and then hid her faceand was conscious that in spite of this acting before herself she was the happiest girl alive he had behaved very badlyof course he had behaved most wickedly and she would tell him so some day but was he not the dearest fellow living did ever man speak with more absolute conviction of love in every tone of his voice was it not the finest noblest heart that ever throbbed beneath a waistcoat had not his very wickedness come from the overpowering truth of his affection for her she would never quite forgive him because it had been so very wrong but she would be true to him for ever and ever of course they could not marry whatwould she go to him and be a clog round his neck and a weight upon him for ever bringing him down to the gutter by the burden of her own useless and unworthy self no she would never so injure him she would not even hamper him by an engagement but yet she would be true to him she had an idea that in spite of all her protestationswhich as she looked back upon them appeared to her to have been louder than they had beenthat through the teeth of her denials something of the truth had escaped from her welllet it be so it was the truth and why should he not know it then she pictured to herself a long romance in which the heroine lived happily on the simple knowledge that she had been beloved and the reader may be sure that in this romance mr glascock with his splendid prospects filled one of the characters  she had been so wretched at nuncombe putney when she had felt herself constrained to admit to herself that this man for whom she had sacrificed herself did not care for her that she could not now but enjoy her triumph after she had sobbed upon the bed she got up and walked about the room smiling and she would now press her hands to her forehead and then shake her tresses and then clasp her own left hand with her right as though he were still holding it wicked man why had he been so wicked and so violent and why why why had she not once felt his lips upon her brow  and she was pleased with herself her sister had rebuked her because she had refused to make her fortune by marrying mr glascock and to own the truth she had rebuked herself on the same score when she found that hugh stanbury had not had a word of love to say to her it was not that she regretted the grandeur which she had lost but that she should even within her own thoughts with the consciousness of her own bosom have declared herself unable to receive another mans devotion because of her love for this man who neglected her now she was proud of herself whether it might be accounted as good or illfortune that she had ever seen hugh stanbury it must at any rate be right that she should be true to him now that she had seen him and had loved him to know that she loved and that she was not loved again had nearly killed her but such was not her lot she too had been successful with her quarry and had struck her game and brought down her dear he had been very violent with her but his violence had at least made the matter clear he did love her she would be satisfied with that and would endeavour so to live that that alone should make life happy for her how should she get his photographand a lock of his hairand when again might she have the pleasure of placing her own hand within his great rough violent grasp then she kissed the hand which he had held and opened the door of her room at which her sister was now knocking  nora dear will you not come down  not yet emily very soon i will  and what has happened dearest  there is nothing to tell emily  there must be something to tell what did he say to you  of course you know what he said  and what answer did you make  i told him that it could not be  and did he take thatas final nora  of course not what man ever takes a no as final  when you said no to mr glascock he took it  that was different emily  but how different i dont see the difference except that if you could have brought yourself to like mr glascock it would have been the greatest thing in the world for you and for all of them  would you have me take a man emily that i didnt care one straw for merely because he was a lord you cant mean that  im not talking about mr glascock now nora  yes you are and whats the use he is gone and theres an end of it  and is mr stanbury gone  of course  in the same way asked mrs trevelyan  how can i tell about his ways no it is not in the same way there he went in a very different way  how was it different nora  oh so different i cant tell you how mr glascock will never come back again  and mr stanbury will said the elder sister nora made no reply but after a while nodded her head and you want him to come back she paused again and again nodded her head then you have accepted him  i have not accepted him i have refused him i have told him that it was impossible  and yet you wish him back again nora again nodded her head that is a state of things i cannot at all understand said mrs trevelyan and would not believe unless you told me so yourself  and you think me very wrong of course i will endeavour to do nothing wrong but it is so i have not said a word of encouragement to mr stanbury but i love him with all my heart ought i to tell you a lie when you question me or is it natural that i should never wish to see again a person whom i love better than all the world it seems to me that a girl can hardly be right if she have any choice of her own here are two men one rich and the other poor i shall fall to the ground between them i know that i have fallen to the ground already i like the one i cant marry i dont care a straw for the one who could give me a grand house that is falling to the ground but i dont see that it is hard to understand or that i have disgraced myself  i said nothing of disgrace nora  but you looked it  i did not intend to look it dearest  and remember this emily i have told you everything because you asked me i do not mean to tell anybody else at all mamma would not understand me i have not told him and i shall not  you mean mr stanbury  yes i mean mr stanbury as to mr glascock of course i shall tell mamma that i have no secret there that is his secret and i suppose mamma should know it but i will have nothing told about the other had i accepted him or even hinted to him that i cared for him i would tell mamma at once  after that there came something of a lecture or something rather of admonition from mrs outhouse that lady did not attempt to upbraid or to find any fault but observed that as she understood that mr stanbury had no means whatever and as nora herself had none there had better be no further intercourse between them till at any rate sir marmaduke and lady rowley should be in london so i told him that he must not come here any more my dear said mrs outhouse  you are quite right aunt he ought not to come here  i am so glad that you agree with me  i agree with you altogether i think i was bound to see him when he asked to see me but the thing is altogether out of the question i dont think hell come any more aunt then mrs outhouse was quite satisfied that no harm had been done  a month had now passed since anything had been heard at st diddulphs from mr trevelyan and it seemed that many months might go on in the same dull way when mrs trevelyan first found herself in her uncles house a sum of two hundred pounds had been sent to her and since that she had received a letter from her husbands lawyer saying that a similar amount would be sent to her every three months as long as she was separated from her husband a portion of this she had given over to mr outhouse but this pecuniary assistance by no means comforted that unfortunate gentleman in his trouble i dont want to get into debt he said by keeping a lot of people whom i havent the means to feed and i dont want to board and lodge my nieces and their family at so much a head its very hard upon me either way and so it was all the comfort of his home was destroyed and he was driven to sacrifice his independence by paying his tradesmen with a portion of mrs trevelyans money the more he thought of it all and the more he discussed the matter with his wife the more indignant they became with the truant husband i cant believe he said but what mr bideawhile could make him come back if he chose to do his duty  but they say that mr trevelyan is in italy my dear  and if i went to italy might i leave you to starve and take my income with me  he doesnt leave her quite to starve my dear  but isnt a man bound to stay with his wife i never heard of such a thingnever and im sure that there must be something wrong a man cant go away and leave his wife to live with her uncle and aunt it isnt right  but what can we do  mr outhouse was forced to acknowledge that nothing could be done he was a man to whom the quiescence of his own childless house was the one pleasure of his existence and of that he was robbed because this wicked madman chose to neglect all his duties and leave his wife without a house to shelter her supposing that she couldnt have come here what then said mr outhouse i did tell him as plain as words could speak that we couldnt receive them but here they are said mrs outhouse and here they must remain till my brother comes to england its the most monstrous thing that i ever heard of in all my life said mr outhouse he ought to be locked upthats what he ought  it was hard and it became harder when a gentleman whom mr outhouse certainly did not wish to see called upon him about the latter end of september mr outhouse was sitting alone in the gloomy parlour of his parsonagefor his own study had been given up to other things since this great inroad had been made upon his familyhe was sitting alone on one saturday morning preparing for the duties of the next day with various manuscript sermons lying on the table around him when he was told that a gentleman had called to see him had mr outhouse been an incumbent at the westend of london or had his maid been a westend servant in all probability the gentlemans name would have been demanded but mr outhouse was a man who was not very ready in foreseeing and preventing misfortunes and the girl who opened the door was not trained to discreet usages in such matters as she announced the fact that there was a gentleman she pointed to the door to show that the gentleman was there and before mr outhouse had been able to think whether it would be prudent for him to make some preliminary inquiry colonel osborne was in the room now as it happened these two men had never hitherto met each other though one was the brotherinlaw of sir marmaduke rowley and the other had been his very old friend my name mr outhouse is colonel osborne said the visitor coming forward with his hand out the clergyman of course took his hand and asked him to be seated we have known each others names very long continued the colonel though i do not think we have ever yet had an opportunity of becoming acquainted      illustration at st diddulphs   no said mr outhouse we have never been acquainted i believe he might have added that he had no desire whatever to make such acquaintance and his manner over which he himself had no control did almost say as much indeed this coming to his house of the suspected lover of his niece appeared to him to be a heavy addition to his troubles for although he was disposed to take his nieces part against her husband to any possible lengtheven to the locking up of the husband as a madman if it were possiblenevertheless he had almost as great a horror of the colonel as though the husbands allegation as to the lover had been true as gospel because trevelyan had been wrong altogether colonel osborne was not the less wrong because trevelyans suspicions were to mr outhouse wicked and groundless he did not the less regard the presumed lover to be an iniquitous roaring lion going about seeking whom he might devour elderly unmarried men of fashion generally and especially colonels and majors and members of parliament and such like were to him as black sheep or roaring lions they were fruges consumere nati men who stood on club doorsteps talking naughtily and doing nothing wearing sleek clothing for which they very often did not pay and never going to church it seemed to himin his ignorancethat such men had none of the burdens of this world upon their shoulders and that therefore they stood in great peril of the burdens of the next it was doubtless his special duty to deal with men in such perilbut those wicked ones with whom he was concerned were those whom he could reach now the colonel osbornes of the earth were not to be got at by any clergyman or as far as mr outhouse could see by any means of grace that story of the rich man and the camel seemed to him to be specially applicable to such people how was such a one as colonel osborne to be shewn the way through the eye of a needle to mr outhouse his own brotherinlaw sir marmaduke was almost of the same classfor he frequented clubs when in london and played whist and talked of the things of the worldsuch as the derby and the levées and westend dinner partiesas though they were all in all to him he to be sure was weighted with so large a family that there might be hope for him the eye of the needle could not be closed against him as a rich man but he savoured of the westend and was worldly and consorted with such men as this colonel osborne when colonel osborne introduced himself to mr outhouse it was almost as though apollyon had made his way into the parsonage of st diddulphs  mr outhouse said the colonel i have thought it best to come to you the very moment that i got back to town from scotland mr outhouse bowed and was bethinking himself slowly what manner of speech he would adopt i leave town again tomorrow for dorsetshire i am going down to my friends the brambers for partridge shooting mr outhouse knitted his thick brows in further inward condemnation partridge shooting yesthis was september and partridge shooting would be the probable care and occupation of such a man at such a time a man without a duty in the world perhaps added to this there was a feeling that whereas colonel osborne could shoot scotch grouse in august and dorsetshire partridges in september and go about throughout the whole year like a roaring lion he mr outhouse was forced to remain at st diddulphsintheeast from january to december with the exception of one small parsons week spent at margate for the benefit of his wifes health if there was such a thought or rather such a feeling who will say that it was not natural but i could not go through london without seeing you continued the colonel this is a most frightful infatuation of trevelyan  very frightful indeed said mr outhouse  and on my honour as a gentleman not the slightest cause in the world  you are old enough to be the ladys father said mr outhouse managing in that to get one blow at the gallant colonel  just so god bless my soul mr outhouse shrunk visibly at this profane allusion to the colonels soul why ive known her father ever so many years as you say i might almost be her father myself as far as age went such certainly might have been the case for the colonel was older than sir marmaduke look here mr outhouse here is a letter i got from emily  from mrs trevelyan  yes from mrs trevelyan and as well as i can understand it must have been sent to me by trevelyan himself did you ever hear of such a thing and now im told he has gone away nobody knows where and has left her here  he has gone awaynobody knows where  of course i dont ask to see her  it would be imprudent colonel osborne and could not be permitted in this house  i dont ask it i have known emily trevelyan since she was an infant and have always loved her im her godfather for aught i knowthough one forgets things of that sort mr outhouse again knit his eyebrows and shuddered visibly she and i have been fast friendsand why not but of course i cant interfere  if you ask me colonel osborne i should say that you can do nothing in the matterexcept to remain away from her when sir marmaduke is in england you can see him if you please  see himof course i shall see him and by george louis trevelyan will have to see him too i shouldnt like to have to stand up before rowley if i had treated a daughter of his in such a fashion you know rowley of course  oh yes i know him  hes not the sort of man to bear this sort of thing hell about tear trevelyan in pieces if he gets hold of him god bless my soul the eyebrows went to work againi never heard of such a thing in all my life does he pay anything for them mr outhouse  this was dreadful to the poor clergyman that is a subject which we surely need not discuss said he then he remembered that such speech on his part was like to a subterfuge and he found it necessary to put himself right i am repaid for the maintenance here of my nieces and the little boy and their attendants i do not know why the question should be asked but such is the fact  then they are here by agreement between you and him  no sir they are not there is no such agreement but i do not like these interrogatives from a stranger as to matters which should be private  you cannot wonder at my interest mr outhouse  you had better restrain it sir till sir marmaduke arrives i shall then wash my hands of the affair  and she is pretty wellemily i mean  mrs trevelyans health is good  pray tell her though i could notmight not ask to see her i came to inquire after her the first moment that i was in london pray tell her how much i feel for herbut she will know that when sir marmaduke is here of course we shall meet when she is once more under her fathers wing she need not be restrained by any absurd commands from a husband who has deserted her at present of course i do not ask to see her  of course you do not colonel osborne  and give my love to noradear little nora there can be no reason why she and i should not shake hands  i should prefer that it should not be so in this house said the clergyman who was now standingin expectation that his unwelcome guest would go  very wellso be it but you will understand i could not be in london without coming and asking after them then the colonel at last took his leave and mr outhouse was left to his solitude and his sermons  mrs outhouse was very angry when she heard of the visit men of that sort she said think it a fine thing and talk about it i believe the poor girl is as innocent as i am but he isnt innocent he likes it  it is easier said mr outhouse solemnly for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god  i dont know that he is a rich man said mrs outhouse but he wouldnt have come here if he had been honest  mrs trevelyan was told of the visit and simply said that of course it was out of the question that she should have seen colonel osborne nevertheless she seemed to think it quite natural that he should have called and defended him with some energy when her aunt declared that he had been much to blame he is not bound to obey mr trevelyan because i am said emily  he is bound to abstain from evil doing said mrs outhouse and he oughtnt to have come there let that be enough my dear your uncle doesnt wish to have it talked about nevertheless it was talked about between the two sisters nora was of opinion that colonel osborne had been wrong whereas emily defended him it seems to me to have been the most natural thing in life said she  had colonel osborne made the visit as sir marmadukes friend feeling himself to be an old man it might have been natural when a man has come to regard himself as being on the score of age about as fit to be a young ladys lover as though he were an old woman instead of an old manwhich some men will do when they are younger even than was colonel osbornehe is justified in throwing behind him as utterly absurd the suspicions of other people but colonel osborne cannot be defended altogether on that plea     chapter xlii  miss stanbury and mr gibson become two   there came to be a very gloomy fortnight at miss stanburys house in the close for two or three days after mr gibsons dismissal at the hands of miss stanbury herself brooke burgess was still in the house and his presence saved dorothy from the full weight of her aunts displeasure there was the necessity of looking after brooke and scolding him and of praising him to martha and of dispraising him and of seeing that he had enough to eat and of watching whether he smoked in the house and of quarrelling with him about everything under the sun which together so employed miss stanbury that she satisfied herself with glances at dorothy which were felt to be full of charges of ingratitude dorothy was thankful that it should be so and bore the glances with abject submission and then there was a great comfort to her in brookes friendship on the second day after mr gibson had gone she found herself talking to brooke quite openly upon the subject the fact was mr burgess that i didnt really care for him i know hes very good and all that and of course aunt stanbury meant it all for the best and i would have done it if i could but i couldnt brooke patted her on the backnot in the flesh but in the spiritand told her that she was quite right and he expressed an opinion too that it was not expedient to yield too much to aunt stanbury i would yield to her in anything that was possible to me said dorothy i wont said he and i dont think i should do any good if i did i like her and i like her money but i dont like either well enough to sell myself for a price  a great part too of the quarrelling which went on from day to day between brooke and miss stanbury was due to the difference of their opinions respecting dorothy and her suitor i believe you put her up to it said aunt stanbury  i neither put her up nor down but i think that she was quite right  youve robbed her of a husband and shell never have another chance after what youve done you ought to take her yourself  i shall be ready tomorrow said brooke  how can you tell such a lie said aunt stanbury  but after two or three days brooke was gone to make a journey through the distant part of the county and see the beauties of devonshire he was to be away for a fortnight and then come back for a day or two before he returned to london during that fortnight things did not go well with poor dorothy at exeter  i suppose you know your own business best her aunt said to her one morning dorothy uttered no word of reply she felt it to be equally impossible to suggest either that she did or that she did not know her own business best there may be reasons which i dont understand exclaimed aunt stanbury but i should like to know what it is you expect  why should i expect anything aunt stanbury  thats nonsense everybody expects something you expect to have your dinner byandbydont you  i suppose i shall said dorothy to whom it occurred at the moment that such expectation was justified by the fact that on every day of her life hitherto some sort of a dinner had come in her way  yesand you think it comes from heaven i suppose  it comes by gods goodness and your bounty aunt stanbury  and how will it come when im dead or how will it come if things should go in such a way that i cant stay here any longer you dont ever think of that  i should go back to mamma and priscilla  psha as if two mouths were not enough to eat all the meal there is in that tub if there was a word to say against the man i wouldnt ask you to have him if he drank or smoked or wasnt a gentleman or was too poor or anything you like but theres nothing its all very well to tell me you dont love him but why dont you love him i dont like a girl to go and throw herself at a mans head as those frenches have done but when everything has been prepared for you and made proper it seems to me to be like turning away from good victuals dorothy could only offer to go home if she had offended her aunt and then miss stanbury scolded her for making the offer as this kind of thing went on at the house in the close for a fortnight during which there was no going out and no society at home dorothy began to be rather tired of it  at the end of the fortnight on the morning of the day on which brooke burgess was expected back dorothy slowly moving into the sitting room with her usual melancholy air found mr gibson talking to her aunt there she is herself said miss stanbury jumping up briskly and now you can speak to her of course i have no authoritynone in the least but she knows what my wishes are and having so spoken miss stanbury left the room  it will be remembered that hitherto no word of affection had been whispered by mr gibson into dorothys ears when he came before to press his suit she had been made aware of his coming and had fled leaving her answer with her aunt mr gibson had then expressed himself as somewhat injured in that no opportunity of pouring forth his own eloquence had been permitted to him on that occasion miss stanbury being in a snubbing humour had snubbed him she had in truth scolded him almost as much as she had scolded dorothy telling him that he went about the business in hand as though butter wouldnt melt in his mouth youre stiff as a chairback she had said to him with a few other compliments and these amenities had for a while made him regard the establishment at heavitree as being at any rate pleasanter than that in the close but since that cool reflection had come the proposal was not that he should marry miss stanbury senior who certainly could be severe on occasions but miss stanbury junior whose temper was as sweet as primroses in march that which he would have to take from miss stanbury senior was a certain sum of money as to which her promise was as good as any bond in the world things had come to such a pass with him in exeterfrom the hints of his friend the prebend from a word or two which had come to him from the dean from certain family arrangements proposed to him by his mother and sistersthings had come to such a pass that he was of a mind that he had better marry some one he had as it were three strings to his bow there were the two french strings and there was dorothy he had not breadth of genius enough to suggest to himself that yet another woman might be found there was a difficulty on the french score even about miss stanbury but it was clear to him that failing her he was due to one of the two miss frenches now it was not only that the miss frenches were emptyhanded but he was beginning to think himself that they were not as nice as they might have been in reference to the arrangement of their headgear therefore having given much thought to the matter and remembering that he had never yet had play for his own eloquence with dorothy he had come to miss stanbury asking that he might have another chance it had been borne in upon him that he had perhaps hitherto regarded dorothy as too certainly his own since she had been offered to him by her auntas being a prize that required no eloquence in the winning and he thought that if he could have an opportunity of amending that fault it might even yet be well with his suit so he prepared himself and asked permission and now found himself alone with the young lady  when last i was in this house miss stanbury he began i was not fortunate enough to be allowed an opportunity of pleading my cause to yourself then he paused and dorothy was left to consider how best she might answer him all that her aunt had said to her had not been thrown away upon her the calls upon that slender mealtub at home she knew were quite sufficient and mr gibson was she believed a good man and how better could she dispose of herself in life and what was she that she should scorn the love of an honest gentleman she would take him she thoughtif she could but then there came upon her unconsciously without work of thought by instinct rather than by intelligence a feeling of the closeness of a wife to her husband looking at it in general she could not deny that it would be very proper that she should become mrs gibson but when there came upon her a remembrance that she would be called upon for demonstration of her lovethat he would embrace her and hold her to his heart and kiss hershe revolted and shuddered she believed that she did not want to marry any man and that such a state of things would not be good for her dear young lady continued mr gibson you will let me now make up for the loss which i then experienced  i thought it was better not to give you trouble said dorothy  trouble miss stanbury how could it be trouble the labour we delight in physics pain but to go back to the subjectmatter i hope you do not doubt that my affection for you is true and honest and genuine  i dont want to doubt anything mr gibson but  you neednt dearest miss stanbury indeed you neednt if you could read my heart you would see written there true love very plainlyvery plainly and do you not think it a duty that people should marry it may be surmised that he had here forgotten some connecting link which should have joined without abruptness the declaration of his own love and his social view as to the general expediency of matrimony but dorothy did not discover the hiatus  certainlywhen they like each other and if their friends think it proper  our friends think it proper miss stanburymay i say dorothyall of them i can assure you that on my side you will be welcomed by a mother and sisters only too anxious to receive you with open arms and as regards your own relations i need hardly allude to your revered aunt as to your own mother and sisterand your brother who i believe gives his mind chiefly to other thingsi am assured by miss stanbury that no opposition need be feared from them is that true dearest dorothy  it is true  does not all that plead in my behalf tell me dorothy  of course it does  and you will be mine as far as eloquence could be of service mr gibson was sufficiently eloquent to dorothy his words appeared good and true and affecting all their friends did wish it there were many reasons why it should be done if talking could have done it his talking was good enough though his words were in truth cold and affected and learned by rote they did not offend her but his face offended her and the feeling was strong within her that if she yielded it would soon be close to her own she couldnt do it she didnt love him and she wouldnt do it priscilla would not grudge her her share out of that meagre mealtub had not priscilla told her not to marry the man if she did not love him she found that she was further than ever from loving him she would not do it say that you will be mine pleaded mr gibson coming to her with both his hands outstretched  mr gibson i cant she said she was sobbing now and was half choked by tears  and why not dorothy  i dont know but i cant i dont feel that i want to be married at all  but it is honourable  its no use mr gibson i cant and you oughtnt to ask me any more  must this be your very last answer  whats the good of going over it all again and again i cant do it  never miss stanbury  nonever  that is cruel very cruel i fear that you doubt my love  it isnt cruel mr gibson i have a right to have my own feelings and i cant if you please ill go away now then she went and he was left standing alone in the room his first feeling was one of anger then there came to be mixed with that a good deal of wonderand then a certain amount of doubt he had during the last fortnight discussed the matter at great length with a friend a gentleman who knew the world and who took upon himself to say that he specially understood female nature it was by advice from this friend that he had been instigated to plead his own cause of course she means to accept you the friend had said why the mischief shouldnt she but she has some flimsy oldfashioned country idea that it isnt maidenly to give in at first you tell her roundly that she must marry you mr gibson was just reaching that roundness which his friend had recommended when the lady left him and he was alone  mr gibson was no doubt very much in love with dorothy stanbury so much we may take for granted he at least believed that he was in love with her he would have thought it wicked to propose to her had he not been in love with her but with his love was mingled a certain amount of contempt which had induced him to look upon her as an easy conquest he had been perhaps a little ashamed of himself for being in love with dorothy and had almost believed the frenches when they had spoken of her as a poor creature a dependant one born to be snubbedas a young woman almost without an identity of her own when therefore she so pertinaciously refused him he could not but be angry and it was natural that he should be surprised though he was to have received a fortune with dorothy the money was not hers it was to be hersor rather theirsonly if she would accept him mr gibson thoroughly understood this point he knew that dorothy had nothing of her own the proposal made to her was as rich as though he had sought her down at nuncombe putney with his preferment plus the £2000 in his own pocket and his other advantages were not hidden from his own eyes he was a clergyman well thought of not badlooking certainly considerably under fortya man indeed who ought to have been in the eyes of dorothy such an orlando as she would have most desired he could not therefore but wonder and then came the doubt could it be possible that all those refusals were simply the early pulses of hesitating compliance produced by maidenly reserve mr gibsons friend had expressed a strong opinion that almost any young woman would accept any young man if he put his com ether upon her strong enough for mr gibsons friend was an irishman as to dorothy the friend had not a doubt in the world mr gibson as he stood alone in the room after dorothys departure could not share his friends certainty but he thought it just possible that the pulsations of maidenly reserve were yet at work as he was revolving these points in his mind miss stanbury entered the room  its all over now she said  as how miss stanbury  as how shes given you an answer hasnt she  yes miss stanbury she has given me an answer but it has occurred to me that young ladies are sometimesperhaps a little  she means it mr gibson you may take my word for that she is quite in earnest she can take the bit between her teeth as well as another though she does look so mild and gentle shes a stanbury all over  and must this be the last of it miss stanbury  upon my word i dont know what else you can dounless you send the dean and chapter to talk her over shes a pigheaded foolish young womanbut i cant help that the truth is you didnt make enough of her at first mr gibson you thought the plum would tumble into your mouth  this did seem cruel to the poor man from the first day in which the project had been opened to him by miss stanbury he had yielded a ready acquiescencein spite of those ties which he had at heavitreeand had done his very best to fall into her views i dont think that is at all fair miss stanbury he said with some tone of wrath in his voice  its truequite true you always treated her as though she were something beneath you mr gibson stood speechless with his mouth open so you did i saw it all and now shes had spirit enough to resent it i dont wonder at it i dont indeed its no good your standing there any longer the thing is done  such intolerable illusage mr gibson had never suffered in his life had he been untrue or very nearly untrue to those dear girls at heavitree for this i never treated her as anything beneath me he said at last  yes you did do you think that i dont understand havent i eyes in my head and ears im not deaf yet nor blind but theres an end of it if any young woman ever meant anything she means it the truth is she dont like you  was ever a lover despatched in so uncourteous a way then too he had been summoned thither as a lover had been specially encouraged to come there as a lover had been assured of success in a peculiar way had had the plum actually offered to him he had done all that this old woman had bidden himsomething indeed to the prejudice of his own heart he had been told that the wife was ready for him and now because this foolish young woman didnt know her own mindthis was mr gibsons view of the matterhe was reviled and abused and told that he had behaved badly to the lady miss stanbury he said i think that you are forgetting yourself  highty tighty said miss stanbury forgetting myself i shant forget you in a hurry mr gibson  nor i you miss stanbury good morning miss stanbury mr gibson as he went from the halldoor into the street shook the dust off his feet and resolved that for the future he and miss stanbury should be two there would arise great trouble in exeter but nevertheless he and miss stanbury must be two he could justify himself in no other purpose after such conduct as he had received     chapter xliii  laburnum cottage   there had been various letters passing during the last six weeks between priscilla stanbury and her brother respecting the clock house at nuncombe putney the ladies at nuncombe had certainly gone into the clock house on the clear understanding that the expenses of the establishment were to be incurred on behalf of mrs trevelyan priscilla had assented to the movement most doubtingly she had disliked the idea of taking the charge of a young married woman who was separated from her husband and she had felt that a going down after such an uprisinga fall from the clock house back to a cottagewould be very disagreeable she had however allowed her brothers arguments to prevail and there they were the annoyance which she had anticipated from the position of their late guest had fallen upon them it had been felt grievously from the moment in which colonel osborne called at the house and now that going back to the cottage must be endured priscilla understood that there had been a settlement between trevelyan and stanbury as to the cost of the establishment so farbut that must now be at an end in their present circumstances she would not continue to live there and had already made inquiries as to some humble roof for their shelter for herself she would not have cared had it been necessary for her to hide herself in a hutfor herself as regarded any feeling as to her own standing in the village for herself she was ashamed of nothing but her mother would suffer and she knew what aunt stanbury would say to dorothy to dorothy at the present moment if dorothy should think of accepting her suitor the change might be very deleterious but still it should be made she could not endure to live there on the very hardearned proceeds of her brothers penproceeds which were not only hardearned but precarious she gave warning to the two servants who had been hired and consulted with mrs crocket as to a cottage and was careful to let it be known throughout nuncombe putney that the clock house was to be abandoned the clock house had been taken furnished for six months of which half were not yet over but there were other expenses of living there much greater than the rent and go she would her mother sighed and assented and mrs crocket having strongly but fruitlessly advised that the clock house should be inhabited at any rate for the six months promised her assistance it has been a bad business mrs crocket said priscilla and all we can do now is to get out of it as well as we can every mouthful i eat chokes me while i stay there it aint good certainly miss not to know as youre all straight the first thing as you wakes in the morning said mrs crocketwho was always able to feel when she woke that everything was straight with her  then there came the correspondence between priscilla and hugh priscilla was at first decided indeed but mild in the expression of her decision to this and to one or two other missives couched in terms of increasing decision hugh answered with manly selfasserting overbearing arguments the house was theirs till christmas between this and then he would think about it he could very well afford to keep the house on till next midsummer and then they might see what had best be done there was plenty of money and priscilla need not put herself into a flutter in answer to that word flutter priscilla wrote as follows      clock house september 16 186     dear hugh     i know very well how good you are and how generous but    you must allow me to have feelings as well as yourself i    will not consent to have myself regarded as a grand lady    out of your earnings how should i feel when some day i    heard that you had run yourself into debt neither mamma    nor i could endure it dorothy is provided for now at any    rate for a time and what we have is enough for us you    know i am not too proud to take anything you can spare to    us when we are ourselves placed in a proper position but    i could not live in this great house while you are paying    for everythingand i will not mamma quite agrees with    me and we shall go out of it on michaelmasday mrs    crocket says she thinks she can get you a tenant for the    three months out of exeterif not for the whole rent    at least for part of it i think we have already got a    small place for eight shillings a week a little out of    the village on the road to cockchaffington you will    remember it old soames used to live there our old    furniture will be just enough there is a mite of a    garden and mrs crocket says she thinks we can get it for    seven shillings or perhaps for six and sixpence if we    stay there we shall go in on the 29th mrs crocket will    see about having somebody to take care of the house     your most affectionate sister     priscilla   on the receipt of this letter hugh proceeded to nuncombe at this time he was making about ten guineas a week and thought that he saw his way to further work no doubt the ten guineas were precariousthat is the daily record might discontinue his services tomorrow if the daily record thought fit to do so the greater part of his earnings came from the d r and the editor had only to say that things did not suit any longer and there would be an end of it he was not as a lawyer or a doctor with many clients who could not all be supposed to withdraw their custom at once but leading articles were things wanted with at least as much regularity as physic or law and hugh stanbury believing in himself did not think it probable that an editor who knew what he was about would withdraw his patronage he was proud of his weekly ten guineas feeling sure that a weekly ten guineas would not as yet have been his had he stuck to the bar as a profession he had calculated when mrs trevelyan left the clock house that two hundred a year would enable his mother to continue to reside there the rent of the place furnished or halffurnished being only eighty and he thought that he could pay the two hundred easily he thought so still when he received priscillas last letter but he knew something of the stubbornness of his dear sister and he therefore went down to nuncombe putney in order that he might use the violence of his logic on his mother  he had heard of mr gibson from both priscilla and from dorothy and was certainly desirous that dear old dolly as he called her should be settled comfortably but when dear old dolly wrote to him declaring that it could not be so that mr gibson was a very nice gentleman of whom she could not say that she was particularly fondthough i really do think that he is an excellent man and if it was any other girl in the world i should recommend her to take himand that she thought that she would rather not get married he wrote to her the kindest brotherly letter in the world telling her that she was a brick and suggesting to her that there might come some day some one who would suit her taste better than mr gibson im not very fond of parsons myself said hugh but you must not tell that to aunt stanbury then he suggested that as he was going down to nuncombe dorothy should get leave of absence and come over and meet him at the clock house dorothy demanded the leave of absence somewhat imperiously and was at home at the clock house when hugh arrived  and so that little affair couldnt come off said hugh at their first family meeting  it was a pity said mrs stanbury plaintively she had been very plaintive on the subject what a thing it would have been for her could she have seen dorothy so well established  theres no help for spilt milk mother said hugh mrs stanbury shook her head  dorothy was quite right said priscilla  of course she was right said hugh who doubts her being right bless my soul whats any girl to do if she dont like a man except to tell him so i honour you dollynot that i ever should have doubted you youre too much of a chip of the old block to say you liked a man when you didnt  he is a very excellent young man said mrs stanbury  an excellent fiddlestick mother loving and liking dont go by excellence besides i dont know about his being any better than anybody else just because hes a clergyman  a clergyman is more likely to be steady than other men said the mother  steady yes and as selfish as you please  your father was a clergyman hugh  i dont mean to say that they are not as good as others but i wont have it that they are better they are always dealing with the bible till they think themselves apostles but when money comes up or comfort or for the matter of that either a pretty woman with a little money then they are as human as the rest of us  if the truth had been told on that occasion hugh stanbury would have had to own that he had written lately two or three rather stinging articles in the daily record as to the assumed merits and actual demerits of the clergy of the church of england it is astonishing how fluent a man is on a subject when he has lately delivered himself respecting it in this fashion  nothing on that evening was said about the clock house or about priscillas intentions priscilla was up early on the next morning intending to discuss it in the garden with hugh before breakfast but hugh was aware of her purpose and avoided her it was his intention to speak first to his mother and though his mother was as he knew very much in awe of her daughter he thought that he might carry his point at any rate for the next three months by forcing an assent from the elder lady so he managed to waylay mrs stanbury before she descended to the parlour  we cant afford it my dearindeed we cant said mrs stanbury  thats not the question mother the rent must be paid up to christmas and you can live here as cheap as you can anywhere  but priscilla  oh priscilla of course we know what priscilla says priscilla has been writing to me about it in the most sensible manner in the world but what does it all come to if you are ashamed of taking assistance from me i dont know who is to do anything for anybody you are comfortable here  very comfortable only priscilla feels  priscilla is a tyrant mother and a very stern one just make up your mind to stay here till christmas if i tell you that i can afford it surely that ought to be enough then dorothy entered the room and hugh appealed to her dorothy had come to nuncombe only on the day before and had not been consulted on the subject she had been told that the clock house was to be abandoned and had been taken down to inspect the cottage in which old soames had livedbut her opinion had not been asked priscilla had quite made up her mind and why should she ask an opinion of any one but now dorothys opinion was demanded its what i call the rhodomontade of independence said hugh  i suppose it is very expensive suggested dorothy  the house must be paid for said hughand if i say that ive got the money is not that enough a miserable dirty little place where youll catch your death of lumbago mother  of course its not a comfortable house said mrs stanburywho of herself was not at all indifferent to the comforts of her present residence  and it is very dirty said dorothy  the nastiest place i ever saw in my life come mother if i say that i can afford it ought not that to be enough for you if you think you cant trust me theres an end of everything you know and hugh as he thus expressed himself assumed an air of injured virtue  mrs stanbury had very nearly yielded when priscilla came in among them it was impossible not to continue the conversation though hugh would much have preferred to have forced an assent from his mother before he opened his mouth on the subject to his sister my mother agrees with me said he abruptly and so does dolly that it will be absurd to move away from this house at present  mamma exclaimed priscilla  i dont think i said that hugh murmured dorothy softly  im sure i dont want anything for myself said mrs stanbury  its i that want it said hugh and i think that ive a right to have my wishes respected so far as that goes  my dear hugh said priscilla the cottage is already taken and we shall certainly go into it i spoke to mrs crocket yesterday about a cart for moving the things im sure mamma agrees with me what possible business can people have to live in such a house as this with about twentyfour shillings a week for everything i wont do it and as the thing is settled it is only making trouble to disturb it  i suppose priscilla said hugh youll do as your mother chooses  mamma chooses to go she has told me so already  you have talked her into it  we had better go hugh said mrs stanbury im sure we had better go  of course we shall go said priscilla hugh is very kind and very generous but he is only giving trouble for nothing about this had we not better go down to breakfast  and so priscilla carried the day they went down to breakfast and during the meal hugh would speak to nobody when the gloomy meal was over he took his pipe and walked out to the cottage it was an untidylooking rickety place small and desolate with a pretension about it of the lowest order a pretension that was evidently ashamed of itself there was a porch and the one sittingroom had what the late mr soames had always called his bow window but the porch looked as though it were tumbling down and the bow window looked as though it were tumbling out the parlour and the bedroom over it had been paperedbut the paper was torn and soiled and in sundry places was hanging loose there was a miserable little room called a kitchen to the right as you entered the door in which the grate was worn out and behind this was a shed with a copper in the garden there remained the stumps and stalks of mr soamess cabbages and there were weeds in plenty and a damp hole among some elder bushes called an arbour it was named laburnum cottage from a shrub that grew at the end of the house hugh stanbury shuddered as he stood smoking among the cabbagestalks how could a man ask such a girl as nora rowley to be his wife whose mother lived in a place like this while he was still standing in the garden and thinking of priscillas obstinacy and his own ten guineas a week and the sort of life which he lived in londonwhere he dined usually at his club and denied himself nothing in the way of pipes beer and beefsteaks he heard a step behind him and turning round saw his elder sister  hugh she said you must not be angry with me  but i am angry with you  i know you are but you are unjust i am doing what i am sure is right  i never saw such a beastly hole as this in all my life  i dont think it beastly at all youll find that ill make it nice whatever we want here you shall give us you are not to think that i am too proud to take anything at your hands it is not that  its very like it  i have never refused anything that is reasonable but it is quite unreasonable that we should go on living in such a place as that as though we had three or four hundred a year of our own if mamma got used to the comfort of it it would be hard then upon her to move you shall give her what you can afford and what is reasonable but it is madness to think of living there i couldnt do it  youre to have your way at any rate it seems  but you must not quarrel with me hugh give me a kiss i dont have you often with me and yet you are the only man in the world that i ever speak to or even know i sometimes half think that the bread is so hard and the water so bitter that life will become impossible i try to get over it but if you were to go away from me in anger i should be so beaten for a week or two that i could do nothing  why wont you let me do anything  i willwhatever you please but kiss me then he kissed her as he stood among mr soamess cabbagestalks dear hugh you are such a god to me  you dont treat me like a divinity  but i think of you as one when you are absent the gods were never obeyed when they showed themselves let us go and have a walk comeshall we get as far as ridleigh mill then they started together and all unpleasantness was over between them when they returned to the clock house     chapter xliv  brooke burgess takes leave of exeter      illustration  the time had arrived at which brooke burgess was to leave exeter he had made his tour through the county and returned to spend his two last nights at miss stanburys house when he came back dorothy was still at nuncombe but she arrived in the close the day before his departure her mother and sister had wished her to stay at nuncombe there is a bed for you now and a place to be comfortable in priscilla had said laughing and you may as well see the last of us but dorothy declared that she had named a day to her aunt and that she would not break her engagement i suppose you can stay if you like priscilla had urged but dorothy was of opinion that she ought not to stay she said not a word about brooke burgess but it may be that it would have been matter of regret to her not to shake hands with him once more brooke declared to her that had she not come back he would have gone over to nuncombe to see her but dorothy did not consider herself entitled to believe that  on the morning of the last day brooke went over to his uncles office ive come to say goodbye uncle barty he said  goodbye my boy take care of yourself  i mean to try  you havent quarrelled with the old womanhave you said uncle barty  not yetthat is to say not to the knife  and you still believe that you are to have her money  i believe nothing one way or the other you may be sure of thisi shall never count it mine till ive got it and i shall never make myself so sure of it as to break my heart because i dont get it i suppose ive got as good a right to it as anybody else and i dont see why i shouldnt take it if it come in my way  i dont think it ever will said the old man after a pause  i shall be none the worse said brooke  yes you will youll be a brokenhearted man and she means to break your heart she does it on purpose she has no more idea of leaving you her money than i have why should she  simply because she takes the fancy  fancy believe me there is very little fancy about it there isnt one of the name she wouldnt ruin if she could shed break all our hearts if she could get at them look at me and my position im little more than a clerk in the concern by godim not so well off as a senior clerk in many a bank if there came a bad time i must lose as the others would losebut a clerk never loses and my share in the business is almost a nothing its just nothingcompared to what it would have been only for her  brooke had known that his uncle was a disappointed or at least a discontented man but he had never known much of the old mans circumstances and certainly had not expected to hear him speak in the strain that he had now used he had heard often that his uncle barty disliked miss stanbury and had not been surprised at former sharp biting little words spoken in reference to that ladys character but he had not expected such a tirade of abuse as the banker had now poured out of course i know nothing about the bank said he but i did not suppose that she had had anything to do with it  where do you think the money came from that she has got did you ever hear that she had anything of her own she never had a pennynever a penny it came out of this house it is the capital on which this business was founded and on which it ought to be carried on to this day my brother had thrown her off by heavens yeshad thrown her off he had found out what she was and had got rid of her  but he left her his money  yesshe got near him when he was dying and he did leave her his moneyhis money and my money and your fathers money  he could have given her nothing uncle barty that wasnt his own  of course thats trueits true in one way you might say the same of a man who was cozened into leaving every shilling away from his own children i wasnt in exeter when the will was made we none of us were here but she was here and when we came to see him die there we found her she had had her revenge upon him and she means to have it on all of us i dont believe shell ever leave you a shilling brooke youll find her out yet and youll talk of her to your nephews as i do to you  brooke made some ordinary answer to this and bade his uncle adieu he had allowed himself to entertain a half chivalrous idea that he could produce a reconciliation between miss stanbury and his uncle barty and since he had been at exeter he had said a word first to the one and then to the other hinting at the subject but his hints had certainly not been successful as he walked from the bank into the high street he could not fail to ask himself whether there were any grounds for the terrible accusations which he had just heard from his uncles lips something of the same kind though in form much less violent had been repeated to him very often by others of the family though he had as a boy known miss stanbury well he had been taught to regard her as an ogress all the burgesses had regarded miss stanbury as an ogress since that unfortunate will had come to light but she was an ogress from whom something might be gainedand the ogress had still persisted in saying that a burgess should be her heir it had therefore come to pass that brooke had been brought up half to revere her and half to abhor her she is a dreadful woman said his branch of the family who will not scruple at anything evil but as it seems that you may probably reap the advantage of the evil that she does it will become you to put up with her iniquity as he had become old enough to understand the nature of her position he had determined to judge for himselfbut his judgment hitherto simply amounted to thisthat miss stanbury was a very singular old woman with a kind heart and good instincts but so capricious withal that no sensible man would risk his happiness on expectations formed on her promises guided by this opinion he had resolved to be attentive to her and after a certain fashion submissive but certainly not to become her slave she had thrown over her nephew she was constantly complaining to him of her niece now and again she would say a very bitter word to him about himself when he had left exeter on his little excursion no one was so much in favour with her as mr gibson on his return he found that mr gibson had been altogether discarded and was spoken of in terms of almost insolent abuse if i were ever so humble to her he had said to himself it would do no good and there is nothing i hate so much as humility he had thus determined to take the goods the gods provided should it ever come to pass that such godlike provision was laid before him out of miss stanburys coffersbut not to alter his mode of life or put himself out of his way in obedience to her behests as a man might be expected to do who was destined to receive so rich a legacy upon this idea he had acted still believing the old woman to be good but believing at the same time that she was very capricious now he had heard what his uncle bartholomew burgess had had to say upon the matter and he could not refrain from asking himself whether his uncles accusations were true  in a narrow passage between the high street and the close he met mr gibson there had come to be that sort of intimacy between the two men which grows from closeness of position rather than from any social desire on either side and it was natural that burgess should say a word of farewell on the previous evening miss stanbury had relieved her mind by turning mr gibson into ridicule in her description to brooke of the manner in which the clergyman had carried on his love affair and she had at the same time declared that mr gibson had been most violently impertinent to herself he knew therefore that miss stanbury and mr gibson had become two and would on this occasion have passed on without a word relative to the old lady had mr gibson allowed him to do so but mr gibson spoke his mind freely  off tomorrow are you he said goodbye i hope we may meet again but not in the same house mr burgess  there or anywhere i shall be very happy said brooke  not there certainly while you were absent miss stanbury treated me in such a way that i shall certainly never put my foot in her house again  dear me i thought that you and she were such great friends  i knew her very well of courseand respected her she is a good churchwoman and is charitable in the city but she has got such a tongue in her head that there is no bearing it when she does what she calls giving you a bit of her mind  she has been indulgent to me and has not given me much of it  your time will come ive no doubt continued mr gibson everybody has always told me that it would be so even her oldest friends knew it you ask mrs machugh or mrs french at heavitree  mrs french said brooke laughing that would hardly be fair evidence  why not i dont know a better judge of character in all exeter than mrs french and she and miss stanbury have been intimate all their lives ask your uncle at the bank  my uncle and miss stanbury never were friends said brooke  ask hugh stanbury what he thinks of her but dont suppose i want to say a word against her i wouldnt for the world do such a thing only as weve met there and all that i thought it best to let you know that she had treated me in such a way and has been altogether so violent that i never will go there again so saying mr gibson passed on and was of opinion that he had spoken with great generosity of the old woman who had treated him so badly  in the afternoon brooke burgess went over to the further end of the close and called on mrs machugh and from thence he walked across to heavitree and called on the frenches it may be doubted whether he would have been so well behaved to these ladies had they not been appealed to by mr gibson as witnesses to the character of miss stanbury he got very little from mrs machugh that lady was kind and cordial and expressed many wishes that she might see him again in exeter when he said a few words about mr gibson mrs machugh only laughed and declared that the gentleman would soon find a plaister for that sore there are more fishes than one in the sea she said  but im afraid theyve quarrelled mrs machugh  so they tell me what should we have to talk about here if somebody didnt quarrel sometimes she and i ought to get up a quarrel for the good of the publiconly they know that i never can quarrel with anybody i never see anybody interesting enough to quarrel with but mrs machugh said nothing about miss stanbury except that she sent over a message with reference to a rubber of whist for the next night but one  he found the two french girls sitting with their mother and they all expressed their great gratitude to him for coming to say goodbye before he went its so very nice of you mr burgess said camilla and particularly just at present  yes indeed said arabella because you know things have been so unpleasant  my dears never mind about that said mrs french miss stanbury has meant everything for the best and it is all over now  i dont know what you mean by its being all over mamma said camilla as far as i can understand it has never been begun  my dear the least said the soonest mended said mrs french  thats of course mamma said camilla but yet one cant hold ones tongue altogether all the city is talking about it and i dare say mr burgess has heard as much as anybody else  ive heard nothing at all said brooke  oh yes you have continued camilla arabella conceived herself at this moment to be situated in so delicate a position that it was best that her sister should talk about it and that she herself should hold her tonguewith the exception perhaps of a hint here and there which might be of assistance for arabella completely understood that the prize was now to be hers if the prize could be rescued out of the stanbury clutches she was awareno one better awarehow her sister had interfered with her early hopes and was sure in her own mind that all her disappointment had come from fratricidal rivalry on the part of camilla it had never however been open to her to quarrel with camilla there they were linked together and together they must fight their battles as two pigs may be seen at the same trough each striving to take the delicacies of the banquet from the other and yet enjoying always the warmth of the same dunghill in amicable contiguity so had these young ladies lived in sisterly friendship while each was striving to take a husband from the other they had understood the position and though for years back they had talked about mr gibson they had never quarrelled but now in these latter days of the stanbury interference there had come tacitly to be something of an understanding between them that if any fighting were still possible on the subject one must be put forward and the other must yield there had been no spoken agreement but arabella quite understood that she was to be put forward it was for her to take up the running and to win if possible against the stanbury filly that was her view and she was inclined to give camilla credit for acting in accordance with it with honesty and zeal she felt therefore that her words on the present occasion ought to be few she sat back in her corner of the sofa and was intent on her work and shewed by the pensiveness of her brow that there were thoughts within her bosom of which she was not disposed to speak you must have heard a great deal said camilla laughing you must know how poor mr gibson has been abused because he wouldnt  camilla dont be foolish said mrs french  because he wouldnt what asked brooke what ought he to have done that he didnt do  i dont know anything about ought said camilla thats a matter of taste altogether  im the worst hand in the world at a riddle said brooke  how sly you are continued camilla laughing as if dear aunt stanbury hadnt confided all her hopes to you  camilla deardont said arabella  but when a gentleman is hunted and cant be caught i dont think he ought to be abused to his face  but who hunted him and who abused him asked brooke  mind i dont mean to say a word against miss stanbury mr burgess weve known her and loved her all our liveshavent we mamma  and respected her said arabella  quite so continued camilla but you know mr burgess that she likes her own way  i dont know anybody that does not said brooke  and when shes disappointed she shows it theres no doubt she is disappointed now mr burgess  whats the good of going on camilla said mrs french arabella sat silent in her corner with a conscious glow of satisfaction as she reflected that the joint disappointment of the elder and the younger miss stanbury had been caused by a tender remembrance of her own charms had not dear mr gibson told her in the glowing language of truth that there was nothing further from his thoughts than the idea of taking dorothy stanbury for his wife  well you know continued camilla i think that when a person makes an attempt and comes by the worst of it that person should put up with the defeat and not say all manner of illnatured things everybody knows that a certain gentleman is very intimate in this house  dont dear said arabella in a whisper  yes i shall said camilla i dont know why people should hold their tongues when other people talk so loudly i dont care a bit what anybody says about the gentleman and us we have known him for ever so many years and mamma is very fond of him  indeed i am camilla said mrs french  and for the matter of that so am ivery said camilla laughing bravely i dont care who knows it  dont be so silly child said arabella camilla was certainly doing her best and arabella was grateful  we dont care what people may say continued camilla again of course we heard as everybody else heard too that a certain gentleman was to be married to a certain lady it was nothing to us whether he was married or not  nothing at all said arabella  we never spoke ill of the young lady we did not interfere if the gentleman liked the young lady he was quite at liberty to marry her as far as we were concerned we had been in the habit of seeing him here almost as a brother and perhaps we might feel that a connection with that particular young lady would take him from us but we never hinted so much even as thatto him or to anyone else why should we it was nothing to us now it turns out that the gentleman never meant anything of the kind whereupon he is pretty nearly kicked out of the house and all manner of illnatured things are said about us everywhere by this time camilla had become quite excited and was speaking with much animation  how can you be so foolish camilla said arabella  perhaps i am foolish said camilla to care what anybody says  what can it all be to mr burgess said mrs french  only this that as we all like mr burgess and as he is almost one of the family in the close i think he ought to know why we are not quite so cordial as we used to be now that the matter is over i have no doubt things will get right again and as for the young lady im sure we feel for her we think it was the aunt who was indiscreet  and then she has such a tongue said arabella  our friend brooke of course knew the whole truthknew the nature of mr gibsons failure and knew also how dorothy had acted in the affair he was inclined moreover to believe that the ladies who were now talking to him were as well instructed on the subject as was he himself he had heard too of the ambition of the two young ladies now before him and believed that that ambition was not yet dead but he did not think it incumbent on him to fight a battle even on behalf of dorothy he might have declared that dorothy at least had not been disappointed but he thought it better to be silent about dorothy yes he said miss stanbury has a tongue but i think it speaks as much good as it does evil and perhaps that is a great deal to say for any ladys tongue  we never speak evil of anybody said camilla never it is a rule with us then brooke took his leave and the three ladies were cordial and almost affectionate in their farewell greetings  brooke was to start on the following morning before anybody would be up except martha and miss stanbury was very melancholy during the evening we shall miss him very much shall we not she said appealing to dorothy i am sure you will miss him very much said dorothy we are so stupid here alone said miss stanbury when they had drank their tea she sat nearly silent for half an hour and then summoned him up into her own room so you are going brooke she said  yes i must go now they would dismiss me if i stayed an hour longer  it was good of you to come to the old woman and you must let me hear of you from time to time  of course ill write  and brooke  what is it aunt stanbury  do you want any money brooke  nonone thank you ive plenty for a bachelor  when you think of marrying brooke mind you tell me  ill be sure to tell youbut i cant promise yet when that will be she said nothing more to him though she paused once more as though she were going to speak she kissed him and bade him goodbye saying that she would not go downstairs again that evening he was to tell dorothy to go to bed and so they parted  but dorothy did not go to bed for an hour after that when brooke came down into the parlour with his message she intended to go at once and put up her work and lit her candle and put out her hand to him and said goodbye to him but for all that she remained there for an hour with him at first she said very little but by degrees her tongue was loosened and she found herself talking with a freedom which she could hardly herself understand she told him how thoroughly she believed her aunt to be a good womanhow sure she was that her aunt was at any rate honest as for me said dorothy i know that i have displeased her about mr gibsonand i would go away only that i think she would be so desolate then brooke begged her never to allow the idea of leaving miss stanbury to enter her head because miss stanbury was capricious he said not on that account should her caprices either be indulged or permitted that was his doctrine respecting miss stanbury and he declared that as regarded himself he would never be either disrespectful to her or submissive it is a great mistake he said to think that anybody is either an angel or a devil when dorothy expressed an opinion that with some people angelic tendencies were predominant and with others diabolic tendencies he assented but declared that it was not always easy to tell the one tendency from the other at last when dorothy had made about five attempts to go mr gibsons name was mentioned i am very glad that you are not going to be mrs gibson said he      illustration brooke burgess takes his leave   i dont know why you should be glad  because i should not have liked your husbandnot as your husband  he is an excellent man im sure said dorothy  nevertheless i am very glad but i did not think you would accept him and i congratulate you on your escape you would have been nothing to me as mrs gibson  shouldnt i said dorothy not knowing what else to say  but now i think we shall always be friends  im sure i hope so mr burgess but indeed i must go now it is ever so late and you will hardly get any sleep good night then he took her hand and pressed it very warmly and referring to a promise before made to her he assured her that he would certainly make acquaintance with her brother as soon as he was back in london dorothy as she went up to bed was more than ever satisfied with herself in that she had not yielded in reference to mr gibson     chapter xlv  trevelyan at venice   trevelyan passed on moodily and alone from turin to venice always expecting letters from bozzle and receiving from time to time the dispatches which that functionary forwarded to him as must be acknowledged with great punctuality for mr bozzle did his work not only with a conscience but with a will he was now as he had declared more than once altogether devoted to mr trevelyans interest and as he was an active enterprising man always on the alert to be doing something and as he loved the work of writing dispatches trevelyan received a great many letters from bozzle it is not exaggeration to say that every letter made him for the time a very wretched man this expoliceman wrote of the wife of his bosomof her who had been the wife of his bosom and who was the mother of his child who was at this very time the only woman whom he lovedwith an entire absence of delicacy bozzle would have thought reticence on his part to be dishonest we remember othellos demand of iago that was the demand which bozzle understood that trevelyan had made of him and he was minded to obey that order but trevelyan though he had in truth given the order was like othello also in thisthat he would have preferred before all the prizes of the world to have had proof brought home to him exactly opposite to that which he demanded but there was nothing so terrible to him as the grinding suspicion that he was to be kept in the dark bozzle could find out facts therefore he gave in effect the same order that othello gaveand bozzle went to work determined to obey it there came many dispatches to venice and at last there came one which created a correspondence which shall be given here at length the first is a letter from mr bozzle to his employer      55 stony walk union street borough    september 29 186 430 pm     hond sir     since i wrote yesterday morning something has occurred    which it may be and i think it will will help to bring    this melancholy affair to a satisfactory termination and    conclusion i had better explain mr trewilyan how i    have been at work from the beginning about watching the    colonel i couldnt do nothing with the porter at the    albany which he is always mostly muzzled with beer and    he wouldnt have taken my money not on the square so    when it was tellegrammed to me as the colonel was on the    move in the north i put on two boys as knows the colonel    at eighteenpence a day at each end one piccadilly end    and the other saville row end and yesterday morning    as quick as ever could be after the limited express    edinburgh male up was in there comes the saville row end    boy here to say as the colonel was lodged safe in his    downey then i was off immediate myself to st diddulphs    because i knows what it is to trust to inferiors when    matters gets delicate now there hadnt been no letters    from the colonel nor none to him as i could make out    though that mightnt be so sure she might have had em    addressed to a z or the like of that at any of the    postoffices as was distant as nobody could give the    notice to em all barring the money which i know aint    an object when the end is so desirable it dont do to be    too ubiketous because things will go astray but ive    kept my eye uncommon open and i dont think there have    been no letters since that last which was sent mr    trewilyan let any of em parsons or what not say what    they will and i dont see as parsons are better than    other folk when they has to do with a lady as likes her    fancyman   trevelyan when he had read as far as this threw down the letter and tore his hair in despair my wife he exclaimed oh my wife but it was essential that he should read bozzles letter and he persevered      well i took to the ground myself as soon as ever i heard    that the colonel was among us and i hung out at the full    moon they had been quite on the square with me at the    full moon which i mention because of course it has    to be remembered and it do come up as a hitem and im    proud mr trewilyan as i did take to the ground myself    for what should happen but i see the colonel as large as    life ringing at the parsons bell at 147 pm he was let    in at 149 and he was let out at 217 he went away in a    cab which it was kept and i followed him till he was put    down at the arcade and i left him having his ed washed    and greased at trufitts rooms halfway up it was a    wonder to me when i see this mr trewilyan as he didnt    have his ed done first as they most of em does when    theyre going to see their ladies but i couldnt make    nothing of that though i did try to put too and too    together as i always does     what he did at the parsons mr trewilyan i wont    say i saw and i wont say i know its my opinion the    young woman there isnt on the square though shes    been remembered too and is a hitem of course and mr    trewilyan it do go against the grain with me when theyre    remembered and aint on the square i doesnt expect too    much of human nature which is poor as the saying goes    but when theyre remembered and aint on the square after    that its too bad for human nature its more than poor    its what i calls beggarly     he aint been there since mr trewilyan and he goes out    of town tomorrow by the 115 pm express to bridport so    he lets on but of course i shall see to that that hes    been at st diddulphs in the house from 147 to 217    you may take as a fact there wont be no shaking of that    because i have it in my mem book and no counsel can get    the better of it of course he went there to see her and    its my belief he did the young woman as was remembered    says he didnt but she isnt on the square they never is    when a lady wants to see her gentleman though they comes    round afterwards and tells up everything when it comes    before his ordinary lordship     if you ask me mr trewilyan i dont think its ripe yet    for the court but well have it ripe before long ill    keep a lookout because its just possible she may leave    town if she do ill be down upon them together and no    mistake     yours most respectful     s bozzle   every word in the letter had been a dagger to trevelyan and yet he felt himself to be under an obligation to the man who had written it no one else would or could make facts known to him if she were innocent let him know that she were innocent and he would proclaim her innocence and believe in her innocenceand sacrifice himself to her innocence if such sacrifice were necessary but if she were guilty let him also know that he knew how bad it was all that bribing of postmen and maidservants who took his money and her money also very likely it was dirt all of it but who had put him into the dirt his wife had at least deceived himhad deceived him and disobeyed him and it was necessary that he should know the facts life without a bozzle would now have been to him a perfect blank  the colonel had been to the parsonage at st diddulphs and had been admitted as to that he had no doubt nor did he really doubt that his wife had seen the visitor he had sent his wife first into a remote village on dartmoor and there she had been visited by herlover how was he to use any other word iagooh iago the pity of it iago then when she had learned that this was discovered she had left the retreat in which he had placed herwithout permission from himand had taken herself to the house of a relative of hers here she was visited again by herlover oh iago the pity of it iago and then there had been between them an almost constant correspondence so much he had ascertained as fact but he did not for a moment believe that bozzle had learned all the facts there might be correspondence or even visits of which bozzle could learn nothing how could bozzle know where mrs trevelyan was during all those hours which colonel osborne passed in london that which he knew he knew absolutely and on that he could act but there was of course much of which he knew nothing gradually the truth would unveil itself and then he would act he would tear that colonel into fragments and throw his wife from him with all the ignominy which the law made possible to him  but in the meantime he wrote a letter to mr outhouse colonel osborne after all that had been said had been admitted at the parsonage and trevelyan was determined to let the clergyman know what he thought about it the oftener he turned the matter in his mind as he walked slowly up and down the piazza of st mark the more absurd it appeared to him to doubt that his wife had seen the man of course she had seen him he walked there nearly the whole night thinking of it and as he dragged himself off at last to his inn had almost come to have but one desirenamely that he should find her out that the evidence should be conclusive that it should be proved and so brought to an end then he would destroy her and destroy that manand afterwards destroy himself so bitter to him would be his ignominy he almost revelled in the idea of the tragedy he would make it was three oclock before he was in his bedroom and then he wrote his letter to mr outhouse before he took himself to his bed it was as follows      venice oct 4 186     sir     information of a certain kind on which i can place a    firm reliance has reached me to the effect that colonel    osborne has been allowed to visit at your house during    the sojourn of my wife under your roof i will thank you    to inform me whether this be true as although i am    confident of my facts it is necessary in reference to my    ulterior conduct that i should have from you either an    admission or a denial of my assertion it is of course    open to you to leave my letter unanswered should you    think proper to do so i shall know also how to deal with    that fact     as to your conduct in admitting colonel osborne into your    house while my wife is thereafter all that has passed    and all that you know that has passedi am quite unable    to speak with anything like moderation of feeling had the    man succeeded in forcing himself into your residence you    should have been the first to give me notice of it as it    is i have been driven to ascertain the fact from other    sources i think that you have betrayed the trust that a    husband has placed in you and that you will find from the    public voice that you will be regarded as having disgraced    yourself as a clergyman     in reference to my wife herself i would wish her to know    that after what has now taken place i shall not feel    myself justified in leaving our child longer in her hands    even tender as are his years i shall take steps for    having him removed what further i shall do to vindicate    myself and extricate myself as far as may be possible    from the slough of despond in which i have been submerged    she and you will learn in due time     your obedient servant     l trevelyan     a letter addressed poste restante venice will reach me    here   if trevelyan was mad when he wrote this letter mr outhouse was very nearly as mad when he read it he had most strongly desired to have nothing to do with his wifes niece when she was separated from her husband he was a man honest charitable and sufficiently affectionate but he was timid and disposed to think ill of those whose modes of life were strange to him actuated by these feelings he would have declined to offer the hospitality of his roof to mrs trevelyan had any choice been left to him but there had been no choice she had come thither unasked with her boy and baggage and he could not send her away his wife had told him that it was his duty to protect these women till their father came and he recognised the truth of what his wife said there they were and there they must remain throughout the winter it was hard upon himespecially as the difficulties and embarrassments as to money were so disagreeable to himbut there was no help for it his duty must be done though it were ever so painful then that horrid colonel had come and now had come this letter in which he was not only accused of being an accomplice between his married niece and her lover but was also assured that he should be held up to public ignominy and disgrace though he had often declared that trevelyan was mad he would not remember that now such a letter as he had received should have been treated by him as the production of a madman but he was not sane enough himself to see the matter in that light he gnashed his teeth and clenched his fist and was almost beside himself as he read the letter a second time  there had been a method in trevelyans madness for though he had declared to himself that without doubt bozzle had been right in saying that as the colonel had been at the parsonage therefore as a certainty mrs trevelyan had met the colonel there yet he had not so stated in his letter he had merely asserted that colonel osborne had been at the house and had founded his accusation upon that alleged fact the alleged fact had been in truth a fact so far bozzle had been right the colonel had been at the parsonage and the reader knows how far mr outhouse had been to blame for his share in the matter he rushed off to his wife with the letter declaring at first that mrs trevelyan nora and the child and the servant should be sent out of the house at once but at last mrs outhouse succeeded in showing him that he would not be justified in illusing them because trevelyan had illused him but i will write to him said mr outhouse he shall know what i think about it and he did write his letter that day in spite of his wifes entreaties that he would allow the sun to set upon his wrath and his letter was as follows      st diddulphs october 8 186     sir     i have received your letter of the 4th which is more    iniquitous unjust and ungrateful than anything i ever    before saw written i have been surprised from the first    at your gross cruelty to your unoffending wife but even    that seems to me more intelligible than your conduct in    writing such words as those which you have dared to send    to me     for your wifes sake knowing that she is in a great    degree still in your power i will condescend to tell    you what has happened when mrs trevelyan found herself    constrained to leave nuncombe putney by your aspersions    on her character she came here to the protection of her    nearest relatives within reach till her father and mother    should be in england sorely against my will i received    them into my home because they had been deprived of other    shelter by the cruelty or madness of him who should have    been their guardian here they are and here they shall    remain till sir marmaduke rowley arrives the other day    on the 29th of september colonel osborne who is their    fathers old friend called not on them but on me i may    truly say that i did not wish to see colonel osborne they    did not see him nor did he ask to see them if his coming    was a faultand i think it was a faultthey were    not implicated in it he came remained a few minutes    and went without seeing any one but myself that is the    history of colonel osbornes visit to my house     i have not thought fit to show your letter to your wife    or to make her acquainted with this further proof of your    want of reason as to the threats which you hold out    of removing her child from her you can of course do    nothing except by law i do not think that even you will    be sufficiently audacious to take any steps of that    description whatever protection the law may give her    and her child from your tyranny and misconduct cannot be    obtained till her father shall be here     i have only further to request that you will not address    any further communication to me should you do so it will    be refused     yours in deep indignation     oliphant outhouse   trevelyan had also written two other letters to england one to mr bideawhile and the other to bozzle in the former he acquainted the lawyer that he had discovered that his wife still maintained her intercourse with colonel osborne and that he must therefore remove his child from her custody he then inquired what steps would be necessary to enable him to obtain possession of his little boy in the letter to bozzle he sent a cheque and his thanks for the expolicemans watchful care he desired bozzle to continue his precautions and explained his intentions about his son being somewhat afraid that mr bideawhile might not be zealous on his behalf and not himself understanding accurately the extent of his power with regard to his own child or the means whereby he might exercise it he was anxious to obtain assistance from bozzle also on this point he had no doubt that bozzle knew all about it he had great confidence in bozzle but still he did not like to consult the expoliceman he knew that it became him to have some regard for his own dignity he therefore put the matter very astutely to bozzle asking no questions but alluding to his difficulty in a way that would enable bozzle to offer advice  and where was he to get a woman to take charge of his child if lady milborough would do it how great would be the comfort but he was almost sure that lady milborough would not do it all his friends had turned against him and lady milborough among the number there was nobody left to him but bozzle could he entrust bozzle to find some woman for him who would take adequate charge of the little fellow till he himself could see to the childs education he did not put this question to bozzle in plain terms but he was very astute and wrote in such a fashion that bozzle could make a proposal if any proposal were within his power  the answer from mr outhouse came first to this mr trevelyan paid very little attention it was just what he expected of course mr outhouses assurance about colonel osborne went for nothing a man who would permit intercourse in his house between a married lady and her lover would not scruple to deny that he had permitted it then came mr bideawhiles answer which was very short mr bideawhile said that nothing could be done about the child till mr trevelyan should return to englandand that he could give no opinion as to what should be done then till he knew more of the circumstances it was quite clear to trevelyan that he must employ some other lawyer mr bideawhile had probably been corrupted by colonel osborne could bozzle recommend a lawyer  from bozzle himself there came no other immediate reply than his duty and that he would make further inquiries     chapter xlvi  the american minister   in the second week in october mr glascock returned to florence intending to remain there till the weather should have become bearable at naples his father was said to be better but was in such a condition as hardly to receive much comfort from his sons presence his mind was gone and he knew no one but his nurse and though mr glascock was unwilling to put himself altogether out of the reach of returning at a days notice he did not find himself obliged to remain in naples during the heat of the autumn so mr glascock returned to the hotel at florence accompanied by the tall man who wore the buttons the hotelkeeper did not allow such a light to remain long hidden under a bushel and it was soon spread far and wide that the honourable charles glascock and his suite were again in the beautiful city  and the fact was soon known to the american minister and his family mr spalding was a man who at home had been very hostile to english interests many american gentlemen are known for such hostility they make antienglish speeches about the country as though they thought that war with england would produce certain triumph to the states certain increase to american trade and certain downfall to a tyranny which no anglosaxon nation ought to endure but such is hardly their real opinion there in the states as also here in england you shall from day to day hear men propounding in very loud language advanced theories of political action the assertion of which is supposed to be necessary to the end which they have in view men whom we know to have been as mild as sucking doves in the political aspiration of their whole lives suddenly jump up and with infuriated gestures declare themselves the enemies of everything existing when they have attained their little purposeor have failed to do sothey revert naturally into their suckingdove elements it is so with americans as frequently as with ourselvesand there is no political subject on which it is considered more expedient to express pseudoenthusiasm than on that of the sins of england it is understood that we do not resent it it is presumed that we regard it as the irishman regarded his wifes cuffs in the states a large party which consists chiefly of those who have lately left english rule and who are keen to prove to themselves how wise they have been in doing so is pleased by this strong language against england and therefore the strong language is spoken but the speakers who are probably men knowing something of the world mean it not at all they have no more idea of war with england than they have of war with all europe and their respect for england and for english opinion is unbounded in their political tones of speech and modes of action they strive to be as english as possible mr spaldings aspirations were of this nature he had uttered speeches against england which would make the hair stand on end on the head of an uninitiated english reader he had told his countrymen that englishmen hugged their chains and would do so until american hammers had knocked those chains from off their wounded wrists and bleeding ankles he had declared that if certain american claims were not satisfied there was nothing left for americans to do but to cross the ferry with such a sheriffs officer as would be able to make distraint on the great english household he had declared that the sheriffs officer would have very little trouble he had spoken of canada as an outlying american territory not yet quite sufficiently redeemed from savage life to be received into the union as a state there is a multiplicity of subjects of this kind ready to the hand of the american orator mr spalding had been quite successful and was now minister at florence but perhaps one of the greatest pleasures coming to him from his prosperity was the enjoyment of the society of wellbred englishmen in the capital to which he had been sent when therefore his wife and nieces pointed out to him the fact that it was manifestly his duty to call upon mr glascock after what had passed between them on that night under the campanile he did not rebel for an instant against the order given to him his mind never reverted for a moment to that opinion which had gained for him such a round of applause when expressed on the platform of the temperance hall at nubbly creek state of illinois to the effect that the english aristocrat thoroughborn and thoroughbred who inherited acres and titles from his father could never be fitting company for a thoughtful christian american citizen he at once had his hat brushed and took up his best gloves and umbrella and went off to mr glascocks hotel he was strictly enjoined by the ladies to fix a day on which mr glascock would come and dine at the american embassy  c g has come back to see you said olivia to her elder sister they had always called him c g since the initials had been seen on the travelling bag  probably said carry there is so very little else to bring people to florence that there can hardly be any other reason for his coming they do say its terribly hot at naples just now but that can have had nothing to do with it  we shall see said livy im sure hes in love with you he looked to me just like a proper sort of lover for you when i saw his long legs creeping up over our heads into the banquette  you ought to have been very much obliged to his long legsso sick as you were at the time  i like him amazingly said livy legs and all i only hope uncle jonas wont bore him so as to prevent his coming  his father is very ill said carry and i dont suppose we shall see him at all  but the american minister was successful he found mr glascock sitting in his dressinggown smoking a cigar and reading a newspaper the english aristocrat seemed very glad to see his visitor and assumed no airs at all the american altogether forgot his speech at nubbly creek and found the aristocrats society to be very pleasant he lit a cigar and they talked about naples rome and florence mr spalding when the marbles of old rome were mentioned was a little too keen in insisting on the merits of story miss hosmer and hiram powers and hardly carried his listener with him in the parallel which he drew between greenough and phidias and he was somewhat repressed by the apathetic curtness of mr glascocks reply when he suggested that the victory gained by the gunboats at vicksburg on the mississippi was vividly brought to his mind by an account which he had just been reading of the battle of actium but he succeeded in inducing mr glascock to accept an invitation to dinner for the next day but one and the two gentlemen parted on the most amicable terms  everybody meets everybody in florence every day carry and livy spalding had met mr glascock twice before the dinner at their uncles house so that they met at dinner quite as intimate friends mrs spalding had very large rooms up three flights of stairs on the lungarno the height of her abode was attributed by mrs spalding to her dread of mosquitoes she had not yet learned that people in florence require no excuse for being asked to walk up three flights of stairs the rooms when they were reached were very lofty floored with what seemed to be marble and were of a nature almost to warrant mrs spalding in feeling that nature had made her more akin to an italian countess than to a matron of nubbly creek state of illinois where mr spalding had found her and made her his own there was one other englishman present mr harris hyde granville gore from the foreign office now serving temporarily at the english legation in florence and an american mr jackson unthank a man of wealth and taste who was resolved on having such a collection of pictures at his house in baltimore that no english private collection should in any way come near to it and a tuscan from the italian foreign office to whom nobody could speak except mr harris hyde granville gorewho did not indeed seem to enjoy the efforts of conversation which were expected of him the italian who had a handle to his namehe was a count buonaroscitook mrs spalding in to dinner mrs spalding had been at great trouble to ascertain whether this was proper or whether she should not entrust herself to mr glascock there were different points to be considered in the matter she did not quite know whether she was in italy or in america she had glimmerings on the subject of her privilege to carry her own nationality into her own drawingroom and then she was called upon to deal between an italian count with an elder brother and an english honourable who had no such incumbrance which of the two was possessed of the higher rank ive found it all out aunt mary said livy you must take the count for livy wanted to give her sister every chance how have you found it out said the aunt you may be sure it is so said livy and the lady in her doubt yielded the point mrs spalding as she walked along the passage on the counts arm determined that she would learn italian she would have given all nubbly creek to have been able to speak a word to count buonarosci to do her justice it must be admitted that she had studied a few words but her courage failed her and she could not speak them she was very careful however that mr h h g gore was placed in the chair next to the count  we are very glad to see you here said mr spalding addressing himself especially to mr glascock as he stood up at his own seat at the round table in leaving my own country sir there is nothing that i value more than the privilege of becoming acquainted with those whose historic names and existing positions are of such inestimable value to the world at large in saying this mr spalding was not in the least insincere nor did his conscience at all prick him in reference to that speech at nubbly creek on both occasions he half thought as he spokeor thought that he thought so unless it be on subjects especially endeared to us the thoughts of but few of us go much beyond this  mr glascock who sat between mrs spalding and her niece was soon asked by the elder lady whether he had been in the states no he had not been in the states then you must come mr glascock said mrs spalding though i will not say dwelling as we now are in the metropolis of the world of art that we in our own homes have as much of the outer beauty of form to charm the stranger as is to be found in other lands yet i think that the busy lives of men and the varied institutions of a free country must always have an interest peculiarly their own mr glascock declared that he quite agreed with her and expressed a hope that he might some day find himself in new york  you wouldnt like it at all said carry because you are an aristocrat i dont mean that it would be your fault  why should that prevent my liking iteven if i were an aristocrat  one half of the people would run after you and the other half would run away from you said carry  then id take to the people who ran after me and would not regard the others  thats all very wellbut you wouldnt like it and then you would become unfair to what you saw when some of our speechifying people talked to you about our institutions through their noses you would think that the institutions themselves must be bad and we have nothing to show except our institutions  what are american institutions asked mr glascock  everything is an institution having iced water to drink in every room of the house is an institution having hospitals in every town is an institution travelling altogether in one class of railway cars is an institution saying sir is an institution teaching all the children mathematics is an institution plenty of food is an institution getting drunk is an institution in a great many towns lecturing is an institution there are plenty of them and some are very goodbut you wouldnt like it  at any rate ill go and see said mr glascock  if you do i hope we may be at home said miss spalding  mr spalding in the mean time with the assistance of his countryman the man of taste was endeavouring to explain a certain point in american politics to the count as in doing this they called upon mr gore to translate every speech they made into italian and as mr gore had never offered his services as an interpreter and as the italian did not quite catch the subtle meanings of the americans in mr gores tuscan version and did not in the least wish to understand the things that were explained to him mr gore and the italian began to think that the two americans were bores the truth is mr spalding said mr gore ive got such a cold in my head that i dont think i can explain it any more then livy spalding laughed aloud and the two american gentlemen began to eat their dinner it sounds ridiculous dont it said mr gore in a whisper  i ought not to have laughed i know said livy  the very best thing you could have done i shant be troubled any more now the fact is i know just nine words of italian now there is a difficulty in having to explain the whole theory of american politics to an italian who doesnt want to know anything about it with so very small a repertory of words at ones command  how well you did it  too well i felt that so well that unless i had stopped it i shouldnt have been able to say a word to you all through dinner your laughter clenched it and buonarosci and i will be grateful to you for ever  after the ladies went there was rather a bad half hour for mr glascock he was buttonholed by the minister and found it oppressive before he was enabled to escape into the drawingroom mr glascock said the minister an english gentleman sir like you who has the privilege of an hereditary seat in your parliamentmr glascock was not quite sure whether he were being accused of having an hereditary seat in the house of commons but he would not stop to correct any possible error on that pointand who has been born to all the gifts of fortune rank and social eminence should never think that his education is complete till he has visited our great cities in the west mr glascock hinted that he by no means conceived his education to be complete but the minister went on without attending to this till you have seen sir what men can do who are placed upon the earth with all gods gifts of free intelligence free air and a free soil but without any of those other good things which we are accustomed to call the gifts of fortune you can never become aware of the infinite ingenuity of man there had been much said before but just at this moment mr gore and the american left the room and the italian followed them briskly mr glascock at once made a decided attempt to bolt but the minister was on the alert and was too quick for him and he was by no means ashamed of what he was doing he had got his guest by the coat and openly declared his intention of holding him let me keep you for a few minutes sir said he while i dilate on this point in one direction in the drawingroom female spells are too potent for us male orators in going among us mr glascock you must not look for luxury or refinement for you will find them not nor must you hope to encounter the highest order of erudition the lofty summits of acquired knowledge tower in your country with an altitude we have not reached yet  its very good of you to say so said mr glascock  no sir in our new country and in our new cities we still lack the luxurious perfection of fastidious civilisation but sir regard our level that is what i say to every unprejudiced britisher that comes among us look at our level and when you have looked at our level i think that you will confess that we live on the highest tableland that the world has yet afforded to mankind you follow my meaning mr glascock mr glascock was not sure that he did but the minister went on to make that meaning clear it is the multitude that with us is educated go into their houses sir and see how they thumb their books look at the domestic correspondence of our helps and servants and see how they write and spell we havent got the mountains sir but our tablelands are the highest on which the bright sun of our almighty god has as yet shone with its illuminating splendour in this improving world of ours it is because we are a young people sirwith nothing as yet near to us of the decrepitude of age the weakness of age sir is the penalty paid by the folly of youth we are not so wise sir but what we too shall suffer from its effects as years roll over our heads there was a great deal more but at last mr glascock did escape into the drawingroom  my uncle has been saying a few words to you perhaps said carry spalding  yes he has said mr glascock  he usually does said carry spalding     chapter xlvii  about fishing and navigation and headdresses      illustration  the feud between miss stanbury and mr gibson raged violently in exeter and produced many complications which were very difficult indeed of management each belligerent party felt that a special injury had been inflicted upon it mr gibson was quite sure that he had been grossly misused by miss stanbury the elder and strongly suspected that miss stanbury the younger had had a hand in this misconduct it had been positively asserted to himat least so he thought but in this was probably in errorthat the lady would accept him if he proposed to her all exeter had been made aware of the intended compact he indeed had denied its existence to miss french comforting himself as best he might with the reflection that all is fair in love and war but when he counted over his injuries he did not think of this denial all exeter so to say had known of it and yet when he had come with his proposal he had been refused without a moments consideration first by the aunt and then by the nieceand after that had been violently abused and at last turned out of the house surely no gentleman had ever before been subjected to illusage so violent but miss stanbury the elder was quite as assured that the injury had been done to her as to the matter of the compact itself she knew very well that she had been as true as steel she had done everything in her power to bring about the marriage she had been generous in her offers of money she had used all her powers of persuasion on dorothy and she had given every opportunity to mr gibson it was not her fault if he had not been able to avail himself of the good things which she had put in his way he had first been as she thought ignorant and arrogant fancying that the good things ought to be made his own without any trouble on his partand then awkward not knowing how to take the trouble when trouble was necessary and as to that matter of abusive language and turning out of the house miss stanbury was quite convinced that she was sinned against and not herself the sinner she declared to martha more than once that mr gibson had used such language to her that coming out of a clergymans mouth it had quite dismayed her martha who knew her mistress probably felt that mr gibson had at least received as good as he gave but she had made no attempt to set her mistress right on that point  but the cause of miss stanburys sharpest anger was not to be found in mr gibsons conduct either before dorothys refusal of his offer or on the occasion of his being turned out of the house a base rumour was spread about the city that dorothy stanbury had been offered to mr gibson that mr gibson had civilly declined the offerand that hence had arisen the wrath of the juno of the close now this was not to be endured by miss stanbury she had felt even in the moment of her original anger against mr gibson that she was bound in honour not to tell the story against him she had brought him into the little difficulty and she at least would hold her tongue she was quite sure that dorothy would never boast of her triumph and martha had been strictly cautionedas indeed also had brooke burgess the man had behaved like an idiot miss stanbury said but he had been brought into a little dilemma and nothing should be said about it from the house in the close but when the other rumour reached miss stanburys ears when mrs crumbie condoled with her on her nieces misfortune when mrs machugh asked whether mr gibson had not behaved rather badly to the young lady then our junos celestial mind was filled with a divine anger but even then she did not declare the truth she asked a question of mrs crumbie and was enabled as she thought to trace the falsehood to the frenches she did not think that mr gibson could on a sudden have become so base a liar mr gibson fast and loose with my niece she said to mrs machugh you have not got the story quite right my dear friend pray believe methere has been nothing of that sort i dare say not said mrs machugh and im sure i dont care mr gibson has been going to marry one of the french girls for the last ten years and i think he ought to make up his mind and do it at last  i can assure you he is quite welcome as far as dorothy is concerned said miss stanbury  without a doubt the opinion did prevail throughout exeter that mr gibson who had been regarded time out of mind as the property of the miss frenches had been angled for by the ladies in the close that he had nearly been caught but that he had slipped the hook out of his mouth and was now about to subside quietly into the net which had been originally prepared for him arabella french had not spoken loudly on the subject but camilla had declared in more than one house that she had most direct authority for stating that the gentleman had never dreamed of offering to the young lady why he should not do so if he pleases i dont know said camilla only the fact is that he has not pleased the rumour of course has reached him and as we happen to be very old friends we have authority for denying it altogether all this came round to miss stanbury and she was divine in her wrath  if they drive me to it she said to dorothy ill have the whole truth told by the bellman through the city or ill publish it in the county gazette  pray dont say a word about it aunt stanbury  it is those odious girls hes there now every day  why shouldnt he go there aunt stanbury  if hes fool enough let him go i dont care where he goes but i do care about these lies they wouldnt dare to say it only they think my mouth is closed theyve no honour themselves but they screen themselves behind mine  im sure they wont find themselves mistaken in what they trust to said dorothy with a spirit that her aunt had not expected from her miss stanbury at this time had told nobody that the offer to her niece had been made and repeated and finally rejectedbut she found it very difficult to hold her tongue  in the meantime mr gibson spent a good deal of his time at heavitree it should not perhaps be asserted broadly that he had made up his mind that marriage would be good for him but he had made up his mind at least to this that it was no longer to be postponed without a balance of disadvantage the charybdis in the close drove him helpless into the whirlpool of the heavitree scylla he had no longer an escape from the perils of the latter shore he had been so mauled by the opposite waves that he had neither spirit nor skill left to him to keep in the middle track he was almost daily at heavitree and did not attempt to conceal from himself the approach of his doom  but still there were two of them he knew that he must become a prey but was there any choice left to him as to which siren should have him he had been quite aware in his more gallant days before he had been knocked about on that charybdis rock that he might sip and taste and choose between the sweets he had come to think lately that the younger young lady was the sweeter eight years ago indeed the passages between him and the elder had been tender but camilla had then been simply a romping girl hardly more than a year or two beyond her teens now with her matured charms camilla was certainly the more engaging as far as outward form went arabellas cheeks were thin and long and her front teeth had come to show themselves her eyes were no doubt still bright and what she had of hair was soft and dark but it was very thin in front and what there was of supplemental mass behindthe bandbox by which miss stanbury was so much aggrievedwas worn with an indifference to the lines of beauty which mr gibson himself found to be very depressing a man with a fair burden on his back is not a grievous sight but when we see a small human being attached to a bale of goods which he can hardly manage to move we feel that the poor fellow has been cruelly overweighted mr gibson certainly had that sensation about arabellas chignon and as he regarded it in a nearer and a dearer lightas a chignon that might possibly become his own as a burden which in one sense he might himself be called upon to bear as a domestic utensil which he himself might be called upon to inspect and perhaps to aid the shifting on and the shifting off he did begin to think that that side of the scylla gulf ought to be avoided if possible and probably this propensity on his part this feeling that he would like to reconsider the matter dispassionately before he gave himself up for good to his old love may have been increased by camillas apparent withdrawal of her claims he felt mildly grateful to the heavitree household in general for accepting him in this time of his affliction but he could not admit to himself that they had a right to decide upon him in private conclave and allot him either to the one or to the other nuptials without consultation with himself to be swallowed up by scylla he now recognised as his doom but he thought he ought to be asked on which side of the gulf he would prefer to go down the way in which camilla spoke of him as a thing that wasnt hers but anothers and the way in which arabella looked at him as though he were hers and could never be anothers wounded his manly pride he had always understood that he might have his choice and he could not understand that the little mishap which had befallen him in the close was to rob him of that privilege  he used to drink tea at heavitree in those days on one evening on going in he found himself alone with arabella oh mr gibson she said we werent sure whether youd come and mamma and camilla have gone out to mrs camadges mr gibson muttered some word to the effect that he hoped he had kept nobody at home and as he did so he remembered that he had distinctly said that he would come on this evening i dont know that i should have gone said arabella because i am not quitenot quite myself at present no not ill not at all dont you know what it is mr gibson to beto beto benot quite yourself mr gibson said that he had very often felt like that and one cant get over itcan one continued arabella there comes a presentiment that something is going to happen and a kind of belief that something has happened though you dont know what and the heart refuses to be light and the spirit becomes abashed and the mind though it creates new thoughts will not settle itself to its accustomed work i suppose its what the novels have called melancholy  i suppose it is said mr gibson but theres generally some cause for it debt for instance  its nothing of that kind with me its no debt at least that can be written down in the figures of ordinary arithmetic sit down mr gibson and we will have some tea then as she stretched forward to ring the bell he thought that he never in his life had seen anything so unshapely as that huge wen at the back of her head monstrum horrendum informe ingens he could not help quoting the words to himself she was dressed with some attempt at being smart but her ribbons were soiled and her lace was tawdry and the fabric of her dress was old and dowdy he was quite sure that he would feel no pride in calling her mrs gibson no pleasure in having her all to himself at his own hearth i hope we shall escape the bitterness of miss stanburys tongue if we drink tea têteàtête she said with her sweetest smile  i dont suppose shell know anything about it  she knows about everything mr gibson its astonishing what she knows she has eyes and ears everywhere i shouldnt care if she didnt see and hear so very incorrectly im told now that she declares but it doesnt signify  declares what asked mr gibson  never mind but wasnt it odd how all exeter believed that you were going to be married in that house and to live there all the rest of your life and be one of miss stanburys slaves i never believed it mr gibson this she said with a sad smile that ought to have brought him on his knees in spite of the chignon  one cant help these things said mr gibson  i never could have believed itnot even if you had not given me an assurance so solemn and so sweet that there was nothing in it the poor man had given the assurance and could not deny the solemnity and the sweetness that was a happy moment for us mr gibson because though we never believed it when it was dinned into our ears so frequently when it was made such a triumph in the close it was impossible not to fear that there might be something in it he felt that he ought to make some reply but he did not know what to say he was thoroughly ashamed of the lie he had told but he could not untell it camilla reproached me afterwards for asking you whispered arabella in her softest tenderest voice she said that it was unmaidenly i hope you did not think it unmaidenly mr gibson  oh dear nonot at all said he  arabella french was painfully alive to the fact that she must do something she had her fish on the hook but of what use is a fish on your hook if you cannot land him when could she have a better opportunity than this of landing the scaly darling out of the fresh and free waters of his bachelor stream and sousing him into the pool of domestic life to be ready there for her own household purposes i had known you so long mr gibson she said and had valued your friendship soso deeply as he looked at her he could see nothing but the shapeless excrescence to which his eyes had been so painfully called by miss stanburys satire it is true that he had formerly been very tender with her but she had not then carried about with her that distorted monster he did not believe himself to be at all bound by anything which had passed between them in circumstances so very different but yet he ought to say something he ought to have said something but he said nothing she was patient however very patient and she went on playing him with her hook i am so glad that i did not go out tonight with mamma it has been such a pleasure to me to have this conversation with you camilla perhaps would say that i amunmaidenly  i dont think so  that is all that i care for mr gibson if you acquit me i do not mind who accuses i should not like to suppose that you thought me unmaidenly anything would be better than that but i can throw all such considerations to the wind when truetruefriendship is concerned dont you think that one ought mr gibson  if it had not been for the thing at the back of her head he would have done it now nothing but that gave him courage to abstain it grew bigger and bigger more shapeless monstrous absurd and abominable as he looked at it nothing should force upon him the necessity of assisting to carry such an abortion through the world one ought to sacrifice everything to friendship said mr gibson except selfrespect  he meant nothing personal something special in the way of an opinion was expected of him and therefore he had striven to say something special but she was in tears in a moment oh mr gibson she exclaimed oh mr gibson  what is the matter miss french  have i lost your respect is it that that you mean  certainly not miss french  do not call me miss french or i shall be sure that you condemn me miss french sounds so very cold you used to call mebella that was quite true but it was long ago thought mr gibsonbefore the monster had been attached will you not call me bella now  he thought that he had rather not and yet how was he to avoid it on a sudden he became very crafty had it not been for the sharpness of his mother wit he would certainly have been landed at that moment as you truly observed just now he said the tongues of people are so malignant there are little birds that hear everything  i dont care what the little birds hear said miss french through her tears i am a very unhappy girli know that and i dont care what anybody says it is nothing to me what anybody says i know what i feel at this moment there was some dash of truth about her the fish was so very heavy on hand that do what she would she could not land him her hopes before this had been very lowhopes that had once been high but they had been depressed gradually and in the slow dull routine of her daily life she had learned to bear disappointment by degrees without sign of outward suffering without consciousness of acute pain the task of her life had been weary and the wishedfor goal was ever becoming more and more distant but there had been still a chance and she had fallen away into a lethargy of lessening expectation from which joy indeed had been banished but in which there had been nothing of agony then had come upon the whole house at heavitree the great stanbury peril and arising out of that had sprung new hopes to arabella which made her again capable of all the miseries of a foiled ambition she could again be patient if patience might be of any service but in such a condition an eternity of patience is simply suicidal she was willing to work hard but how could she work harder than she had worked poor young womanperishing beneath an incubus which a false idea of fashion had imposed on her  i hope i have said nothing that makes you unhappy pleaded mr gibson im sure i havent meant it  but you have she said you make me very unhappy you condemn me i see you do and if i have done wrong it has been all because oh dear oh dear oh dear  but who says you have done wrong  you wont call me bellabecause you say the little birds will hear it if i dont care for the little birds why should you  there is no question more difficult than this for a gentleman to answer circumstances do not often admit of its being asked by a lady with that courageous simplicity which had come upon miss french in this moment of her agonising struggle but nevertheless it is one which in a more complicated form is often put and to which some reply more or less complicated is expected if i a woman can dare for your sake to encounter the public tongue will you a man be afraid the true answer if it could be given would probably be this i am afraid though a man because i have much to lose and little to get you are not afraid though a woman because you have much to get and little to lose but such an answer would be uncivil and is not often given therefore men shuffle and lie and tell themselves that in lovelove here being taken to mean all antenuptial contests between man and womaneverything is fair mr gibson had the above answer in his mind though he did not frame it into words he was neither sufficiently brave nor sufficiently cruel to speak to her in such language there was nothing for him therefore but that he must shuffle and lie  i only meant said he that i would not for worlds do anything to make you uneasy  she did not see how she could again revert to the subject of her own christian name she had made her little tender loving request and it had been refused of course she knew that it had been refused as a matter of caution she was not angry with him because of his caution as she had expected him to be cautious the barriers over which she had to climb were no more than she had expected to find in her waybut they were so very high and so very difficult of course she was aware that he would escape if he could she was not angry with him on that account anger could not have helped her indeed she did not price herself highly enough to make her feel that she would be justified in being angry it was natural enough that he shouldnt want her she knew herself to be a poor thin vapid tawdry creature with nothing to recommend her to any man except a sort of secondrate provincialtown fashion whichinfatuated as she wasshe attributed in a great degree to the thing she carried on her head she knew nothing she could do nothing she possessed nothing she was not angry with him because he so evidently wished to avoid her but she thought that if she could only be successful she would be good and loving and obedientand that it was fair for her at any rate to try each created animal must live and get its food by the gifts which the creator has given to it let those gifts be as poor as they maylet them be even as distasteful as they may to other members of the great created family the rat the toad the slug the flea must each live according to its appointed mode of existence animals which are parasites by nature can only live by attaching themselves to life that is strong to arabella mr gibson would be strong enough and it seemed to her that if she could fix herself permanently upon his strength that would be her proper mode of living she was not angry with him because he resisted the attempt but she had nothing of conscience to tell her that she should spare him as long as there remained to her a chance of success and should not her plea of excuse her justification be admitted there are tormentors as to which no man argues that they are iniquitous though they be very troublesome he either rids himself of them or suffers as quiescently as he may  we used to be suchgreatfriends she said still crying and i am afraid you dont like me a bit now  indeed i doi have always liked you but  but what do tell me what the but means i will do anything that you bid me  then it occurred to him that if after such a promise he were to confide to her his feeling that the chignon which she wore was ugly and unbecoming she would probably be induced to change her mode of headdress it was a foolish idea because had he followed it out he would have seen that compliance on her part in such a matter could only be given with the distinct understanding that a certain reward should be the consequence when an unmarried gentleman calls upon an unmarried lady to change the fashion of her personal adornments the unmarried lady has a right to expect that the unmarried gentleman means to make her his wife but mr gibson had no such meaning and was led into error by the necessity for sudden action when she offered to do anything that he might bid her do he could not take up his hat and go away she looked up into his face expecting that he would give her some orderand he fell into the temptation that was spread for him  if i might say a word he began  you may say anything she exclaimed  if i were you i dont think  you dont think what mr gibson  he found it to be a matter very difficult of approach do you know i dont think the fashion that has come up about wearing your hair quite suits younot so well as the way you used to do it she became on a sudden very red in the face and he thought that she was angry vexed she was but still accompanying her vexation there was a remembrance that she was achieving victory even by her own humiliation she loved her chignon but she was ready to abandon even that for him nevertheless she could not speak for a moment or two and he was forced to continue his criticism i have no doubt those things are very becoming and all that and i dare say they are comfortable  oh very she said  but there was a simplicity that i liked about the other  could it be then that for the last five years he had stood aloof from her because she had arrayed herself in fashionable attire she was still very red in the face still suffering from wounded vanity still conscious of that soreness which affects us all when we are made to understand that we are considered to have failed there where we have most thought that we excelled but her womanly art enabled her quickly to conceal the pain i have made a promise she said and you will find that i will keep it  what promise asked mr gibson  i said that i would do as you bade me and so i will i would have done it sooner if i had known that you wished it i would never have worn it at all if i had thought that you disliked it  i think that a little of them is very nice said mr gibson mr gibson was certainly an awkward man but there are men so awkward that it seems to be their especial province to say always the very worst thing at the very worst moment  she became redder than ever as she was thus told of the hugeness of her favourite ornament she was almost angry now but she restrained herself thinking perhaps of how she might teach him taste in days to come as he was teaching her now i will change it tomorrow she said with a smile you come and see tomorrow  upon this he got up and took his hat and made his escape assuring her that he would come and see her on the morrow she let him go now without any attempt at further tenderness certainly she had gained much during the interview he had as good as told her in what had been her offence and of course when she had remedied that offence he could hardly refuse to return to her she got up as soon as she was alone and looked at her head in the glass and told herself that the pity would be great it was not that the chignon was in itself a thing of beauty but that it imparted so unmistakable an air of fashion it divested her of that dowdiness which she feared above all things and enabled her to hold her own among other young women without feeling that she was absolutely destitute of attraction there had been a certain homage paid to it which she had recognised and enjoyed but it was her ambition to hold her own not among young women but among clergymens wives and she would certainly obey his orders she could not make the attempt now because of the complications but she certainly would make it before she laid her head on the pillowand would explain to camilla that it was a little joke between herself and mr gibson     chapter xlviii  mr gibson is punished   miss stanbury was divine in her wrath and became more and more so daily as new testimony reached her of dishonesty on the part of the frenches and of treachery on the part of mr gibson and these people so empty so vain so weak were getting the better of her were conquering her were robbing her of her prestige and her ancient glory simply because she herself was too generous to speak out and tell the truth there was a martyrdom to her in this which was almost unendurable  now there came to her one day at luncheon timeon the day succeeding that on which miss french had promised to sacrifice her chignona certain mrs clifford from budleigh salterton to whom she was much attached perhaps the distance of budleigh salterton from exeter added somewhat to this affection so that mrs clifford was almost closer to our friends heart even than mrs machugh who lived just at the other end of the cathedral and in truth mrs clifford was a woman more serious in her mode of thought than mrs machugh and one who had more in common with miss stanbury than that other lady mrs clifford had been a miss noel of doddiscombe leigh and she and miss stanbury had been engaged to be married at the same timeeach to a man of fortune one match had been completed in the ordinary course of matches what had been the course of the other we already know but the friendship had been maintained on very close terms mrs machugh was a gallio at heart anxious chiefly to remove from herselfand from her friends alsoall the troubles of life and make things smooth and easy she was one who disregarded great questions who cared little or nothing what people said of her who considered nothing worth the trouble of a fightepicuri de grege porca but there was nothing swinish about mrs clifford of budleigh salterton she took life thoroughly in earnest she was a tory who sorrowed heartily for her country believing that it was being brought to ruin by the counsels of evil men she prayed daily to be delivered from dissenters radicals and wolves in sheeps clothingby which latter bad name she meant especially a certain leading politician of the day who had with the cunning of the devil tempted and perverted the virtue of her own political friends and she was one who thought that the slightest breath of scandal on a young womans name should be stopped at once an antique pureminded anxious selfsacrificing matron was mrs clifford and very dear to the heart of miss stanbury  after lunch was over on the day in question mrs clifford got miss stanbury into some closet retirement and there spoke her mind as to the things which were being said it had been asserted in her presence by camilla french that she camilla was authorised by mr gibson to declare that he had never thought of proposing to dorothy stanbury and that miss stanbury had been labouring under some strange misapprehension in the matter now my dear i dont care very much for the young lady in question said mrs clifford alluding to camilla french  very little indeed i should think said miss stanbury with a shake of her head  quite true my dearbut that does not make the words out of her mouth the less efficacious for evil she clearly insinuated that you had endeavoured to make up a match between this gentleman and your niece and that you had failed so much was at least true miss stanbury felt this and felt also that she could not explain the truth even to her dear old friend in the midst of her divine wrath she had acknowledged to herself that she had brought mr gibson into his difficulty and that it would not become her to tell any one of his failure and in this matter she did not herself accuse mr gibson she believed that the lie originated with camilla french and it was against camilla that her wrath raged the fiercest  she is a poor mean disappointed thing said miss stanbury  very probablybut i think i should ask her to hold her tongue about miss dorothy said mrs clifford  the consultation in the closet was carried on for about halfanhour and then miss stanbury put on her bonnet and shawl and descended into mrs cliffords carriage the carriage took the heavitree road and deposited miss stanbury at the door of mrs frenchs house the walk home from heavitree would be nothing and mrs clifford proceeded on her way having given this little help in counsel and conveyance to her friend mrs french was at home and miss stanbury was shown up into the room in which the three ladies were sitting      illustration miss stanbury visits the frenches   the reader will doubtless remember the promise which arabella had made to mr gibson that promise she had already fulfilledto the amazement of her mother and sisterand when miss stanbury entered the room the elder daughter of the family was seen without her accustomed headgear if the truth is to be owned miss stanbury gave the poor young woman no credit for her new simplicity but put down the deficiency to the charge of domestic slatternliness she was unjust enough to declare afterwards that she had found arabella french only half dressed at between three and four oclock in the afternoon from which this lesson may surely be learnedthat though the way down avernus may be and customarily is made with great celerity the return journey if made at all must be made slowly a young woman may commence in chignons by attaching any amount of an edifice to her head but the reduction should be made by degrees arabellas edifice had in miss stanburys eyes been the ugliest thing in art that she had known but now its absence offended her and she most untruly declared that she had come upon the young woman in the middle of the day just out of her bedroom and almost in her dressinggown  and the whole french family suffered a diminution of power from the strange phantasy which had come upon arabella they all felt in sight of the enemy that they had to a certain degree lowered their flag one of the ships at least had shown signs of striking and this element of weakness made itself felt through the whole fleet arabella herself when she saw miss stanbury was painfully conscious of her head and wished that she had postponed the operation till the evening she smiled with a faint watery smile and was aware that something ailed her  the greetings at first were civil but very formal as are those between nations which are nominally at peace but which are waiting for a sign at which each may spring at the others throat in this instance the juno from the close had come quite prepared to declare her casus belli as complete and to fling down her gauntlet unless the enemy should at once yield to her everything demanded with an abject submission mrs french she said i have called today for a particular purpose and i must address myself chiefly to miss camilla  oh certainly said mrs french  i shall be delighted to hear anything from you miss stanbury said camillanot without an air of bravado arabella said nothing but she put her hand up almost convulsively to the back of her head  i have been told today by a friend of mine miss camilla began miss stanbury that you declared yourself in her presence authorised by mr gibson to make a statement about my niece dorothy  may i ask who was your friend demanded mrs french  it was mrs clifford of course said camilla there is nobody else would try to make difficulties  there need be no difficulty at all miss camilla said miss stanbury if you will promise me that you will not repeat the statement it cant be true  but it is true said camilla  what is true asked miss stanbury surprised by the audacity of the girl  it is true that mr gibson authorised us to state what i did state when mrs clifford heard me  and what was that  only thisthat people had been saying all about exeter that he was going to be married to a young lady and that as the report was incorrect and as he had never had the remotest idea in his mind of making the young lady his wife camilla as she said this spoke with a great deal of emphasis putting forward her chin and shaking her headand as he thought it was uncomfortable both for the young lady and for himself and as there was nothing in it the least in the worldnothing at all no glimmer of a foundation for the report it would be better to have it denied everywhere that is what i said and we had authority from the gentleman himself arabella can say the same and so can mammaonly mamma did not hear him nor had camilla heard him but that incident she did not mention  the circumstances were in miss stanburys judgment becoming very remarkable she did not for a moment believe camilla she did not believe that mr gibson had given to either of the frenches any justification for the statement just made but camilla had been so much more audacious than miss stanbury had expected that that lady was for a moment struck dumb im sure miss stanbury said mrs french we dont want to give any offence to your niecevery far from it  my niece doesnt care about it two straws said miss stanbury it is i that care and i care very much the things that have been said have been altogether false  how false miss stanbury asked camilla  altogether falseas false as they can be  mr gibson must know his own mind said camilla  my dear theres a little disappointment said miss french and it dont signify  theres no disappointment at all said miss stanbury and it does signify very much now that ive begun ill go to the bottom of it if you say that mr gibson told you to make these statements ill go to mr gibson ill have it out somehow  you may have what you like out for us miss stanbury said camilla  i dont believe mr gibson said anything of the kind  thats civil said camilla  but why shouldnt he asked arabella  there were the reports you know said mrs french  and why shouldnt he deny them when there wasnt a word of truth in them continued camilla for my part i think the gentleman is bound for the ladys sake to declare that theres nothing in it when there is nothing in it this was more than miss stanbury could bear hitherto the enemy had seemed to have the best of it camilla was firing broadside after broadside as though she was assured of victory even mrs french was becoming courageous and arabella was forgetting the place where her chignon ought to have been i really do not know what else there is for me to say remarked camilla with a toss of her head and an air of impudence that almost drove poor miss stanbury frantic  it was on her tongue to declare the whole truth but she refrained she had schooled herself on this subject vigorously she would not betray mr gibson had she known all the truthor had she believed camilla frenchs version of the storythere would have been no betrayal but looking at the matter with such knowledge as she had at present she did not even yet feel herself justified in declaring that mr gibson had offered his hand to her niece and had been refused she was however sorely tempted very well ladies she said i shall now see mr gibson and ask him whether he did give you authority to make such statements as you have been spreading abroad everywhere then the door of the room was opened and in a moment mr gibson was among them he was true to his promise and had come to see arabella with her altered headdressbut he had come at this hour thinking that escape in the morning would be easier and quicker than it might have been in the evening his mind had been full of arabella and her headdress even up to the moment of his knocking at the door but all that was driven out of his brain at once when he saw miss stanbury  here is mr gibson himself said mrs french  how do you do mr gibson said miss stanbury with a very stately courtesy they had never met since the day on which he had been as he stated turned out of miss stanburys house he now bowed to her but there was no friendly greeting and the frenches were able to congratulate themselves on the apparent loyalty to themselves of the gentleman who stood among them i have come here mr gibson continued miss stanbury to put a small matter right in which you are concerned  it seems to me to be the most insignificant thing in the world said camilla  very likely said miss stanbury but it is not insignificant to me miss camilla french has asserted publicly that you have authorised her to make a statement about my niece dorothy  mr gibson looked into camillas face doubtingly inquisitively almost piteously you had better let her go on said camilla she will make a great many mistakes no doubt but you had better let her go on to the end  i have made no mistake as yet miss camilla she so asserted mr gibson in the hearing of a friend of mine and she repeated the assertion here in this room to me just before you came in she says that you have authorised her to declare thatthatthati had better speak it out plainly at once  much better said camilla  that you never entertained an idea of offering your hand to my niece miss stanbury paused and mr gibsons jaw fell visibly but he was not expected to speak as yet and miss stanbury continued her accusation beyond that i dont want to mention my nieces name if it can be avoided  but it cant be avoided said camilla  if you please i will continue mr gibson will understand me i will not if i can help it mention my nieces name again mr gibson but i still have that confidence in you that i do not think that you would have made such a statement in reference to yourself and any young ladyunless it were some young lady who had absolutely thrown herself at your head and in saying this she paused and looked very hard at camilla  thats just what dorothy stanbury has been doing said camilla  she has been doing nothing of the kind and you know she hasnt said miss stanbury raising her arm as though she were going to strike her opponent but i am quite sure mr gibson that you never could have authorised these young ladies to make such an assertion publicly on your behalf whatever there may have been of misunderstanding between you and me i cant believe that of you then she paused for a reply if you will be good enough to set us right on that point i shall be obliged to you  mr gibsons position was one of great discomfort he had given no authority to any one to make such a statement he had said nothing about dorothy stanbury to camilla but he had told arabella when hard pressed by that lady that he did not mean to propose to dorothy he could not satisfy miss stanbury because he feared arabella he could not satisfy the frenches because he feared miss stanbury i really do not think said he that we ought to talk about a young lady in this way  thats my opinion too said camilla but miss stanbury will  exactly so miss stanbury will said that lady mr gibson i insist upon it that you tell me whether you did give any such authority to miss camilla french or to miss french  i wouldnt answer her if i were you said camilla  i really dont think this can do any good said mrs french  and it is so very harassing to our nerves said arabella  nerves pooh exclaimed miss stanbury now mr gibson i am waiting for an answer  my dear miss stanbury i really think it betterthe situation is so peculiar and upon my word i hardly know how not to give offence which i wouldnt do for the world  do you mean to tell me that you wont answer my question demanded miss stanbury  i really think that i had better hold my tongue pleaded mr gibson  you are quite right mr gibson said camilla  indeed it is wisest said mrs french  i dont see what else he can do said arabella  then was miss stanbury driven altogether beyond her powers of endurance if that be so said she i must speak out though i should have preferred to hold my tongue mr gibson did offer to my niece the week before lasttwice and was refused by her my niece dorothy took it into her head that she did not like him and upon my word i think she was right we should have said nothing about thisnot a word but when these false assertions are made on mr gibsons alleged authority and mr gibson wont deny it i must tell the truth then there was silence among them for a few seconds and mr gibson struggled hard but vainly to clothe his face in a pleasant smile mr gibson is that true said miss stanbury but mr gibson made no reply it is as true as heaven said miss stanbury striking her hand upon the table and now you had better all of you hold your tongues about my niece and she will hold her tongue about you and as for mr gibsonanybody who wants him after this is welcome to him for us goodmorning mrs french goodmorning young ladies and so she stalked out of the room and out of the house and walked back to her house in the close  mamma said arabella as soon as the enemy was gone i have got such a headache that i think i will go upstairs  and i will go with you dear said camilla  mr gibson before he left the house confided his secret to the maternal ears of mrs french he certainly had been allured into making an offer to dorothy stanbury but was ready to atone for this crime by marrying her daughtercamillaas soon as might be convenient he was certainly driven to make this declaration by intense cowardicenot to excuse himself for in that there could be no excusebut how else should he dare to suggest that he might as well leave the house shall i tell the dear girl asked mrs french but mr gibson requested a fortnight in which to consider how the proposition had best be made     chapter xlix  mr brooke burgess after supper   brooke burgess was a clerk in the office of the ecclesiastical commissioners in london and as such had to do with things very solemn grave and almost melancholy he had to deal with the rents of episcopal properties to correspond with clerical claimants and to be at home with the circumstances of underpaid vicars and perpetual curates with much less than £300 ayear but yet he was as jolly and pleasant at his desk as though he were busied about the collection of the malt tax or wrote his letters to admirals and captains instead of to deans and prebendaries brooke burgess had risen to be a senior clerk and was held in some respect in his office but it was not perhaps for the amount of work he did nor yet on account of the gravity of his demeanour nor for the brilliancy of his intellect but if not clever he was sensible though he was not a dragon of official virtue he had a conscienceand he possessed those small but most valuable gifts by which a man becomes popular among men and thus it had come to pass in all those battles as to competitive merit which had taken place in his as in other public offices that no one had ever dreamed of putting a junior over the head of brooke burgess he was tractable easy pleasant and therefore deservedly successful all his brother clerks called him brookeexcept the young lads who for the first year or two of their service still denominated him mr burgess  brooke said one of his juniors coming into his room and standing before the fireplace with a cigar in his mouth have you heard who is to be the new commissioner  colenso to be sure said brooke  what a lark that would be and i dont see why he shouldnt but it isnt colenso the name has just come down  and who is it  old proudie from barchester  why we had him here years ago and he resigned  but hes to come on again now for a spell it always seems to me that the bishops aint a bit of use here they only get blown up and snubbed and shoved into corners by the others  you young reprobateto talk of shoving an archbishop into a corner  welldont they its only for the name of it they have them theres the bishop of broomsgrovehes always sauntering about the place looking as though hed be so much obliged if somebody would give him something to do hes always smiling and so graciousjust as if he didnt feel above half sure that he had any right to be where he is and he thought that perhaps somebody was going to kick him  and so old proudie is coming up again said brooke it certainly is very much the same to us whom they send hell get shoved into a corner as you call itonly that hell go into the corner without any shoving then there came in a messenger with a card and brooke learned that hugh stanbury was waiting for him in the strangers room in performing the promise made to dorothy he had called upon her brother as soon as he was back in london but had not found him this now was the return visit  i thought i was sure to find you here said hugh  pretty nearly sure from eleven till five said brooke a hard stepmother like the civil service does not allow one much chance of relief i do get across to the club sometimes for a glass of sherry and a biscuitbut here i am now at any rate and im very glad you have come then there was some talk between them about affairs at exeter but as they were interrupted before half an hour was over their heads by a summons brought for burgess from one of the secretaries it was agreed that they should dine together at burgesss club on the following day we can manage a pretty good beefsteak said brooke and have a fair glass of sherry i dont think you can get much more than that anywhere nowadaysunless you want a dinner for eight at three guineas a head the magnificence of men has become so intolerable now that one is driven to be humble in ones selfdefence stanbury assured his acquaintance that he was anything but magnificent in his own ideas that cold beef and beer was his usual fare and at last allowed the clerk to wait upon the secretary  i wouldnt have any other fellow to meet you said brooke as they sat at their dinners because in this way we can talk over the dear old woman at exeter yes our fellow does make good soup and its about all that he does do well as for getting a potato properly boiled thats quite out of the question yes it is a good glass of sherry i told you wed a fairish tap of sherry on well i was there backwards and forwards for nearly six weeks  and how did you get on with the old woman  like a house on fire said brooke  she didnt quarrel with you  noupon the whole she did not i always felt that it was touch and go she might or she might not every now and then she looked at me and said a sharp word as though it was about to come but i had determined when i went there altogether to disregard that kind of thing  its rather important to youis it not  you mean about her money  of course i mean about her money said stanbury  it is importantand so it was to you  not in the same degree or nearly so and as for me it was not on the cards that we shouldnt quarrel i am so utterly a bohemian in all my ideas of life and she is so absolutely the reverse that not to have quarrelled would have been hypocritical on my part or on hers she had got it into her head that she had a right to rule my life and of course she quarrelled with me when i made her understand that she should do nothing of the kind now she wont want to rule you  i hope not  she has taken you up continued stanbury on altogether a different understanding you are to her the representative of a family to whom she thinks she owes the restitution of the property which she enjoys i was simply a member of her own family to which she owes nothing she thought it well to help one of us out of what she regarded as her private purse and she chose me but the matter is quite different with you  she might have given everything to you as well as to me said brooke  thats not her idea she conceives herself bound to leave all she has back to a burgess except anything she may saveas she says off her own back or out of her own belly she has told me so a score of times  and what did you say  i always told her that let her do as she would i should never ask any question about her will  but she hates us all like poisonexcept me said brooke i never knew people so absurdly hostile as are your aunt and my uncle barty each thinks the other the most wicked person in the world  i suppose your uncle was hard upon her once  very likely he is a hard manand has very warmly all the feelings of an injured man i suppose my uncle brookes will was a cruel blow to him he professes to believe that miss stanbury will never leave me a shilling  he is wrong then said stanbury  oh yeshes wrong because he thinks that thats her present intention i dont know that hes wrong as to the probable result  who will have it then  there are ever so many horses in the race said brooke im one  youre the favourite said stanbury  for the moment i am then theres yourself  ive been scratched and am altogether out of the betting  and your sister continued brooke  shes only entered to run for the second money and if shell trot over the course quietly and not go the wrong side of the posts shell win that  she may do more than that then theres martha  my aunt will never leave her money to a servant what she may give to martha would come from her own savings  the next is a dark horse but one that wins a good many races of this kind hes apt to come in with a fatal rush at the end  who is it  the hospitals when an old lady finds in her latter days that she hates everybody and fancies that the people around her are all thinking of her money shes uncommon likely to indulge herself in a little bit of revenge and solace herself with largehanded charity  but shes so good a woman at heart said hugh  and what can a good woman do better than promote hospitals  shell never do that shes too strong its a maudlin sort of thing after all for a person to leave everything to a hospital  but people are maudlin when theyre dying said brookeor even when they think theyre dying how else did the church get the estates of which we are now distributing so bountifully some of the last remnants down at our office come into the next room and well have a smoke  they had their smoke and then they went at halfprice to the play and after the play was over they eat three or four dozen of oysters between them brooke burgess was a little too old for oysters at midnight in september but he went through his work like a man hugh stanburys powers were so great that he could have got up and done the same thing again after he had been an hour in bed without any serious inconvenience  but in truth brooke burgess had still another word or two to say before he went to his rest they supped somewhere near the haymarket and then he offered to walk home with stanbury to his chambers in lincolns inn do you know that mr gibson at exeter he asked as they passed through leicester square  yes i knew him he was a sort of tamecat parson at my aunts house in my days  exactlybut i fancy that has come to an end now have you heard anything about him lately  wellyes i have said stanbury feeling that dislike to speak of his sister which is common to most brothers when in company with other men  i suppose youve heard of it and as i was in the middle of it all of course i couldnt but know all about it too your aunt wanted him to marry your sister  so i was told  but your sister didnt see it said brooke  so i understand said stanbury i believe my aunt was exceedingly liberal and meant to do the best she could for poor dorothy but if she didnt like him i suppose she was right not to have him said hugh  of course she was right said brooke with a good deal of enthusiasm  i believe gibson to be a very decent sort of fellow said stanbury  a mean paltry dog said brooke there had been a little whiskytoddy after the oysters and mr burgess was perhaps moved to a warmer expression of feeling than he might have displayed had he discussed this branch of the subject before supper i knew from the first that she would have nothing to say to him he is such a poor creature  i always thought well of him said stanbury and was inclined to think that dolly might have done worse  it is hard to say what is the worst a girl might do but i think she might do perhaps a little better  what do you mean said hugh  i think i shall go down and ask her to take myself  do you mean it in earnest  i do said brooke of course i hadnt a chance when i was there she told me  who told youdorothy  no your auntshe told me that mr gibson was to marry your sister you know your aunts way she spoke of it as though the thing were settled as soon as she had got it into her own head and she was as hot upon it as though mr gibson had been an archbishop i had nothing to do then but to wait and see  i had no idea of dolly being fought for by rivals  brothers never think much of their sisters said brooke burgess  i can assure you i think a great deal of dorothy said hugh i believe her to be as sweet a woman as god ever made she hardly knows that she has a self belonging to herself  i am sure she doesnt said brooke  she is a dear loving sweettempered creature who is only too ready to yield in all things  but she wouldnt yield about gibson said brooke  how did she and my aunt manage  your sister simply said she couldntand then that she wouldnt i never thought from the first moment that shed take that fellow in the first place he cant say boo to a goose  but dolly wouldnt want a man to sayboo  im not so sure of that old fellow at any rate i mean to try myself nowwhatll the old woman say  shell be pleased as punch i should think said stanbury  either thator else shell swear that shell never speak another word to either of us however i shall go on with it  does dorothy know anything of this asked stanbury  not a word said brooke i came away a day or so after gibson was settled and as i had been talked to all through the affair by both of them i couldnt turn round and offer myself the moment he was gone you wont objectwill you  who i said stanbury i shall have no objection as long as dolly pleases herself of course you know that we havent as much as a brass farthing among us  that wont matter if the old lady takes it kindly said brooke then they parted at the corner of lincolns inn fields and hugh as he went up to his own rooms reflected with something of wonderment on the success of dorothys charms she had always been the poor one of the family the chick out of the nest which would most require assistance from the stronger birds but it now appeared that she would become the first among all the stanburys wealth had first flowed down upon the stanbury family from the will of old brooke burgess and it now seemed probable that poor dolly would ultimately have the enjoyment of it all     chapter l  camilla triumphant      illustration  it was now new years day and there was some grief and perhaps more excitement in exeterfor it was rumoured that miss stanbury lay very ill at her house in the close but in order that our somewhat uneven story may run as smoothly as it may be made to do the little history of the french family for the intervening months shall be told in this chapter in order that it may be understood how matters were with them when the tidings of miss stanburys severe illness first reached their house at heavitree  after that terrible scene in which miss stanbury had so dreadfully confounded mr gibson by declaring the manner in which he had been rebuffed by dorothy the unfortunate clergyman had endeavoured to make his peace with the french family by assuring the mother that in very truth it was the dearest wish of his heart to make her daughter camilla his wife mrs french who had ever been disposed to favour arabellas ambition well knowing its priority and ancient right and who of late had been taught to consider that even camilla had consented to waive any claim that she might have once possessed could not refrain from the expression of some surprise that he should be recovered at all out of the stanbury clutches was very much to mrs frenchwas so much that had time been given her for consideration she would have acknowledged to herself readily that the property had best be secured at once to the family without incurring that amount of risk which must unquestionably attend any attempt on her part to direct mr gibsons purpose hither or thither but the proposition came so suddenly that time was not allowed to her to be altogether wise i thought it was poor bella she said with something of a piteous whine in her voice at the moment mr gibson was so humble that he was half inclined to give way even on that head he felt himself to have been brought so low in the market by that terrible story of miss stanburyswhich he had been unable either to contradict or to explainthat there was but little power of fighting left in him he was however just able to speak a word for himself and that sufficed i hope there has been no mistake he said but really it is camilla that has my heart mrs french made no rejoinder to this it was so much to her to know that mr gibsons heart was among them at all after what had occurred in the close that she acknowledged to herself after that moment of reflection that arabella must be sacrificed for the good of the family interests poor dear loving misguided and spiritless mother she would have given the blood out of her bosom to get husbands for her daughters though it was not of her own experience that she had learned that of all worldly goods a husband is the best but it was the possession which they had from their earliest years thought of acquiring which they first expected for which they had then hoped and afterwards worked and schemed and striven with every energyand as to which they had at last almost despaired and now arabellas fire had been rekindled with a new spark which alas was to be quenched so suddenly and am i to tell them asked mrs french with a tremor in her voice to this however mr gibson demurred he said that for certain reasons he should like a fortnights grace and that at the end of the fortnight he would be prepared to speak the interval was granted without further questions and mr gibson was allowed to leave the house  after that mrs french was not very comfortable at home as soon as mr gibson had departed camilla at once returned to her mother and desired to know what had taken place was it true that the perjured man had proposed to that young woman in the close mrs french was not clever at keeping a secret and she could not keep this by her own aid she told all that happened to camilla and between them they agreed that arabella should be kept in ignorance till the fatal fortnight should have passed when camilla was interrogated as to her own purpose she said she should like a day to think of it she took the twentyfour hours and then made the following confession of her passion to her mother you see mamma i always liked mr gibsonalways  so did arabella my dearbefore you thought of such things  i dare say that may be true mamma but that is not my fault he came here among us on such sweetly intimate terms that the feeling grew up with me before i knew what it meant as to any idea of cutting out arabella my conscience is quite clear if i thought there had been anything really between them i would have gone anywhereto the top of a mountainrather than rob my sister of a heart that belonged to her  he has been so slow about it said mrs french  i dont know about that said camilla gentlemen have to be slow i suppose when they think of their incomes he only got st peterscumpumpkin three years ago and didnt know for the first year whether he could hold that and the minor canonry together of course a gentleman has to think of these things before he comes forward  my dear he has been very backward  if im to be mrs gibson mamma i beg that i maynt hear anything said against him then there came all this about that young woman and when i saw that arabella took on sowhich i must say was very absurdim sure i put myself out of the way entirely if id buried myself under the ground i couldnt have done it more and its my belief that what ive said all for arabellas sake has put the old woman into such a rage that it has made a quarrel between him and the niece otherwise that wouldnt be off i dont believe a word of her refusing him and never shall is it in the course of things mamma mrs french shook her head of course not then when you question himvery properlyhe says that hes devoted topoor me if i was to refuse him he wouldnt put up with bella  i suppose not said mrs french  he hates bella ive known it all along though i wouldnt say so if i were to sacrifice myself ever so it wouldnt be of any goodand i shant do it in this way the matter was arranged  at the end of the fortnight however mr gibson did not comenor at the end of three weeks inquiries had of course been made and it was ascertained that he had gone into cornwall for a parsons holiday of thirteen days that might be all very well a man might want the recruiting vigour of some change of air after such scenes as those mr gibson had gone through with the stanburys and before his proposed encounter with new perils and he was a man so tied by the leg that his escape could not be for any long time he was back on the appointed sunday and on the wednesday mrs french under camillas instruction wrote to him a pretty little note he replied that he would be with her on the saturday it would then be nearly four weeks after the great day with miss stanbury but no one would be inclined to quarrel with so short a delay as that arabella in the meantime had become fidgety and unhappy she seemed to understand that something was expected being quite unable to guess what that something might be she was true throughout these days to the simplicity of headgear which mr gibson had recommended to her and seemed in her questions to her mother and to camilla to be more fearful of dorothy stanbury than of any other enemy mamma i think you ought to tell her said camilla more than once but she had not been told when mr gibson came on the saturday it may truly be said that the poor mothers pleasure in the prospects of one daughter was altogether destroyed by the anticipation of the other daughters misery had mr gibson made dorothy stanbury his wife they could have all comforted themselves together by the heat of their joint animosity  he came on the saturday and it was so managed that he was closeted with camilla before arabella knew that he was in the house there was a quarter of an hour during which his work was easy and perhaps pleasant when he began to explain his intention camilla with the utmost frankness informed him that her mother had told her all about it then she turned her face on one side and put her hand in his he got his arm round her waist gave her a kiss and the thing was done camilla was fully resolved that after such a betrothal it should not be undone she had behaved with sisterly forbearance and would not now lose the reward of virtue not a word was said of arabella at this interview till he was pressed to come and drink tea with them all that night he hesitated a moment and then camilla declared with something perhaps of imperious roughness in her manner that he had better face it all at once mamma will tell her and she will understand said camilla he hesitated again but at last promised that he would come  whilst he was yet in the house mrs french had told the whole story to her poor elder daughter what is he doing with camilla arabella had asked with feverish excitement  bella darlingdont you know said the mother  i know nothing everybody keeps me in the dark and i am badly used what is it that he is doing then mrs french tried to take the poor young woman in her arms but arabella would not submit to be embraced dont she exclaimed leave me alone nobody likes me or cares a bit about me why is cammy with him there all alone  i suppose he is asking herto behis wife then arabella threw herself in despair upon the bed and wept without any further attempt at control over her feelings it was a deathblow to her last hope and all the world as she looked upon the world then was over for her if i could have arranged it the other way you know that i would said the mother  mamma said arabella jumping up he shant do it he hasnt a right and as for her oh that she should treat me in this way didnt he tell me the other night when he drank tea here with me alone  what did he tell you bella  never mind nothing shall ever make me speak to him againnot if he married her three times over nor to her she is a nasty sly goodfornothing thing  but bella  dont talk to me mamma there never was such a thing done before since peoplewerepeople at all she has been doing it all the time i know she has  nevertheless arabella did sit down to tea with the two lovers that night there was a terrible scene between her and camilla but camilla held her own and arabella being the weaker of the two was vanquished by the expenditure of her own small energies camilla argued that as her sisters chance was gone and as the prize had come in her own way there was no good reason why it should be lost to the family altogether because arabella could not win it when arabella called her a treacherous vixen and a heartless profligate hussy she spoke out freely and said that she wasnt going to be abused a gentleman to whom she was attached had asked her for her hand and she had given it if arabella chose to make herself a fool she mightbut what would be the effect simply that all the world would know that she arabella was disappointed poor bella at last gave way put on her discarded chignon and came down to tea mr gibson was already in the room when she entered it arabella he said getting up to greet her i hope you will congratulate me he had planned his little speech and his manner of making it and had wisely decided that in this way might he best get over the difficulty  oh yesof course she said with a little giggle and then a sob and then a flood of tears  dear bella feels these things so strongly said mrs french  we have never been parted yet said camilla then arabella tapped the head of the sofa three or four times sharply with her knuckles it was the only protest against the reading of the scene which camilla had given of which she was capable at that moment after that mrs french gave out the tea arabella curled herself upon the sofa as though she were asleep and the two lovers settled down to proper loverlike conversation  the reader may be sure that camilla was not slow in making the fact of her engagement notorious through the city it was not probably true that the tidings of her success had anything to do with miss stanburys illness but it was reported by many that such was the case it was in november that the arrangement was made and it certainly was true that miss stanbury was rather ill about the same time you know you naughty lothario that you did give her some ground to hope that she might dispose of her unfortunate niece said camilla playfully to her own one when this illness was discussed between them but you are caught now and your wings are clipped and you are never to be a naughty lothario again the clerical don juan bore it all awkwardly indeed but with good humour and declared that all his troubles of that sort were over now and for ever nevertheless he did not name the day and camilla began to feel that there might be occasion for a little more of that imperious roughness which she had at her command  november was nearly over and nothing had been fixed about the day arabella never condescended to speak to her sister on the subject but on more than one occasion made some inquiry of her mother and she came to perceive or to think that she perceived that her mother was still anxious on the subject i shouldnt wonder if he wasnt off some day now she said at last to her mother  dont say anything so dreadful bella  it would serve cammy quite right and its just what hes likely to do  it would kill me said the mother  i dont know about killing said arabella its nothing to what ive had to go through i shouldnt pretend to be sorry if he were to go to hongkong tomorrow  but mr gibson had no idea of going to hongkong he was simply carrying out his little scheme for securing the advantages of a long day he was fully resolved to be married and was contented to think that his engagement was the best thing for him to one or two male friends he spoke of camilla as the perfection of female virtue and entertained no smallest idea of ultimate escape but a long day is often a convenience a bill at three months sits easier on a man than one at sixty days and a bill at six months is almost as little of a burden as no bill at all  but camilla was resolved that some day should be fixed thomas she said to her lover one morning as they were walking home together after service at the cathedral isnt this rather a fools paradise of ours  how a fools paradise asked the happy thomas  what i mean is dearest that we ought to fix something mamma is getting uneasy about her own plans  in what way dearest  about a thousand things she cant arrange anything till our plans are made of course there are little troubles about money when people aint rich then it occurred to her that this might seem to be a plea for postponing rather than for hurrying the marriage and she mended her argument the truth is thomas she wants to know when the day is to be fixed and ive promised to ask she said shed ask you herself but i wouldnt let her do that  we must think about it of course said thomas  but my dear there has been plenty of time for thinking what do you say to january this was on the last day of november  january exclaimed thomas in a tone that betrayed no triumph i couldnt get my services arranged for in january  i thought a clergyman could always manage that for his marriage said camilla  not in january besides i was thinking you would like to be away in warmer weather  they were still in november and he was thinking of postponing it till the summer camilla immediately perceived how necessary it was that she should be plain with him we shall not have warm weather as you call it for a very long time thomasand i dont think that it would be wise to wait for the weather at all indeed ive begun to get my things for doing it in the winter mamma said that she was sure january would be the very latest and it isnt as though we had to get furniture or anything of that kind of course a lady shouldnt be pressing she smiled sweetly and leaned on his arm as she said this but i hate all girlish nonsense and that kind of thing it is such a bore to be kept waiting im sure theres nothing to prevent it coming off in february  the 31st of march was fixed before they reached heavitree and camilla went into her mothers house a happy woman but mr gibson as he went home thought that he had been hardly used here was a girl who hadnt a shilling of moneynot a shilling till her mother diedand who already talked about his house and his furniture and his income as if it were all her own circumstanced as she was what right had she to press for an early day he was quite sure that arabella would have been more discreet and less exacting he was very angry with his dear cammy as he went across the close to his house     chapter li  shewing what happened during miss stanburys illness   it was on christmasday that sir peter mancrudy the highest authority on such matters in the west of england was sent for to see miss stanbury and sir peter had acknowledged that things were very serious he took dorothy on one side and told her that mr martin the ordinary practitioner had treated the case no doubt quite wisely throughout that there was not a word to be said against mr martin whose experience was great and whose discretion was undeniable but neverthelessat least it seemed to dorothy that this was the only meaning to be attributed to sir peters wordsmr martin had in this case taken one line of treatment when he ought to have taken another the plan of action was undoubtedly changed and mr martin became very fidgety and ordered nothing without sir peters sanction miss stanbury was suffering from bronchitis and a complication of diseases about her throat and chest barty burgess declared to more than one acquaintance in the little parlour behind the bank that she would go on drinking four or five glasses of new port wine every day in direct opposition to martins request camilla french heard the report and repeated it to her lover and perhaps another person or two with an expression of her assured conviction that it must be falseat any rate as regarded the fifth glass mrs machugh who saw martha daily was much frightened the peril of such a friend disturbed equally the repose and the pleasures of her life mrs clifford was often at miss stanburys bedsideand would have sat there reading for hours together had she not been made to understand by martha that miss stanbury preferred that miss dorothy should read to her the sick woman received the sacrament weeklynot from mr gibson but from the hands of another minor canon and though she never would admit her own danger or allow others to talk to her of it it was known to them all that she admitted it to herself because she had with much personal annoyance caused a codicil to be added to her will as you didnt marry that man she said to dorothy i must change it again it was in vain that dorothy begged her not to trouble herself with such thoughts thats trash said miss stanbury angrily a person who has it is bound to trouble himself about it you dont suppose im afraid of dyingdo you she added dorothy answered her with some commonplacedeclaring how strongly they all expected to see her as well as ever im not a bit afraid to die said the old woman wheezing struggling with such voice as she possessed im not afraid of it and i dont think i shall die this time but im not going to have mistakes when im gone this was on the eve of the new year and on the same night she asked dorothy to write to brooke burgess and request him to come to exeter this was dorothys letter      exeter 31st december 186     my dear mr burgess     perhaps i ought to have written before to say that aunt    stanbury is not as well as we could wish her but as i    know that you cannot very well leave your office i have    thought it best not to say anything to frighten you but    tonight aunt herself has desired me to tell you that she    thinks you ought to know that she is ill and that she    wishes you to come to exeter for a day or two if it is    possible sir peter mancrudy has been here every day    since christmasday and i believe he thinks she may get    over it it is chiefly in the throatwhat they call    bronchitisand she has got to be very weak with it and    at the same time very liable to inflammation so i know    that you will come if you can     yours very truly     dorothy stanbury     perhaps i ought to tell you that she had her lawyer here    with her the day before yesterday but she does not seem    to think that she herself is in danger i read to her a    good deal and i think she is generally asleep when i    stop she wakes and i dont believe she gets any other    rest at all   when it was known in exeter that brooke burgess had been sent for then the opinion became general that miss stanburys days were numbered questions were asked of sir peter at every corner of the street but sir peter was a discreet man who could answer such questions without giving any information if it so pleased god his patient would die but it was quite possible that she might live that was the tenor of sir peters repliesand they were read in any light according to the idiosyncracies of the reader mrs machugh was quite sure that the danger was over and had a little game of cribbage on the sly with old miss wrightfor during the severity of miss stanburys illness whist was put on one side in the vicinity of the close barty burgess was still obdurate and shook his head he was of opinion that they might soon gratify their curiosity and see the last crowning iniquity of this wickedest of old women mrs clifford declared that it was all in the hands of god but that she saw no reason why miss stanbury should not get about again mr gibson thought that it was all up with his late friend and camilla wished that at their last interview there had been more of charity on the part of one whom she had regarded in past days with respect and esteem mrs french despondent about everything was quite despondent in this case martha almost despaired and already was burdened with the cares of a whole wardrobe of solemn funereal clothing she was seen peering in for halfanhour at the windows and doorway of a large warehouse for the sale of mourning giles hickbody would not speak above his breath and took his beer standing but dorothy was hopeful and really believed that her aunt would recover perhaps sir peter had spoken to her in terms less oracular than those which he used towards the public  brooke burgess came and had an interview with sir peter and to him sir peter was under some obligation to speak plainly as being the person whom miss stanbury recognised as her heir so sir peter declared that his patient might perhaps live and perhaps might die the truth is mr burgess said sir peter a doctor doesnt know so very much more about these things than other people it was understood that brooke was to remain three days in exeter and then return to london he would of course come again ifif anything should happen sir peter had been quite clear in his opinion that no immediate result was to be anticipatedeither in the one direction or the other his patient was doomed to a long illness she might get over it or she might succumb to it  dorothy and brooke were thus thrown much together during these three days dorothy indeed spent most of her hours beside her aunts bed instigating sleep by the reading of a certain series of sermons in which miss stanbury had great faith but nevertheless there were some minutes in which she and brooke were necessarily together they eat their meals in each others company and there was a period in the evening before dorothy began her nightwatch in her aunts room at which she took her tea while martha was nurse in the room above at this time of the day she would remain an hour or more with brooke and a great deal may be said between a man and a woman in an hour when the will to say it is there brooke burgess had by no means changed his mind since he had declared it to hugh stanbury under the midnight lamps of long acre when warmed by the influence of oysters and whisky toddy the whisky toddy had in that instance brought out truth and not falsehoodas is ever the nature of whisky toddy and similar dangerous provocatives there is no saying truer than that which declares that there is truth in wine wine is a dangerous thing and should not be made the exponent of truth let the truth be good as it may but it has the merit of forcing a man to show his true colours a man who is a gentleman in his cups may be trusted to be a gentleman at all times i trust that the severe censor will not turn upon me and tell me that no gentleman in these days is ever to be seen in his cups there are cups of different degrees of depth and cups do exist even among gentlemen and seem disposed to hold their own let the censor be ever so severe the gentleman in his cups is a gentleman always and the man who tells his friend in his cups that he is in love does so because the fact has been very present to himself in his cooler and calmer moments brooke burgess who had seen hugh stanbury on two or three occasions since that of the oysters and toddy had not spoken again of his regard for hughs sister but not the less was he determined to carry out his plan and make dorothy his wife if she would accept him but could he ask her while the old lady was as it might be dying in the house he put this question to himself as he travelled down to exeter and had told himself that he must be guided for an answer by circumstances as they might occur hugh had met him at the station as he started for exeter and there had been a consultation between them as to the propriety of bringing about or of attempting to bring about an interview between hugh and his aunt do whatever you like hugh had said i would go down to her at a moments warning if she should express a desire to see me  on the first night of brookes arrival this question had been discussed between him and dorothy dorothy had declared herself unable to give advice if any message were given to her she would deliver it to her aunt but she thought that anything said to her aunt on the subject had better come from brooke himself you evidently are the person most important to her dorothy said and she would listen to you when she would not let any one else say a word brooke promised that he would think of it and then dorothy tripped up to relieve martha dreaming nothing at all of that other doubt to which the important personage downstairs was now subject dorothy was in truth very fond of the new friend she had made but it had never occurred to her that he might be a possible suitor to her her old conception of herselfthat she was beneath the notice of any manhad only been partly disturbed by the absolute fact of mr gibsons courtship she had now heard of his engagement with camilla french and saw in that complete proof that the foolish man had been induced to offer his hand to her by the promise of her aunts money if there had been a moment of exaltationa period in which she had allowed herself to think that she was as other women capable of making herself dear to a manit had been but a moment and now she rejoiced greatly that she had not acceded to the wishes of one to whom it was so manifest that she had not made herself in the least dear  on the second day of his visit brooke was summoned to miss stanburys room at noon she was forbidden to talk and during a great portion of the day could hardly speak without an effort but there would be half hours now and again in which she would become stronger than usual at which time nothing that martha and dorothy could say would induce her to hold her tongue when brooke came to her on this occasion he found her sitting up in bed with a great shawl round her and he at once perceived she was much more like her own self than on the former day she told him that she had been an old fool for sending for him that she had nothing special to say to him that she had made no alteration in her will in regard to himexcept that i have done something for dolly that will have to come out of your pocket brooke brooke declared that too much could not be done for a person so good and dear and excellent as dorothy stanbury let it come out of whose pocket it might she is nothing to you you know said miss stanbury  she is a great deal to me said brooke  what is she asked miss stanbury  oha friend a great friend  well yes i hope it may be so but she wont have anything that i havent saved said miss stanbury there are two houses at st thomass but i bought them myself brookeout of the income brooke could only declare that as the whole property was hers to do what she liked with it as completely as though she had inherited it from her own father no one could have any right to ask questions as to when or how this or that portion of the property had accrued but i dont think im going to die yet brooke she said if it is gods will i am ready not that im fit brooke god forbid that i should ever think that but i doubt whether i shall ever be fitter i can go without repining if he thinks best to take me then he stood up by her bedside with his hand upon hers and after some hesitation asked her whether she would wish to see her nephew hugh no said she sharply brooke went on to say how pleased hugh would have been to come to her i dont think much of deathbed reconciliations said the old woman grimly i loved him dearly but he didnt love me and i dont know what good we should do each other brooke declared that hugh did love her but he could not press the matter and it was dropped  on that evening at eight dorothy came down to her tea she had dined at the same table with brooke that afternoon but a servant had been in the room all the time and nothing had been said between them as soon as brooke had got his tea he began to tell the story of his failure about hugh he was sorry he said that he had spoken on the subject as it had moved miss stanbury to an acrimony which he had not expected  she always declares that he never loved her said dorothy she has told me so twenty times  there are people who fancy that nobody cares for them said brooke  indeed there are mr burgess and it is so natural  why natural  just as it is natural that there should be dogs and cats that are petted and loved and made much of and others that have to crawl through life as they can cuffed and kicked and starved  that depends on the accident of possession said brooke  so does the other how many people there are that dont seem to belong to anybodyand if they do theyre no good to anybody theyre not cuffed exactly or starved but  you mean that they dont get their share of affection  they get perhaps as much as they deserve said dorothy  because theyre crossgrained or illtempered or disagreeable  not exactly that  what then asked brooke  because theyre just nobodies they are not anything particular to anybody and so they go on living till they die you know what i mean mr burgess a man who is a nobody can perhaps make himself somebodyor at any rate he can try but a woman has no means of trying she is a nobody and a nobody she must remain she has her clothes and her food but she isnt wanted anywhere people put up with her and that is about the best of her luck if she were to die somebody perhaps would be sorry for her but nobody would be worse off she doesnt earn anything or do any good she is just there and thats all  brooke had never heard her speak after this fashion before had never known her to utter so many consecutive words or to put forward any opinion of her own with so much vigour and dorothy herself when she had concluded her speech was frightened by her own energy and grew red in the face and showed very plainly that she was half ashamed of herself brooke thought that he had never seen her look so pretty before and was pleased by her enthusiasm he understood perfectly that she was thinking of her own position though she had entertained no idea that he would so read her meaning and he felt that it was incumbent on him to undeceive her and make her know that she was not one of those women who are just there and thats all one does see such a woman as that now and again he said  there are hundreds of them said dorothy and of course it cant be helped  such as arabella french said he laughing  wellyes if she is one it is very easy to see the difference some people are of use and are always doing things there are others generally women who have nothing to do but who cant be got rid of it is a melancholy sort of feeling  you at least are not one of them  i didnt mean to complain about myself she said i have got a great deal to make me happy  i dont suppose you regard yourself as an arabella french said he  how angry miss french would be if she heard you she considers herself to be one of the reigning beauties of exeter  she has had a very long reign and dominion of that sort to be successful ought to be short  that is spiteful mr burgess  i dont feel spiteful against her poor woman i own i do not love camilla not that i begrudge camilla her present prosperity  nor i either mr burgess  she and mr gibson will do very well together i dare say  i hope they will said dorothy and i do not see any reason against it they have known each other a long time  a very long time said brooke then he paused for a minute thinking how he might best tell her that which he had now resolved should be told on this occasion dorothy finished her tea and got up as though she were about to go to her duty upstairs she had been as yet hardly an hour in the room and the period of her relief was not fairly over but there had come something of a personal flavour in their conversation which prompted her unconsciously to leave him she had without any special indication of herself included herself among that company of old maids who are born and live and die without that vital interest in the affairs of life which nothing but family duties the care of children or at least of a husband will give to a woman if she had not meant this she had felt it he had understood her meaning or at least her feeling and had taken upon himself to assure her that she was not one of the company whose privations she had endeavoured to describe her instinct rather than her reason put her at once upon her guard and she prepared to leave the room you are not going yet he said  i think i might as well martha has so much to do and she comes to me again at five in the morning  dont go quite yet he said pulling out his watch i know all about the hours and it wants twenty minutes to the proper time  there is no proper time mr burgess  then you can remain a few minutes longer the fact is ive got something i want to say to you  he was now standing between her and the door so that she could not get away from him but at this moment she was absolutely ignorant of his purpose expecting nothing of love from him more than she would from sir peter mancrudy her face had become flushed when she made her long speech but there was no blush on it as she answered him now of course i can wait she said if you have anything to say to me  welli have i should have said it before only that that other man was here he was blushing nowup to the roots of his hair and felt that he was in a difficulty there are men to whom such moments of their lives are pleasurable but brooke burgess was not one of them he would have been glad to have had it done and overso that then he might take pleasure in it  what man asked dorothy in perfect innocence  mr gibson to be sure i dont know that there is anybody else  oh mr gibson he never comes here now and i dont suppose he will again aunt stanbury is so very angry with him  i dont care whether he comes or not what i mean is this when i was here before i was told that you were goingto marry him  but i wasnt  how was i to know that when you didnt tell me i certainly did know it after i came back from dartmoor he paused a moment as though she might have a word to say she had no word to say and did not in the least know what was coming she was so far from anticipating the truth that she was composed and easy in her mind but all that is of no use at all he continued when i was here before miss stanbury wanted you to marry mr gibson and of course i had nothing to say about it now i want youto marry me  mr burgess  dorothy my darling i love you better than all the world i do indeed as soon as he had commenced his protestations he became profuse enough with them and made a strong attempt to support them by the action of his hands but she retreated from him step by step till she had regained her chair by the teatable and there she seated herselfsafely as she thought but he was close to her over her shoulder still continuing his protestations offering up his vows and imploring her to reply to him she as yet had not answered him by a word save by that one halfterrified exclamation of his name tell me at any rate that you believe me when i assure you that i love you he said the room was going round with dorothy and the world was going round and there had come upon her so strong a feeling of the disruption of things in general that she was at the moment anything but happy had it been possible for her to find that the last ten minutes had been a dream she would at this moment have wished that it might become one a trouble had come upon her out of which she did not see her way to dive among the waters in warm weather is very pleasant there is nothing pleasanter but when the young swimmer first feels the thorough immersion of his plunge there comes upon him a strong desire to be quickly out again he will remember afterwards how joyous it was but now at this moment the dry land is everything to him so it was with dorothy she had thought of brooke burgess as one of those bright ones of the world with whom everything is happy and pleasant whom everybody loves who may have whatever they please whose lines have been laid in pleasant places she thought of him as a man who might some day make some woman very happy as his wife to be the wife of such a man was in dorothys estimation one of those blessed chances which come to some women but which she never regarded as being within her own reach though she had thought much about him she had never thought of him as a possible possession for herself and now that he was offering himself to her she was not at once made happy by his love her ideas of herself and of her life were all dislocated for the moment and she required to be alone that she might set herself in order and try herself all over and find whether her bones were broken say that you believe me he repeated      illustration the world was going round with dorothy   i dont know what to say she whispered  ill tell you what to say say at once that you will be my wife  i cant say that mr burgess  why not do you mean that you cannot love me  i think if you please ill go up to aunt stanbury it is time for me indeed it is and she will be wondering and martha will be put out indeed i must go up  and will you not answer me  i dont know what to say you must give me a little time to consider i dont quite think youre serious  heaven and earth began brooke  and im sure it would never do at any rate i must go now i must indeed  and so she escaped and went up to her aunts room which she reached at ten minutes after her usual time and before martha had begun to be put out she was very civil to martha as though martha had been injured and she put her hand on her aunts arm with a soft caressing apologetic touch feeling conscious that she had given cause for offence what has he been saying to you said her aunt as soon as martha had closed the door this was a question which dorothy certainly could not answer miss stanbury meant nothing by itnothing beyond a sick womans desire that something of the conversation of those who were not sick should be retailed to her but to dorothy the question meant so much how should her aunt have known that he had said anything she sat herself down and waited giving no answer to the question i hope he gets his meals comfortably said miss stanbury  i am sure he does said dorothy infinitely relieved then knowing how important it was that her aunt should sleep she took up the volume of jeremy taylor and with so great a burden on her mind she went on painfully and distinctly with the second sermon on the marriage ring she strove valiantly to keep her mind to the godliness of the discourse so that it might be of some possible service to herself and to keep her voice to the tone that might be of service to her aunt presently she heard the grateful sound which indicated her aunts repose but she knew of experience that were she to stop the sound and the sleep would come to an end also for a whole hour she persevered reading the sermon of the marriage ring with such attention to the godly principles of the teaching as she could givewith that terrible burden upon her mind  thank youthank you that will do my dear shut it up said the sick woman its time now for the draught then dorothy moved quietly about the room and did her nurses work with soft hand and soft touch and soft tread after that her aunt kissed her and bade her sit down and sleep  ill go on reading aunt if youll let me said dorothy but miss stanbury who was not a cruel woman would have no more of the reading and dorothys mind was left at liberty to think of the proposition that had been made to her to one resolution she came very quickly the period of her aunts illness could not be a proper time for marriage vows or the amenities of lovemaking she did not feel that he being a man had offended but she was quite sure that were she a woman the niece of so kind an aunt the nurse at the bedside of such an invalidwere she at such a time to consent to talk of love she would never deserve to have a lover and from this resolve she got great comfort it would give her an excuse for making no more assured answer at present and would enable her to reflect at leisure as to the reply she would give him should he ever by any chance renew his offer if he did notand probably he would notthen it would have been very well that he should not have been made the victim of a momentary generosity she had complained of the dulness of her life and that complaint from her had produced his noble kind generous dear enthusiastic benevolence towards her as she thought of it alland by degrees she took great pleasure in thinking of ither mind bestowed upon him all manner of eulogies she could not persuade herself that he really loved her and yet she was full at heart of gratitude to him for the expression of his love and as for herself could she love him we who are looking on of course know that she loved himthat from this moment there was nothing belonging to him down to his shoetie that would not be dear to her heart and an emblem so tender as to force a tear from her he had already become her god though she did not know it she made comparisons between him and mr gibson and tried to convince herself that the judgment which was always pronounced very clearly in brookes favour came from anything but her heart and thus through the long watches of the night she became very happy feeling but not knowing that the whole aspect of the world was changed to her by those few words which her lover had spoken to her she thought now that it would be consolation enough to her in future to know that such a man as brooke burgess had once asked her to be the partner of his life and that it would be almost ungenerous in her to push her advantage further and attempt to take him at his word besides there would be obstacles her aunt would dislike such a marriage for him and he would be bound to obey her aunt in such a matter she would not allow herself to think that she could ever become brookes wife but nothing could rob her of the treasure of the offer which he had made her then martha came to her at five oclock and she went to her bed to dream for an hour or two of brooke burgess and her future life  on the next morning she met him at breakfast she went down stairs later than usual not till ten having hung about her aunts room thinking that thus she would escape him for the present she would wait till he was gone out and then she would go down she did wait but she could not hear the front door and then her aunt murmured something about brookes breakfast she was told to go down and she went but when on the stairs she slunk back to her own room and stood there for awhile aimless motionless not knowing what to do then one of the girls came to her and told her that mr burgess was waiting breakfast for her she knew not what excuse to make and at last descended slowly to the parlour she was very happy but had it been possible for her to have run away she would have gone  dear dorothy he said at once i may call you somay i not  oh yes  and you will love meand be my own own wife  no mr burgess  no  i meanthat is to say  do you love me dorothy  only think how ill aunt stanbury is mr burgessperhaps dying how can i have any thought now except about her it wouldnt be rightwould it  you may say that you love me  mr burgess pray pray dont speak of it now if you do i must go away  but do you love me  pray pray dont mr burgess  there was nothing more to be got from her during the whole day than that he told her in the evening that as soon as miss stanbury was well he would come againthat in any case he would come again she sat quite still as he said this with a solemn facebut smiling at heart laughing at heart so happy when she got up to leave him and was forced to give him her hand he seized her in his arms and kissed her that is very very wrong she said sobbing and then ran to her roomthe happiest girl in all exeter he was to start early on the following morning and she knew that she would not be forced to see him again thinking of him was so much pleasanter than seeing him     chapter lii  mr outhouse complains that its hard   life had gone on during the winter at st diddulphs parsonage in a dull weary painful manner there had come a letter in november from trevelyan to his wife saying that as he could trust neither her nor her uncle with the custody of his child he should send a person armed with due legal authority addressed to mr outhouse for the recovery of the boy and desiring that little louis might be at once surrendered to the messenger then of course there had arisen great trouble in the house both mrs trevelyan and nora rowley had learned by this time that as regarded the master of the house they were not welcome guests at st diddulphs when the threat was shewn to mr outhouse he did not say a word to indicate that the child should be given up he muttered something indeed about impotent nonsense which seemed to imply that the threat could be of no avail but there was none of that reassurance to be obtained from him which a positive promise on his part to hold the bairn against all comers would have given mrs outhouse told her niece more than once that the child would be given to no messenger whatever but even she did not give the assurance with that energy which the mother would have liked they shall drag him away from me by force if they do take him said the mother gnashing her teeth oh if her father would but come for some weeks she did not let the boy out of her sight but when no messenger had presented himself by christmas time they all began to believe that the threat had in truth meant nothingthat it had been part of the ravings of a madman  but the threat had meant something early on one morning in january mr outhouse was told that a person in the hall wanted to see him and mrs trevelyan who was sitting at breakfast the child being at the moment upstairs started from her seat the maid described the man as being all as one as a gentleman though she would not go so far as to say that he was a gentleman in fact mr outhouse slowly rose from his breakfast went out to the man in the passage and bade him follow into the little closet that was now used as a study it is needless perhaps to say that the man was bozzle  i dare say mr houthouse you dont know me said bozzle mr outhouse disdaining all complimentary language said that he certainly did not my name mr houthouse is samuel bozzle and i live at no 55 stony walk union street borough i was in the force once but i work on my own ook now  what do you want with me mr bozzle  it isnt so much with you sir as it is with a lady as is under your protection and it isnt so much with the lady as it is with her infant  then you may go away mr bozzle said mr outhouse impatiently you may as well go away at once  will you please read them few lines sir said mr bozzle they is in mr trewilyans handwriting which will no doubt be familiar charactersleastways to mrs t if you dont know the gents fist mr outhouse after looking at the paper for a minute and considering deeply what in this emergency he had better do did take the paper and read it the words ran as follows i hereby give full authority to mr samuel bozzle of 55 stony walk union street borough to claim and to enforce possession of the body of my child louis trevelyan and i require that any person whatsoever who may now have the custody of the said child whether it be my wife or any of her friends shall at once deliver him up to mr bozzle on the production of this authoritylouis trevelyan it may be explained that before this document had been written there had been much correspondence on the subject between bozzle and his employer to give the expoliceman his due he had not at first wished to meddle in the matter of the child he had a wife at home who expressed an opinion with much vigour that the boy should be left with its mother and that he bozzle should he succeed in getting hold of the child would not know what to do with it bozzle was aware moreover that it was his business to find out facts and not to perform actions but his employer had become very urgent with him mr bideawhile had positively refused to move in the matter and trevelyan mad as he was had felt a disinclination to throw his affairs into the hands of a certain mr skint of stamford street whom bozzle had recommended to him as a lawyer trevelyan had hinted moreover that if bozzle would make the application in person that application if not obeyed would act with usefulness as a preliminary step for further personal measures to be taken by himself he intended to return to england for the purpose but he desired that the order for the childs rendition should be made at once therefore bozzle had come he was an earnest man and had now worked himself up to a certain degree of energy in the matter he was a man loving power and specially anxious to enforce obedience from those with whom he came in contact by the production of the laws mysterious authority in his heart he was ever tapping people on the shoulder and telling them that they were wanted thus when he displayed his document to mr outhouse he had taught himself at least to desire that that document should be obeyed  mr outhouse read the paper and turned up his nose at it you had better go away said he as he thrust it back into bozzles hand  of course i shall go away when i have the child  psha said mr outhouse  what does that mean mr houthouse i presume youll not dispute the paternal parents legal authority  go away sir said mr outhouse  go away  yesout of this house its my belief that you are a knave  a knave mr houthouse  yesa knave no one who was not a knave would lend a hand towards separating a little child from its mother i think you are a knave but i dont think you are fool enough to suppose that the child will be given up to you  its my belief that knave is hactionable said bozzlewhose respect however for the clergyman was rising fast would you mind ringing the bell mr houthouse and calling me a knave again before the young woman  go away said mr outhouse  if you have no objection sir i should be glad to see the lady before i goes  you wont see any lady here and if you dont get out of my house when i tell you ill send for a real policeman then was bozzle conquered and as he went he admitted to himself that he had sinned against all the rules of his life in attempting to go beyond the legitimate line of his profession as long as he confined himself to the getting up of facts nobody could threaten him with a real policeman but one fact he had learned today the clergyman of st diddulphs who had been represented to him as a weak foolish man was anything but that bozzle was much impressed in favour of mr outhouse and would have been glad to have done that gentleman a kindness had an opportunity come in his way  what does he want uncle oliphant said mrs trevelyan at the foot of the stairs guarding the way up to the nursery at this moment the front door had just been closed behind the back of mr bozzle  you had better ask no questions said mr outhouse  but is it about louis  yes he came about him  well of course you must tell me uncle oliphant think of my condition  he had some stupid paper in his hand from your husband but it meant nothing  he was the messenger then  yes he was the messenger but i dont suppose he expected to get anything never mind go up and look after the child then mrs trevelyan returned to her boy and mr outhouse went back to his papers  it was very hard upon him mr outhouse thoughtvery hard he was threatened with an action now and most probably would become subject to one though he had been spirited enough in presence of the enemy he was very much out of spirits at this moment though he had admitted to himself that his duty required him to protect his wifes niece he had never taken the poor woman to his heart with a loving generous feeling of true guardianship though he would not give up the child to bozzle he thoroughly wished that the child was out of his house though he called bozzle a knave and trevelyan a madman still he considered that colonel osborne was the chief sinner and that emily trevelyan had behaved badly he constantly repeated to himself the old adage that there was no smoke without fire and lamented the misfortune that had brought him into close relation with things and people that were so little to his taste he sat for awhile with a pen in his hand at the miserable little substitute for a library table which had been provided for him and strove to collect his thoughts and go on with his work but the effort was in vain bozzle would be there presenting his document and begging that the maid might be rung for in order that she might hear him called a knave and then he knew that on this very day his niece intended to hand him money which he could not refuse of what use would it be to refuse it now after it had been once taken as he could not write a word he rose and went away to his wife  if this goes on much longer said he i shall be in bedlam  my dear dont speak of it in that way  thats all very well i suppose i ought to say that i like it there has been a policeman here who is going to bring an action against me  a policeman  some one that her husband has sent for the child  the boy must not be given up oliphant  its all very well to say that but i suppose we must obey the law the parsonage of st diddulphs isnt a castle in the apennines when it comes to this that a policeman is sent here to fetch any mans child and threatens me with an action because i tell him to leave my house it is very hard upon me seeing how very little ive had to do with it its all over the parish now that my niece is kept here away from her husband and that a lover comes to see her this about the policeman will be known now of course i only say it is hard thats all the wife did all that she could to comfort him reminding him that sir marmaduke would be home soon and that then the burden would be taken from his shoulders but she was forced to admit that it was very hard     chapter liii  hugh stanbury is shewn to be no conjuror      illustration  many weeks had now passed since hugh stanbury had paid his visit to st diddulphs and nora rowley was beginning to believe that her rejection of her lover had been so firm and decided that she would never see him or hear from him more and she had long since confessed to herself that if she did not see him or hear from him soon life would not be worth a straw to her to all of us a single treasure counts for much more when the outward circumstances of our life are dull unvaried and melancholy than it does when our days are full of pleasure or excitement or even of business with nora rowley at st diddulphs life at present was very melancholy there was little or no society to enliven her her sister was sick at heart and becoming ill in health under the burden of her troubles mr outhouse was moody and wretched and mrs outhouse though she did her best to make her house comfortable to her unwelcome inmates could not make it appear that their presence there was a pleasure to her nora understood better than did her sister how distasteful the present arrangement was to their uncle and was consequently very uncomfortable on that score and in the midst of that unhappiness she of course told herself that she was a young woman miserable and unfortunate altogether it is always so with us the heart when it is burdened though it may have ample strength to bear the burden loses its buoyancy and doubts its own power it is like the springs of a carriage which are pressed flat by the superincumbent weight but because the springs are good the weight is carried safely and they are the better afterwards for their required purposes because of the trial to which they have been subjected  nora had sent her lover away and now at the end of three months from the day of his dismissal she had taught herself to believe that he would never come again amidst the sadness of her life at st diddulphs some confidence in a lover expected to come again would have done much to cheer her the more she thought of hugh stanbury the more fully she became convinced that he was the man who as a lover as a husband and as a companion would just suit all her tastes she endowed him liberally with a hundred good gifts in the disposal of which nature had been much more sparing she made for herself a mental portrait of him more gracious in its flattery than ever was canvas coming from the hand of a court limner she gave him all gifts of manliness honesty truth and energy and felt regarding him that he was a paladinsuch as paladins are in this age that he was indomitable sure of success and fitted in all respects to take the high position which he would certainly win for himself but she did not presume him to be endowed with such a constancy as would make him come to seek her hand again had nora at this time of her life been living at the westend of london and going out to parties three or four times a week she would have been quite easy about his coming the springs would not have been weighted so heavily and her heart would have been elastic  no doubt she had forgotten many of the circumstances of his visit and of his departure immediately on his going she had told her sister that he would certainly come again but had said at the same time that his coming could be of no use he was so poor a man and shethough poorer than hehad been so little accustomed to poverty of life that she had then acknowledged to herself that she was not fit to be his wife gradually as the slow weeks went by her there had come a change in her ideas she now thought that he never would come again but that if he did she would confess to him that her own views about life were changed i would tell him frankly that i could eat a crust with him in any garret in london but this was said to herselfnever to her sister emily and mrs outhouse had determined together that it would be wise to abstain from all mention of hugh stanburys name nora had felt that her sister had so abstained and this reticence had assisted in producing the despair which had come upon her hugh when he had left her had certainly given her encouragement to expect that he would return she had been sure then that he would return she had been sure of it though she had told him that it would be useless but now when these sad weeks had slowly crept over her head when during the long hours of the long days she had thought of him continuallytelling herself that it was impossible that she should ever become the wife of any man if she did not become hisshe assured herself that she had seen and heard the last of him she must surely have forgotten his hot words and that daring embrace  then there came a letter to her the question of the management of letters for young ladies is handled very differently in different houses in some establishments the post is as free to young ladies as it is to the reverend seniors of the household in others it is considered to be quite a matter of course that some experienced discretion should sit in judgment on the correspondence of the daughters of the family when nora rowley was living with her sister in curzon street she would have been very indignant indeed had it been suggested to her that there was any authority over her letters vested in her sister but now circumstanced as she was at st diddulphs she did understand that no letter would reach her without her aunt knowing that it had come all this was distasteful to heras were indeed all the details of her life at st diddulphsbut she could not help herself had her aunt told her that she should never be allowed to receive a letter at all she must have submitted till her mother had come to her relief the letter which reached her now was put into her hands by her sister but it had been given to mrs trevelyan by mrs outhouse nora said mrs trevelyan here is a letter for you i think it is from mr stanbury  give it me said nora greedily  of course i will give it you but i hope you do not intend to correspond with him  if he has written to me i shall answer him of course said nora holding her treasure  aunt mary thinks that you should not do so till papa and mamma have arrived  if aunt mary is afraid of me let her tell me so and i will contrive to go somewhere else poor nora knew that this threat was futile there was no house to which she could take herself  she is not afraid of you at all nora she only says that she thinks you should not write to mr stanbury then nora escaped to the cold but solitary seclusion of her bedroom and there she read her letter  the reader may remember that hugh stanbury when he last left st diddulphs had not been oppressed by any of the gloomy reveries of a despairing lover he had spoken his mind freely to nora and had felt himself justified in believing that he had not spoken in vain he had had her in his arms and she had found it impossible to say that she did not love him but then she had been quite firm in her purpose to give him no encouragement that she could avoid she had said no word that would justify him in considering that there was any engagement between them and moreover he had been warned not to come to the house by its mistress from day to day he thought of it all now telling himself that there was nothing to be done but to trust in her fidelity till he should be in a position to offer her a fitting home and then reflecting that he could not expect such a girl as nora rowley to wait for him unless he could succeed in making her understand that he at any rate intended to wait for her on one day he would think that good faith and proper consideration for nora herself required him to keep silent on the next he would tell himself that such maudlin chivalry as he was proposing to himself was sure to go to the wall and be neither rewarded nor recognised so at last he sat down and wrote the following letter      lincolns inn fields january 186     dearest nora     ever since i last saw you at st diddulphs i have been    trying to teach myself what i ought to do in reference    to you sometimes i think that because i am poor i ought    to hold my tongue at others i feel sure that i ought to    speak out loud because i love you so dearly you may    presume that just at this moment the latter opinion is in    the ascendant     as i do write i mean to be very bold so bold that if i am    wrong you will be thoroughly disgusted with me and will    never willingly see me again but i think it best to be    true and to say what i think i do believe that you love    me according to all precedent i ought not to say sobut    i do believe it ever since i was at st diddulphs that    belief has made me happythough there have been moments    of doubt if i thought that you did not love me i would    trouble you no further a man may win his way to love when    social circumstances are such as to throw him and the girl    together but such is not the case with us and unless you    love me now you never will love me   i doi do said nora pressing the letter to her bosom      if you do i think that you owe it me to say so and    to let me have all the joy and all the feeling of    responsibility which such an assurance will give me   i will tell him so said nora i dont care what may come afterwards but i will tell him the truth      i know continued hugh that an engagement with me now    would be hazardous because what i earn is both scanty and    precarious but it seems to me that nothing could ever    be done without some risk there are risks of different    kinds   she wondered whether he was thinking when he wrote this of the rock on which her sisters barque had been split to pieces      and we may hardly hope to avoid them all for myself    i own that life would be tame to me if there were no    dangers to be overcome     if you do love me and will say so i will not ask you    to be my wife till i can give you a proper home but the    knowledge that i am the master of the treasure which i    desire will give me a double energy and will make me feel    that when i have gained so much i cannot fail of adding to    it all other smaller things that may be necessary     praypray send me an answer i cannot reach you except    by writing as i was told by your aunt not to come to the    house again     dearest nora pray believe    that i shall always be truly yours only     hugh stanbury   write to him of course she would write to him of course she would confess to him the truth he tells me that i owe it to him to say so and i acknowledge the debt she said aloud to herself and as for a proper home he shall be the judge of that she resolved that she would not be a fine lady not fastidious not coy not afraid to take her full share of the risk of which he spoke in such manly terms it is quite true as he has been able to make me love him i have no right to stand aloofeven if i wished it as she was walking up and down the room so resolving her sister came to her  well dear said emily may i ask what it is he says  nora paused a moment holding the letter tight in her hand and then she held it out to her sister there it is you may read it mrs trevelyan took the letter and read it slowly during which nora stood looking out of the window she would not watch her sisters face as she did not wish to have to reply to any outward signs of disapproval give it me back she said when she heard by the refolding of the paper that the perusal was finished  of course i shall give it you back dear  yesthanks i did not mean to doubt you  and what will you do nora  answer it of course  i would think a little before i answered it said mrs trevelyan  i have thoughta great deal already  and how will you answer it  nora paused again before she replied as nearly as i know how to do in such words as he would put into my mouth i shall strive to write just what i think he would wish me to write  then you will engage yourself to him nora  certainly i shall i am engaged to him already i have been ever since he came here  you told me that there was nothing of the kind  i told you that i loved him better than anybody in the world and that ought to have made you know what it must come to when i am thinking of him every day and every hour how can i not be glad to have an engagement settled with him i couldnt marry anybody else and i dont want to remain as i am the tears came into the married sisters eyes and rolled down her cheeks as this was said to her would it not have been better for her had she remained as she was dear emily said nora you have got louey still  yesand they mean to take him from me but i do not wish to speak of myself will you postpone your answer till mamma is here  i cannot do that emily what receive such a letter as that and send no reply to it  i would write a line for you and explain  no indeed emily i choose to answer my own letters i have shewn you that because i trust you but i have fully made up my mind as to what i shall write it will have been written and sent before dinner  i think you will be wrong nora  why wrong when i came over here to stay with you would mamma ever have thought of directing me not to accept any offer till her consent had been obtained all the way from the mandarins she would never have dreamed of such a thing  will you ask aunt mary  certainly not what is aunt mary to me we are here in her house for a time under the press of circumstances but i owe her no obedience she told mr stanbury not to come here and he has not come and i shall not ask him to come i would not willingly bring any one into uncle oliphants house that he and she do not wish to see but i will not admit that either of them have any authority over me  then who has dearest  nobodyexcept papa and mamma and they have chosen to leave me to myself  mrs trevelyan found it impossible to shake her sisters firmness and could herself do nothing except tell mrs outhouse what was the state of affairs when she said that she should do this there almost came to be a flow of high words between the two sisters but at last nora assented as for knowing i dont care if all the world knows it i shall do nothing in a corner i dont suppose aunt mary will endeavour to prevent my posting my letter  emily at last went to seek mrs outhouse and nora at once sat down to her desk neither of the sisters felt at all sure that mrs outhouse would not attempt to stop the emission of the letter from her house but as it happened she was out and did not return till nora had come back from her journey to the neighbouring postoffice she would trust her letter when written to no hands but her own and as she herself dropped it into the safe custody of the postmastergeneral it also shall be revealed to the public      parsonage st diddulphs january 186     dear hugh     for i suppose i may as well write to you in that way now    i have been made so happy by your affectionate letter is    not that a candid confession for a young lady but you    tell me that i owe you the truth and so i tell you the    truth nobody will ever be anything to me except you and    you are everything i do love you and should it ever be    possible i will become your wife     i have said so much because i feel that i ought to obey    the order you have given me but pray do not try to see me    or write to me till mamma has arrived she and papa will    be here in the springquite early in the spring we    hope and then you may come to us what they may say of    course i cannot tell but i shall be true to you     your own with truest affection     nora     of course you knew that i loved you and i dont think    that you are a conjuror at all      illustration noras letter   as soon as ever the letter was written she put on her bonnet and went forth with it herself to the postoffice mrs trevelyan stopped her on the stairs and endeavoured to detain her but nora would not be detained i must judge for myself about this she said if mamma were here it would be different but as she is not here i must judge for myself  what mrs outhouse might have done had she been at home at the time it would be useless to surmise she was told what had happened when it occurred and questioned nora on the subject i thought i understood from you she said with something of severity in her countenance that there was to be nothing between you and mr stanburyat any rate till my brother came home  i never pledged myself to anything of the kind aunt mary nora said i think he promised that he would not come here and i dont suppose that he means to come if he should do so i shall not see him  with this mrs outhouse was obliged to be content the letter was gone and could not be stopped nor indeed had any authority been delegated to her by which she would have been justified in stopping it she could only join her husband in wishing that they both might be relieved as soon as possible from the terrible burden which had been thrown upon them i call it very hard said mr outhousevery hard indeed if we were to desire them to leave the house everybody would cry out upon us for our cruelty and yet while they remain here they will submit themselves to no authority as far as i can see they may both of them do just what they please and we cant stop it     chapter liv  mr gibsons threat   miss stanbury for a long time persisted in being neither better nor worse sir peter would not declare her state to be precarious nor would he say that she was out of danger and mr martin had been so utterly prostrated by the nearlyfatal effects of his own mistake that he was quite unable to rally himself and talk on the subject with any spirit or confidence when interrogated he would simply reply that sir peter said this and sir peter said that and thus add to rather than diminish the doubt and excitement and varied opinion which prevailed through the city on one morning it was absolutely asserted within the limits of the close that miss stanbury was dyingand it was believed for half a day at the bank that she was then lying in articulo mortis there had got about too a report that a portion of the property had only been left to miss stanbury for her life that the burgesses would be able to reclaim the houses in the city and that a will had been made altogether in favour of dorothy cutting out even brooke from any share in the inheritanceand thus exeter had a good deal to say respecting the affairs and state of health of our old friend miss stanburys illness however was true enough she was much too ill to hear anything of what was going ontoo ill to allow martha to talk to her at all about the outside public when the invalid herself would ask questions about the affairs of the world martha would be very discreet and turn away from the subject miss stanbury for instance ill as she was exhibited a most mundane interest not exactly in camilla frenchs marriage but in the delay which that marriage seemed destined to encounter i dare say hell slip out of it yet said the sick lady to her confidential servant then martha had thought it right to change the subject feeling it to be wrong that an old lady on her deathbed should be taking joy in the disappointment of her young neighbour martha changed the subject first to jelly and then to the psalms of the day miss stanbury was too weak to resist but the last verse of the last psalm of the evening had hardly been finished before she remarked that she would never believe it till she saw it its all in the hands of him as is on high mum said martha turning her eyes up to the ceiling and closing the book at the same time with a look strongly indicative of displeasure  miss stanbury understood it all as well as though she were in perfect health she knew her own failings was conscious of her worldly tendencies and perceived that her old servant was thinking of it and then sundry odd thoughts halfdigested thoughts ideas too difficult for her present strength crossed her brain had it been wicked of her when she was well to hope that a scheming woman should not succeed in betraying a man by her schemes into an illassorted marriage and if not wicked then was it wicked now because she was ill and from that thought her mind travelled on to the ordinary practices of deathbed piety could an assumed devotion be of use to her nowsuch a devotion as martha was enjoining upon her from hour to hour in pure and affectionate solicitude for her soul she had spoken one evening of a game of cards saying that a game of cribbage would have consoled her then martha with a shudder had suggested a hymn and had had recourse at once to a sleeping draught miss stanbury had submitted but had understood it all if cards were wicked she had indeed been a terrible sinner what hope could there be now on her deathbed for one so sinful and she could not repent of her cards and would not try to repent of them not seeing the evil of them and if they were innocent why should she not have the consolation nowwhen she so much wanted it yet she knew that the whole household even dorothy would be in arms against her were she to suggest such a thing she took the hymn and the sleeping draught telling herself that it would be best for her to banish such ideas from her mind pastors and masters had laid down for her a mode of living which she had followed but indifferently perhaps but still with an intention of obedience they had also laid down a mode of dying and it would be well that she should follow that as closely as possible she would say nothing more about cards she would think nothing more of camilla french but as she so resolved with intellect half asleep with her mind wandering between fact and dream she was unconsciously comfortable with an assurance that if mr gibson did marry camilla french camilla french would lead him the very devil of a life  during three days dorothy went about the house as quiet as a mouse sitting nightly at her aunts bedside and tending the sick woman with the closest care she too had been now and again somewhat startled by the seeming worldliness of her aunt in her illness her aunt talked to her about rents and gave her messages for brooke burgess on subjects which seemed to dorothy to be profane when spoken of on what might perhaps be a deathbed and this struck her the more strongly because she had a matter of her own on which she would have much wished to ascertain her aunts opinion if she had not thought that it would have been exceedingly wrong of her to trouble her aunts mind at such a time by any such matter hitherto she had said not a word of brookes proposal to any living being at present it was a secret with herself but a secret so big that it almost caused her bosom to burst with the load that it bore she could not she thought write to priscilla till she had told her aunt if she were to write a word on the subject to any one she could not fail to make manifest the extreme longing of her own heart she could not have written brookes name on paper in reference to his words to herself without covering it with epithets of love but all that must be known to no one if her love was to be of no avail to her and she had an idea that her aunt would not wish brooke to marry herwould think that brooke should do better and she was quite clear that in such a matter as this her aunts wishes must be law had not her aunt the power of disinheriting brooke altogether and what then if her aunt should dieshould die nowleaving brooke at liberty to do as he pleased there was something so distasteful to her in this view of the matter that she would not look at it she would not allow herself to think of any success which might possibly accrue to herself by reason of her aunts death intense as was the longing in her heart for permission from those in authority over her to give herself to brooke burgess perfect as was the earthly paradise which appeared to be open to her when she thought of the good thing which had befallen her in that matter she conceived that she would be guilty of the grossest ingratitude were she in any degree to curtail even her own estimate of her aunts prohibitory powers because of her aunts illness the remembrance of the words which brooke had spoken to her was with her quite perfect she was entirely conscious of the joy which would be hers if she might accept those words as properly sanctioned but she was a creature in her aunts handsaccording to her own ideas of her own duties and while her aunt was ill she could not even learn what might be the behests which she would be called on to obey  she was sitting one evening alone thinking of all this having left martha with her aunt and was trying to reconcile the circumstances of her life as it now existed with the circumstances as they had been with her in the old days at nuncombe putney wondering at herself in that she should have a lover and trying to convince herself that for her this little episode of romance could mean nothing serious when martha crept down into the room to her of late daysthe alteration might perhaps be dated from the rejection of mr gibsonmartha who had always been very kind had become more respectful in her manner to dorothy than had heretofore been usual with her dorothy was quite aware of it and was not unconscious of a certain rise in the world which was thereby indicated if you please miss said martha who do you think is here  but there is nobody with my aunt said dorothy  she is sleeping like a babby and i came down just for a moment mr gibson is here missin the house he asked for your aunt and when of course he could not see her he asked for you dorothy for a few minutes was utterly disconcerted but at last she consented to see mr gibson i think it is best said martha because it is bad to be fighting and missus so ill blessed are the peacemakers miss for they shall be called the children of god convinced by this argument or by the working of her own mind dorothy directed that mr gibson might be shewn into the room when he came she found herself unable to address him she remembered the last time in which she had seen him and was lost in wonder that he should be there but she shook hands with him and went through some form of greeting in which no word was uttered  i hope you will not think that i have done wrong said he in calling to ask after my old friends state of health  oh dear no said dorothy quite bewildered  i have known her for so very long miss dorothy that now in the hour of her distress and perhaps mortal malady i cannot stop to remember the few harsh words that she spoke to me lately  she never means to be harsh mr gibson  ah well noperhaps not at any rate i have learned to forgive and forget i am afraid your aunt is very ill miss dorothy  she is ill certainly mr gibson  dear dear we are all as the grass of the field miss dorothyhere today and gone tomorrow as sparks fly upwards just fit to be cut down and cast into the oven mr jennings has been with her i believe mr jennings was the other minor canon  he comes three times a week mr gibson  he is an excellent young mana very good young man it has been a great comfort to me to have jennings with me but hes very young miss dorothy isnt he dorothy muttered something purporting to declare that she was not acquainted with the exact circumstances of mr jennings age i should be so glad to come if my old friend would allow me said mr gibson almost with a sigh dorothy was clearly of opinion that any change at the present would be bad for her aunt but she did not know how to express her opinion so she stood silent and looked at him there neednt be a word spoken you know about the ladies at heavitree said mr gibson  oh dear no said dorothy and yet she knew well that there would be such words spoken if mr gibson were to make his way into her aunts room her aunt was constantly alluding to the ladies at heavitree in spite of all the efforts of her old servant to restrain her  there was some little misunderstanding said mr gibson but all that should be over now we both intended for the best miss dorothy and im sure nobody here can say that i wasnt sincere but dorothy though she could not bring herself to answer mr gibson plainly could not be induced to assent to his proposition she muttered something about her aunts weakness and the great attention which mr jennings shewed her aunt had become very fond of mr jennings and she did at last express her opinion with some clearness that her aunt should not be disturbed by any changes at present after that i should not think of pressing it miss dorothy said mr gibson but still i do hope that i may have the privilege of seeing her yet once again in the flesh and touching my approaching marriage miss dorothy he paused and dorothy felt that she was blushing up to the roots of her hair touching my marriage continued mr gibson which however will not be solemnized till the end of marchit was manifest that he regarded this as a point that would in that household be regarded as an argument in his favouri do hope that you will look upon it in the most favourable lightand your excellent aunt also if she be spared to us  i am sure we hope that you will be happy mr gibson  what was i to do miss dorothy i know that i have been very much blamedbut so unfairly i have never meant to be untrue to a mouse miss dorothy dorothy did not at all understand whether she were the mouse or camilla french or arabella and it is so hard to find that one is illspoken of because things have gone a little amiss it was quite impossible that dorothy should make any answer to this and at last mr gibson left her assuring her with his last word that nothing would give him so much pleasure as to be called upon once more to see his old friend in her last moments  though miss stanbury had been described as sleeping like a babby she had heard the footsteps of a strange man in the house and had made martha tell her whose footsteps they were as soon as dorothy went to her she darted upon the subject with all her old keenness what did he want here dolly  he said he would like to see you auntwhen you are a little better you know he spoke a good deal of his old friendship and respect  he should have thought of that before how am i to see people now  but when you are better aunt  how do i know that i shall ever be better he isnt off with those people at heavitreeis he  i hope not aunt  psha a poor weak insufficient creaturethats what he is mr jennings is worth twenty of him dorothy though she put the question again in its most alluring form of christian charity and forgiveness could not induce her aunt to say that she would see mr gibson how can i see him when you know that sir peter has forbidden me to see anybody except mrs clifford and mr jennings  two days afterwards there was an uncomfortable little scene at heavitree it must no doubt have been the case that the same train of circumstances which had produced mr gibsons visit to the close produced also the scene in question it was suggested by some who were attending closely to the matter that mr gibson had already come to repent his engagement with camilla french and indeed there were those who pretended to believe that he was induced by the prospect of miss stanburys demise to transfer his allegiance yet again and to bestow his hand upon dorothy at last there were many in the city who could never be persuaded that dorothy had refused himthese being for the most part ladies in whose estimation the value of a husband was counted so great and a beneficed clergyman so valuable among suitors that it was to their thinking impossible that dorothy stanbury should in her sound senses have rejected such an offer i dont believe a bit of it said mrs crumbie to mrs apjohn is it likely the ears of all the french family were keenly alive to rumours and to rumours of rumours reports of these opinions respecting mr gibson reached heavitree and had their effect as long as mr gibson was behaving well as a suitor they were inoperative there what did it matter to them how the prize might have been struggled formight still be struggled for elsewhere while they enjoyed the consciousness of possession but when the consciousness of possession became marred by a cankerous doubt such rumours were very important camilla heard of the visit in the close and swore that she would have justice done her she gave her mother to understand that if any trick were played upon her the diocese should be made to ring of it in a fashion that would astonish them all from the bishop downwards whereupon mrs french putting much faith in her daughters threats sent for mr gibson  the truth is mr gibson said mrs french when the civilities of their first greeting had been completed my poor child is pining  pining mrs french  yespining mr gibson i am afraid that you little understand how sensitive is that young heart of course she is your own now to her thinking it would be treason to you for her to indulge in conversation with any other gentleman but then she expects that you should spend your evenings with herof course  but mrs frenchthink of my engagements as a clergyman  we know all about that mr gibson we know what a clergymans calls are it isnt like a doctors mr gibson  its very often worse mrs french  why should you go calling in the close mr gibson here was the gist of the accusation  wouldnt you have me make my peace with a poor dying sister pleaded mr gibson  after what has occurred said mrs french shaking her head at him and while things are just as they are now it would be more like an honest man of you to stay away and of course camilla feels it she feels it very muchand she wont put up with it neither  i think this is the cruellest cruellest thing i ever heard said mr gibson  it is you that are cruel sir  then the wretched man turned at bay i tell you what it is mrs frenchif i am treated in this way i wont stand it i wont indeed ill go away im not going to be suspected nor yet blown up i think ive behaved handsomely at any rate to camilla  quite so mr gibson if you would come and see her on evenings said mrs french who was falling back into her usual state of timidity  but if im to be treated in this way i will go away ive thought of it as it is ive been already invited to go to natal and if i hear anything more of these accusations i shall certainly make up my mind to go then he left the house before camilla could be down upon him from her perch on the landingplace     chapter lv  the republican browning   mr glascock had returned to naples after his sufferings in the diningroom of the american minister and by the middle of february was back again in florence his father was still alive and it was said that the old lord would now probably live through the winter and it was understood that mr glascock would remain in italy he had declared that he would pass his time between naples rome and florence but it seemed to his friends that florence was of the three the most to his taste he liked his room he said at the york hotel and he liked being in the capital that was his own statement his friends said that he liked being with carry spalding the daughter of the american minister but none of them then in italy were sufficiently intimate with him to express that opinion to himself  it had been expressed more than once to carry spalding the world in general says such things to ladies more openly than it does to men and the probability of a girls success in matrimony is canvassed in her hearing by those who are nearest to her with a freedom which can seldom be used in regard to a man a mans most intimate friend hardly speaks to him of the prospect of his marriage till he himself has told that the engagement exists the lips of no living person had suggested to mr glascock that the american girl was to become his wife but a great deal had been said to carry spalding about the conquest she had made her uncle her aunt her sister and her great friend miss petrie the poetessthe republican browning as she was calledhad all spoken to her about it frequently olivia had declared her conviction that the thing was to be miss petrie had with considerable eloquence explained to her friend that that english title which was but the clatter of a sounding brass should be regarded as a drawback rather than as an advantage mrs spalding who was no poetess would undoubtedly have welcomed mr glascock as her nieces husband with all an aunts energy when told by miss petrie that old lord peterborough was a tinkling cymbal she snapped angrily at her gifted countrywoman but she was too honest a woman and too conscious also of her nieces strength to say a word to urge her on mr spalding as an american minister with full powers at the court of a european sovereign felt that he had full as much to give as to receive but he was well inclined to do both he would have been much pleased to talk about his nephew lord peterborough and he loved his niece dearly but by the middle of february he was beginning to think that the matter had been long enough in training if the honourable glascock meant anything why did he not speak out his mind plainly the american minister in such matters was accustomed to fewer ambages than were common in the circles among which mr glascock had lived  in the meantime caroline spalding was suffering she had allowed herself to think that mr glascock intended to propose to her and had acknowledged to herself that were he to do so she would certainly accept him all that she had seen of him since the day on which he had been courteous to her about the seat in the diligence had been pleasant to her she had felt the charm of his manner his education and his gentleness and had told herself that with all her love for her own country she would willingly become an englishwoman for the sake of being that mans wife but nevertheless the warnings of her great friend the poetess had not been thrown away upon her she would put away from herself as far as she could any desire to become lady peterborough there should be no bias in the mans favour on that score the tinkling cymbal and the sounding brass should be nothing to her but yetyet what a chance was there here for her they are dishonest and rotten at the core said miss petrie trying to make her friend understand that a free american should under no circumstances place trust in an english aristocrat their country carry is a game played out while we are still breasting the hill with our young lungs full of air carry spalding was proud of her intimacy with the republican browning but nevertheless she liked mr glascock and when mr glascock had been ten days in florence on his third visit to the city and had been four or five times at the embassy without expressing his intentions in the proper form carry spalding began to think that she had better save herself from a heartbreak while salvation might be within her reach she perceived that her uncle was gloomy and almost angry when he spoke of mr glascock and that her aunt was fretful with disappointment the republican browning had uttered almost a note of triumph and had it not been that olivia persisted carry spalding would have consented to go away with miss petrie to rome the old stones are rotten too said the poetess but their dust tells no lies that well known piece of hersancient marbles while ye crumble was written at this time and contained an occult reference to mr glascock and her friend  but livy spalding clung to the alliance she probably knew her sisters heart better than did the others and perhaps also had a clearer insight into mr glascocks character she was at any rate clearly of opinion that there should be no running away either you do like him or you dont if you do what are you to get by going to rome said livy  i shall get quit of doubt and trouble  i call that cowardice i would never run away from a man carry aunt sophie forgets that they dont manage these things in england just as we do  i dont know why there should be a difference  nor do ionly that there is you havent read so many of their novels as i have  who would ever think of learning to live out of an english novel said carry  i am not saying that you may teach him to live how you like afterwards but if you have anything to do with people it must be well to know what their manners are i think the richer sort of people in england slide into these things more gradually than we do you stand your ground carry and hold your own and take the goods the gods provide you though caroline spalding opposed her sisters arguments and was particularly hard upon that allusion to the richer sort of peoplewhich as she knew miss petrie would have regarded as evidence of reverence for sounding brasses and tinkling cymbalsnevertheless she loved livy dearly for what she said and kissed the sweet counsellor and resolved that she would for the present decline the invitation of the poetess then was miss petrie somewhat indignant with her friend and threw out her scorn in those lines which have been mentioned  but the american minister hardly knew how to behave himself when he met mr glascock or even when he was called upon to speak of him florence no doubt is a large city and is now the capital of a great kingdom but still people meet in florence much more frequently than they do in paris or in london it may almost be said that they whose habit it is to go into society and whose circumstances bring them into the same circles will see each other every day now the american minister delighted to see and to be seen in all places frequented by persons of a certain rank and position in florence having considered the matter much he had convinced himself that he could thus best do his duty as minister from the great republic of free states to the newest andas he called itthe freeest of the european kingdoms the minister from france was a marquis he from england was an earl from spain had come a countand so on in the domestic privacy of his embassy mr spalding would be severe enough upon the sounding brasses and the tinkling cymbals and was quite content himself to be the honourable jonas g spaldinghonourable because selected by his country for a post of honour but he liked to be heard among the cymbals and seen among the brasses and to feel that his position was as high as theirs mr glascock also was frequently in the same circles and thus it came to pass that the two gentlemen saw each other almost daily that mr spalding knew well how to bear himself in his high place no one could doubt but he did not quite know how to carry himself before mr glascock at home at boston he would have been more completely master of the situation  he thought too that he began to perceive that mr glascock avoided him though he would hear on his return home that that gentleman had been at the embassy or had been walking in the cascine with his nieces that their young ladies should walk in public places with unmarried gentlemen is nothing to american fathers and guardians american young ladies are accustomed to choose their own companions but the minister was tormented by his doubts as to the ways of englishmen and as to the phase in which english habits might most properly exhibit themselves in italy he knew that people were talking about mr glascock and his niece why then did mr glascock avoid him it was perhaps natural that mr spalding should have omitted to observe that mr glascock was not delighted by those lectures on the american constitution which formed so large a part of his ordinary conversation with englishmen  it happened one afternoon that they were thrown together so closely for nearly an hour that neither could avoid the other they were both at the old palace in which the italian parliament is held and were kept waiting during some long delay in the ceremonies of the place they were seated next to each other and during such delay there was nothing for them but to talk on the other side of each of them was a stranger and not to talk in such circumstances would be to quarrel mr glascock began by asking after the ladies  they are quite well sir thank you said the minister i hope that lord peterborough was pretty well when last you heard from naples mr glascock mr glascock explained that his fathers condition was not much altered and then there was silence for a moment  your nieces will remain with you through the spring i suppose said mr glascock  such is their intention sir  they seem to like florence i think  yesyes i think they do like florence they see this capital sir perhaps under more favourable circumstances than are accorded to most of my countrywomen our republican simplicity mr glascock has this drawback that away from home it subjects us somewhat to the cold shade of unobserved obscurity that it possesses merits which much more than compensate for this trifling evil i should be the last man in europe to deny it is to be observed that american citizens are always prone to talk of europe it affords the best counterpoise they know to that other term americaand america and the united states are of course the same to speak of france or of england as weighing equally against their own country seems to an american to be an absurdityand almost an insult to himself with europe he can compare himself but even this is done generally in the style of the republican browning when she addressed the ancient marbles  undoubtedly said mr glascock the family of a minister abroad has great advantages in seeing the country to which he is accredited  that is my meaning sir but as i was remarking we carry with us as a people no external symbols of our standing at home the wives and daughters sir of the most honoured of our citizens have no nomenclature different from that which belongs to the least noted among us it is perhaps a consequence of this that europeans who are accustomed in their social intercourse to the assistance of titles will not always trouble themselves to inquire who and what are the american citizens who may sit opposite to them at table i have known mr glascock the wife and daughter of a gentleman who has been thrice sent as senator from his native state to washington to remain as disregarded in the intercourse of a european city as though they had formed part of the family of some grocer from your russell square  let the miss spaldings go where they will said mr glascock they will not fare in that way  the miss spaldings sir are very much obliged to you said the minister with a bow  i regard it as one of the luckiest chances of my life that i was thrown in with them at st michael as i was said mr glascock with something like warmth  i am sure sir they will never forget the courtesy displayed by you on that occasion said the minister bowing again  that was a matter of course i and my friend would have done the same for the grocers wife and daughter of whom you spoke little services such as that do not come from appreciation of merit but are simply the payment of the debt due by all men to all women  such is certainly the rule of living in our country sir said mr spalding  the chances are continued the englishman that no further observation follows the payment of such a debt it has been a thing of course  we delight to think it so mr glascock in our own cities  but in this instance it has given rise to one of the pleasantest and as i hope most enduring friendships that i have ever formed said mr glascock with enthusiasm what could the american minister do but bow again three times and what other meaning could he attach to such words than that which so many of his friends had been attributing to mr glascock for some weeks past it had occurred to mr spalding even since he had been sitting in his present close proximity to mr glascock that it might possibly be his duty as an uncle having to deal with an englishman to ask that gentleman what were his intentions he would do his duty let it be what it might but the asking of such a question would be very disagreeable to him for the present he satisfied himself with inviting his neighbour to come and drink tea with mrs spalding on the next evening but one the girls will be delighted i am sure said he thinking himself to be justified in this friendly familiarity by mr glascocks enthusiasm for mr spalding was clearly of opinion that let the value of republican simplicity be what it might an alliance with the crumbling marbles of europe would in his nieces circumstances be not inexpedient mr glascock accepted the invitation with alacrity and the minister when he was closeted with his wife that evening declared his opinion that after all the britisher meant fighting the aunt told the girls that mr glascock was coming and in order that it might not seem that a net was being specially spread for him others were invited to join the party miss petrie consented to be there and the italian count buonarosci to whose presence though she could not speak to him mrs spalding was becoming accustomed it was painful to her to feel that she could not communicate with those around her and for that reason she would have avoided italians but she had an idea that she could not thoroughly realise the advantages of foreign travel unless she lived with foreigners and therefore she was glad to become intimate at any rate with the outside of count buonarosci  i think your uncle is wrong dear said miss petrie early in the day to her friend  but why he has done nothing more than what is just civil  if mr glascock kept a store in broadway he would not have thought it necessary to shew the same civility  yesif we all liked the mr glascock who kept the store  caroline said the poetess with severe eloquence can you put your hand upon your heart and say that this inherited title this tinkling cymbal as i call it has no attraction for you or yours is it the unadorned simple man that you welcome to your bosom or a thing of stars and garters a patch of parchment the minion of a throne the lordling of twenty descents in which each has been weaker than that before it the hero of a scutcheon whose glory is in his quarterings and whose worldly wealth comes from the sweat of serfs whom the euphonism of an effete country has learned to decorate with the name of tenants  but caroline spalding had a spirit of her own and had already made up her mind that she would not be talked down by miss petrie uncle jonas said she asks him because we like him and would do so too if he kept the store in broadway but if he did keep the store perhaps we should not like him  i trow not said miss petrie  livy was much more comfortable in her tactics and without consulting anybody sent for a hairdresser its all very well for wallachia said livymiss petries name was wallachiabut i know a nice sort of man when i see him and the ways of the world are not to be altered because wally writes poetry  when mr glascock was announced mrs spaldings handsome rooms were almost filled as rooms in florence are filledobstruction in every avenue a crowd in every corner and a block at every doorway not being among the customs of the place mr spalding immediately caught himintercepting him between the passages and the ladiesand engaged him at once in conversation  your john s mill is a great man said the minister  they tell me so said mr glascock i dont read what he writes myself  this acknowledgment seemed to the minister to be almost disgraceful and yet he himself had never read a word of mr mills writings he is a farseeing man continued the minister he is one of the few europeans who can look forward and see how the rivers of civilization are running on he has understood that women must at last be put upon an equality with men  can he manage that men shall have half the babies said mr glascock thinking to escape by an attempt at playfulness  but the minister was down upon him at oncehad him by the lappet of his coat though he knew how important it was for his dear niece that he should allow mr glascock to amuse himself this evening after another fashion i have an answer ready sir for that difficulty he said step aside with me for a moment the question is important and i should be glad if you would communicate my ideas to your great philosopher nature sir has laid down certain laws which are immutable and against them  but mr glascock had not come to florence for this there were circumstances in his present position which made him feel that he would be gratified in escaping even at the cost of some seeming incivility i must go in to the ladies at once he said or i shall never get a word with them there came across the ministers brow a momentary frown of displeasure as though he felt that he were being robbed of that which was justly his own for an instant his grasp fixed itself more tightly to the coat it was quite within the scope of his courage to hold a struggling listener by physical strengthbut he remembered that there was a purpose and he relaxed his hold  i will take another opportunity said the minister as you have raised that somewhat trite objection of the bearing of children which we in our country sir have altogether got over i must put you in possession of my views on that subject but i will find another occasion then mr glascock began to reflect whether an american lady married in england would probably want to see much of her uncle in her adopted country  mrs spalding was all smiles when her guest reached her we did not mean to have such a crowd of people she said whispering but you know how one thing leads to another and people here really like short invitations then the ministers wife bowed very low to an italian lady and for the moment wished herself in beacon street it was a great trouble to her that she could not pluck up courage to speak a word in italian i know more about it than some that are glib enough she would say to her niece livy but these tuscans are so particular with their bocca toscana  it was almost spiteful on the part of miss petriethe manner in which on this evening she remained close to her friend caroline spalding it is hardly possible to believe that it came altogether from high principlefrom a determination to save her friend from an impending danger ones friend has no right to decide for one what is and what is not dangerous mr glascock after awhile found himself seated on a fixed couch that ran along the wall between carry spalding and miss petrie but miss petrie was almost as bad to him as had been the minister himself i am afraid she said looking up into his face with some severity and rushing upon her subject with audacity that the works of your browning have not been received in your country with that veneration to which they are entitled  do you mean mr or mrs browning asked mr glascockperhaps with some mistaken idea that the lady was out of her depth and did not know the difference  eitherboth for they are one the same and indivisible the spirit and germ of each is so reflected in the outcome of the other that one sees only the result of so perfect a combination and one is tempted to acknowledge that here and there a marriage may have been arranged in heaven i dont think that in your country you have perceived this mr glascock  i am not quite sure that we have said mr glascock  yours is not altogether an inglorious mission continued miss petrie  ive got no mission said mr glascockeither from the foreign office or from my own inner convictions  miss petrie laughed with a scornful laugh i spoke sir of the mission of that small speck on the earths broad surface of which you think so much and which we call great britain  i do think a good deal of it said mr glascock  it has been more thought of than any other speck of the same size said carry spalding  true said miss petrie sharplybecause of its iron and coal but the mission i spoke of was this and she put forth her hand with an artistic motion as she spoke it utters prophecies though it cannot read them it sends forth truth though it cannot understand it though its own ears are deaf as adders it is the nursery of poets who sing not for their own countrymen but for the higher sensibilities and newer intelligences of lands in which philanthropy has made education as common as the air that is breathed  wally said olivia coming up to the poetess in anger that was almost apparent i want to take you and introduce you to the marchesa pulti  but miss petrie no doubt knew that the eldest son of an english lord was at least as good as an italian marchesa let her come here said the poetess with her grandest smile     chapter lvi  withered grass      illustration  when caroline spalding perceived how direct an attempt had been made by her sister to take the poetess away in order that she might thus be left alone with mr glascock her spirit revolted against the manoeuvre and she took herself away amidst the crowd if mr glascock should wish to find her again he could do so and there came across her mind something of a halfformed idea that perhaps after all her friend wallachia was right were this man ready to take her and she ready to be taken would such an arrangement be a happy one for both of them his highborn wealthy friends might very probably despise her and it was quite possible that she also might despise them to be lady peterborough and have the spending of a large fortune would not suffice for her happiness she was sure of that it would be a leap in the dark and all such leaps must needs be dangerous and therefore should be avoided but she did like the man her friend was untrue to her and cruel in those allusions to tinkling cymbals it might be well for her to get over her liking and to think no more of one who was to her a foreigner and a strangerof whose ways of living in his own home she knew so little whose people might be antipathetic to her enemies instead of friends among whom her life would be one long misery but it was not on that ground that miss petrie had recommended her to start for rome as soon as mr glascock had reached florence there is no reason she said to herself why i should not marry a man if i like him even though he be a lord and of him i should not be the least afraid its the women that i fear and then she called to mind all that she had ever heard of english countesses and duchesses she thought that she knew that they were generally cold and proud and very little given to receive outsiders graciously within their ranks mr glascock had an aunt who was a duchess and a sister who would be a countess caroline spalding felt how her back would rise against these new relations if it should come to pass that they should look unkindly upon her when she was taken to her own homehow she would fight with them giving them scorn for scorn how unutterably miserable she would be how she would long to be back among her own equals in spite even of her love for her husband how grand a thing it is she said to be equal with those whom you love and yet she was to some extent allured by the social position of the man she could perceive that he had a charm of manner which her countrymen lacked he had read perhaps less than her uncleknew perhaps less than most of those men with whom she had been wont to associate in her own city life at homewas not braver or more virtuous or more selfdenying than they but there was a softness and an ease in his manner which was palatable to her and an absence of that too visible effort of the intellect which is so apt to mark and mar the conversation of americans she almost wished that she had been english in order that the mans home and friends might have suited her she was thinking of all this as she stood pretending to talk to an american lady who was very eloquent on the delights of florence  in the meantime olivia and mr glascock had moved away together and miss petrie was left alone this was no injury to miss petrie as her mind at once set itself to work on a sonnet touching the frivolity of modern social gatherings and when she complained afterwards to caroline that it was the curse of their mode of life that no moment could be allowed for thoughtin which she referred specially to a few words that mr gore had addressed to her at this moment of her meditationsshe was not wilfully a hypocrite she was painfully turning her second set of rhymes and really believed that she had been subjected to a hardship in the meantime olivia and mr glascock were discussing her at a distance  you were being put through your facings mr glascock olivia had said  well yes and your dear friend miss petrie is rather a stern examiner  she is carrys ally not mine said olivia then she remembered that by saying this she might be doing her sister an injury mr glascock might object to such a bosom friend for his wife that is to say of course we are all intimate with her but just at this moment carry is most in favour  she is very clever i am quite sure said he  oh yesshes a genius you must not doubt that on the peril of making every american in italy your enemy  she is a poetis she not  mr glascock  have i said anything wrong he asked  do you mean to look me in the face and tell me that you are not acquainted with her worksthat you dont know pages of them by heart that you dont sleep with them under your pillow dont travel about with them in your dressingbag im afraid we have mistaken you mr glascock  is it so great a sin  if youll own up honestly ill tell you somethingin a whisper you have not read a word of her poems  not a word  neither have i isnt it horrible but perhaps if i heard tennyson talking every day i shouldnt read tennyson familiarity does breed contemptdoesnt it and then poor dear wallachia is such a bore i sometimes wonder when english people are listening to her whether they think that american girls generally talk like that  not all perhaps with that perfected eloquence  i dare say you do continued olivia craftily that is just the way in which people form their opinions about foreigners some specially selfasserting american speaks his mind louder than other people and then you say that all americans are selfasserting  but you are a little that way given miss spalding  because we are always called upon to answer accusations against us expressed or unexpressed we dont think ourselves a bit better than you or if the truth were known half as good we are always struggling to be as polished and easy as the french or as sensible and dignified as the english but when our defects are thrown in our teeth  who throws them in your teeth miss spalding  you look itall of youif you do not speak it out you do assume a superiority mr glascock and that we cannot endure  i do not feel that i assume anything said mr glascock meekly  if three gentlemen be together an englishman a frenchman and an american is not the american obliged to be on his mettle to prove that he is somebody among the three i admit that he is always claiming to be the first but he does so only that he may not be too evidently the last if you knew us mr glascock you would find us to be very mild and humble and nice and good and clever and kind and charitable and beautifulin short the finest people that have as yet been created on the broad face of gods smiling earth these last words she pronounced with a nasal twang and in a tone of voice which almost seemed to him to be a direct mimicry of the american minister the upshot of the conversation however was that the disgust against americans which to a certain degree had been excited in mr glascocks mind by the united efforts of mr spalding and the poetess had been almost entirely dispelled from all of which the reader ought to understand that miss olivia spalding was a very clever young woman  but nevertheless mr glascock had not quite made up his mind to ask the elder sister to be his wife he was one of those men to whom lovemaking does not come very easy although he was never so much at his ease as when he was in company with ladies he was sorely in want of a wife but he was aware that at different periods during the last fifteen years he had been angled for as a fish mothers in england had tried to catch him and of such mothers he had come to have the strongest possible detestation he had seen the hooksor perhaps had fancied that he saw them when they were not there lady janes and lady sarahs had been hard upon him till he learned to buckle himself into triple armour when he went amongst them and yet he wanted a wifeno man more sorely wanted one the reader will perhaps remember how he went down to nuncombe putney in quest of a wife but all in vain the lady in that case had been so explicit with him that he could not hope for a more favourable answer and indeed he would not have cared to marry a girl who had told him that she preferred another man to himself even if it had been possible for him to do so now he had met a lady very different from those with whom he had hitherto associatedbut not the less manifestly a lady caroline spalding was bright pleasant attractive very easy to talk to and yet quite able to hold her own but the american minister wasa bore and miss petrie wasunbearable he had often told himself that in this matter of marrying a wife he would please himself altogether that he would allow himself to be tied down by no consideration of family pridethat he would consult nothing but his own heart and feelings as for rank he could give that to his wife as for money he had plenty of that also he wanted a woman that was not blasée with the world that was not a fool and who would respect him the more he thought of it the more sure he was that he had seen none who pleased him so well as caroline spalding and yet he was a little afraid of taking a step that would be irrevocable perhaps the american minister might express a wish to end his days at monkhams and might think it desirable to have miss petrie always with him as a private secretary in poetry  between you and us mr glascock the spark of sympathy does not pass with a strong flash said a voice in his ear as he turned round rapidly to face his foe he was quite sure for the moment that under no possible circumstances would he ever take an american woman to his bosom as his wife  no said he no no i rather think that i agree with you  the antipathy is one continued miss petrie which has been common on the face of the earth since the clown first trod upon the courtiers heels it is the instinct of fallen man to hate equality to desire ascendancy to crush to oppress to tyrannise to enslave then when the slave is at last free and in his freedom demandsequality man is not great enough to take his enfranchised brother to his bosom  you mean negroes said mr glascock looking round and planning for himself a mode of escape  not negroes onlynot the enslaved blacks who are now enslaved no morebut the rising nations of white men wherever they are to be seen you english have no sympathy with a people who claim to be at least your equals the clown has trod upon the courtiers heels till the clown is clown no longer and the courtier has hardly a court in which he may dangle his swordknot  if so the clown might as well spare the courtier not meaning the rebuke which his words implied  ahhbut the clown will not spare the courtier mr glascock i understand the gibe and i tell you that the courtier shall be spared no longerbecause he is useless he shall be cut down together with the withered grasses and thrown into the oven and there shall be an end of him then she turned round to appeal to an american gentleman who had joined them and mr glascock made his escape i hold it to be the holiest duty which i owe to my country never to spare one of them when i meet him  they are all very well in their way said the american gentleman  down with them down with them exclaimed the poetess with a beautiful enthusiasm in the meantime mr glascock had made up his mind that he could not dare to ask caroline spalding to be his wife there were certain forms of the american female so dreadful that no wise man would wilfully come in contact with them miss petries ferocity was distressing to him but her eloquence and enthusiasm were worse even than her ferocity the personal incivility of which she had been guilty in calling him a withered grass was distasteful to him as being opposed to his ideas of the customs of society but what would be his fate if his wifes chosen friend should be for ever dinning her denunciation of withered grasses into his ear  he was still thinking of all this when he was accosted by mrs spalding are you going to dear lady banburys tomorrow she asked lady banbury was the wife of the english minister  i suppose i shall be there in the course of the evening  how very nice she is is she not i do like lady banburyso soft and gentle and kind  one of the pleasantest old ladies i know said mr glascock  it does not strike you so much as it does me said mrs spalding with one of her sweetest smiles the truth is we all value what we have not got there are no lady banburys in our country and therefore we think the more of them when we meet them here she is talking of going to rome for the carnival and has asked caroline to go with her i am so pleased to find that my dear girl is such a favourite  mr glascock immediately told himself that he saw the hook if he were to be fished for by this american aunt as he had been fished for by english mothers all his pleasure in the society of caroline spalding would be at once over it would be too much indeed if in this american household he were to find the old vices of an aristocracy superadded to young republican sins nevertheless lady banbury was as he knew well a person whose opinion about young people was supposed to be very good she noticed those only who were worthy of notice and to have been taken by the hand by lady banbury was acknowledged to be a passport into good society if caroline spalding was in truth going to rome with lady banbury that fact was in itself a great confirmation of mr glascocks good opinion of her mrs spalding had perhaps understood this but had not understood that having just hinted that it was so she should have abstained from saying a word more about her dear girl clever and wellpractised must indeed be the hand of the fisherwoman in matrimonial waters who is able to throw her fly without showing any glimpse of the hook to the fish for whom she angles poor mrs spalding though with kindly instincts towards her niece she did on this occasion make some slight attempt at angling was innocent of any concerted plan it seemed to her to be so natural to say a good word in praise of her niece to the man whom she believed to be in love with her niece  caroline and mr glascock did not meet each other again till late in the evening and just as he was about to take his leave as they came together each of them involuntarily looked round to see whether miss petrie was near had she been there nothing would have been said beyond the shortest farewell greeting but miss petrie was afar off electrifying some italian by the vehemence of her sentiments and the audacious volubility of a language in which all arbitrary restrictions were ignored are you going she asked  welli believe i am since i saw you last ive encountered miss petrie again and im rather depressed  ahyou dont know her if you did you wouldnt laugh at her  laugh at her indeed i do not do that but when im told that im to be thrown into the oven and burned because im such a wornout old institution  you dont mean to say that you mind that  not much when it comes up in the ordinary course of conversation but it palls upon one when it is asserted for the fourth or fifth time in an evening  alas alas exclaimed miss spalding with mock energy  and why alas  because it is so impossible to make the oil and vinegar of the old world and of the new mix together and suit each other  you think it is impossible miss spalding  i fear so we are so terribly tender and you are always pinching us on our most tender spot and we never meet you without treading on your gouty toes  i dont think my toes are gouty said he  i apologise to your own individually mr glascock but i must assert that nationally you are subject to the gout  that is when im told over and over again that im to be cut down and thrown into the oven  never mind the oven now mr glascock if my friend has been overzealous i will beg pardon for her but it does seem to me indeed it does with all the reverence and partiality i have for everything europeanthe word european was an offence to him and he shewed that it was so by his countenancethat the idiosyncrasies of you and of us are so radically different that we cannot be made to amalgamate and sympathise with each other thoroughly  he paused for some seconds before he answered her but it was so evident by his manner that he was going to speak that she could neither leave him nor interrupt him i had thought that it might have been otherwise he said at last and the tone of his voice was so changed as to make her know that he was in earnest  but she did not change her voice by a single note im afraid it cannot be so she said speaking after her old fashionhalf in earnest half in banter we may make up our minds to be very civil to each other when we meet the threats of the oven may no doubt be dropped on our side and you may abstain from expressing in words your sense of our inferiority  i never expressed anything of the kind he said quite in anger  i am taking you simply as the sample englishman not as mr glascock who helped me and my sister over the mountains such of us as have to meet in society may agree to be very courteous but courtesy and cordiality are not only not the same but they are incompatible  why so  courtesy is an effort and cordiality is free i must be allowed to contradict the friend that i love but i assenttoo often falselyto what is said to me by a passing acquaintance in spite of what the scripture says i think it is one of the greatest privileges of a brother that he may call his brother a fool  shall you desire to call your husband a fool  my husband  he will i suppose be at least as dear to you as a brother  i never had a brother  your sister then it is the same i suppose  if i were to have a husband i hope he would be the dearest to me of all unless he were so he certainly would not be my husband but between a man and his wife there does not spring up that playful violent intimacy admitting of all liberties which comes from early nursery associations and then there is the difference of sex  i should not like my wife to call me a fool he said  i hope she may never have occasion to do so mr glascock marry an english wife in your own classas of course you willand then you will be safe  but i have set my heart fast on marrying an american wife he said  then i cant tell what may befall you its like enough if you do that that you may be called by some name you will think hard to bear but youll think better of it like should pair with like mr glascock if you were to marry one of our young women you would lose in dignity as much as she would lose in comfort then they parted and she went off to say farewell to other guests the manner in which she had answered what he had said to her had certainly been of a nature to stop any further speech of the same kind had she been gentle with him then he would certainly have told her that she was the american woman whom he desired to take with him to his home in england     chapter lvii  dorothys fate   towards the end of february sir peter mancrudy declared miss stanbury to be out of danger and mr martin began to be sprightly on the subject taking to himself no inconsiderable share of the praise accruing to the medical faculty in exeter generally for the saving of a life so valuable to the city yes mr burgess sir peter said to old barty of the bank our friend will get over it this time and without any serious damage to her constitution if she will only take care of herself barty made some inaudible grunt intended to indicate his own indifference on the subject and expressed his opinion to the chief clerk that old jemima wideawakeas he was pleased to call herwas one of those tough customers who would never die it would be nothing to us mr barty one way or the other said the clerk to which barty burgess assented with another grunt  camilla french declared that she was delighted to hear the news at this time there had been some sort of a reconciliation between her and her lover mrs french had extracted from him a promise that he would not go to natal and camilla had commenced the preparations for her wedding his visits to heavitree were as few and far between as he could make them with any regard to decency but the 31st of march was coming on quickly and as he was to be made a possession of them for ever it was considered to be safe and well to allow him some liberty in his present condition my dear if they are driven there is no knowing what they wont do mrs french said to her daughter camilla had submitted with compressed lips and a slight nod of her head she had worked very hard but her day of reward was coming it was impossible not to perceiveboth for her and her motherthat the scantiness of mr gibsons attention to his future bride was cause of some weak triumph to arabella she said that it was very odd that he did not comeand once added with a little sigh that he used to come in former days alluding to those happy days in which another love was paramount camilla could not endure this with an equal mind bella dear she said we know what all that means he has made his choice and if i am satisfied with what he does now surely you need not grumble miss stanburys illness had undoubtedly been a great source of contentment to the family at heavitree as they had all been able to argue that her impending demise was the natural consequence of her great sin in the matter of dorothys proposed marriage when however they heard from mr martin that she would certainly recover that sir peters edict to that effect had gone forth they were willing to acknowledge that providence having so far punished the sinner was right in staying its hand and abstaining from the final blow im sure we are delighted said mrs french for though she has said cruel things of usand so untrue tooyet of course it is our duty to forgive her and we do forgive her  dorothy had written three or four notes to brooke since his departure which contained simple bulletins of her aunts health she always began her letters with my dear mr burgess and ended them with yours truly she never made any allusion to brookes declaration of love or gave the slightest sign in her letters to shew that she even remembered it at last she wrote to say that her aunt was convalescent and in making this announcement she allowed herself some enthusiasm of expression she was so happy and was so sure that mr burgess would be equally so and her aunt had asked after her dear brooke expressing her great satisfaction with him in that he had come down to see her when she had been almost too ill to see any one in answer to this there came to her a real loveletter from brooke burgess it was the first occasion on which he had written to her the little bulletins had demanded no replies and had received none perhaps there had been a shade of disappointment on dorothys side in that she had written thrice and had been made rich with no word in return but although her heart had palpitated on hearing the postmans knock and had palpitated in vain she had told herself that it was all as it should be she wrote to him because she possessed information which it was necessary that she should communicate he did not write to her because there was nothing for him to tell then had come the loveletter and in the loveletter there was an imperative demand for a reply  what was she to do to have recourse to priscilla for advice was her first idea but she herself believed that she owed a debt of gratitude to her aunt which priscilla would not take into accountthe existence of which priscilla would by no means admit she knew priscillas mind in this matter and was sure that priscillas advice whatever it might be would be given without any regard to her aunts views and then dorothy was altogether ignorant of her aunts views her aunt had been very anxious that she should marry mr gibson but had clearly never admitted into her mind the idea that she might possibly marry brooke burgess and it seemed to her that she herself would be dishonest both to her aunt and to her lover if she were to bind this man to herself without her aunts knowledge he was to be her aunts heir and she was maintained by her aunts liberality thinking of all this she at last resolved that she would take the bull by the horns and tell her aunt she felt that the task would be one almost beyond her strength thrice she went into her aunts room intending to make a clean breast thrice her courage failed her and she left the room with her tale untold excusing herself on various pretexts her aunt had seemed to be not quite so well or had declared herself to be tired or had been a little crossor else martha had come in at the nick of time but there was brooke burgesss letter unanswereda letter that was read night and morning and which was never for an instant out of her mind he had demanded a reply and he had a right at least to that the letter had been with her for four entire days before she had ventured to speak to her aunt on the subject  on the first of march miss stanbury came out of her bedroom for the first time dorothy on the previous day had decided on postponing her communication for this occasion but when she found herself sitting in the little sittingroom upstairs close at her aunts elbow and perceived the signs of weakness which the new move had made conspicuous and heard the invalid declare that the little journey had been almost too much for her her heart misgave her she ought to have told her tale while her aunt was still in bed but presently there came a question which put her into such a flutter that she was for the time devoid of all resolution has brooke written said miss stanbury  yesaunt he has written  and what did he say dorothy was struck quite dumb is there anything wrong and now as miss stanbury asked the question she seemed herself to have forgotten that she had two minutes before declared herself to be almost too feeble to speak im sure there is something wrong what is it i will know  there is nothing wrong aunt stanbury  where is the letter let me see it  i mean there is nothing wrong about him  what is it then  he is quite well aunt stanbury  shew me the letter i will see the letter i know that there is something the matter do you mean to say you wont shew me brookes letter  there was a moments pause before dorothy answered i will shew you his letterthough i am sure he didnt mean that i should shew it to anyone  he hasnt written evil of me  no no no he would sooner cut his hand off than say a word bad of you he never says or writes anything bad of anybody but oh aunt ill tell you everything i should have told you before only that you were ill  then miss stanbury was frightened what is it she said hoarsely clasping the arms of the great chair each with a thin shrivelled hand  aunt stanbury brookebrookewants me to be hiswife      illustration brooke wants me to be his wife   what  you cannot be more surprised than i have been aunt stanbury and there has been no fault of mine  i dont believe it said the old woman  now you may read the letter said dorothy standing up she was quite prepared to be obedient but she felt that her aunts manner of receiving the information was almost an insult  he must be a fool said miss stanbury  this was hard to bear and the colour went and came rapidly across dorothys cheeks as she gave herself a few moments to prepare an answer she already perceived that her aunt would be altogether adverse to the marriage and that therefore the marriage could never take place she had never for a moment allowed herself to think otherwise but nevertheless the blow was heavy on her we all know how constantly hope and expectation will rise high within our own bosoms in opposition to our own judgmenthow we become sanguine in regard to events which we almost know can never come to pass so it had been with dorothy her heart had been almost in a flutter of happiness since she had had brookes letter in her possession and yet she never ceased to declare to herself her own conviction that that letter could lead to no good result in regard to her own wishes on the subject she had never asked herself a single question as it had been quite beyond her power to bring herself to endure the idea of marrying mr gibson so it had been quite impossible to her not to long to be brookes wife from the moment in which a suggestion to that effect had fallen from his lips this was a state of things so certain so much a matter of course that though she had not spoken a word to him in which she owned her love she had never for a moment doubted that he knew the truthand that everybody else concerned would know it too but she did not suppose that her wishes would go for anything with her aunt brooke burgess was to become a rich man as her aunts heir and her aunt would of course have her own ideas about brookes advancement in life she was quite prepared to submit without quarrelling when her aunt should tell her that the idea must not be entertained but the order might be given the prohibition might be pronounced without an insult to her own feelings as a woman he must be a fool miss stanbury had said and dorothy took time to collect her thoughts before she would reply in the meantime her aunt finished the reading of the letter  he may be foolish in this dorothy said but i dont think you should call him a fool  i shall call him what i please i suppose this was going on at the time when you refused mr gibson  nothing was going on nothing has gone on at all said dorothy with as much indignation as she was able to assume  how can you tell me that that is an untruth  it is notan untruth said dorothy almost sobbing but driven at the same time to much anger  do you mean to say that this is the first you ever heard of it and she held out the letter shaking it in her thin hand  i have never said so aunt stanbury  yes you did  i said that nothingwasgoing on when mr gibsonwas if you choose to suspect me aunt stanbury ill go away i wont stay here if you suspect me when brooke spoke to me i told him you wouldnt like it  of course i dont like it but she gave no reason why she did not like it  and there was nothing more till this letter came i couldnt help his writing to me it wasnt my fault  psha  if you are angry i am very sorry but you havent a right to be angry  go on dorothy go on im so weak that i can hardly stir myself its the first moment that ive been out of my bed for weeksand of course you can say what you please i know what it will be i shall have to take to my bed again and thenin a very little timeyou can bothmake fools of yourselvesjust as you like  this was an argument against which dorothy of course found it to be quite impossible to make continued combat she could only shuffle her letter back into her pocket and be if possible more assiduous than ever in her attentions to the invalid she knew that she had been treated most unjustly and there would be a question to be answered as soon as her aunt should be well as to the possibility of her remaining in the close subject to such injustice but let her aunt say what she might or do what she might dorothy could not leave her for the present miss stanbury sat for a considerable time quite motionless with her eyes closed and did not stir or make signs of life till dorothy touched her arm asking her whether she would not take some broth which had been prepared for her wheres martha why does not martha come said miss stanbury this was a hard blow and from that moment dorothy believed that it would be expedient that she should return to nuncombe putney the broth however was taken while dorothy sat by in silence only one word further was said that evening by miss stanbury about brooke and his love affair there must be nothing more about this dorothy remember that nothing at all i wont have it dorothy made no reply brookes letter was in her pocket and it should be answered that night on the following day she would let her aunt know what she had said to brooke her aunt should not see the letter but should be made acquainted with its purport in reference to brookes proposal of marriage  i wont have it that had been her aunts command what right had her aunt to give any command upon the matter then crossed dorothys mind as she thought of this a glimmering of an idea that no one can be entitled to issue commands who cannot enforce obedience if brooke and she chose to become man and wife by mutual consent how could her aunt prohibit the marriage then there followed another idea that commands are enforced by the threatening and if necessary by the enforcement of penalties her aunt had within her hand no penalty of which dorothy was afraid on her own behalf but she had the power of inflicting a terrible punishment on brooke burgess now dorothy conceived that she herself would be the meanest creature alive if she were actuated by fears as to money in her acceptance or rejection of a man whom she loved as she did brooke burgess brooke had an income of his own which seemed to her to be ample for all purposes but that which would have been sordid in her did not seem to her to have any stain of sordidness for him he was a man and was bound to be rich if he could and moreover what had she to offer in herselfsuch a poor thing as was sheto make compensation to him for the loss of fortune her aunt could inflict this penalty and therefore the power was hers and the power must be obeyed she would write to brooke in a manner that should convey to him her firm decision but not the less on that account would she let her aunt know that she thought herself to have been illused it was an insult to her a most illnatured insultthat telling her that brooke had been a fool for loving her and then that accusation against her of having been false of having given one reason for refusing mr gibson while there was another reason in her heartof having been cunning and then untrue was not to be endured what would her aunt think of her if she were to bear such allegations without indignant protest she would write her letter and speak her mind to her aunt as soon as her aunt should be well enough to hear it  as she had resolved she wrote her letter that night before she went to bed she wrote it with floods of tears and a bitterness of heart which almost conquered her she too had heard of love and had been taught to feel that the success or failure of a womans life depended upon thatwhether she did or whether she did not by such gifts as god might have given to her attract to herself some man strong enough and good enough and loving enough to make straight for her her paths to bear for her her burdens to be the father of her children the staff on which she might lean and the wall against which she might grow feeling the sunshine and sheltered from the wind she had ever estimated her own value so lowly as to have told herself often that such success could never come in her way from her earliest years she had regarded herself as outside the pale within which such joys are to be found she had so strictly taught herself to look forward to a blank existence that she had learned to do so without active misery but not the less did she know where happiness lay and when the good thing came almost within her reach when it seemed that god had given her gifts which might have sufficed when a man had sought her hand whose nature was such that she could have leaned on him with a true worship could have grown against him as against a wall with perfect confidence could have lain with her head upon his bosom and have felt that of all spots that in the world was the most fitting for herwhen this was all but grasped and must yet be abandoned there came upon her spirit an agony so bitter that she had not before known how great might be the depth of human disappointment but the letter was at last written and when finished was as follows      the close exeter march 1 186     dear brooke   there had been many doubts about this but at last they were conquered and the name was written      i have shown your letter to my aunt as i am sure you will    think was best i should have answered it before only    that i thought that she was not quite well enough to talk    about it she says as i was sure she would that what you    propose is quite out of the question i am aware that i    am bound to obey her and as i think that you also ought    to do so i shall think no more of what you have said to    me and have written it is quite impossible now even if    it might have been possible under other circumstances i    shall always remember your great kindness to me perhaps    i ought to say that i am very grateful for the compliment    you have paid me i shall think of you alwaystill i    die     believe me to be    your very sincere friend     dorothy stanbury   the next day miss stanbury again came out of her room and on the third day she was manifestly becoming stronger dorothy had as yet not spoken of her letter but was prepared to do so as soon as she thought that a fitting opportunity had come she had a word or two to say for herself but she must not again subject herself to being told that she was taking her will of her aunt because her aunt was too ill to defend herself but on the third day miss stanbury herself asked the question have you written anything to brooke she asked  i have answered his letter aunt stanbury  and what have you said to him  i have told him that you disapproved of it and that nothing more must be said about it  yesof course you made me out to be an ogre  i dont know what you mean by that aunt i am sure that i told him the truth  may i see the letter  it has gone  but you have kept a copy said miss stanbury  yes i have got a copy replied dorothy but i would rather not shew it i told him just what i tell you  dorothy it is not at all becoming that you should have a correspondence with any young man of such a nature that you should be ashamed to shew it to your aunt  i am not ashamed of anything said dorothy sturdily  i dont know what young women in these days have come to continued miss stanbury there is no respect no subjection no obedience and too oftenno modesty  does that mean me aunt stanbury asked dorothy  to tell you the truth dorothy i dont think you ought to have been receiving loveletters from brooke burgess when i was lying ill in bed i didnt expect it of you i tell you fairly that i didnt expect it of you  then dorothy spoke out her mind as you think that aunt stanbury i had better go away and if you please i willwhen you are well enough to spare me  pray dont think of me at all said her aunt  and as for lovelettersmr burgess has written to me once i dont think that there can be anything immodest in opening a letter when it comes by the post and as soon as i had it i determined to shew it to you as for what happened before when mr burgess spoke to me which was long long after all that about mr gibson was over i told him that it couldnt be so and i thought there would be no more about it you were so ill that i could not tell you now you know it all  i have not seen your letter to him  i shall never shew it to anybody but you have said things aunt stanbury that are very cruel  of course everything i say is wrong  you have told me that i was telling untruths and you have called meimmodest that is a terrible word  you shouldnt deserve it then  i never have deserved it and i wont bear it no i wont if hugh heard me called that word i believe hed tear the house down  hugh indeed hes to be brought in between usis he  hes my brother and of course im obliged to think of him and if you please ill go home as soon as you are well enough to spare me  quickly after this there were very many letters coming and going between the house in the close and the ladies at nuncombe putney and hugh stanbury and brooke burgess the correspondent of brooke burgess was of course miss stanbury herself the letters to hugh and to nuncombe putney were written by dorothy of the former we need be told nothing at the present moment but the upshot of all poor dollys letters was that on the tenth of march she was to return home to nuncombe putney share once more her sisters bed and mothers poverty and abandon the comforts of the close before this became a definite arrangement miss stanbury had given way in a certain small degree she had acknowledged that dorothy had intended no harm but this was not enough for dorothy who was conscious of no harm either done or intended she did not specify her terms or require specifically that her aunt should make apology for that word immodest or at least withdraw it but she resolved that she would go unless it was most absolutely declared to have been applied to her without the slightest reason she felt moreover that her aunts house ought to be open to brooke burgess and that it could not be open to them both and so she wenthaving resided under her aunts roof between nine and ten months  goodbye aunt stanbury said dorothy kissing her aunt with a tear in her eye and a sob in her throat  goodbye my dear goodbye and miss stanbury as she pressed her nieces hand left in it a banknote  im much obliged aunt i am indeed but id rather not and the banknote was left on the parlour table     chapter lviii  dorothy at home   dorothy was received at home with so much affection and such expressions of esteem as to afford her much consolation in her misery both her mother and her sister approved of her conduct mrs stanburys approval was indeed accompanied by many expressions of regret as to the good things lost she was fully alive to the fact that life in the close at exeter was better for her daughter than life in their little cottage at nuncombe putney the outward appearance which dorothy bore on her return home was proof of this her clothes the set of her hair her very gestures and motions had framed themselves on town ideas the faded wildered washedout look the uncertain purposeless bearing which had come from her secluded life and subjection to her sister had vanished from her she had lived among people and had learned something of their gait and carriage money we know will do almost everything and no doubt money had had much to do with this it is very pretty to talk of the alluring simplicity of a clean calico gown but poverty will shew itself to be meagre dowdy and draggled in a womans dress let the woman be ever so simple ever so neat ever so independent and ever so highhearted mrs stanbury was quite alive to all that her younger daughter was losing had she not received two offers of marriage while she was at exeter there was no possibility that offers of marriage should be made in the cottage at nuncombe putney a man within the walls of the cottage would have been considered as much out of place as a wild bull it had been matter of deep regret to mrs stanbury that her daughter should not have found herself able to marry mr gibson she knew that there was no matter for reproach in this but it was a misfortunea great misfortune and in the mothers breast there had been a sad unrepressed feeling of regret that young people should so often lose their chances in the world through overfancifulness and ignorance as to their own good now when she heard the story of brooke burgess she could not but think that had dorothy remained at exeter enduring patiently such hard words as her aunt might speak the love affair might have been brought at some future time to a happy conclusion she did not say all this but there came on her a silent melancholy made expressive by constant little shakings of the head and a continued reproachful sadness of demeanour which was quite as intelligible to priscilla as would have been any spoken words but priscillas approval of her sisters conduct was clear outspoken and satisfactory she had been quite sure that her sister had been right about mr gibson and was equally sure that she was now right about brooke burgess priscilla had in her mind an idea that if b b as they called him was half as good as her sister represented him to befor indeed dorothy endowed him with every virtue consistent with humanityhe would not be deterred from his pursuit either by dollys letter or by aunt stanburys commands but of this she thought it wise to say nothing she paid dolly the warm and hitherto unaccustomed compliment of equality assuming to regard her sisters judgment and persistent independence to be equally strong with her own and as she knew well she could not have gone further than this i never shall agree with you about aunt stanbury she said to me she seems to be so imperious so exacting and also so unjust as to be unbearable  but she is affectionate said dolly  so is the dog that bites you and for aught i know the horse that kicks you but it is ill living with biting dogs and kicking horses but all that matters little as you are still your own mistress how strange these nine months have been with you in exeter while we have been at the clock house and here we are together again in the old way just as though nothing had happened but dorothy knew well that a great deal had happened and that her life could never be as it had been heretofore the very tone in which her sister spoke to her was proof of this she had an infinitely greater possession in herself than had belonged to her before her residence at exeter but that possession was so heavily mortgaged and so burthened as to make her believe that the change was to be regretted  at the end of the first week there came a letter from aunt stanbury to dorothy it began by saying that dolly had left behind her certain small properties which had now been made up in a parcel and sent by the railway carriage paid but they werent mine at all said dolly alluding to certain books in which she had taken delight she means to give them to you said priscilla and i think you must take them and the shawl is no more mine than it is yours though i wore it two or three times in the winter priscilla was of opinion that the shawl must be taken also then the letter spoke of the writers health and at last fell into such a strain of confidential gossip that mrs stanbury when she read it could not understand that there had been a quarrel martha says that she saw camilla french in the street today such a guy in her new finery as never was seen before except on mayday then in the postscript dorothy was enjoined to answer this letter quickly none of your short scraps my dear said aunt stanbury  she must mean you to go back to her said mrs stanbury  no doubt she does said priscilla but dolly need not go because my aunt means it we are not her creatures  but dorothy answered her aunts letter in the spirit in which it had been written she asked after her aunts health thanked her aunt for the gift of the booksin each of which her name had been clearly writtenprotested about the shawl sent her love to martha and her kind regards to jane and expressed a hope that c f enjoyed her new clothes she described the cottage and was funny about the cabbage stumps in the garden and at last succeeded in concocting a long epistle i suppose there will be a regular correspondence said priscilla  two days afterwards however the correspondence took altogether another form the cottage in which they now lived was supposed to be beyond the beat of the woodenlegged postman and therefore it was necessary that they should call at the postoffice for their letters on the morning in question priscilla obtained a thick letter from exeter for her mother and knew that it had come from her aunt her aunt could hardly have found it necessary to correspond with dorothys mother so soon after that letter to dorothy had been written had there not arisen some very peculiar cause priscilla after much meditation thought it better that the letter should be opened in dorothys absence and in dorothys absence the following letter was read both by priscilla and her mother      the close march 19 186     dear sister stanbury     after much consideration i think it best to send under    cover to you the enclosed letter from mr brooke burgess    intended for your daughter dorothy you will see that i    have opened it and read itas i was clearly entitled to    do the letter having been addressed to my niece while she    was supposed to be under my care i do not like to destroy    the letter though perhaps that would be best but i    would advise you to do so if it be possible without    shewing it to dorothy i have told mr brooke burgess what    i have done     i have also told him that i cannot sanction a marriage    between him and your daughter there are many reasons of    old datenot to speak of present reasons alsowhich    would make such a marriage highly inexpedient mr brooke    burgess is of course his own master but your daughter    understands completely how the matter stands     yours truly     jemima stanbury   what a wicked old woman said priscilla then there arose a question whether they should read brookes letter or whether they should give it unread to dorothy priscilla denounced her aunt in the strongest language she could use for having broken the seal clearly entitledbecause dorothy had been living with her exclaimed priscilla she can have no proper conception of honour or of honesty she had no more right to open dorothys letter than she had to take her money mrs stanbury was very anxious to read brookes letter alleging that they would then be able to judge whether it should be handed over to dorothy but priscillas sense of right would not admit of this dorothy must receive the letter from her lover with no further stain from unauthorised eyes than that to which it had been already subjected she was called in therefore from the kitchen and the whole packet was given to her your aunt has read the enclosure dolly but we have not opened it  dorothy took the packet without a word and sat herself down she first read her aunts letter very slowly i understand perfectly she said folding it up almost listlessly while brookes letter lay still unopened on her lap then she took it up and held it awhile in both hands while her mother and priscilla watched her priscilla she said do you read it first  priscilla was immediately at her side kissing her no my darling no she said it is for you to read it then dorothy took the precious contents from the envelope and opened the folds of the paper when she had read a dozen words her eyes were so suffused with tears that she could hardly make herself mistress of the contents of the letter but she knew that it contained renewed assurances of her lovers love and assurance on his part that he would take no refusal from her based on any other ground than that of her own indifference to him he had written to miss stanbury to the same effect but he had not thought it necessary to explain this to dorothy nor did miss stanbury in her letter tell them that she had received any communication from him shall i read it now said priscilla as soon as dorothy again allowed the letter to fall into her lap  both priscilla and mrs stanbury read it and for awhile they sat with the two letters among them without much speech about them mrs stanbury was endeavouring to make herself believe that her sisterinlaws opposition might be overcome and that then dorothy might be married priscilla was inquiring of herself whether it would be well that dorothy should defy her auntso much at any rate would be welland marry the man even to his deprivation of the old womans fortune priscilla had her doubts about this being very strong in her ideas of selfdenial that her sister should put up with the bitterest disappointment rather than injure the man she loved was rightbut then it would also be so extremely right to defy aunt stanbury to her teeth but dorothy in whose character was mixed with her mothers softness much of the old stanbury strength had no doubt in her mind it was very sweet to be so loved what gratitude did she not owe to a man who was so true to her what was she that she should stand in his way to lay herself down that she might be crushed in his path was no more than she owed to him mrs stanbury was the first to speak  i suppose he is a very good young man she said  i am sure he isa noble truehearted man said priscilla  and why shouldnt he marry whom he pleases as long as she is respectable said mrs stanbury  in some peoples eyes poverty is more disreputable than vice said priscilla  your aunt has been so fond of dorothy pleaded mrs stanbury  just as she is of her servants said priscilla  but dorothy said nothing her heart was too full to enable her to defend her aunt nor at the present moment was she strong enough to make her mother understand that no hope was to be entertained in the course of the day she walked out with her sister on the road towards ridleigh and there standing among the rocks and ferns looking down upon the river with the buzz of the little mill within her ears she explained the feelings of her heart and her many thoughts with a flow of words stronger as priscilla thought than she had ever used before  it is not what he would suffer now pris or what he would feel but what he would feel ten twenty years hence when he would know that his children would have been all provided for had he not lost his fortune by marrying me  he must be the only judge whether he prefers you to the old womans money said priscilla  no dear not the only judge and it isnt that prisnot which he likes best now but which it is best for him that he should have what could i do for him  you can love him  yesi can do that and dorothy paused a moment to think how exceedingly well she could do that one thing but what is that as you said the other day a dog can do that i am not clever i cant play or talk french or do things that men like their wives to do and i have lived here all my life and what am i that for me he should lose a great fortune  that is his look out  no dearestit is mine and i will look out i shall be able at any rate to remember always that i have loved him and have not injured him he may be angry with me nowand there was a feeling of pride at her heart as she thought that he would be angry with her because she did not go to himbut he will know at last that i have been as good to him as i knew how to be  then priscilla wound her arms round dorothy and kissed her my sister she said my own sister they walked on further discussing the matter in all its bearings talking of the act of selfdenial which dorothy was called on to perform as though it were some abstract thing the performance of which was or perhaps was not imperatively demanded by the laws which should govern humanity but with no idea on the mind of either of them that there was any longer a doubt as to this special matter in hand they were away from home over three hours and when they returned dorothy at once wrote her two letters they were very simple and very short she told brooke whom she now addressed as dear mr burgess that it could not be as he would have it and she told her auntwith some terse independence of expression which miss stanbury quite understoodthat she had considered the matter and had thought it right to refuse mr burgesss offer  dont you think she is very much changed said mrs stanbury to her eldest daughter  not changed in the least mother but the sun has opened the bud and now we see the fruit     chapter lix  mr bozzle at home      illustration  it had now come to pass that trevelyan had not a friend in the world to whom he could apply in the matter of his wife and family in the last communication which he had received from lady milborough she had scolded him in terms that were for her severe because he had not returned to his wife and taken her off with him to naples mr bideawhile had found himself obliged to decline to move in the matter at all with hugh stanbury trevelyan had had a direct quarrel mr and mrs outhouse he regarded as bitter enemies who had taken the part of his wife without any regard to the decencies of life and now it had come to pass that his sole remaining ally mr samuel bozzle the expoliceman was becoming weary of his service trevelyan remained in the north of italy up to the middle of march spending a fortune in sending telegrams to bozzle instigating bozzle by all the means in his power to obtain possession of the child desiring him at one time to pounce down upon the parsonage of st diddulphs with a battalion of policemen armed to the teeth with the laws authority and at another time suggesting to him to find his way by stratagem into mr outhouses castle and carry off the child in his arms at last he sent word to say that he himself would be in england before the end of march and would see that the majesty of the law should be vindicated in his favour  bozzle had in truth made but one personal application for the child at st diddulphs in making this he had expected no success though from the energetic nature of his disposition he had made the attempt with some zeal but he had never applied again at the parsonage disregarding the letters the telegrams and even the promises which had come to him from his employer with such frequency the truth was that mrs bozzle was opposed to the proposed separation of the mother and the child and that bozzle was a man who listened to the words of his wife mrs bozzle was quite prepared to admit that madame tas mrs trevelyan had come to be called at no 55 stony walkwas no better than she should be mrs bozzle was disposed to think that ladies of quality among whom madame t was entitled in her estimation to take rank were seldom better than they ought to be and she was quite willing that her husband should earn his bread by watching the lady or the ladys lover she had participated in bozzles triumph when he had discovered that the colonel had gone to devonshire and again when he had learned that the lothario had been at st diddulphs and had the case been brought before the judge ordinary by means of her husbands exertions she would have taken pleasure in reading every word of the evidence even though her husband should have been ever so roughly handled by the lawyers but now when a demand was made upon bozzle to violate the sanctity of the clergymans house and withdraw the child by force or stratagem she began to perceive that the palmy days of the trevelyan affair were over for them and that it would be wise on her husbands part gradually to back out of the gentlemans employment just put it on the fireback bozzle she said one morning as her husband stood before her reading for the second time a somewhat lengthy epistle which had reached him from italy while he held the baby over his shoulder with his left arm he had just washed himself at the sink and though his face was clean his hair was rough and his shirt sleeves were tucked up      illustration put it on the fireback bozzle   thats all very well maryanne but when a party has took a gents money a party is bound to go through with the job  gammon bozzle  its all very well to say gammon but his money has been tookand theres more to come  and aint you worked for the moneydown to hexeter one time across the water pretty well day and night watching that ere clergymans ouse like a cat what mored he have as to the child i wont hear of it b the child shant come here wed all be shewed up in the papers as that black that theyd hoot us along the streets it aint the regular line of business bozzle and there aint no good to be got never by going off the regular line whereupon bozzle scratched his head and again read the letter a distinct promise of a hundred pounds was made to him if he would have the child ready to hand over to trevelyan on trevelyans arrival in england  it aint to be done you know said bozzle  of course it aint said mrs bozzle  it aint to be done anywaysnot in my way of business why didnt he go to skint as i told him when his own lawyer was too dainty for the job the paternal parent has a right to his infants no doubt that was bozzles law  i dont believe it b  but he have i tell you  he cant suckle emcan he i dont believe a bit of his rights  when a married woman has followers and the husband dont go the wrong side of the post too or it aint proved again him that he do theyll never let her have nothing to do with the children its been before the court a hundred times hell get the child fast enough if hell go before the court  anyways it aint your business bozzle and dont you meddle nor make the moneys good money as long as its honest earned but when you come to rampaging and breaking into a gents house then i say money may be had a deal too hard in this special letter which had now come to hand bozzle was not instructed to rampage he was simply desired to make a further official requisition for the boy at the parsonage and to explain to mr outhouse mrs outhouse and mrs trevelyan or to as many of them as he could contrive to see that mr trevelyan was immediately about to return to london and that he would put the law into execution if his son were not given up to him at once ill tell you what it is b exclaimed mrs bozzle its my belief as he aint quite right up here and mrs bozzle touched her forehead  its love for her as has done it then said bozzle shaking his head  im not a taking of her part b a woman as has a husband as finds her with her wittels regular and with whats decent and comfortable beside ought to be contented ive never said no other than that i aint no patience with your saucy madames as cant remember as theyre eating an honest mans bread drat em all what is it they wants they dont know what they wants its just hidlenesscause there aint a haporth for em to do its that as makes em i wont say what but as for this here child b at that moment there came a knock at the door mrs bozzle going into the passage opened it herself and saw a strange gentleman bozzle who had stood at the inner door saw that the gentleman was mr trevelyan  the letter which was still in the expolicemans hand had reached stony walk on the previous day but the master of the house had been absent finding out facts following up his profession and earning an honest penny trevelyan had followed his letter quicker than he had intended when it was written and was now with his prime minister before his prime minister had been able to take any action on the last instruction received does one mr samuel bozzle live here asked trevelyan then bozzle came forward and introduced his wife there was no one else present except the baby and bozzle intimated that let matters be as delicate as they might they could be discussed with perfect security in his wifes presence but trevelyan was of a different opinion and he was disgusted and revoltedmost unreasonablyby the appearance of his ministers domestic arrangements bozzle had always waited upon him with a decent coat and a wellbrushed hat and clean shoes it is very much easier for such men as mr bozzle to carry decency of appearance about with them than to keep it at home trevelyan had never believed his ally to be more than an ordinary expoliceman but he had not considered how unattractive might be the interior of a private detectives private residence mrs bozzle had set a chair for him but he had declined to sit down the room was dirty and very closeas though no breath of air was ever allowed to find entrance there perhaps you could put on your coat and walk out with me for a few minutes said trevelyan mrs bozzle who well understood that business was business and that wives were not business felt no anger at this and handed her husband his best coat the wellbrushed hat was fetched from a cupboard and it was astonishing to see how easily and how quickly the outer respectability of bozzle was restored  well said trevelyan as soon as they were together in the middle of stony walk  there hasnt been nothing to be done sir said bozzle  why not trevelyan could perceive at once that the authority which he had once respected had gone from the man bozzle away from his own home out on business with his coat buttoned over his breast and his best hat in his hand was aware that he commanded respectand he could carry himself accordingly he knew himself to be somebody and could be easy selfconfident confidential severe authoritative or even arrogant as the circumstances of the moment might demand but he had been found with his coat off and a baby in his arms and he could not recover himself i do not suppose that anybody will question my right to have the care of my own child said trevelyan  if you would have gone to mr skint sir suggested bozzle there aint no smarter gent in all the profession sir than mr skint  mr trevelyan made no reply to this but walked on in silence with his minister at his elbow he was very wretched understanding well the degradation to which he was subjecting himself in discussing his wifes conduct with this manbut with whom else could he discuss it the man seemed to be meaner now than he had been before he had been seen in his own home and trevelyan was conscious too that he himself was not in outward appearance as he used to be that he was illdressed and haggard and worn and visibly a wretched being how can any man care to dress himself with attention who is always alone and always miserable when alone during the months which had passed over him since he had sent his wife away from him his very nature had been altered and he himself was aware of the change as he went about his eyes were ever cast downwards and he walked with a quick shuffling gait and he suspected others feeling that he himself was suspected and all work had ceased with him since she had left him he had not read a single book that was worth the reading and he knew it all he was conscious that he was becoming disgraced and degraded he would sooner have shot himself than have walked into his club or even have allowed himself to be seen by daylight in pall mall or piccadilly he had taken in his misery to drinking little drops of brandy in the morning although he knew well that there was no shorter road to the devil than that opened by such a habit he looked up for a moment at bozzle and then asked him a question where is he now  you mean the colonel sir hes up in town sir a minding of his parliamentary duties he have been up all this month sir  they havent met  bozzle paused a moment before he replied and then smiled as he spoke it is so hard to say sir ladies is so cute and cunning ive watched as sharp as watching can go pretty near ive put a youngster on at each hend and both of em d hear a mouse stirring in his sleep i aint got no evidence mr trevelyan but if you ask me my opinion why in course theyve been together somewhere it stands to reason mr trevelyan dont it and bozzle as he said this smiled almost aloud  dn and bt it all for ever said trevelyan gnashing his teeth and moving away into union street as fast as he could walk and he did go away leaving bozzle standing in the middle of stony walk  hes disturbed in his mindquite orrid bozzle said when he got back to his wife he cursed and swore as made even me feel bad  b said his wife do you listen to me get in whats a howing and dont you have nothing more to do with it     chapter lx  another struggle   sir marmaduke and lady rowley were to reach england about the end of march or the beginning of april and both mrs trevelyan and nora rowley were almost sick for their arrival both their uncle and aunt had done very much for them had been true to them in their need and had submitted to endless discomforts in order that their nieces might have respectable shelter in their great need but nevertheless their conduct had not been of a kind to produce either love or friendship each of the sisters felt that she had been much better off at nuncombe putney and that either the weakness of mrs stanbury or the hardness of priscilla was preferable to the repulsive forbearance of their clerical host he did not scold them he never threw it in mrs trevelyans teeth that she had been separated from her husband by her own fault he did not tell them of his own discomfort but he showed it in every gesture and spoke of it in every tone of his voiceso that mrs trevelyan could not refrain from apologising for the misfortune of her presence  my dear he said things cant be pleasant and unpleasant at the same time you were quite right to come here i am glad for all our sakes that sir marmaduke will be with us so soon  she had almost given up in her mind the hope that she had long cherished that she might some day be able to live again with her husband every step which he now took in reference to her seemed to be prompted by so bitter an hostility that she could not but believe that she was hateful to him how was it possible that a husband and his wife should again come together when there had been between them such an emissary as a detective policeman mrs trevelyan had gradually come to learn that bozzle had been at nuncombe putney watching her and to be aware that she was still under the surveillance of his eye for some months past now she had neither seen colonel osborne nor heard from him he had certainly by his folly done much to produce the ruin which had fallen upon her but it never occurred to her to blame him indeed she did not know that he was liable to blame mr outhouse always spoke of him with indignant scorn and nora had learned to think that much of their misery was due to his imprudence but mrs trevelyan would not see this and not seeing it was more widely separated from her husband than she would have been had she acknowledged that any excuse for his misconduct had been afforded by the vanity and folly of the other man  lady rowley had written to have a furnished house taken for them from the first of april and a house had been secured in manchester street the situation in question is not one which is of itself very charming nor is it supposed to be in a high degree fashionable but nora looked forward to her escape from st diddulphs to manchester street as though paradise were to be reopened to her as soon as she should be there with her father and mother she was quite clear now as to her course about hugh stanbury she did not doubt but that she could so argue the matter as to get the consent of her father and mother she felt herself to be altogether altered in her views of life since experience had come upon her first at nuncombe putney and after that much more heavily and seriously at st diddulphs she looked back as though to a childish dream to the ideas which had prevailed with her when she had told herself as she used to do so frequently that she was unfit to be a poor mans wife why should she be more unfit for such a position than another of course there were many thoughts in her mind much of memory if nothing of regret in regard to mr glascock and the splendour that had been offered to her she had had her chance of being a rich mans wife and had rejected ithad rejected it twice with her eyes open readers will say that if she loved hugh stanbury with all her heart there could be nothing of regret in her reflections but we are perhaps accustomed in judging for ourselves and of others to draw the lines too sharply and to say that on this side lie vice folly heartlessness and greedand on the other honour love truth and wisdomthe good and the bad each in its own domain but the good and the bad mix themselves so thoroughly in our thoughts even in our aspirations that we must look for excellence rather in overcoming evil than in freeing ourselves from its influence there had been many moments of regret with norabut none of remorse at the very moment in which she had sent mr glascock away from her and had felt that he had now been sent away for always she had been full of regret since that there had been many hours in which she had thought of her own selflesson of that teaching by which she had striven to convince herself that she could never fitly become a poor mans wife but the upshot of it all was a healthy pride in what she had done and a strong resolution that she would make shirts and hem towels for her husband if he required it it had been given her to choose and she had chosen she had found herself unable to tell a man that she loved him when she did not love himand equally unable to conceal the love which she did feel if he wheeled a barrow of turnips about the street id marry him tomorrow she said to her sister one afternoon as they were sitting together in the room which ought to have been their uncles study  if he wheeled a big barrow youd have to wheel a little one said her sister  then id do it i shouldnt mind there has been this advantage in st diddulphs that nothing can be triste nothing dull nothing ugly after it  it may be so with you norathat is in imagination  what i mean is that living here has taught me much that i never could have learned in curzon street i used to think myself such a fine young womanbut upon my word i think myself a finer one now  i dont quite know what you mean  i dont quite know myself but i nearly know i do know this that ive made up my own mind about what i mean to do  youll change it dear when mamma is here and things are comfortable again its my belief that mr glascock would come to you again tomorrow if you would let him mrs trevelyan was naturally in complete ignorance of the experience of transatlantic excellence which mr glascock had encountered in italy  but i certainly should not let him how would it be possible after what i wrote to hugh  all that might pass away said mrs trevelyanslowly after a long pause  all what might pass away have i not given him a distinct promise have i not told him that i loved him and sworn that i would be true to him can that be made to pass awayeven if one wished it  of course it can nothing need be fixed for you till you have stood at the altar with a man and been made his wife you may choose still i can never choose again  i never will at any rate said nora  then there was another pause it seems strange to me nora said the elder sister that after what you have seen you should be so keen to be married to any one  what is a girl to do  better drown herself than do as i have done only think what there is before me what i have gone through is nothing to it of course i must go back to the islands where else am i to live who else will take me  come to us said nora  us nora who are the us but in no way would that be possible papa will be here perhaps for six months nora thought it quite possible that she might have a home of her own before six months were passedeven though she might be wheeling the smaller barrowbut she would not say so and by that time everything must be decided  i suppose it must  of course papa and mamma must go back said mrs trevelyan  papa might take a pension hes entitled to a pension now  hell never do that as long as he can have employment theyll go back and i must go with them who else would take me in  i know who would take you in emily  my darling that is romance as for myself i should not care where i went if it were even to remain here i could bear it  i could not said nora decisively  it is so different with you dear i dont suppose it is possible i should take my boy with me to the islands and howam ito goanywherewithout him then she broke down and fell into a paroxysm of sobs and was in very truth a brokenhearted woman  nora was silent for some minutes but at last she spoke why do you not go back to him emily  how am i to go back to him what am i to do to make him take me back at this very moment trevelyan was in the house but they did not know it  write to him said nora  what am i to say in very truth i do believe that he is mad if i write to him should i defend myself or accuse myself a dozen times i have striven to write such a letternot that i might send it but that i might find what i could say should i ever wish to send it and it is impossible i can only tell him how unjust he has been how cruel how mad how wicked  could you not say to him simply thislet us be together wherever it may be and let bygones be bygones  while he is watching me with a policeman while he is still thinking that i entertain alover while he believes that i am the base thing that he has dared to think me  he has never believed it  then how can he be such a villain as to treat me like this i could not go to him noranot unless i went to him as one who was known to be mad over whom in his wretched condition it would be my duty to keep watch in no other way could i overcome my abhorrence of the outrages to which he has subjected me  but for the childs sake emily  ah yes if it were simply to grovel in the dust before him it should be done if humiliation would sufficeor any selfabasement that were possible to me but i should be false if i said that i look forward to any such possibility how can he wish to have me back again after what he has said and done i am his wife and he has disgraced me before all men by his own words and what have i done that i should not have donewhat left undone on his behalf that i should have done it is hard that the foolish workings of a weak mans mind should be able so completely to ruin the prospects of a womans life  nora was beginning to answer this by attempting to shew that the husbands madness was perhaps only temporary when there came a knock at the door and mrs outhouse was at once in the room it will be well that the reader should know what had taken place at the parsonage while the two sisters had been together upstairs so that the nature of mrs outhouses mission to them may explain itself mr outhouse had been in his closet downstairs when the maidservant brought word to him that mr trevelyan was in the parlour and was desirous of seeing him  mr trevelyan said the unfortunate clergyman holding up both his hands the servant understood the tragic importance of the occasion quite as well as did her master and simply shook her head has your mistress seen him said the master the girl again shook her head ask your mistress to come to me said the clergyman then the girl disappeared and in a few minutes mrs outhouse equally imbued with the tragic elements of the day was with her husband  mr outhouse began by declaring that no consideration should induce him to see trevelyan and commissioned his wife to go to the man and tell him that he must leave the house when the unfortunate woman expressed an opinion that trevelyan had some legal rights upon which he might probably insist mr outhouse asserted roundly that he could have no legal right to remain in that parsonage against the will of the rector if he wants to claim his wife and child he must do it by lawnot by force and thank god sir marmaduke will be here before he can do that but i cant make him go said mrs outhouse tell him that youll send for a policeman said the clergyman  it had come to pass that there had been messages backwards and forwards between the visitor and the master of the house all carried by that unfortunate lady trevelyan did not demand that his wife and child should be given up to himdid not even on this occasion demand that his boy should be surrendered to himnow at once he did say very repeatedly that of course he must have his boy but seemed to imply that under certain circumstances he would be willing to take his wife to live with him again this appeared to mrs outhouse to be so manifestly the one thing that was desirableto be the only solution of the difficulty that could be admitted as a solution at allthat she went to work on that hint and ventured to entertain a hope that a reconciliation might be effected she implored her husband to lend a hand to the workby which she intended to imply that he should not only see trevelyan but consent to meet the sinner on friendly terms but mr outhouse was on the occasion even more than customarily obstinate his wife might do what she liked he would neither meddle nor make he would not willingly see mr trevelyan in his own houseunless indeed mr trevelyan should attempt to force his way up into the nursery then he said that which left no doubt on his wifes mind that should any violence be attempted her husband would manfully join the mêlée  but it soon became evident that no such attempt was to be made on that day trevelyan was lachrymose heartbroken and a sight pitiable to behold when mrs outhouse loudly asserted that his wife had not sinned against him in the leastnot in a tittle mr trevelyan she repeated over and over againhe began to assert himself declaring that she had seen the man in devonshire and corresponded with him since she had been at st diddulphs and when the lady had declared that the latter assertion was untrue he had shaken his head and had told her that perhaps she did not know all but the misery of the man had its effect upon her and at last she proposed to be the bearer of a message to his wife he had demanded to see his child offering to promise that he would not attempt to take the boy by force on this occasionsaying also that his claim by law was so good that no force could be necessary it was proposed by mrs outhouse that he should first see the motherand to this he at last assented how blessed a thing would it be if these two persons could be induced to forget the troubles of the last twelve months and once more to love and trust each other but sir said mrs outhouse putting her hand upon his armyou must not upbraid her for she will not bear it she knows nothing of what is due to a husband said trevelyan gloomily the task was not hopeful but nevertheless the poor woman resolved to do her best  and now mrs outhouse was in her nieces room asking her to go down and see her husband little louis had at the time been with the nurse and the very moment that the mother heard that the childs father was in the house she jumped up and rushed away to get possession of her treasure has he come for baby nora asked in dismay then mrs outhouse anxious to obtain a convert to her present views boldly declared that mr trevelyan had no such intention mrs trevelyan came back at once with the boy and then listened to all her aunts arguments but i will not take baby with me she said at last it was decided that she should go down alone and that the child should afterwards be taken to his father in the drawingroom mrs outhouse pledging herself that the whole household should combine in her defence if mr trevelyan should attempt to take the child out of that room but what am i to say to him she asked  say as little as possible said mrs outhouseexcept to make him understand that he has been in error in imputing fault to you  he will never understand that said mrs trevelyan  a considerable time elapsed after that before she could bring herself to descend the stairs now that her husband was so near her and that her aunt had assured her that she might reinstate herself in her position if she could only abstain from saying hard words to him she wished that he was away from her again in italy she knew that she could not refrain from hard words how was it possible that she should vindicate her own honour without asserting with all her strength that she had been illused and to speak truth on the matter her love for the man which had once been true and eager had been quelled by the treatment she had received she had clung to her love in some shape in spite of the accusations made against her till she had heard that the policeman had been set upon her heels could it be possible that any woman should love a man or at least that any wife should love a husband after such usage as that at last she crept gently down the stairs and stood at the parlourdoor she listened and could hear his steps as he paced backwards and forwards through the room she looked back and could see the face of the servant peering round from the kitchenstairs she could not endure to be watched in her misery and thus driven she opened the parlourdoor louis she said walking into the room aunt mary has desired me to come to you  emily he exclaimed and ran to her and embraced her she did not seek to stop him but she did not return the kiss which he gave her then he held her by her hands and looked into her face and she could see how strangely he was altered she thought that she would hardly have known him had she not been sure that it was he she herself was also changed who can bear sorrow without such change till age has fixed the lines of the face or till care has made them hard and unmalleable but the effect on her was as nothing to that which grief remorse and desolation had made on him he had had no child with him no sister no friend bozzle had been his only refugea refuge not adapted to make life easier to such a man as trevelyan and hein spite of the accusations made by himself against his wife within his own breast hourly since he had left herhad found it to be very difficult to satisfy his own conscience he told himself from hour to hour that he knew that he was right but in very truth he was ever doubting his own conduct  you have been ill louis she said looking at him  ill at ease emilyvery ill at ease a sore heart will make the face thin as well as fever or ague since we parted i have not had much to comfort me  nor have inor any of us said she how was comfort to come from such a parting  then they both stood silent together he was still holding her by the hand but she was careful not to return his pressure she would not take her hand away from him but she would show him no sign of softness till he should have absolutely acquitted her of the accusation he had made against her we are man and wife he said after awhile in spite of all that has come and gone i am yours and you are mine  you should have remembered that always louis  i have never forgotten itnever in no thought have i been untrue to you my heart has never changed since first i gave it you there came a bitter frown upon her face of which she was so conscious herself that she turned her face away from him she still remembered her lesson that she was not to anger him and therefore she refrained from answering him at all but the answer was there hot within her bosom had he loved herand yet suspected that she was false to him and to her vows simply because she had been on terms of intimacy with an old friend had he loved her and yet turned her from his house had he loved herand set a policeman to watch her had he loved her and yet spoken evil of her to all their friends had he loved her and yet striven to rob her of her child will you come to me he said  i suppose it will be better so she answered slowly  then you will promise me he paused and attempted to turn her towards him so that he might look her in the face  promise what she said quickly glancing round at him and drawing her hand away from him as she did so  that all intercourse with colonel osborne shall be at an end  i will make no promise you come to me to add one insult to another had you been a man you would not have named him to me after what you have done to me  that is absurd i have a right to demand from you such a pledge i am willing to believe that you have not  have not what  that you have not utterly disgraced me  god in heaven that i should hear this she exclaimed louis trevelyan i have not disgraced you at allin thought in word in deed in look or in gesture it is you that have disgraced yourself and ruined me and degraded even your own child  is this the way in which you welcome me  certainly it isin this way and in no other if you speak to me of what is past without acknowledging your error her brow became blacker and blacker as she continued to speak to him it would be best that nothing should be saidnot a word that it all should be regarded as an ugly dream but when you come to me and at once go back to it all and ask me for a promise  am i to understand then that all idea of submission to your husband is to be at an end  i will submit to no imputation on my honoureven from you one would have thought that it would have been for you to preserve it untarnished  and you will give me no assurance as to your future life  nonecertainly none if you want promises from me there can be no hope for the future what am i to promise that i will not havea lover what respect can i enjoy as your wife if such a promise be needed if you should choose to fancy that it had been broken you would set your policeman to watch me again louis we can never live together again ever with comfort unless you acknowledge in your own heart that you have used me shamefully  were you right to see him in devonshire  of course i was right why should i not see himor any one  and you will see him again  when papa comes of course i shall see him  then it is hopeless said he turning away from her  if that man is to be a source of disquiet to you it is hopeless she answered if you cannot so school yourself that he shall be the same to you as other men it is quite hopeless you must still be madas you have been mad hitherto  he walked about the room restlessly for a time while she stood with assumed composure near the window send me my child he said at last  he shall come to you louisfor a little but he is not to be taken out from hence is that a promise  you are to exact promises from me where my own rights are concerned while you refuse to give me any though i am entitled to demand them i order you to send the boy to me is he not my own  is he not mine too and is he not all that you have left to me  he paused again and then gave the promise let him be brought to me he shall not be removed now i intend to have him i tell you so fairly he shall be taken from you unless you come back to me with such assurances as to your future conduct as i have a right to demand there is much that the law cannot give me it cannot procure wifelike submission love gratitude or even decent matronly conduct but that which it can give me i will have  she walked off to the door and then as she was quitting the room she spoke to him once again alas louis she said neither can the law nor medicine nor religion restore to you that fine intellect which foolish suspicions have destroyed then she left him and returned to the room in which her aunt and nora and the child were all clustered together waiting to learn the effects of the interview the two women asked their questions with their eyes rather than with spoken words it is all over said mrs trevelyan there is nothing left for me but to go back to papa i only hear the same accusations repeated again and again and make myself subject to the old insults then mrs outhouse knew that she could interfere no further and that in truth nothing could be done till the return of sir marmaduke should relieve her and her husband from all further active concern in the matter  but trevelyan was still downstairs waiting for the child at last it was arranged that nora should take the boy into the drawingroom and that mrs outhouse should fetch the father up from the parlour to the room above it angry as was mrs trevelyan with her husband not the less was she anxious to make the boy goodlooking and seemly in his fathers eyes she washed the childs face put on him a clean frill and a pretty ribbon and as she did so she bade him kiss his papa and speak nicely to him and love him poor papa is unhappy she said and louey must be very good to him the boy child though he was understood much more of what was passing around him than his mother knew how was he to love papa when mamma did not do so in some shape that idea had framed itself in his mind and as he was taken down he knew it was impossible that he should speak nicely to his papa nora did as she was bidden and went down to the firstfloor mrs outhouse promising that even if she were put out of the room by mr trevelyan she would not stir from the landing outside the door descended to the parlour and quickly returned with the unfortunate father mr outhouse in the meantime was still sitting in his closet tormented with curiosity but yet determined not to be seen till the intruder should have left his house  i hope you are well nora he said as he entered the room with mrs outhouse  quite well thank you louis  i am sorry that our troubles should have deprived you of the home you had been taught to expect to this nora made no reply but escaped and went up to her sister my poor little boy said trevelyan taking the child and placing it on his knee i suppose you have forgotten your unfortunate father the child of course said nothing but just allowed himself to be kissed  he is looking very well said mrs outhouse  is he i dare say he is well louey my boy are you happy the question was asked in a voice that was dismal beyond compare and it also remained unanswered he had been desired to speak nicely to his papa but how was it possible that a child should speak nicely under such a load of melancholy he will not speak to me said trevelyan i suppose it is what i might have expected then the child was put off his knee on to the floor and began to whimper a few months since he would sit there for hours with his head upon my breast said trevelyan  a few months is a long time in the life of such an infant said mrs outhouse  he may go away said trevelyan then the child was led out of the room and sent up to his mother  emily has done all she can to make the child love your memory said mrs outhouse  to love my memory whatas though i were dead i will teach him to love me as i am mrs outhouse i do not think that it is too late will you tell your husband from me with my compliments that i shall cause him to be served with a legal demand for the restitution of my child  but sir marmaduke will be here in a few days  i know nothing of that sir marmaduke is nothing to me now my child is my ownand so is my wife sir marmaduke has no authority over either one or the other i find my child here and it is here that i must look for him i am sorry that you should be troubled but the fault does not rest with me mr outhouse has refused to give me up my own child and i am driven to take such steps for his recovery as the law has put within my reach  why did you turn your wife out of doors mr trevelyan asked mrs outhouse boldly  i did not turn her out of doors i provided a fitting shelter for her i gave her everything that she could want you know what happened that man went down and was received there i defy you mrs outhouse to say that it was my fault  mrs outhouse did attempt to show him that it was his fault but while she was doing so he left the house i dont think she could go back to him said mrs outhouse to her husband he is quite insane upon this matter  i shall be insane i know said mr outhouse if sir marmaduke does not come home very quickly nevertheless he quite ignored any legal power that might be brought to bear against him as to the restitution of the child to its father     chapter lxi  parkers hotel mowbray street   within a week of the occurrence which is related in the last chapter there came a telegram from southampton to the parsonage at st diddulphs saying that sir marmaduke and lady rowley had reached england on the evening of that day they were to lodge at a small family hotel in baker street and both mrs trevelyan and nora were to be with them the leavetaking at the parsonage was painful as on both sides there existed a feeling that affection and sympathy were wanting the uncle and aunt had done their duty and both mrs trevelyan and nora felt that they ought to have been demonstrative and cordial in their gratitudebut they found it impossible to become so and the rector could not pretend but that he was glad to be rid of his guests there were too some last words about money to be spoken which were grievous thorns in the poor mans flesh two bank notes however were put upon his table and he knew that unless he took them he could not pay for the provisions which his unwelcome visitors had consumed surely there never was a man so cruelly illused as had been mr outhouse in all this matter another such winter as that would put me in my grave he said when his wife tried to comfort him after they were gone i know that they have both been very good to us said mrs trevelyan as she and her sister together with the child and the nurse hurried away towards baker street in a cab but i have never for a moment felt that they were glad to have us but how could they have been glad to have us she added afterwards when we brought such trouble with us but they to whom they were going now would receive her with joywould make her welcome with all her load of sorrows would give to her a sympathy which it was impossible that she should receive from others though she might not be happy nowfor in truth how could she be ever really happy againthere would be a joy to her in placing her child in her mothers arms and in receiving her fathers warm caresses that her father would be very vehement in his anger against her husband she knew wellfor sir marmaduke was a vehement man but there would be some support for her in the very violence of his wrath and at this moment it was such support that she most needed as they journeyed together in the cab the married sister seemed to be in the higher spirits of the two she was sure at any rate that those to whom she was going would place themselves on her side nora had her own story to tell about hugh stanbury and was by no means so sure that her tale would be received with cordial agreement let me tell them myself she whispered to her sister not tonight because they will have so much to say to you but i shall tell mamma tomorrow  the train by which the rowleys were to reach london was due at the station at 730 pm and the two sisters timed their despatch from st diddulphs so as to enable them to reach the hotel at eight we shall be there now before mamma said nora because they will have so much luggage and so many things and the trains are always late when they started from the door of the parsonage mr outhouse gave the direction to the cabman greggs hotel baker street then at once he began to console himself in that they were gone  it was a long drive from st diddulphs in the east to marylebone in the west of london none of the party in the cab knew anything of the region through which they passed the cabman took the line by the back of the bank and finsbury square and the city road thinking it best probably to avoid the crush at holborn hill though at the expense of something of a circuit but of this mrs trevelyan and nora knew nothing had their way taken them along piccadilly or through mayfair or across grosvenor square they would have known where they were but at present they were not thinking of those once muchloved localities the cab passed the angel and up and down the hill at pentonville and by the kings cross stations and through euston squareand then it turned up gower street surely the man should have gone on along the new road now that he had come so far out of his way but of this the two ladies knew nothingnor did the nurse it was a dark windy night but the lamps in the streets had given them light so that they had not noticed the night nor did they notice it now as the streets became narrower and darker they were hardly thinking that their journey was yet at an end and the mother was in the act of covering her boys face as he lay asleep on the nurses lap when the cab was stopped nora looking out through the window saw the word hotel over a doorway and was satisfied shall i take the child maam said a man in black and the child was handed out nora was the first to follow and she then perceived that the door of the hotel was not open mrs trevelyan followed and then they looked round themand the child was gone they heard the rattle of another cab as it was carried away at a gallop round a distant cornerand then some inkling of what had happened came upon them the father had succeeded in getting possession of his child  it was a narrow dark street very quiet having about it a certain air of poor respectabilityan obscure noiseless street without even a sign of life some unfortunate one had endeavoured here to keep an hotelbut there was no hotel kept there now there had been much craft in selecting the place in which the child had been taken from them as they looked around them perceiving the terrible misfortune which had befallen them there was not a human being near them save the cabman who was occupied in unchaining or pretending to unchain the heavy mass of luggage on the roof the windows of the house before which they were stopping were closed and nora perceived at once that the hotel was not inhabited the cabman must have perceived it also as for the man who had taken the child the nurse could only say that he was dressed in black like a waiter that he had a napkin under his arm and no hat on his head he had taken the boy tenderly in his armsand then she had seen nothing further the first thing that nora had seen as she stood on the pavement was the other cab moving off rapidly  mrs trevelyan had staggered against the railings and was soon screaming in her wretchedness before long there was a small crowd around them comprising three or four women a few boys an old man or twoand a policeman to the policeman nora had soon told the whole story and the cabman was of course attacked but the cabman played his part very well he declared that he had done just what he had been told to do nora was indeed sure that she had heard her uncle desire him to drive to greggs hotel in baker street the cabman in answer to this declared that he had not clearly heard the old gentlemans directions but that a man whom he had conceived to be a servant had very plainly told him to drive to parkers hotel mowbray street gower street i comed ever so far out of my way said the cabman to avoid the rumpus with the homnibuses at the hillcause the ladies things is so heavy wed never got up if the orse had once jibbed all which though it had nothing to do with the matter seemed to impress the policeman with the idea that the cabman if not a true man was going to be too clever for them on this occasion and the crafty cabman went on to declare that his horse was so tired with the load that he could not go on to baker street they must get another cab take his number of course they could take his number there was his number his fare was four and sixthat is if the ladies wouldnt pay him anything extra for the terrible load and he meant to have it it would be sixpence more if they kept him there many minutes longer the number was taken and another cab was got and the luggage was transferred and the money was paid while the unhappy mother was still screaming in hysterics against the railings what had been done was soon clear enough to all those around her nora had told the policeman and had told one of the women thinking to obtain their sympathy and assistance its the kids dada as has taken it said one man and there aint nothing to be done there was nothing to be donenothing at any rate then and there  nora had been very eager that the cabman should be arrested but the policeman assured her that such an arrest was out of the question and would have been useless had it been possible the man would be forthcoming if his presence should be again desired but he had probablyso said the policemanreally been desired to drive to mowbray street they knows where to find me if they wants meonly i must be paid my time said the cabman confidently and the policeman was of opinion that as the boy had been kidnapped on behalf of the father no legal steps could be taken either for the recovery of the child or for the punishment of the perpetrators of the act he got up however on the box of the cab and accompanied the party to the hotel in baker street they reached it almost exactly at the same time with sir marmaduke and lady rowley and the reader must imagine the confusion the anguish and the disappointment of that meeting mrs trevelyan was hardly in possession of her senses when she reached her mother and could not be induced to be tranquil even when she was assured by her father that her son would suffer no immediate evil by being transferred to his fathers hands she in her frenzy declared that she would never see her little one again and seemed to think that the father might not improbably destroy the child he is mad papa and does not know what he does do you mean to say that a madman may do as he pleasesthat he may rob my child from me in the streetsthat he may take him out of my very arms in that way and she was almost angry with her father because no attempt was made that night to recover the boy  sir marmaduke who was not himself a good lawyer had been closeted with the policeman for a quarter of an hour and had learned the policemans views of course the father of the child was the person who had done the deed whether the cabman had been in the plot or not was not matter of much consequence there could be no doubt that some one had told the man to go to parkers hotel as the cab was starting and it would probably be impossible to punish him in the teeth of such instructions sir marmaduke however could doubtless have the cabman summoned and as for the absolute abduction of the child the policeman was of opinion that a father could not be punished for obtaining possession of his son by such a stratagem unless the custody of the child had been made over to the mother by some court of law the policeman indeed seemed to think that nothing could be done and sir marmaduke was inclined to agree with him when this was explained to mrs trevelyan by her mother she again became hysterical in her agony and could hardly be restrained from going forth herself to look for her lost treasure  it need hardly be further explained that trevelyan had planned the stratagem in concert with mr bozzle bozzle though strongly cautioned by his wife to keep himself out of danger in the matter was sorely tempted by his employers offer of a hundred pounds he positively refused to be a party to any attempt at violence at st diddulphs but when he learned as he did learn that mrs trevelyan with her sister and baby were to be transferred from st diddulphs in a cab to baker street and that the journey was luckily to be made during the shades of evening his active mind went to work and he arranged the plan there were many difficulties and even some pecuniary difficulty he bargained that he should have his hundred pounds clear of all deduction for expenses and then the attendant expenses were not insignificant it was necessary that there should be four men in the service all good and true and men require to be well paid for such goodness and truth there was the man himself an expoliceman who gave the instructions to the first cabman as he was starting the cabman would not undertake the job at all unless he were so instructed on the spot asserting that in this way he would be able to prove that the orders he obeyed came from the ladys husband and there was the crafty pseudowaiter with the napkin and no hat who had carried the boy to the cab in which his father was sitting and there were the two cabmen bozzle planned it all and with some difficulty arranged the preliminaries how successful was the scheme we have seen and bozzle for a month was able to assume a superiority over his wife which that honest woman found to be very disagreeable there aint no fraudulent abduction in it at all bozzle exclaimed because a wife aint got no rights again her husbandnot in such a matter as that mrs bozzle implied that if her husband were to take her child away from her without her leave shed let him know something about it but as the husband had in his possession the note for a hundred pounds realized mrs bozzle had not much to say in support of her view of the case  on the morning after the occurrence while sir marmaduke was waiting with his solicitor upon a magistrate to find whether anything could be done the following letter was brought to mrs trevelyan at greggs hotel      our child is safe with me and will remain so if you care    to obtain legal advice you will find that i as his father    have a right to keep him under my protection i shall    do so but will allow you to see him as soon as i shall    have received a full guarantee that you have no idea of    withdrawing him from my charge     a home for yourself with me is still open to youon    condition that you will give me the promise that i have    demanded from you and as long as i shall not hear that    you again see or communicate with the person to whose    acquaintance i object while you remain away from me i    will cause you to be paid £50 a month as i do not wish    that you should be a burden on others but this payment    will depend also on your not seeing or holding any    communication with the person to whom i have alluded     your affectionate and offended husband     louis trevelyan     a letter addressed to the acrobats club will reach me   sir rowley came home dispirited and unhappy and could not give much comfort to his daughter the magistrate had told him that though the cabman might probably be punished for taking the ladies otherwise than as directedif the direction to baker street could be provednothing could be done to punish the father the magistrate explained that under a certain act of parliament the mother might apply to the court of chancery for the custody of any children under seven years of age and that the court would probably grant such custodyunless it were shewn that the wife had left her husband without sufficient cause the magistrate could not undertake to say whether or no sufficient cause had here been givenor whether the husband was in fault or the wife it was however clear that nothing could be done without application to the court of chancery it appearedso said the magistratethat the husband had offered a home to his wife and that in offering it he had attempted to impose no conditions which could be shown to be cruel before a judge the magistrate thought that mr trevelyan had done nothing illegal in taking the child from the cab sir marmaduke on hearing this was of opinion that nothing could be gained by legal interference his private desire was to get hold of trevelyan and pull him limb from limb lady rowley thought that her daughter had better go back to her husband let the future consequences be what they might and the poor desolate mother herself had almost brought herself to offer to do so having in her brain some idea that she would after a while be able to escape with her boy as for love for her husband certainly there was none now left in her bosom nor could she teach herself to think it possible that she should ever live with him again on friendly terms but she would submit to anything with the object of getting back her boy three or four letters were written to mr trevelyan in as many days from his wife from lady rowley and from nora in which various overtures were made trevelyan wrote once again to his wife she knew he said already the terms on which she might come back these terms were still open to her as for the boy he certainly should not leave his father a meeting might be planned on condition that he trevelyan were provided with a written assurance from his wife that she would not endeavour to remove the boy and that he himself should be present at the meeting  thus the first week was passed after sir marmadukes returnand a most wretched time it was for all the party at greggs hotel     chapter lxii  lady rowley makes an attempt      illustration  nothing could be more uncomfortable than the state of sir marmaduke rowleys family for the first ten days after the arrival in london of the governor of the mandarin islands lady rowley had brought with her two of her girlsthe third and fourthand as we know had been joined by the two eldest so that there was a large family of ladies gathered together a house had been taken in manchester street to which they had intended to transfer themselves after a single night passed at greggs hotel but the trouble and sorrow inflicted upon them by the abduction of mrs trevelyans child and the consequent labours thrust upon sir marmadukes shoulders had been so heavy that they had slept six nights at the hotel before they were able to move themselves into the house prepared for them by that time all idea had been abandoned of recovering the child by any legal means to be taken as a consequence of the illegality of the abduction the boy was with his father and the lawyers seemed to think that the fathers rights were paramountas he had offered a home to his wife without any conditions which a court of law would adjudge to be cruel if she could shew that he had driven her to live apart from him by his own bad conduct then probably the custody of her boy might be awarded to her until the child should be seven years old but when the circumstances of the case were explained to sir marmadukes lawyer by lady rowley that gentleman shook his head mrs trevelyan had he said no case with which she could go into court then by degrees there were words whispered as to the husbands madness the lawyer said that that was a matter for the doctors if a certain amount of medical evidence could be obtained to shew that the husband was in truth mad the wife could no doubt obtain the custody of the child when this was reported to mrs trevelyan she declared that conduct such as her husbands must suffice to prove any man to be mad but at this sir marmaduke shook his head and lady rowley sat sadly silent with her daughters hand within her own they would not dare to tell her that she could regain her child by that plea  during those ten days they did not learn whither the boy had been carried nor did they know even where the father might be found sir marmaduke followed up the address as given in the letter and learned from the porter at the acrobats that the gentlemans letters were sent to no 55 stony walk union street borough to this uncomfortable locality sir marmaduke travelled more than once thrice he went thither intent on finding his soninlaws residence on the two first occasions he saw no one but mrs bozzle and the discretion of that lady in declining to give any information was most admirable trewillian yes she had heard the name certainly it might be that her husband had business engagements with a gent of that name she would not say even that for certain as it was not her custom ever to make any inquiries as to her husbands business engagements her husbands business engagements were she said much too important for the likes of she to know anything about them when was bozzle likely to be at home bozzle was never likely to be at home according to her showing bozzle was of all husbands the most erratic he might perhaps come in for an hour or two in the middle of the day on a wednesday or perhaps would take a cup of tea at home on friday evening but anything so fitful and uncertain as were bozzles appearances in the bosom of his family was not to be conceived in the mind of woman sir marmaduke then called in the middle of the day on wednesday but bozzle was reported to be away in the provinces his wife had no idea in which of the provinces he was at that moment engaged the persevering governor from the islands called again on the friday evening and then by chance bozzle was found at home but sir marmaduke succeeded in gaining very little information even from bozzle the man acknowledged that he was employed by mr trevelyan any letter or parcel left with him for mr trevelyan should be duly sent to that gentleman if sir marmaduke wanted mr trevelyans address he could write to mr trevelyan and ask for it if mr trevelyan declined to give it was it likely that he bozzle should betray it sir marmaduke explained who he was at some length bozzle with a smile assured the governor that he knew very well who he was he let drop a few words to show that he was intimately acquainted with the whole course of sir marmadukes family affairs he knew all about the mandarins and colonel osborne and greggs hotelnot that he said anything about parkers hoteland the colonial office he spoke of miss nora and even knew the names of the other two young ladies miss sophia and miss lucy it was a weakness with bozzlethat of displaying his information he would have much liked to be able to startle sir marmaduke by describing the government house in the island or by telling him something of his old carriagehorses but of such information as sir marmaduke desired sir marmaduke got none  and there were other troubles which fell very heavily upon the poor governor who had come home as it were for a holiday and who was a man hating work naturally and who from the circumstances of his life had never been called on to do much work a man may govern the mandarins and yet live in comparative idleness to do such governing work well a man should have a good presence a flow of words which should mean nothing an excellent temper and a love of hospitality with these attributes sir rowley was endowed for though his disposition was by nature hot for governing purposes it had been brought by practice under good control he had now been summoned home through the machinations of his dangerous old friend colonel osborne in order that he might give the results of his experience in governing before a committee of the house of commons in coming to england on this business he had thought much more of his holiday of his wife and children of his daughters at home of his allowance per day while he was to be away from his government and of his salary to be paid to him entire during his absence instead of being halved as it would be if he were away on leavehe had thought much more in coming home on these easy and pleasant matters than he did on the work that was to be required from him when he arrived and then it came to pass that he felt himself almost injured when the colonial office demanded his presence from day to day and when clerks bothered him with questions as to which they expected ready replies but in replying to which sir marmaduke was by no means ready the working men at the colonial office had not quite thought that sir marmaduke was the most fitting man for the job in hand there was a certain mr thomas smith at another set of islands in quite another part of the world who was supposed by these working men at home to be a very paragon of a governor if he had been had homeso said the working menno committee of the house would have been able to make anything of him they might have asked him questions week after week and he would have answered them all fluently and would have committed nobody he knew all the ins and outs of governingdid mr thomas smithand was a match for the sharpest committee that ever sat at westminster poor sir marmaduke was a man of a very different sort all of which was known by the working men but the parliamentary interest had been too strong and here was sir marmaduke at home but the working men were not disposed to make matters so pleasant for sir marmaduke as sir marmaduke had expected the committee would not examine sir marmaduke till after easter in the middle of april but it was expected of him that he should read bluebooks without number and he was so catechised by the working men that he almost began to wish himself back at the mandarins in this way the new establishment in manchester street was not at first in a happy or even in a contented condition  at last after about ten days lady rowley did succeed in obtaining an interview with trevelyan a meeting was arranged through bozzle and took place in a very dark and gloomy room at an inn in the city why bozzle should have selected the bremen coffee house in poulters alley for this meeting no fit reason can surely be given unless it was that he conceived himself bound to select the most dreary locality within his knowledge on so melancholy an occasion poulters alley is a narrow dark passage somewhere behind the mansion house and the bremen coffee housewhy so called no one can now tellis one of those strange houses of public resort in the city at which the guests seem never to eat never to drink never to sleep but to come in and out after a mysterious and almost ghostly fashion seeing their friendsor perhaps their enemies in nooks and corners and carrying on their conferences in low melancholy whispers there is an aged waiter at the bremen coffee house and there is certainly one private sittingroom upstairs it was a dingy illfurnished room with an old large mahogany table an old horsehair sofa six horsehair chairs two old round mirrors and an old mahogany press in a corner it was a chamber so sad in its appearance that no wholesome useful work could have been done within it nor could men have eaten there with any appetite or have drained the flowing bowl with any touch of joviality it was generally used for such purposes as that to which it was now appropriated and no doubt had been taken by bozzle on more than one previous occasion here lady rowley arrived precisely at the hour fixed and was told that the gentleman was waiting upstairs for her  there had of course been many family consultations as to the manner in which this meeting should be arranged should sir marmaduke accompany his wifeor perhaps should sir marmaduke go alone lady rowley had been very much in favour of meeting mr trevelyan without any one to assist her in the conference as for sir marmaduke no meeting could be concluded between him and his soninlaw without a personal and probably a violent quarrel of that lady rowley had been quite sure sir marmaduke since he had been home had in the midst of his various troubles been driven into so vehement a state of indignation against his soninlaw as to be unable to speak of the wretched man without strongest terms of opprobrium nothing was too bad to be said by him of one who had illtreated his dearest daughter it must be admitted that sir marmaduke had heard only one side of the question he had questioned his daughter and had constantly seen his old friend osborne the colonels journey down to devonshire had been made to appear the most natural proceeding in the world the correspondence of which trevelyan thought so much had been shown to consist of such notes as might pass between any old gentleman and any young woman the promise which trevelyan had endeavoured to exact and which mrs trevelyan had declined to give appeared to the angry father to be a monstrous insult he knew that the colonel was an older man than himself and his emily was still to him only a young girl it was incredible to him that anybody should have regarded his old comrade as his daughters lover he did not believe that anybody had in truth so regarded the man the tale had been a monstrous invention on the part of the husband got up because he had become tired of his young wife according to sir marmadukes way of thinking trevelyan should either be thrashed within an inch of his life or else locked up in a madhouse colonel osborne shook his head and expressed a conviction that the poor man was mad  but lady rowley was more hopeful though she was as confident about her daughter as was the father she was less confident about the old friend she probably was alive to the fact that a man of fifty might put on the airs and assume the character of a young lover and acting on that suspicion entertaining also some hope that bad as matters now were they might be mended she had taken care that colonel osborne and mrs trevelyan should not be brought together sir marmaduke had fumed but lady rowley had been firm if you think so mamma mrs trevelyan had said with something of scorn in her toneof course let it be so lady rowley had said that it would be better so and the two had not seen each other since the memorable visit to nuncombe putney and now lady rowley was about to meet her soninlaw with some slight hope that she might arrange affairs she was quite aware that present indignation though certainly a gratification might be indulged in at much too great a cost it would be better for all reasons that emily should go back to her husband and her home and that trevelyan should be forgiven for his iniquities  bozzle was at the tavern during the interview but he was not seen by lady rowley he remained seated downstairs in one of the dingy corners ready to give assistance to his patron should assistance be needed when lady rowley was shown into the gloomy sittingroom by the old waiter she found trevelyan alone standing in the middle of the room and waiting for her this is a sad occasion he said as he advanced to give her his hand  a very sad occasion louis  i do not know what you may have heard of what has occurred lady rowley it is natural however to suppose that you must have heard me spoken of with censure  i think my child has been ill used louis she replied  of course you do i could not expect that it should be otherwise when it was arranged that i should meet you here i was quite aware that you would have taken the side against me before you had heard my story it is i that have been ill usedcruelly misused but i do not expect that you should believe me i do not wish you to do i would not for worlds separate the mother from her daughter  but why have you separated your own wife from her child  because it was my duty what is a father not to have the charge of his own son i have done nothing lady rowley to justify a separation which is contrary to the laws of nature  where is the boy louis  ahthat is just what i am not prepared to tell any one who has taken my wifes side till i know that my wife has consented to pay to me that obedience which i as her husband have a right to demand if emily will do as i request of her as i command heras trevelyan said this he spoke in a tone which was intended to give the highest possible idea of his own authority and dignitythen she may see her child without delay  what is it you request of my daughter  obediencesimply that submission to my will which is surely a wifes duty let her beg my pardon for what has occurred  she cannot do that louis  and solemnly promise me continued trevelyan not deigning to notice lady rowleys interruption that she will hold no further intercourse with that snake in the grass who wormed his way into my houselet her be humble and penitent and affectionate and then she shall be restored to her husband and to her child he said this walking up and down the room and waving his hand as though he were making a speech that was intended to be eloquentas though he had conceived that he was to overcome his motherinlaw by the weight of his words and the magnificence of his demeanour and yet his demeanour was ridiculous and his words would have had no weight had they not tended to show lady rowley how little prospect there was that she should be able to heal this breach he himself too was so altered in appearance since she had last seen him bright with the hopes of his young married happiness that she would hardly have recognised him had she met him in the street he was thin and pale and haggard and mean and as he stalked up and down the room it seemed to her that the very character of the man was changed she had not previously known him to be pompous unreasonable and absurd she did not answer him at once as she perceived that he had not finished his addressand after a moments pause he continued lady rowley there is nothing i would not have done for your daughterfor my wife all that i had was hers i did not dictate to her any mode of life i required from her no sacrifices i subjected her to no caprices but i was determined to be master in my own house  i do not think louis that she has ever denied your right to be master  to be master in my own house and to be paramount in my influence over her so much i had a right to demand  who has denied your right  she has submitted herself to the counsels and to the influences of a man who has endeavoured to undermine me in her affection in saying that i make my accusation as light against her as is possible i might make it much heavier and yet not sin against the truth  this is an illusion louis  ahwell no doubt it becomes you to defend your child was it an illusion when he went to devonshire was it an illusion when he corresponded with hercontrary to my express ordersboth before and after that unhallowed journey lady rowley there must be no more such illusions if my wife means to come back to me and to have her child in her own hands she must be penitent as regards the past and obedient as regards the future  there was a wicked bitterness in that word penitent which almost maddened lady rowley she had come to this meeting believing that trevelyan would be rejoiced to take back his wife if details could be arranged for his doing so which should not subject him to the necessity of crying peccavi but she found him speaking of his wife as though he would be doing her the greatest possible favour in allowing her to come back to him dressed in sackcloth and with ashes on her head she could understand from what she had heard that his tone and manner were much changed since he obtained possession of the child and that he now conceived that he had his wife within his power that he should become a tyrant because he had the power to tyrannise was not in accordance with her former conception of the mans characterbut then he was so changed that she felt that she knew nothing of the man who now stood before her i cannot acknowledge that my daughter has done anything that requires penitence said lady rowley  i dare say not but my view is different  she cannot admit herself to be wrong when she knows herself to be right you would not have her confess to a fault the very idea of which has always been abhorrent to her  she must be crushed in spirit lady rowley before she can again become a pure and happy woman  this is more than i can bear said lady rowley now at last worked up to a fever of indignation my daughter sir is as pure a woman as you have ever known or are likely to know you who should have protected her against the world will some day take blame to yourself as you remember that you have so cruelly maligned her then she walked away to the door and would not listen to the words which he was hurling after her she went down the stairs and out of the house and at the end of poulters alley found the cab which was waiting for her  trevelyan as soon as he was alone rang the bell and sent for bozzle and while the waiter was coming to him and until his myrmidon had appeared he continued to stalk up and down the room waving his hand in the air as though he were continuing his speech bozzle said he as soon as the man had closed the door i have changed my mind  as how mr trewillian  i shall make no further attempt i have done all that man can do and have done it in vain her father and mother uphold her in her conduct and she is lost to mefor ever  but the boy mr t  i have my child yesi have my child poor infant bozzle i look to you to see that none of them learn our retreat  as for that mr trewillianwhy facts is to be come at by one party pretty well as much as by another now suppose the things was changed wicey warseyand as i was hacting for the colonels party  d the colonel exclaimed trevelyan  just so mr trewillian but if i was hacting for the other party and they said to me bozzlewheres the boy why in three days id be down on the facts facts is open mr trewillian if you knows where to look for them  i shall take him abroadat once  think twice of it mr t the boy is so young you see and a mothers art is softer and lovinger than anything id think twice of it mr t before i kept em apart this was a line of thought which mr bozzles conscience had not forced him to entertain to the prejudice of his professional arrangements but now as he conversed with his employer and became by degrees aware of the failure of trevelyans mind some shade of remorse came upon him and made him say a word on behalf of the other party  am i not always thinking of it what else have they left me to think of that will do for today you had better come down to me tomorrow afternoon bozzle promised obedience to these instructions and as soon as his patron had started he paid the bill and took himself home  lady rowley as she travelled back to her house in manchester street almost made up her mind that the separation between her daughter and her soninlaw had better be continued it was a very sad conclusion to which to come but she could not believe that any highspirited woman could long continue to submit herself to the caprices of a man so unreasonable and dictatorial as he to whom she had just been listening were it not for the boy there would she felt be no doubt upon the matter and now as matters stood she thought that it should be their great object to regain possession of the child then she endeavoured to calculate what would be the result to her daughter if in very truth it should be found that the wretched man was mad to hope for such a result seemed to her to be very wickedand yet she hardly knew how not to hope for it  well mamma said emily trevelyan with a faint attempt at a smile you saw him  yes dearest i saw him i can only say that he is a most unreasonable man  and he would tell you nothing of louey  no dearnot a word     chapter lxiii  sir marmaduke at home   nora rowley had told her lover that there was to be no further communication between them till her father and mother should be in england but in telling him so had so frankly confessed her own affection for him and had so sturdily promised to be true to him that no lover could have been reasonably aggrieved by such an interdiction nora was quite conscious of this and was aware that hugh stanbury had received such encouragement as ought at any rate to bring him to the new rowley establishment as soon as he should learn where it had fixed itself but when at the end of ten days he had not shown himself she began to feel doubts could it be that he had changed his mind that he was unwilling to encounter refusal from her father or that he had found on looking into his own affairs more closely that it would be absurd for him to propose to take a wife to himself while his means were so poor and so precarious sir marmaduke during this time had been so unhappy so fretful so indignant and so much worried that nora herself had become almost afraid of him and without much reasoning on the matter had taught herself to believe that hugh might be actuated by similar fears she had intended to tell her mother of what had occurred between her and stanbury the first moment that she and lady rowley were together but then there had fallen upon them that terrible incident of the loss of the child and the whole family had become at once so wrapped up in the agony of the bereaved mother and so full of rage against the unreasonable father that there seemed to nora to be no possible opportunity for the telling of her own lovestory emily herself appeared to have forgotten it in the midst of her own misery and had not mentioned hugh stanburys name since they had been in manchester street we have all felt how on occasions our own hopes and fears nay almost our own individuality become absorbed in and obliterated by the more pressing cares and louder voices of those around us nora hardly dared to allude to herself while her sisters grief was still so prominent and while her father was daily complaining of his own personal annoyances at the colonial office it seemed to her that at such a moment she could not introduce a new matter for dispute and perhaps a new subject of dismay  nevertheless as the days passed by and as she saw nothing of hugh stanbury her heart became sore and her spirit vexed it seemed to her that if she were now deserted by him all the world would be over for her the glascock episode in her life had passed bythat episode which might have been her history which might have been a history so prosperous so magnificent and probably so happy as she thought of herself and of circumstances as they had happened to her of the resolutions which she had made as to her own career when she first came to london and of the way in which she had thrown all those resolutions away in spite of the wonderful success which had come in her path she could not refrain from thinking that she had brought herself to shipwreck by her own indecision it must not be imagined that she regretted what she had done she knew very well that to have acted otherwise than she did when mr glascock came to her at nuncombe putney would have proved her to be heartless selfish and unwomanly long before that time she had determined that it was her duty to marry a rich manand if possible a man in high position such a one had come to herone endowed with all the good things of the world beyond her most sanguine expectationand she had rejected him she knew that she had been right because she had allowed herself to love the other man she did not repent what she had done the circumstances being as they were but she almost regretted that she had been so soft in heart so susceptible of the weakness of love so little able to do as she pleased with herself of what use to her was it that she loved this man with all her strength of affection when he never came to her although the time at which he had been told that he might come was now ten days past  she was sitting one afternoon in the drawingroom listlessly reading or pretending to read a novel when on a sudden hugh stanbury was announced the circumstances of the moment were most unfortunate for such a visit sir marmaduke who had been down at whitehall in the morning and from thence had made a journey to st diddulphsintheeast and back was exceedingly cross and out of temper they had told him at his office that they feared he would not suffice to carry through the purpose for which he had been brought home and his brotherinlaw the parson had expressed to him an opinion that he was in great part responsible for the misfortune of his daughter by the encouragement which he had given to such a man as colonel osborne sir marmaduke had in consequence quarrelled both with the chief clerk and with mr outhouse and had come home surly and discontented lady rowley and her eldest daughter were away closeted at the moment with lady milborough with whom they were endeavouring to arrange some plan by which the boy might at any rate be given back poor emily trevelyan was humble enough now to lady milboroughwas prepared to be humble to any one and in any circumstances so that she should not be required to acknowledge that she had entertained colonel osborne as her lover the two younger girls sophy and lucy were in the room when stanbury was announced as was also sir marmaduke who at that very moment was uttering angry growls at the obstinacy and want of reason with which he had been treated by mr outhouse now sir marmaduke had not so much as heard the name of hugh stanbury as yet and nora though her listlessness was all at an end at once felt how impossible it would be to explain any of the circumstances of her case in such an interview as this while however hughs dear steps were heard upon the stairs her feminine mind at once went to work to ascertain in what best mode with what most attractive reason for his presence she might introduce the young man to her father had not the girls been then present she thought that it might have been expedient to leave hugh to tell his own story to sir marmaduke but she had no opportunity of sending her sisters away and unless chance should remove them this could not be done  he is son of the lady we were with at nuncombe putney she whispered to her father as she got up to move across the room to welcome her lover now sir marmaduke had expressed great disapproval of that retreat to dartmoor and had only understood respecting it that it had been arranged between trevelyan and the family in whose custody his two daughters had been sent away into banishment he was not therefore specially disposed to welcome hugh stanbury in consequence of this mode of introduction  hugh who had asked for lady rowley and mrs trevelyan and had learned that they were out before he had mentioned miss rowleys name was almost prepared to take his sweetheart into his arms in that halfminute he had taught himself to expect that he would meet her alone and had altogether forgotten sir marmaduke young men when they call at four oclock in the day never expect to find papas at home and of sophia and lucy he had either heard nothing or had forgotten what he had heard he repressed himself however in time and did not commit either nora or himself by any very vehement demonstration of affection but he did hold her hand longer than he should have done and sir marmaduke saw that he did so  this is papa said nora papa this is our friend mr hugh stanbury the introduction was made in a manner almost absurdly formal but poor noras difficulties lay heavy upon her sir marmaduke muttered somethingbut it was little more than a grunt mamma and emily are out continued nora i dare say they will be in soon sir marmaduke looked round sharply at the man why was he to be encouraged to stay till lady rowley should return lady rowley did not want to see him it seemed to sir marmaduke in the midst of his troubles that this was no time to be making new acquaintances these are my sisters mr stanbury continued nora this is sophia and this is lucy sophia and lucy would have been thoroughly willing to receive their sisters lover with genial kindness if they had been properly instructed and if the time had been opportune but as it was they had nothing to say they also could only mutter some little sound intended to be more courteous than their fathers grunt poor nora  i hope you are comfortable here said hugh  the house is all very well said nora but we dont like the neighbourhood  hugh also felt that conversation was difficult he had soon come to perceivebefore he had been in the room half a minutethat the atmosphere was not favourable to his mission there was to be no embracing or permission for embracing on the present occasion had he been left alone with sir marmaduke he would probably have told his business plainly let sir marmadukes manner to him have been what it might but it was impossible for him to do this with three young ladies in the room with him seeing that nora was embarrassed by her difficulties and that noras father was cross and silent he endeavoured to talk to the other girls and asked them concerning their journey and the ship in which they had come but it was very uphill work lucy and sophy could talk as glibly as any young ladies home from any colonyand no higher degree of fluency can be expressedbut now they were cowed their elder sister was shamefully and most undeservedly disgraced and this man had had somethingthey knew not whatto do with it is priscilla quite well nora asked at last  quite well i heard from her yesterday you know they have left the clock house  i had not heard it  oh yesand they are living in a small cottage just outside the village and what else do you think has happened  nothing bad i hope mr stanbury  my sister dorothy has left her aunt and is living with them again at nuncombe  has there been a quarrel mr stanbury  well yesafter a fashion there has i suppose but it is a long story and would not interest sir marmaduke the wonder is that dorothy should have been able to stay so long with my aunt i will tell it you all some day sir marmaduke could not understand why a long story about this mans aunt and sister should be told to his daughter he forgotas men always do in such circumstances forgetthat while he was living in the mandarins his daughter living in england would of course pick up new interest and become intimate with new histories but he did not forget that pressure of the hand which he had seen and he determined that his daughter nora could not have any worse lover than the friend of his elder daughters husband  stanbury had just determined that he must go that there was no possibility for him either to say or do anything to promote his cause at the present moment when the circumstances were all changed by the return home of lady rowley and mrs trevelyan lady rowley knew and had for some days known much more of stanbury than had come to the ears of sir marmaduke she understood in the first place that the stanburys had been very good to her daughter and she was aware that hugh stanbury had thoroughly taken her daughters part against his old friend trevelyan she would therefore have been prepared to receive him kindly had he not on this very morning been the subject of special conversation between her and emily but as it had happened mrs trevelyan had this very day told lady rowley the whole story of noras love the elder sister had not intended to be treacherous to the younger but in the thorough confidence which mutual grief and close conference had created between the mother and daughter everything had at last come out and lady rowley had learned the story not only of hugh stanburys courtship but of those rich offers which had been made by the heir to the barony of peterborough  it must be acknowledged that lady rowley was greatly grieved and thoroughly dismayed it was not only that mr glascock was the eldest son of a peer but that he was represented by the poor suffering wife of the illtempered man to be a man blessed with a disposition sweet as an angels and she would have liked him emily had said if it had not been for this unfortunate young man lady rowley was not worse than are other mothers not more ambitious or more heartless or more worldly she was a good mother loving her children and thoroughly anxious for their welfare but she would have liked to be the motherinlaw of lord peterborough and she would have liked dearly to see her second daughter removed from the danger of those rocks against which her eldest child had been shipwrecked and when she asked after hugh stanbury and his means of maintaining a wife the statement which mrs trevelyan made was not comforting he writes for a penny newspaperand i believe writes very well mrs trevelyan had said  for a penny newspaper is that respectable  his aunt miss stanbury seemed to think not but i suppose men of education do write for such things now he says himself that it is very precarious as an employment  it must be precarious emily and has he got nothing  not a penny of his own said mrs trevelyan  then lady rowley had thought again of mr glascock and of the family title and of monkhams and she thought of her present troubles and of the mandarins and the state of sir marmadukes balance at the bankersand of the other girls and of all there was before her to do here had been a very apollo among suitors kneeling at her childs feet and the foolish girl had sent him away for the sake of a young man who wrote for a penny newspaper was it worth the while of any woman to bring up daughters with such results lady rowley therefore when she was first introduced to hugh stanbury was not prepared to receive him with open arms  on this occasion the task of introducing him fell to mrs trevelyan and was done with much graciousness emily knew that hugh stanbury was her friend and would sympathise with her respecting her child you have heard what has happened to me she said stanbury however had heard nothing of that kidnapping of the child though to the rowleys it seemed that such a deed of iniquity done in the middle of london must have been known to all the world he had not as yet been told of itand now the story was given to him mrs trevelyan herself told it with many tears and an agony of fresh grief but still she told it as to one whom she regarded as a sure friend and from whom she knew that she would receive sympathy sir marmaduke sat by the while still gloomy and out of humour why was their family sorrow to be laid bare to this stranger  it is the cruellest thing i ever heard said hugh  a dastardly deed said lady rowley  but we all feel that for the time he can hardly know what he does said nora  and where is the child stanbury asked  we have not the slightest idea said lady rowley i have seen him and he refuses to tell us he did say that my daughter should see her boy but he now accompanies his offer with such conditions that it is impossible to listen to him  and where is he  we do not know where he lives we can reach him only through a certain man  ah i know the man said stanbury one who was a policeman once his name is bozzle  that is the man said sir marmaduke i have seen him  and of course he will tell us nothing but what he is told to tell us continued lady rowley can there be anything so horrible as thisthat a wife should be bound to communicate with her own husband respecting her own child through such a man as that  one might possibly find out where he keeps the child said hugh  if you could manage that mr stanbury said lady rowley  i hardly see that it would do much good said hugh indeed i do not know why he should keep the place a secret i suppose he has a right to the boy until the mother shall have made good her claim before the court he promised however that he would do his best to ascertain where the child was kept and where trevelyan resided and thenhaving been nearly an hour at the househe was forced to get up and take his leave he had said not a word to any one of the business that had brought him there he had not even whispered an assurance of his affection to nora till the two elder ladies had come in and the subject of the taking of the boy had been mooted he had sat there as a perfect stranger he thought that it was manifest enough that nora had told her secret to no one it seemed to him that mrs trevelyan must have forgotten itthat nora herself must have forgotten it if such forgetting could be possible he got up however and took his leave and was comforted in some slight degree by seeing that there was a tear in noras eye  who is he demanded sir marmaduke as soon as the door was closed  he is a young man who was an intimate friend of louiss answered mrs trevelyan but he is so no longer because he sees how infatuated louis has been  and why does he come here      illustration and why does he come here   we know him very well continued mrs trevelyan it was he that arranged our journey down to devonshire he was very kind about it and so were his mother and sister we have every reason to be grateful to mr stanbury this was all very well but nora nevertheless felt that the interview had been anything but successful  has he any profession asked sir marmaduke  he writes for the press said mrs trevelyan  what do you meanbooks  nofor a newspaper  for a penny newspaper said nora boldlyfor the daily record  then i hope he wont come here any more said sir marmaduke nora paused a moment striving to find words for some speech which might be true to her love and yet not unseemlybut finding no such words ready she got up from her seat and walked out of the room what is the meaning of it all asked sir marmaduke there was a silence for a while and then he repeated his question in another form is there any reason for his coming hereabout nora  i think he is attached to nora said mrs trevelyan  my dear said lady rowley perhaps we had better not speak about it just now  i suppose he has not a penny in the world said sir marmaduke  he has what he earns said mrs trevelyan  if nora understands her duty she will never let me hear his name again said sir marmaduke then there was nothing more said and as soon as they could escape both lady rowley and mrs trevelyan left the room  i should have told you everything said nora to her mother that night i had no intention to keep anything a secret from you but we have all been so unhappy about louey that we have had no heart to talk of anything else  i understand all that my darling  and i had meant that you should tell papa for i supposed that he would come and i meant that he should go to papa himself he intended that himselfonly todayas things turned out  just so dearestbut it does not seem that he has got any income it would be very rashwouldnt it  people must be rash sometimes everybody cant have an income without earning it i suppose people in professions do marry without having fortunes  when they have settled professions nora  and why is not his a settled profession i believe he receives quite as much at seven and twenty as uncle oliphant does at sixty  but your uncle oliphants income is permanent  lawyers dont have permanent incomes or doctorsor merchants  but those professions are regular and sure they dont marry without fortunes till they have made their incomes sure  mr stanburys income is sure i dont know why it shouldnt be sure he goes on writing and writing every day and it seems to me that of all professions in the world it is the finest id much sooner write for a newspaper than be one of those old musty fusty lawyers wholl say anything that theyre paid to say  my dearest nora all that is nonsense you know as well as i do that you should not marry a man when there is a doubt whether he can keep a house over your headthat is his position  it is good enough for me mamma  and what is his income from writing  it is quite enough for me mamma the truth is i have promised and i cannot go back from it dear dear mamma you wont quarrel with us and oppose us and make papa hard against us you can do what you like with papa i know that look at poor emily plenty of money has not made her happy  if mr glascock had only asked you a week sooner said lady rowley with a handkerchief to her eyes  but you see he didnt mamma  when i think of it i cannot but weepand the poor mother burst out into a full flood of tearssuch a man so good so gentle and so truly devoted to you  mamma whats the good of that now  going down all the way to devonshire after you  so did hugh mamma  a position that any girl in england would have envied you i cannot but feel it and emily says she is sure he would come back if he got the very slightest encouragement  that is quite impossible mamma  why should it be impossible emily declares that she never saw a man so much in love in her lifeand she says also that she believes he is abroad now simply because he is brokenhearted about it  mr glascock mamma was very nice and good and all that but indeed he is not the man to suffer from a broken heart and emily is quite mistaken i told him the whole truth  what truth  that there was somebody else that i did love then he said that of course that put an end to it all and he wished me goodbye ever so calmly  how could you be so infatuated why should you have cut the ground away from your feet in that way  because i chose that there should be an end to it now there has been an end to it and it is much better mamma that we should not think about mr glascock any more he will never come again to meand if he did i could only say the same thing  you mustnt be surprised nora if im unhappy that is all of course i must feel it such a connection as it would have been for your sisters such a home for poor emily in her trouble and as for this other man  mamma dont speak ill of him  if i say anything of him i must say the truth said lady rowley  dont say anything against him mamma because he is to be my husband dear dear mamma you cant change me by anything you say perhaps i have been foolish but it is settled now dont make me wretched by speaking against the man whom i mean to love all my life better than all the world  think of louis trevelyan  i will think of no one but hugh stanbury i tried not to love him mamma i tried to think that it was better to make believe that i loved mr glascock but he got the better of me and conquered me and i will never rebel against him you may help me mammabut you cant change me     chapter lxiv  sir marmaduke at his club   sir marmaduke had come away from his brotherinlaw the parson in much anger for mr outhouse with that mixture of obstinacy and honesty which formed his character had spoken hard words of colonel osborne and words which by implication had been hard also against emily trevelyan he had been very staunch to his niece when attacked by his nieces husband but when his sympathies and assistance were invoked by sir marmaduke it seemed as though he had transferred his allegiance to the other side he pointed out to the unhappy father that colonel osborne had behaved with great cruelty in going to devonshire that the stanburys had been untrue to their trust in allowing him to enter the house and that emily had been indiscreet in receiving him when a young woman is called indiscreet by her friends it may be assumed that her character is very seriously assailed sir marmaduke had understood this and on hearing the word had become wroth with his brotherinlaw there had been hot words between them and mr outhouse would not yield an inch or retract a syllable he conceived it to be his duty to advise the father to caution his daughter with severity to quarrel absolutely with colonel osborne and to let trevelyan know that this had been done as to the child mr outhouse expressed a strong opinion that the father was legally entitled to the custody of his boy and that nothing could be done to recover the child except what might be done with the fathers consent in fact mr outhouse made himself exceedingly disagreeable and sent away sir marmaduke with a very heavy heart could it really be possible that his old friend fred osborne who seven or eightandtwenty years ago had been potent among young ladies had really been making love to his old friends married daughter sir marmaduke looked into himself and conceived it to be quite out of the question that he should make love to any one a good dinner good wine a good cigar an easy chair and a rubber of whistall these things with no work to do and men of his own standing around him were the pleasures of life which sir marmaduke desired now fred osborne was an older man than he and though fred osborne did keep up a foolish system of padded clothes and dyed whiskers stillat fiftytwo or fiftythreesurely a man might be reckoned safe and then too that ancient friendship sir marmaduke who had lived all his life in the comparative seclusion of a colony thought perhaps more of that ancient friendship than did the colonel who had lived amidst the blaze of london life and who had had many opportunities of changing his friends some inkling of all this made its way into sir marmadukes bosom as he thought of it with bitterness and he determined that he would have it out with his friend  hitherto he had enjoyed very few of those pleasant hours which he had anticipated on his journey homewards he had had no heart to go to his club and he had fancied that colonel osborne had been a little backward in looking him up and providing him with amusement he had suggested this to his wife and she had told him that the colonel had been right not to come to manchester street i have told emily said lady rowley that she must not meet him and she is quite of the same opinion nevertheless there had been remissness sir marmaduke felt that it was so in spite of his wifes excuses in this way he was becoming sore with everybody and very unhappy it did not at all improve his temper when he was told that his second daughter had refused an offer from lord peterboroughs eldest son then she may go into the workhouse for me the angry father had said declaring at the same time that he would never give his consent to her marriage with the man who did dirty work for the daily recordas he with his paternal wisdom chose to express it but this cruel phrase was not spoken in noras hearing nor was it repeated to her lady rowley knew her husband and was aware that he would on occasions change his opinion  it was not till two or three days after his visit to st diddulphs that he met colonel osborne the easter recess was then over and colonel osborne had just returned to london they met on the doorsteps of the acrobats and the colonel immediately began with an apology i have been so sorry to be away just when you are hereupon my word i have but i was obliged to go down to the duchesss i had promised early in the winter and those people are so angry if you put them off by george its almost as bad as putting off royalty  dn the duchess said sir marmaduke  with all my heart said the colonelonly i thought it as well that i should tell you the truth  what i mean is that the duchess and her people make no difference to me i hope you had a pleasant time thats all  wellyes we had one must get away somewhere at easter there is no one left at the club and theres no house and no one asks one to dinner in town in fact if one didnt go away one wouldnt know what to do there were ever so many people there that i liked to meet lady glencora was there and uncommon pleasant she made it that woman has more to say for herself than any halfdozen men that i know and lord cantrip your chief was there he said a word or two to me about you  what sort of a word  he says he wishes you would read up some bluebooks or papers or reports or something of that kind which he says that some of his fellows have sent you it seems that there are some new rules or orders or fashions which he wants you to have at your fingers ends nothing could be more civil than he wasbut he just wished me to mention this knowing that you and i are likely to see each other  i wish i had never come over said sir marmaduke  why so  they didnt bother me with their new rules and fashions over there when the papers came somebody read them and that was enough i could do what they wanted me to do there  and so you will hereafter a bit  im not so sure of that those young fellows seem to forget that an old dog cant learn new tricks theyve got a young brisk fellow there who seems to think that a man should be an encyclopedia of knowledge because he has lived in a colony over twenty years  thats the new undersecretary  never mind who it is osborne just come up to the library will you i want to speak to you then sir marmaduke with considerable solemnity led the way up to the most deserted room in the club and colonel osborne followed him well knowing that something was to be said about emily trevelyan  sir marmaduke seated himself on a sofa and his friend sat close beside him the room was quite deserted it was four oclock in the afternoon and the club was full of men there were men in the morningroom and men in the drawingroom and men in the cardroom and men in the billiardroom but no better choice of a chamber for a conference intended to be silent and secret could have been made in all london than that which had induced sir marmaduke to take his friend into the library of the acrobats and yet a great deal of money had been spent in providing this library for the acrobats sir marmaduke sat for awhile silent and had he sat silent for an hour colonel osborne would not have interrupted him then at last he began with a voice that was intended to be serious but which struck upon the ear of his companion as being affected and unlike the owner of it this is a very sad thing about my poor girl said sir marmaduke  indeed it is there is only one thing to be said about it rowley  and whats that  the man must be mad  he is not so mad as to give us any relief by his madnesspoor as such comfort would be he has got emilys child away from her and i think it will about kill her and what is to become of her as to taking her back to the islands without her child it is out of the question i never knew anything so cruel in my life  and so absurd you know  ahthats just the question if anybody had asked me i should have said that you were the man of all men whom i could have best trusted  do you doubt it now  i dont know what to think  do you mean to say that you suspect meand your daughter too  noby heavens poor dear if i suspected her there would be an end of all things with me i could never get over that no i dont suspect her sir marmaduke had now dropped his affected tone and was speaking with natural energy  but you do me  noif i did i dont suppose i should be sitting with you here but they tell me  they tell you what  they tell me thatthat you did not behave wisely about it why could you not let her alone when you found out how matters were going  who has been telling you this rowley  sir marmaduke considered for awhile and then remembering that colonel osborne could hardly quarrel with a clergyman told him the truth outhouse says that you have done her an irretrievable injury by going down to devonshire to her and by writing to her  outhouse is an ass  that is easily saidbut why did you go  and why should i not go what the deuce because a man like that chooses to take vagaries into his head i am not to see my own godchild sir marmaduke tried to remember whether the colonel was in fact the godfather of his eldest daughter but he found that his mind was quite a blank about his childrens godfathers and godmothers and as for the lettersi wish you could see them the only letters which had in them a word of importance were those about your coming home i was anxious to get that arranged not only for your sake but because she was so eager about it  god bless her poor child said sir marmaduke rubbing the tears away from his eyes with his red silk pockethandkerchief  i will acknowledge that those lettersthere may have been one or twowere the beginning of the trouble it was these that made this man show himself to be a lunatic i do admit that i was bound not to talk about your coming and i told her to keep the secret he went spying about and found her letters i supposeand then he took fire because there was to be a secret from him dirty mean dog and now im to be told by such a fellow as outhouse that its my fault that i have caused all the trouble because when i happened to be in devonshire i went to see your daughter we must do the colonel the justice of supposing that he had by this time quite taught himself to believe that the church porch at cockchaffington had been the motive cause of his journey into devonshire upon my word it is too hard continued he indignantly as for outhouseonly for the gown upon his back id pull his nose and i wish that you would tell him that i say so  there is trouble enough without that said sir marmaduke  but it is hard by g it is hard there is this comfortif it hadnt been me it would have been some one else such a man as that couldnt have gone two or three years without being jealous of some one and as for poor emily she is better off perhaps with an accusation so absurd as this than she might have been had her name been joined with a younger man or with one whom you would have less reason for trusting  there was so much that seemed to be sensible in this and it was spoken with so well assumed a tone of injured innocence that sir marmaduke felt that he had nothing more to say he muttered something further about the cruelty of the case and then slunk away out of the club and made his way home to the dull gloomy house in manchester street there was no comfort for him therebut neither was there any comfort for him at the club and why did that vexatious secretary of state send him messages about blue books as he went he expressed sundry wishes that he was back at the mandarins and told himself that it would be well that he should remain there till he died     chapter lxv  mysterious agencies      illustration  when the thirtyfirst of march arrived exeter had not as yet been made gay with the marriage festivities of mr gibson and camilla french and this delay had not been the fault of camilla camilla had been ready and when about the middle of the month it was hinted to her that some postponement was necessary she spoke her mind out plainly and declared that she was not going to stand that kind of thing the communication had not been made to her by mr gibson in person for some days previously he had not been seen at heavitree and camilla had from day to day become more black gloomy and harsh in her manners both to her mother and her sister little notes had come and little notes had gone but no one in the house except camilla herself knew what those notes contained she would not condescend to complain to arabella nor did she say much in condemnation of her lover to mrs french till the blow came with unremitting attention she pursued the great business of her wedding garments and exacted from the unfortunate arabella an amount of work equal to her ownof thankless work as is the custom of embryo brides with their unmarried sisters and she drew with great audacity on the somewhat slender means of the family for the amount of feminine gear necessary to enable her to go into mr gibsons house with something of the éclat of a wellprovided bride when mrs french hesitated and then expostulated camilla replied that she did not expect to be married above once and that in no cheaper or more productive way than this could her mother allow her to consume her share of the family resources what matter mamma if you do have to borrow a little money mr burgess will let you have it when he knows why and as i shant be eating and drinking at home any more nor yet getting my things here i have a right to expect it and she ended by expressing an opinion in arabellas hearing that any daughter of a house who proves herself to be capable of getting a husband for herself is entitled to expect that those left at home shall pinch themselves for a time in order that she may go forth to the world in a respectable way and be a credit to the family  then came the blow mr gibson had not been at the house for some days but the notes had been going and coming at last mr gibson came himself but as it happened when he came camilla was out shopping in these days she often did go out shopping between eleven and one carrying her sister with her it must have been but a poor pleasure for arabella this witnessing the purchases made seeing the pleasant draperies and handling the real linens and admiring the fine cambrics spread out before them on the shop counters by obsequious attendants and the questions asked of her by her sister whether this was good enough for so august an occasion or that sufficiently handsome must have been harassing she could not have failed to remember that it ought all to have been done for herthat had she not been treated with monstrous injustice with most unsisterly cruelty all these good things would have been spread on her behoof but she went on and endured it and worked diligently with her needle and folded and unfolded as she was desired and became as it were quite a younger sister in the housecreeping out by herself now and again into the purlieus of the city to find such consolation as she might receive from her solitary thoughts  but arabella and camilla were both away when mr gibson called to tell mrs french of his altered plans and as he asked not for his ladylove but for mrs french herself it is probable that he watched his opportunity and that he knew to what cares his camilla was then devoting herself perhaps it is quite as well that i should find you alone he said after sundry preludes to his future motherinlaw because you can make camilla understand this better than i can i must put off the day for about three weeks  three weeks mr gibson  or a month perhaps we had better say the 29th of april mr gibson had by this time thrown off every fear that he might have entertained of the mother and could speak to her of such an unwarrantable change of plans with tolerable equanimity  but i dont know that that will suit camilla at all  she can name any other day she pleases of coursethat is in may  but why is this to be  there are things about money mrs french which i cannot arrange sooner and i find that unfortunately i must go up to london though many other questions were asked nothing further was got out of mr gibson on that occasion and he left the house with a perfect understanding on his own partand on that of mrs frenchthat the marriage was postponed till some day still to be fixed but which could not and should not be before the 29th of april mrs french asked him why he did not come up and see camilla he repliedfalse man that he wasthat he had hoped to have seen her this morning and that he would come again before the week was over  then it was that camilla spoke her mind out plainly i shall go to his house at once she said and find out all about it i dont understand it i dont understand it at all and i wont put up with it he shall know who he has to deal with if he plays tricks upon me mamma i wonder you let him out of the house till you had made him come back to his old day  what could i do my dear  what could you do shake him out of itas i would have done but he didnt dare to tell mebecause he is a coward  camilla in all this showed her spirit but she allowed her anger to hurry her away into an indiscretion arabella was present and camilla should have repressed her rage  i dont think hes at all a coward said arabella  thats my business i suppose im entitled to know what he is better than you  all the same i dont think mr gibson is at all a coward said arabella again pleading the cause of the man who had misused her  now arabella i wont take any interference from you mind that i say it was cowardly and he should have come to me its my concern and i shall go to him im not going to be stopped by any shillyshally nonsense when my future respectability perhaps is at stake all exeter knows that the marriage is to take place on the 31st of this month  on the next day camilla absolutely did go to mr gibsons house at an early hour at nine when as she thought he would surely be at breakfast but he had flown he had left exeter that morning by an early train and his servant thought that he had gone to london on the next morning camilla got a note from him written in london it affected to be very cheery and affectionate beginning dearest cammy and alluding to the postponement of his wedding as though it were a thing so fixed as to require no further question camilla answered this letter still in much wrath complaining protesting expostulatingthrowing in his teeth the fact that the day had been fixed by him and not by her and she added a postscript in the following momentous wordsif you have any respect for the name of your future wife you will fall back upon your first arrangement to this she got simply a line of an answer declaring that this falling back was impossible and then nothing was heard of him for ten days he had gone from tuesday to saturday weekand the first that camilla saw of him was his presence in the reading desk when he chaunted the cathedral service as priestvicar on the sunday  at this time arabella was very ill and was confined to her bed mr martin declared that her system had become low from over anxietythat she was nervous weak and liable to hystericsthat her feelings were in fact too many for herand that her efforts to overcome them and to face the realities of the world had exhausted her this was of course not said openly at the towncross of exeter but such was the opinion which mr martin gave in confidence to the mother fiddlededee said camilla when she was told of feelings susceptibilities and hysterics at the present moment she had a claim to the undivided interest of the family and she believed that her sisters illness was feigned in order to defraud her of her rights my dear she is ill said mrs french then let her have a dose of salts said the stern camilla this was on the sunday afternoon camilla had endeavoured to see mr gibson as he came out of the cathedral but had failed mr gibson had been detained within the buildingno doubt by duties connected with the choral services on that evening he got a note from camilla and quite early on the monday morning he came up to heavitree  you will find her in the drawingroom said mrs french as she opened the halldoor for him there was a smile on her face as she spoke but it was a forced smile mr gibson did not smile at all  is it all right with her he asked  wellyou had better go to her you see mr gibson young ladies when they are going to be married think that they ought to have their own way a little just for the last time you know he took no notice of the joke but went with slow steps up to the drawingroom it would be inquiring too curiously to ask whether camilla when she embraced him discerned that he had fortified his courage that morning with a glass of curacoa  what does all this mean thomas was the first question that camilla asked when the embrace was over  all what mean dear  this untoward delay thomas you have almost broken my heart you have been away and i have not heard from you  i wrote twice camilla  and what sort of letters if there is anything the matter thomas you had better tell me at once she paused but thomas held his tongue i dont suppose you want to kill me  god forbid said thomas  but you will what must everybody think of me in the city when they find that it is put off poor mamma has been dreadfulquite dreadful and here is arabella now laid up on a bed of sickness this too was indiscreet camilla should have said nothing about her sisters sickness  i have been so sorry to hear about dear bella said mr gibson  i dont suppose shes very bad said camilla but of course we all feel it of course were upset as for me i bear up because ive that spirit that i wont give way if its ever so but upon my word it tries me hard what is the meaning of it thomas  but thomas had nothing to say beyond what he had said before to mrs french he was very particular he said about money and certain money matters made it incumbent on him not to marry before the 29th of april when camilla suggested to him that as she was to be his wife she ought to know all about his money matters he told her that she shouldsome day when they were married he would tell her all camilla talked a great deal and said some things that were very severe mr gibson did not enjoy his morning but he endured the upbraidings of his fair one with more firmness than might perhaps have been expected from him he left all the talking to camilla but when he got up to leave her the 29th of april had been fixed with some sort of assent from her as the day on which she was really to become mrs gibson  when he left the room he again met mrs french on the landingplace she hesitated a moment waiting to see whether the door would be shut but the door could not be shut as camilla was standing in the entrance mr gibson said mrs french in a voice that was scarcely a whisper would you mind stepping in and seeing poor bella for a moment  whyshe is in bed said camilla  yesshe is in bed but she thinks it would be a comfort to her she has seen nobody these four days except mr martin and she thinks it would comfort her to have a word or two with mr gibson now mr gibson was not only going to be bellas brotherinlaw but he was also a clergyman camilla in her heart believed that the halfclerical aspect which her mother had given to the request was false and hypocritical there were special reasons why bella should not have wished to see mr gibson in her bedroom at any rate till mr gibson had become her brotherinlaw the expression of such a wish at the present moment was almost indecent  youll be there with them said camilla mr gibson blushed up to his ears as he heard the suggestion of course youll be there with them mamma  no my dear i think not i fancy she wishes him to read to heror something of that sort then mr gibson without speaking a word but still blushing up to his ears was taken to arabellas room and camilla flouncing into the drawingroom banged the door behind her she had hitherto fought her battle with considerable skill and with great couragebut her very success had made her imprudent she had become so imperious in the great position which she had reached that she could not control her temper or wait till her power was confirmed the banging of that door was heard through the whole house and every one knew why it was banged she threw herself on to a sofa and then instantly rising again paced the room with quick step could it be possible that there was treachery was it on the cards that that weak poor creature bella was intriguing once again to defraud her of her husband there were different things that she now remembered arabella in that moment of bliss in which she had conceived herself to be engaged to mr gibson had discarded her chignon then she had resumed itin all its monstrous proportions since that it had been lessened by degrees and brought down through various interesting but abnormal shapes to a size which would hardly have drawn forth any anathema from miss stanbury and now on this very morning arabella had put on a clean nightcap with muslin frills it is perhaps not unnatural that a sick lady preparing to receive a clergyman in her bedroom should put on a clean nightcapbut to suspicious eyes small causes suffice to create alarm and if there were any such hideous wickedness in the wind had arabella any colleague in her villainy could it be that the mother was plotting against her daughters happiness and respectability camilla was well aware that her mamma would at first have preferred to give arabella to mr gibson had the choice in the matter been left to her but now when the thing had been settled before all the world would not such treatment on a mothers part be equal to infanticide and then as to mr gibson himself camilla was not prone to think little of her own charms but she had been unable not to perceive that her lover had become negligent in his personal attentions to her an accepted lover who deserves to have been accepted should devote every hour at his command to his mistress but mr gibson had of late been so chary of his presence at heavitree that camilla could not but have known that he took no delight in coming thither she had acknowledged this to herself but she had consoled herself with the reflection that marriage would make this all right mr gibson was not the man to stray from his wife and she could trust herself to obtain a sufficient hold upon her husband hereafter partly by the strength of her tongue partly by the ascendency of her spirit and partly also by the comforts which she would provide for him she had not doubted but that it would be all well when they should be marriedbut how if even now there should be no marriage for her camilla french had never heard of creusa and of jason but as she paced her mothers drawingroom that morning she was a medea in spirit if any plot of that kind should be in the wind she would do such things that all devonshire should hear of her wrongs and of her revenge  in the meantime mr gibson was sitting by arabellas bedside while mrs french was trying to make herself busy in her own chamber next door there had been a reading of some chapter of the bibleor of some portion of a chapter and mr gibson as he read and arabella as she listened had endeavoured to take to their hearts and to make use of the word which they heard the poor young woman when she begged her mother to send to her the man who was so dear to her did so with some halfformed condition that it would be good for her to hear a clergyman read to her but now the chapter had been read and the book was back in mr gibsons pocket and he was sitting with his hand on the bed she is so very arrogant said bellaand so domineering to this mr gibson made no reply im sure i have endeavoured to bear it well though you must have known what i have suffered thomas nobody can understand it so well as you do  i wish i had never been born said mr gibson tragically  dont say that thomasbecause its wicked  but i do see all the harm i have doneand yet i did not mean it  you must try and do the best you can now i am not saying what that should be i am not dictating to you you are a man and of course you must judge for yourself but i will say this you shouldnt do anything just because it is the easiest i dont suppose i should live after it i dont indeed but that should not signify to you  i dont suppose that any man was ever before in such a terrible position since the world began  it is difficulti am sure of that thomas  and i have meant to be so true i fancy sometimes that some mysterious agency interferes with the affairs of a man and drives him onand onand onalmosttill he doesnt know where it drives him as he said this in a voice that was quite sepulchral in its tone he felt some consolation in the conviction that this mysterious agency could not affect a man without embuing him with a certain amount of grandeurvery uncomfortable indeed in its nature but still having considerable value as a counterpoise pride must bear painbut pain is recompensed by pride  she is so strong thomas that she can put up with anything said arabella in a whisper  strongyes said he with a shuddershe is strong enough  and as for love  dont talk about it said he getting up from his chair dont talk about it you will drive me frantic  you know what my feelings are thomas you have always known them there has been no change since i was the young thing you first knew me as she spoke she just touched his hand with hers but he did not seem to notice this sitting with his elbow on the arm of his chair and his forehead on his hand in reply to what she said to him he merely shook his headnot intending to imply thereby any doubt of the truth of her assertion you have now to make up your mind and to be bold thomas continued arabella she says that you are a coward but i know that you are no coward i told her so and she said that i was interfering ohthat she should be able to tell me that i interfere when i defend you  i must go said mr gibson jumping up from his chair i must go bella i cannot stand this any longer it is too much for me i will pray that i may decide aright god bless you then he kissed her brow as she lay in bed and hurried out of the room  he had hoped to go from the house without further converse with any of its inmates for his mind was disturbed and he longed to be at rest but he was not allowed to escape so easily camilla met him at the diningroom door and accosted him with a smile there had been time for much meditation during the last half hour and camilla had meditated how do you find her thomas she asked  she seems weak but i believe she is better i have been reading to her  come in thomaswill you not it is bad for us to stand talking on the stairs dear thomas dont let us be so cold to each other he had no alternative but to put his arm round her waist and kiss her thinking as he did so of the mysterious agency which afflicted him tell me that you love me thomas she said  of course i love you the question is not a pleasant one when put by a lady to a gentleman whose affections towards her are not strong and it requires a very good actor to produce an efficient answer  i hope you do thomas it would be sad indeed if you did not you are not weary of your camillaare you  for a moment there came upon him an idea that he would confess that he was weary of her but he found at once that such an effort was beyond his powers how can you ask such a question he said  because you do notcome to me camilla as she spoke laid her head upon his shoulder and wept and now you have been five minutes with me and nearly an hour with bella  she wanted me to read to her said mr gibsonand he hated himself thoroughly as he said it  and now you want to get away as fast as you can continued camilla  because of the morning service said mr gibson this was quite true and yet he hated himself again for saying it as camilla knew the truth of the last plea she was obliged to let him go but she made him swear before he went that he loved her dearly i think its all right she said to herself as he went down the stairs i dont think hed dare make it wrong if he doesooh  mr gibson as he walked into exeter endeavoured to justify his own conduct to himself there was no moment he declared to himself in which he had not endeavoured to do right seeing the manner in which he had been placed among these two young women both of whom had fallen in love with him how could he have saved himself from vacillation and by what untoward chance had it come to pass that he had now learned to dislike so vigorously almost to hate the one with whom he had been for a moment sufficiently infatuated to think that he loved  but with all his arguments he did not succeed in justifying to himself his own conduct and he hated himself     chapter lxvi  of a quarter of lamb   miss stanbury looking out of her parlour window saw mr gibson hurrying towards the cathedral down the passage which leads from southernhay into the close hes just come from heavitree ill be bound said miss stanbury to martha who was behind her  like enough maam  though they do say that the poor fool of a man has become quite sick of his bargain already  hell have to be sicker yet maam said martha  they were to have been married last week and nobody ever knew why it was put off its my belief hell never marry her and shell be served rightquite right  he must marry her now maam shes been buying things all over exeter as though there was no end of their money  they havent more than enough to keep body and soul together said miss stanbury i dont see why i mightnt have gone to service this morning martha its quite warm now out in the close  youd better wait maam till the east winds is over she was at puddocks only the day before yesterday buying bedlinenthe finest they had and that wasnt good enough  psha said miss stanbury  as though mr gibson hadnt things of that kind good enough for her said martha  then there was silence in the room for awhile miss stanbury was standing at one window and martha at the other watching the people as they passed backwards and forwards in and out of the close dorothy had now been away at nuncombe putney for some weeks and her aunt felt her loneliness with a heavy sense of weakness never had she entertained a companion in the house who had suited her as well as her niece dorothy dorothy would always listen to her would always talk to her would always bear with her since dorothy had gone various letters had been interchanged between them though there had been anger about brooke burgess there had been no absolute rupture but miss stanbury had felt that she could not write and beg her niece to come back to her she had not sent dorothy away dorothy had chosen to go because her aunt had had an opinion of her own as to what was fitting for her heir and as miss stanbury would not give up her opinion she could not ask her niece to return to her such had been her resolution sternly expressed to herself a dozen times during these solitary weeks but time and solitude had acted upon her and she longed for the girls presence in the house martha she said at last i think i shall get you to go over to nuncombe putney  again maam  why not again its not so far i suppose that the journey will hurt you  i dont think itd hurt me maamonly what good will i do  if youll go rightly to work you may do good miss dorothy was a fool to go the way she dida great fool  she stayed longer than i thought she would maam  im not asking you what you thought ill tell you what do you send giles to winslows and tell them to send in early tomorrow a nice forequarter of lamb or it wouldnt hurt you if you went and chose it yourself  it wouldnt hurt me at all maam  you get it nicenot too small because meat is meat at the price things are now and how they ever see butchers meat at all is more than i can understand  people as has to be careful maam makes a little go a long way  you get it a good size and take it over in a basket it wont hurt you done up clean in a napkin  it wont hurt me at all maam  and you give it to miss dorothy with my love dont you let em think i sent it to my sisterinlaw  and is that to be all maam  how do you mean all  because maam the railway and the carrier would take it quite ready and there would be a matter of ten or twelve shillings saved in the journey  whose affair is that  not mine maam of course  i believe you are afraid of the trouble martha or else you dont like going because theyre poor  it aint fair maam of you to say sothat it aint all i ask isis that to be all when ive givem the lamb am i just to come away straight or

that dummy waywouldnt itand you that was so fond of miss dorothy  i was fond of her maam  of course youll be talking to herand why not and if she should say anything about returning  yes maam  you can

about returning  yes she will martha if you talk to her rightly the servant didnt reply for awhile but stood looking out of the window you might as well go about the lamb at once martha  so i will maam when ive got it out all clear  what do you mean by that  whyjust this maam may i tell miss dolly straight out that you want her to come back and that ive been sent to say so  no martha  then how am i to do it maam  do it out of your own head just as it comes up at the moment  out of my own head maam  yesjust as you feel you know  just as i feel maam  you understand what i mean martha  ill do my best maam and i cant say no more and if you scolds me afterwards maamwhy of course i must put up with it  but i wont scold you martha  then ill go out to winslows about the lamb at once maam  very nice and not too small martha  martha went out and ordered the lamb and packed it as desired quite clean in a napkin and fitted it into the basket and arranged with giles hickbody to carry it down for her early in the morning to the station so that she might take the first train to lessborough it was understood that she was to hire a fly at lessborough to take her to nuncombe putney now that she understood the importance of her mission and was aware that the present she took with her was only the customary accompaniment of an ambassadress entrusted with a great mission martha said nothing even about the expense the train started for lessborough at seven and as she was descending from her room at six miss stanbury in her flannel dressinggown stepped out of the door of her own room just put this in the basket said she handing a note to her servant i thought last night id write a word just put it in the basket and say nothing about it the note which she sent was as follows      the close 8th april 186     my dear dorothy     as martha talks of going over to pay you a visit ive    thought that id just get her to take you a quarter of    lamb which is coming in now very nice i do envy her    going to see you my dear for i had gotten somehow to    love to see your pretty face im getting almost strong    again but sir peter who was here this afternoon just    calling as a friend was uncivil enough to say that im    too much of an old woman to go out in the east wind i    told him it didnt much matterfor the sooner old women    made way for young ones the better     i am very desolate and solitary here but i rather think    that women who dont get married are intended to be    desolate and perhaps it is better for them if they    bestow their time and thoughts properlyas i hope you    do my dear a woman with a family of children has almost    too many of the cares of this world to give her mind as    she ought to the other what shall we say then of those    who have no such cares and yet do not walk uprightly    dear dorothy be not such a one for myself i acknowledge    bitterly the extent of my shortcomings much has been    given to me but if much be expected how shall i answer    the demand     i hope i need not tell you that whenever it may suit you    to pay a visit to exeter your room will be ready for you    and there will be a warm welcome mrs machugh always asks    after you and so has mrs clifford i wont tell you    what mrs clifford said about your colour because it    would make you vain the heavitree affair has all been put    offof course you have heard that dear dear dear you    know what i think so i need not repeat it     give my respects to your mamma and priscillaand for    yourself accept the affectionate love of     your loving old aunt     jemima stanbury     psif martha should say anything to you you may feel    sure that she knows my mind   poor old soul she felt an almost uncontrollable longing to have her niece back again and yet she told herself that she was bound not to send a regular invitation or to suggest an unconditional return dorothy had herself decided to take her departure and if she chose to remain awayso it must be she miss stanbury could not demean herself by renewing her invitation she read her letter before she added to it the postscript and felt that it was too solemn in its tone to suggest to dorothy that which she wished to suggest she had been thinking much of her own past life when she wrote those words about the state of an unmarried woman and was vacillating between two mindswhether it were better for a young woman to look forward to the cares and affections and perhaps hard usage of a married life or to devote herself to the easier and safer course of an old maids career but an old maid is nothing if she be not kind and good she acknowledged that and acknowledging it added the postscript to her letter what though there was a certain blow to her pride in the writing of it she did tell herself that in thus referring her niece to martha for an expression of her own mindafter that conversation which she and martha had had in the parlourshe was in truth eating her own words but the postscript was written and though she took the letter up with her to her own room in order that she might alter the words if she repented of them in the night the letter was sent as it was writtenpostscript and all  she spent the next day with very sober thoughts when mrs machugh called upon her and told her that there were rumours afloat in exeter that the marriage between camilla french and mr gibson would certainly be broken off in spite of all purchases that had been made she merely remarked that they were two poor feckless things who didnt know their own minds camilla knows hers plain enough said mrs machugh sharply but even this did not give miss stanbury any spirit she waited and waited patiently till martha should return thinking of the sweet pink colour which used to come and go in dorothys cheekswhich she had been wont to observe so frequently not knowing that she had observed it and loved it     chapter lxvii  rivers cottage   three days after hugh stanburys visit to manchester street he wrote a note to lady rowley telling her of the address at which might be found both trevelyan and his son as bozzle had acknowledged facts are things which may be found out hugh had gone to work somewhat after the bozzlian fashion and had found out this fact he lives at a place called rivers cottage at willesden wrote stanbury if you turn off the harrow road to the right about a mile beyond the cemetery you will find the cottage on the left hand side of the lane about a quarter of a mile from the harrow road i believe you can go to willesden by railway but you had better take a cab from london there was much consultation respecting this letter between lady rowley and mrs trevelyan and it was decided that it should not be shown to sir marmaduke to see her child was at the present moment the most urgent necessity of the poor mother and both the ladies felt that sir marmaduke in his wrath might probably impede rather than assist her in this desire if told where he might find trevelyan he would probably insist on starting in quest of his soninlaw himself and the distance between the mother and her child might become greater in consequence instead of less there were many consultations and the upshot of these was that lady rowley and her daughter determined to start for willesden without saying anything to sir marmaduke of the purpose they had in hand when emily expressed her conviction that if trevelyan should be away from home they would probably be able to make their way into the houseso as to see the child lady rowley with some hesitation acknowledged that such might be the case but the childs mother said nothing to her own mother of a scheme which she had half formed of so clinging to her boy that no human power should separate them  they started in a cab as advised by stanbury and were driven to a point on the road from which a lane led down to willesden passing by rivers cottage they asked as they came along and met no difficulty in finding their way at the point on the road indicated there was a country inn for haywaggoners and here lady rowley proposed that they should leave their cab urging that it might be best to call at the cottage in the quietest manner possible but mrs trevelyan with her scheme in her head for the recapture of their child begged that the cab might go onand thus they were driven up to the door  rivers cottage was not a prepossessing abode it was a new building of lightcoloured bricks with a door in the middle and one window on each side over the door was a stone tablet bearing the namerivers cottage there was a little garden between the road and the house across which there was a straight path to the door in front of one window was a small shrub generally called a puzzlemonkey and in front of the other was a variegated laurel there were two small morsels of green turf and a distant view round the corner of the house of a row of cabbage stumps if trevelyan were living there he had certainly come down in the world since the days in which he had occupied the house in curzon street the two ladies got out of the cab and slowly walked across the little garden mrs trevelyan was dressed in black and she wore a thick veil she had altogether been unable to make up her mind as to what should be her conduct to her husband should she see him that must be governed by circumstances as they might occur her visit was made not to him but to her boy  the door was opened before they knocked and trevelyan himself was standing in the narrow passage lady rowley was the first to speak louis she said i have brought your wife to see you  who told you that i was here he asked still standing in the passage  of course a mother would find out where was her child said lady rowley  you should not have come here without notice he said i was careful to let you know the conditions on which you should come  you do not mean that i shall not see my child said the mother oh louis you will let me see him  trevelyan hesitated a moment still keeping his position firmly in the doorway by this time an old woman decently dressed and of comfortable appearance had taken her place behind him and behind her was a slip of a girl about fifteen years of age this was the owner of rivers cottage and her daughter and all the inhabitants of the cottage were now there standing in the passage i ought not to let you see him said trevelyan you have intruded upon me in coming here i had not wished to see you heretill you had complied with the order i had given you what a meeting between a husband and a wife who had not seen each other now for many monthsbetween a husband and a wife who were still young enough not to have outlived the first impulses of their early love he still stood there guarding the way and had not even put out his hand to greet her he was guarding the way lest she should without his permission obtain access to her own child she had not removed her veil and now she hardly dared to step over the threshold of her husbands house at this moment she perceived that the woman behind was pointing to the room on the left as the cottage was entered and emily at once understood that her boy was there then at that moment she heard her sons voice as in his solitude the child began to cry i must go in she said i will go in and rushing on she tried to push aside her husband her mother aided her nor did trevelyan attempt to stop her with violence and in a moment she was kneeling at the foot of a small sofa with her child in her arms i had not intended to hinder you said trevelyan but i require from you a promise that you will not attempt to remove him  why should she not take him home with her said lady rowley  because i will not have it so replied trevelyan because i choose that it should be understood that i am to be the master of my own affairs  mrs trevelyan had now thrown aside her bonnet and her veil and was covering her child with caresses the poor little fellow whose mind had been utterly dismayed by the events which had occurred to him since his capture though he returned her kisses did so in fear and trembling and he was still sobbing rubbing his eyes with his knuckles and by no means yielding himself with his whole heart to his mothers tendernessas she would have had him do louey she said whispering to him you know mamma you havent forgotten mamma he half murmured some little infantine word through his sobs and then put his cheek up to be pressed against his mothers face louey will never never forget his own mamma will he louey the poor boy had no assurances to give and could only raise his cheek again to be kissed in the meantime lady rowley and trevelyan were standing by not speaking to each other regarding the scene in silence      illustration you havent forgotten mamma   shelady rowleycould see that he was frightfully altered in appearance even since the day on which she had so lately met him in the city his cheeks were thin and haggard and his eyes were deep and very brightand he moved them quickly from side to side as though ever suspecting something he seemed to be smaller in staturewithered as it were as though he had melted away and though he stood looking upon his wife and child he was not for a moment still he would change the posture of his hands and arms moving them quickly with little surreptitious jerks and would shuffle his feet upon the floor almost without altering his position his clothes hung about him and his linen was soiled and worn lady rowley noticed this especially as he had been a man peculiarly given to neatness of apparel he was the first to speak you have come down here in a cab said he  yesin a cab from london said lady rowley  of course you will go back in it you cannot stay here there is no accommodation it is a wretched place but it suits the boy as for me all places are now alike  louis said his wife springing up from her knees coming to him and taking his right hand between both her own you will let me take him with me i know you will let me take him with me  i cannot do that emily it would be wrong  wrong to restore a child to his mother oh louis think of it what must my life be without himor you  dont talk of me it is too late for that  not if you will be reasonable louis and listen to me oh heavens how ill you are as she said this she drew nearer to him so that her face was almost close to his louis come back come back and let it all be forgotten it shall be a dream a horrid dream and nobody shall speak of it he left his hand within hers and stood looking into her face he was well aware that his life since he had left her had been one long hour of misery there had been to him no alleviation no comfort no consolation he had not a friend left to him even his satellite the policeman was becoming weary of him and manifestly suspicious the woman with whom he was now lodging and whose resources were infinitely benefited by his payments to her had already thrown out hints that she was afraid of him and as he looked at his wife he knew that he loved her everything for him now was hot and dry and poor and bitter how sweet would it be again to sit with her soft hand in his to feel her cool brow against his own to have the comfort of her care and to hear the music of loving words the companionship of his wife had once been to him everything in the world but now for many months past he had known no companion she bade him come to her and look upon all this trouble as a dream not to be mentioned could it be possible that it should be so and that they might yet be happy togetherperhaps in some distant country where the story of all their misery might not be known he felt all this truly and with a keen accuracy if he were mad he was not all mad i will tell you of nothing that is past said she hanging to him and coming still nearer to him and embracing his arm  could she have condescended to ask him not to tell her of the pasthad it occurred to her so to word her requestshe might perhaps have prevailed but who can say how long the tenderness of his heart would have saved him from further outbreakand whether such prevailing on her part would have been of permanent service as it was her words wounded him in that spot of his inner self which was most sensitiveon that spot from whence had come all his fury a black cloud came upon his brow and he made an effort to withdraw himself from her grasp it was necessary to him that she should in some fashion own that he had been right and now she was promising him that she would not tell him of his fault he could not thus swallow down all the convictions by which he had fortified himself to bear the misfortunes which he had endured had he not quarrelled with every friend he possessed on this score and should he now stultify himself in all those quarrels by admitting that he had been cruel unjust and needlessly jealous and did not truth demand of him that he should cling to his old assurances had she not been disobedient illconditioned and rebellious had she not received the man both him personally and his letters after he had explained to her that his honour demanded that it should not be so how could he come into such terms as those now proposed to him simply because he longed to enjoy the rich sweetness of her soft hand to feel the fragrance of her breath and to quench the heat of his forehead in the cool atmosphere of her beauty why have you driven me to this by your intercourse with that man he said why why why did you do it  she was still clinging to him louis she said i am your wife  yes you are my wife  and will you still believe such evil of me without any cause  there has been causehorrible cause you must repentrepentrepent  heaven help me said the woman falling back from him and returning to the boy who was now seated in lady rowleys lap mamma do you speak to him what can i say would he think better of me were i to own myself to have been guilty when there has been no guilt no slightest fault does he wish me to purchase my child by saying that i am not fit to be his mother  louis said lady rowley if any man was ever wrong mad madly mistaken you are so now  have you come out here to accuse me again as you did before in london he asked is that the way in which you and she intend to let the past be as she says like a dream she tells me that i am ill it is true i am illand she is killing me killing me by her obstinacy  what would you have me do said the wife again rising from her child  acknowledge your transgressions and say that you will amend your conduct for the future  mamma mammawhat shall i say to him  who can speak to a man that is beside himself replied lady rowley  i am not so beside myself as yet lady rowley but that i know how to guard my own honour and to protect my own child i have told you emily the terms on which you can come back to me you had better now return to your mothers house and if you wish again to have a house of your own and your husband and your boy you know by what means you may acquire them for another week i shall remain hereafter that i shall remove far from hence  and where will you go louis  as yet i know not to italy i thinkor perhaps to america it matters little where for me  and will louey be taken with you  certainly he will go with me to strive to bring him up so that he may be a happier man than his father is all that there is now left for me in life mrs trevelyan had now got the boy in her arms and her mother was seated by her on the sofa trevelyan was standing away from them but so near the door that no sudden motion on their part would enable them to escape with the boy without his interposition it now again occurred to the mother to carry off her prize in opposition to her husbandbut she had no scheme to that effect laid with her mother and she could not reconcile herself to the idea of a contest with him in which personal violence would be necessary the woman of the house had indeed seemed to sympathise with her but she could not dare in such a matter to trust to assistance from a stranger i do not wish to be uncourteous said trevelyan but if you have no assurance to give me you had betterleave me  then there came to be a bargaining about time and the poor woman begged almost on her knees that she might be allowed to take her child upstairs and be with him alone for a few minutes it seemed to her that she had not seen her boy till she had had him to herself in absolute privacy till she had kissed his limbs and had her hand upon his smooth back and seen that he was white and clean and bright as he had ever been and the bargain was made she was asked to pledge her word that she would not take him out of the houseand she pledged her word feeling that there was no strength in her for that action which she had meditated he knowing that he might still guard the passage at the bottom of the stairs allowed her to go with the boy to his bedroom while he remained below with lady rowley a quarter of an hour was allowed to her and she humbly promised that she would return when that time was expired  trevelyan held the door open for her as she went and kept it open during her absence there was hardly a word said between him and lady rowley but he paced from the passage into the room and from the room into the passage with his hands behind his back it is cruel he said once it is very cruel  it is you that are cruel said lady rowley  of courseof course that is natural from you i expect that from you to this she made no answer and he did not open his lips again  after a while mrs trevelyan called to her mother and lady rowley was allowed to go upstairs the quarter of an hour was of course greatly stretched and all the time trevelyan continued to pace in and out of the room he was patient for he did not summon them but went on pacing backwards and forwards looking now and again to see that the cab was at its placethat no deceit was being attempted no second act of kidnapping being perpetrated at last the two ladies came down the stairs and the boy was with themand the woman of the house  louis said the wife going quickly up to her husband i will do anything if you will give me my child  what will you do  anythingsay what you want he is all the world to me and i cannot live if he be taken from me  acknowledge that you have been wrong  but howin what wordshow am i to speak it  say that you have sinnedand that you will sin no more  sinned louisas the woman didin the scripture would you have me say that  he cannot think that it is so said lady rowley  but trevelyan had not understood her lady rowley i should have fancied that my thoughts at any rate were my own but this is useless now the child cannot go with you today nor can you remain here go home and think of what i have said if then you will do as i would have you you shall return  with many embraces with promises of motherly love and with prayers for love in return the poor woman did at last leave the house and return to the cab as she went there was a doubt on her own mind whether she should ask to kiss her husband but he made no sign and she at last passed out without any mark of tenderness he stood by the cab as they entered it and closed the door upon them and then went slowly back to his room my poor bairn he said to the boy my poor bairn  why for mamma go sobbed the child  mamma goes oh heaven and earth why should she go she goes because her spirit is obstinate and she will not bend she is stiffnecked and will not submit herself but louey must love mamma alwaysand mamma some day will come back to him and be good to him  mamma is goodalways said the child trevelyan had intended on this very afternoon to have gone up to townto transact business with bozzle for he still believed though the aspect of the man was bitter to him as wormwood that bozzle was necessary to him in all his business and he still made appointments with the man sometimes at stony walk in the borough and sometimes at the tavern in poulters court even though bozzle not unfrequently neglected to attend the summons of his employer and he would go to his bankers and draw out money and then walk about the crowded lanes of the city and afterwards return to his desolate lodgings at willesden thinking that he had been transacting businessand that this business was exacted from him by the unfortunate position of his affairs but now he gave up his journey his retreat had been discovered and there came upon him at once a fear that if he left the house his child would be taken his landlady told him on this very day that the boy ought to be sent to his mother and had made him understand that it would not suit her to find a home any longer for one who was so singular in his proceedings he believed that his child would be given up at once if he were not there to guard it he stayed at home therefore turning in his mind many schemes he had told his wife that he should go either to italy or to america at once but in doing so he had had no formed plan in his head he had simply imagined at the moment that such a threat would bring her to submission but now it became a question whether he would do better than go to america he suggested to himself that he should go to canada and fix himself with his boy on some remote farmfar away from any city and would then invite his wife to join him if she would she was too obstinate as he told himself ever to yield unless she should be absolutely softened and brought down to the ground by the loss of her child what would do this so effectually as the interposition of the broad ocean between him and her he sat thinking of this for the rest of the day and louey was left to the charge of the mistress of rivers cottage  do you think he believes it mamma mrs trevelyan said to her mother when they had already made nearly half their journey home in the cab there had been nothing spoken hitherto between them except some halfformed words of affection intended for consolation to the young mother in her great affliction  he does not know what he believes dearest  you heard what he said i was to own that i hadsinned  sinnedyes because you will not obey him like a slave that is sinto him  but i asked him mamma did you not hear me i could not say the word plainerbut i asked him whether he meant that sin he must have known and he would not answer me and he spoke of mytransgression mamma if he believed that he would not let me come back at all  he did not believe it emily  could he possibly then so accuse methe mother of his child if his heart be utterly hard and false towards me if it is possible that he should be cruel to me with such cruelty as thatstill he must love his boy why did he not answer me and say that he did not think it  simply because his reason has left him  but if he be mad mamma ought we to leave him like that and then did you see his eyes and his face and his hands did you observe how thin he isand his back how bent and his clotheshow they were torn and soiled it cannot be right that he should be left like that  we will tell papa when we get home said lady rowley who was herself beginning to be somewhat frightened by what she had seen it is all very well to declare that a friend is mad when one simply desires to justify ones self in opposition to that friendbut the matter becomes much more serious when evidence of the friends insanity becomes true and circumstantial i certainly think that a physician should see him continued lady rowley on their return home sir marmaduke was told of what had occurred and there was a long family discussion in which it was decided that lady milborough should be consulted as being the oldest friend of louis trevelyan himself with whom they were acquainted trevelyan had relatives of his own name living in cornwall but mrs trevelyan herself had never even met one of that branch of the family  sir marmaduke however resolved that he himself would go out and see his soninlaw he too had called trevelyan mad but he did not believe that the madness was of such a nature as to interfere with his own duties in punishing the man who had ill used his daughter he would at any rate see trevelyan himselfbut of this he said nothing either to his wife or to his child     chapter lxviii  major magruders committee      illustration  sir marmaduke could not go out to willesden on the morning after lady rowleys return from rivers cottage because on that day he was summoned to attend at twelve oclock before a committee of the house of commons to give his evidence and the fruit of his experience as to the government of british colonies generally and as he went down to the house in a cab from manchester street he thoroughly wished that his friend colonel osborne had not been so efficacious in bringing him home the task before him was one which he thoroughly disliked and of which he was afraid he dreaded the inquisitors before whom he was to appear and felt that though he was called there to speak as a master of his art of governing he would in truth be examined as a servantand probably as a servant who did not know his business had his sojourn at home been in other respects happy he might have been able to balance the advantage against the inquirybut there was no such balancing for him now and moreover the expense of his own house in manchester street was so large that this journey in a pecuniary point of view would be of but little service to him so he went down to the house in an unhappy mood and when he shook hands in one of the passages with his friend osborne who was on the committee there was very little cordiality in his manner this is the most ungrateful thing i ever knew said the colonel to himself i have almost disgraced myself by having this fellow brought home and now he quarrels with me because that idiot his soninlaw has quarrelled with his wife and colonel osborne really did feel that he was a martyr to the ingratitude of his friend  the committee had been convoked by the house in compliance with the eager desires of a certain ancient pundit of the constitution who had been for many years a member and who had been known as a stern critic of our colonial modes of government to him it certainly seemed that everything that was was badas regarded our national dependencies but this is so usually the state of mind of all parliamentary critics it is so much a matter of course that the members who take up the army or the navy guns india our relations with spain or workhouse management should find everything to be bad rotten and dishonest that the wrath of the member for killicrankie against colonial peculation and idleness was not thought much of in the open house he had been at the work for years and the colonial office were so used to it that they rather liked him he had made himself free of the office and the clerks were always glad to see him it was understood that he said bitter things in the housethat was major magruders line of business but he could be quite pleasant when he was asking questions of a private secretary or telling the news of the day to a senior clerk as he was now between seventy and eighty and had been at the work for at least twenty years most of those concerned had allowed themselves to think that he would ride his hobby harmlessly to the day of his parliamentary death but the drop from a house corner will hollow a stone by its constancy and major magruder at last persuaded the house to grant him a committee of inquiry then there came to be serious faces at the colonial office and all the little pleasantries of a friendly opposition were at an end it was felt that the battle must now become a real fight and secretary and undersecretary girded up their loins  major magruder was chairman of his own committee and being a man of a laborious turn of mind much given to bluebooks very patient thoroughly conversant with the house and imbued with a strong belief in the efficacy of parliamentary questionings to carry a point if not to elicit a fact had a happy time of it during this session he was a man who always attended the house from 4 pm to the time of its breaking up and who never missed a division the slight additional task of sitting four hours in a committeeroom three days a week was only a delight the moreespecially as during those four hours he could occupy the post of chairman those who knew major magruder well did not doubt but that the committee would sit for many weeks and that the whole theory of colonial government or rather of imperial control supervising such government would be tested to the very utmost men who had heard the old major maunder on for years past on his pet subject hardly knew how much vitality would be found in him when his maundering had succeeded in giving him a committee  a governor from one of the greater colonies had already been under question for nearly a week and was generally thought to have come out of the fire unscathed by the flames of the majors criticism this governor had been a picked man and he had made it appear that the control of downing street was never more harsh and seldom less refreshing and beautifying than a spring shower in april no other lands under the sun were so blest in the way of government as were the colonies with which he had been acquainted and as a natural consequence their devotion and loyalty to the mother country were quite a passion with them now the major had been long of a mind that one or two colonies had better simply be given up to other nations which were more fully able to look after them than was england and that three or four more should be allowed to go clearcosting england nothing and owing england nothing but the wellchosen governor who had now been before the committee had rather staggered the majorand things altogether were supposed to be looking up for the colonial office  and now had come the day of sir marmadukes martyrdom he was first requested with most urbane politeness to explain the exact nature of the government which he exercised in the mandarins now it certainly was the case that the manner in which the legislative and executive authorities were intermingled in the affairs of these islands did create a complication which it was difficult for any man to understand and very difficult indeed for any man to explain to others there was a court of chancery so called which sir marmaduke described as a little parliament when he was asked whether the court exercised legislative or executive functions he said at first that it exercised both and then that it exercised neither he knew that it consisted of nine men of whom five were appointed by the colony and four by the crown yet he declared that the crown had the control of the courtwhich in fact was true enough no doubt as the five open members were not perhaps all of them immaculate patriots but on this matter poor sir marmaduke was very obscure when asked who exercised the patronage of the crown in nominating the four members he declared that the four members exercised it themselves did he appoint them no he never appointed anybody himself he consulted the court of chancery for everything at last it came out that the chief justice of the islands and three other officers always sat in the courtbut whether it was required by the constitution of the islands that this should be so sir marmaduke did not know it had worked well that was to say everybody had complained of it but he sir marmaduke would not recommend any change what he thought best was that the colonial secretary should send out his orders and that the people in the colonies should mind their business and grow coffee when asked what would be the effect upon the islands under his scheme of government if an incoming colonial secretary should change the policy of his predecessor he said that he didnt think it would much matter if the people did not know anything about it  in this way the major had a field day and poor sir marmaduke was much discomfited there was present on the committee a young parliamentary undersecretary who with much attention had studied the subject of the court of chancery in the mandarins and who had acknowledged to his superiors in the office that it certainly was of all legislative assemblies the most awkward and complicated he did what he could by questions judiciously put to pull sir marmaduke through his difficulties but the unfortunate governor had more than once lost his temper in answering the chairman and in his heavy confusion was past the power of any undersecretary let him be ever so clever to pull him through colonel osborne sat by the while and asked no questions he had been put on the committee as a respectable dummy but there was not a member sitting there who did not know that sir marmaduke had been brought home as his friendand some of them no doubt had whispered that this bringing home of sir marmaduke was part of the payment made by the colonel for the smiles of the governors daughter but no one alluded openly to the inefficiency of the evidence given no one asked why a governor so incompetent had been sent to them no one suggested that a job had been done there are certain things of which opposition members of parliament complain loudlyand there are certain other things as to which they are silent the line between these things is well known and should an illconditioned a pigheaded an underbred or an ignorant member not understand this line and transgress it by asking questions which should not be asked he is soon put down from the treasury bench to the great delight of the whole house  sir marmaduke after having been questioned for an entire afternoon left the house with extreme disgust he was so convinced of his own failure that he felt that his career as a colonial governor must be over surely they would never let him go back to his islands after such an exposition as he had made of his own ignorance he hurried off into a cab and was ashamed to be seen of men but the members of the committee thought little or nothing about it the major and those who sided with him had been anxious to entrap their witness into contradictions and absurdities for the furtherance of their own object and for the furtherance of theirs the undersecretary from the office and the supporters of government had endeavoured to defend their man but when the affair was over if no special admiration had been elicited for sir marmaduke neither was there expressed any special reprobation the major carried on his committee over six weeks and succeeded in having his bluebook printed but as a matter of course nothing further came of it and the court of chancery in the mandarin islands still continues to hold its own and to do its work in spite of the absurdities displayed in its construction major magruder has had his day of success and now feels that othellos occupation is gone he goes no more to the colonial office lives among his friends on the memories of his committeenot always to their gratificationand is beginning to think that as his work is done he may as well resign killicrankie to some younger politician poor sir marmaduke remembered his defeat with soreness long after it had been forgotten by all others who had been present and was astonished when he found that the journals of the day though they did in some curt fashion report the proceedings of the committee never uttered a word of censure against him as they had not before uttered a word of praise for that pearl of a governor who had been examined before him  on the following morning he went to the colonial office by appointment and then he saw the young irish undersecretary whom he had so much dreaded nothing could be more civil than was the young irish undersecretary who told him that he had better of course stay in town till the committee was over though it was not probable that he would be wanted again when the committee had done its work he would be allowed to remain six weeks on service to prepare for his journey back if he wanted more time after that he could ask for leave of absence so sir marmaduke left the colonial office with a great weight off his mind and blessed that young irish secretary as he went     chapter lxix  sir marmaduke at willesden   on the next day sir marmaduke purposed going to willesden he was in great doubt whether or no he would first consult that very eminent man dr trite turbury as to the possibility andif possibleas to the expediency of placing mr trevelyan under some control but sir marmaduke though he would repeatedly declare that his soninlaw was mad did not really believe in this madness he did not that is believe that trevelyan was so mad as to be fairly exempt from the penalties of responsibility and he was therefore desirous of speaking his own mind out fully to the man and as it were of having his own personal revenge before he might be deterred by the interposition of medical advice he resolved therefore that he would not see sir trite turbury at any rate till he had come back from willesden he also went down in a cab but he left the cab at the publichouse at the corner of the road and walked to the cottage  when he asked whether mr trevelyan was at home the woman of the house hesitated and then said that her lodger was out i particularly wish to see him said sir marmaduke feeling that the woman was lying to him but he aint to be seen sir said the woman i know he is at home said sir marmaduke but the argument was soon cut short by the appearance of trevelyan behind the womans shoulder  i am here sir marmaduke rowley said trevelyan if you wish to see me you may come in i will not say that you are welcome but you can come in then the woman retired and sir marmaduke followed trevelyan into the room in which lady rowley and emily had been received but the child was not now in the chamber  what are these charges that i hear against my daughter said sir marmaduke rushing at once into the midst of his indignation  i do not know what charges you have heard  you have put her away  in strict accuracy that is not correct sir marmaduke  but she is put away she is in my house now because you have no house of your own for her is not that so and when i came home she was staying with her uncle because you had put her away and what was the meaning of her being sent down into devonshire what has she done i am her father and i expect to have an answer  you shall have an answer certainly  and a true one i will have no hocuspocus no humbug no jesuitry  have you come here to insult me sir marmaduke because if so there shall be an end to this interview at once  there shall not be an endby g no not till i have heard what is the meaning of all this do you know what people are saying of youthat you are mad and that you must be locked up and your child taken away from you and your property  who are the people that say so yourselfand perhaps lady rowley does my wife say so does she think that i am mad she did not think so on thursday when she prayed that she might be allowed to come back and live with me  and you would not let her come  pardon me said trevelyan i would wish that she should comebut it must be on certain conditions  what i want to know is why she was turned out of your house  she was not turned out  what has she done that she should be punished urged sir marmaduke who was unable to arrange his questions with the happiness which had distinguished major magruder i insist upon knowing what it is that you lay to her charge i am her father and i have a right to know she has been barbarously shamefully illused and by g i will know  you have come here to bully me sir marmaduke rowley  i have come here sir to do the duty of a parent to his child to protect my poor girl against the cruelty of a husband who in an unfortunate hour was allowed to take her from her home i will know the reason why my daughter has been treated as thoughas thoughas though  listen to me for a minute said trevelyan  i am listening  i will tell you nothing i will answer you not a word  you will not answer me  not when you come to me in this fashion my wife is my wife and my claim to her is nearer and closer than is yours who are her father she is the mother of my child and the only being in the worldexcept that childwhom i love do you think that with such motives on my part for tenderness towards her for loving care for the most anxious solicitude that i can be made more anxious more tender more loving by coarse epithets from you i am the most miserable being under the sun because our happiness has been interrupted and is it likely that such misery should be cured by violent words and gestures if your heart is wrung for her so is mine if she be much to you she is more to me she came here the other day almost as a stranger and i thought that my heart would have burst beneath its weight of woe what can you do that can add an ounce to the burden that i bear you may as well leave meor at least be quiet  sir marmaduke had stood and listened to him and he too was so struck by the altered appearance of the man that the violence of his indignation was lessened by the pity which he could not suppress when trevelyan spoke of his wretchedness it was impossible not to believe him he was as wretched a being to look at as it might have been possible to find his contracted cheeks and lips always open and eyes glowing in their sunken caverns told a tale which even sir marmaduke who was not of nature quick in deciphering such stories could not fail to read and then the twitching motion of the mans hands and the restless shuffling of his feet produced a nervous feeling that if some remedy were not applied quickly some alleviation given to the misery of the suffering wretch human power would be strained too far and the man would break to piecesor else the mind of the man sir marmaduke during his journey in the cab had resolved that old as he was he would take this sinner by the throat this brute who had striven to stain his daughters nameand would make him there and then acknowledge his own brutality but it was now very manifest to sir marmaduke that there could be no taking by the throat in this case he could not have brought himself to touch the poor weak passionate creature before him indeed even the fury of his words was stayed and after that last appeal he stormed no more but what is to be the end of it he said  who can tell who can say she can tell she can put an end to it all she has but to say a word and i will devote my life to her but that word must be spoken as he said this he dashed his hand upon the table and looked up with an air that would have been comic with its assumed magnificence had it not been for the true tragedy of the occasion  you had better at any rate let her have her child for the present  nomy boy shall go with me she may go too if she pleases but my boy shall certainly go with me if i had put her from me as you said just now it might have been otherwise but she shall be as welcome to me as flowers in mayas flowers in may she shall be as welcome to me as the music of heaven  sir marmaduke felt that he had nothing more to urge he had altogether abandoned that idea of having his revenge at the cost of the mans throat and was quite convinced that reason could have no power with him he was already thinking that he would go away straight to his lawyer so that some step might be taken at once to stop if possible the taking away of the boy to america when the lock of the door was gently turned and the landlady entered the room  you will excuse me sir said the woman but if you be anything to this gentleman  mrs fuller leave the room said trevelyan i and the gentleman are engaged  i see you be engaged and i do beg pardon i aint one as would intrude wilful and as for listening or the likes of that i scorn it but if this gentleman be anything to you mr trevelyan  i am his wifes father said sir marmaduke  like enough i was thinking perhaps so his lady was down here on thursdayas sweet a lady as any gentleman need wish to stretch by his side  mrs fuller said trevelyan marching up towards her i will not have this and i desire that you will retire from my room  but mrs fuller escaped round the table and would not be banished she got round the table and came closely opposite to sir marmaduke i dont want to say nothing out of my place sir said she but something ought to be done he aint fit to be left to hisselfnot alonenot as he is at present he aint indeed and i wouldnt be doing my duty if i didnt say so he has them sweats at night asd be enough to kill any man and he eats nothing and he dont do nothing and as for that poor little boy as is now in my own bed upstairs if it wasnt that i and my bessy is fond of children i dont know what would become of that boy  trevelyan finding it impossible to get rid of her had stood quietly while he listened to her she has been good to my child he said i acknowledge it as for myself i have not been well it is true but i am told that travel will set me on my feet again change of air will do it not long since he had been urging the wretchedness of his own bodily health as a reason why his wife should yield to him but now when his sickness was brought as a charge against himwas adduced as a reason why his friends should interfere and look after him and concern themselves in his affairs he saw at once that it was necessary that he should make little of his ailments  would it not be best trevelyan that you should come with me to a doctor said sir marmaduke  nono i have my own doctor that is i know the course which i should follow this place though it is good for the boy has disagreed with me and my life has not been altogether pleasanti may say by no means pleasant troubles have told upon me but change of air will mend it all  i wish you would come with me at once to london you shall come back you know i will not detain you  thank youno i will not trouble you that will do mrs fuller you have intended to do your duty no doubt and now you can go whereupon mrs fuller did go i am obliged for your care sir marmaduke but i can really do very well without troubling you  you cannot suppose trevelyan that we can allow things to go on like this  and what do you mean to do  welli shall take advice i shall go to a lawyerand to a doctor and perhaps to the lord chancellor and all that kind of thing we cant let things go on like this  you can do as you please said trevelyan but as you have threatened me i must ask you to leave me  sir marmaduke could do no more and could say no more and he took his leave shaking hands with the man and speaking to him with a courtesy which astonished himself it was impossible to maintain the strength of his indignation against a poor creature who was so manifestly unable to guide himself but when he was in london he drove at once to the house of dr trite turbury and remained there till the doctor returned from his round of visits according to the great authority there was much still to be done before even the child could be rescued out of the fathers hands i cant act without the lawyers said dr turbury but he explained to sir marmaduke what steps should be taken in such a matter  trevelyan in the mean time clearly understanding that hostile measures would now be taken against him set his mind to work to think how best he might escape at once to america with his boy     chapter lxx  shewing what nora rowley thought about carriages   sir marmaduke on his return home from dr turburys house found that he had other domestic troubles on hand over and above those arising from his elder daughters position mr hugh stanbury had been in manchester street during his absence and had asked for him and finding that he was away from home had told his story to lady rowley when he had been shown upstairs all the four daughters had been with their mother but he had said a word or two signifying his desire to speak to lady rowley and the three girls had left the room in this way it came to pass that he had to plead his cause before noras mother and her elder sister he had pleaded it well and lady rowleys heart had been well disposed towards him but when she asked of his house and his home his answer had been hardly more satisfactory than that of alanadale there was little that he could call his own beyond the blue vault of heaven had he saved any money nonot a shillingthat was to sayas he himself expressed itnothing that could be called money he had a few pounds by him just to go on with what was his income welllast year he had made four hundred pounds and this year he hoped to make something more he thought he could see his way plainly to five hundred a year was it permanent and if not on what did it depend he believed it to be as permanent as most other professional incomes but was obliged to confess that as regarded the source from whence it was drawn at the present moment it might be brought to an abrupt end any day by a disagreement between himself and the editor of the d r did he think that this was a fixed income he did think that if he and the editor of the d r were to fall out he could come across other editors who would gladly employ him would he himself feel safe in giving his own sister to a man with such an income in answer to this question he started some rather bold doctrines on the subject of matrimony in general asserting that safety was not desirable that energy patience and mutual confidence would be increased by the excitement of risk and that in his opinion it behoved young men and young women to come together and get themselves married even though there might be some not remote danger of distress before them he admitted that starvation would be disagreeableespecially for children in the eyes of their parentsbut alleged that children as a rule were not starved and quoted the scripture to prove that honest laborious men were not to be seen begging their bread in the streets he was very eloquent but his eloquence itself was against him both lady rowley and mrs trevelyan were afraid of such advanced opinions and although everything was of course to be left nominally to the decision of sir marmaduke they both declared that they could not recommend sir marmaduke to consent lady rowley said a word as to the expediency of taking nora back with her to the mandarins pointing out what appeared to her then to be the necessity of taking mrs trevelyan with them also and in saying this she hinted that if nora were disposed to stand by her engagement and mr stanbury equally so disposed there might be some possibility of a marriage at a future period only in such case there must be no correspondence in answer to this hugh declared that he regarded such a scheme as being altogether bad the mandarins were so very far distant that he might as well be engaged to an angel in heaven nora if she were to go away now would perhaps never come back again and if she did come back would be an old woman with hollow cheeks in replying to this proposition he let fall an opinion that nora was old enough to judge for herself he said nothing about her actual age and did not venture to plead that the young lady had a legal right to do as she liked with herself but he made it manifest that such an idea was in his mind in answer to this lady rowley asserted that nora was a good girl and would do as her father told her but she did not venture to assert that nora would give up her engagement lady rowley at last undertook to speak to sir rowley and to speak also to her daughter hugh was asked for his address and gave that of the office of the d r he was always to be found there between three and five and after that four times a week in the reporters gallery of the house of commons then he was at some pains to explain to lady rowley that though he attended the reporters gallery he did not report himself it was his duty to write leading political articles and to enable him to do so he attended the debates  before he went mrs trevelyan thanked him most cordially for the trouble he had taken in procuring for her the address at willesden and gave him some account of the journey which she and her mother had made to rivers cottage he argued with both of them that the unfortunate man must now be regarded as being altogether out of his mind and something was said as to the great wisdom and experience of dr trite turbury then hugh stanbury took his leave and even lady rowley bade him adieu with kind cordiality i dont wonder mamma that nora should like him said mrs trevelyan  that is all very well my dear and no doubt he is pleasant and manly and all thatbut really it would be almost like marrying a beggar  for myself said mrs trevelyan if i could begin life again i do not think that any temptation would induce me to place myself in a mans power  sir marmaduke was told of all this on his return home and he asked many questions as to the nature of stanburys work when it was explained to himlady rowley repeating as nearly as she could all that hugh had himself said about it he expressed his opinion that writing for a penny newspaper was hardly more safe as a source of income than betting on horse races i dont see that it is wrong said mrs trevelyan  i say nothing about wrong i simply assert that it is uncertain the very existence of such a periodical must in itself be most insecure sir marmaduke amidst the cares of his government at the mandarins had perhaps had no better opportunity of watching what was going on in the world of letters than had fallen to the lot of miss stanbury at exeter  i think your papa is right said lady rowley  of course i am right it is out of the question and so nora must be told he had as yet heard nothing about mr glascock had that misfortune been communicated to him his cup would indeed have been filled with sorrow to overflowing  in the evening nora was closeted with her father nora my dear you must understand once and for all that this cannot be said sir marmaduke the governor when he was not disturbed by outward circumstances could assume a good deal of personal dignity and could speak especially to his children with an air of indisputable authority  what cant be papa said nora  sir marmaduke perceived at once that there was no indication of obedience in his daughters voice and he prepared himself for battle he conceived himself to be very strong and thought that his objections were so well founded that no one would deny their truth and that his daughter had not a leg to stand on this that your mamma tells me of about mr stanbury do you know my dear that he has not a shilling in the world  i know that he has no fortune papaif you mean that  and no profession eithernothing that can be called a profession i do not wish to argue it my dear because there is no room for argument the whole thing is preposterous i cannot but think ill of him for having proposed it to you for he must have knownmust have known that a young man without an income cannot be accepted as a fitting suitor for a gentlemans daughter as for yourself i can only hope that you will get the little idea out of your head very quicklybut mamma will speak to you about that what i want you to understand from me is thisthat there must be an end to it  nora listened to this speech in perfect silence standing before her father and waiting patiently till the last word of it should be pronounced even when he had finished she still paused before she answered him papa she said at last and hesitated again before she went on  well my dear  i can not give it up  but you must give it up      illustration but you must give it up said sir marmaduke   no papa i would do anything i could for you and mamma but that is impossible  why is it impossible  because i love him so dearly  that is nonsense that is what all girls say when they choose to run against their parents i tell you that it shall be given up i will not have him here i forbid you to see him it is quite out of the question that you should marry such a man i do hope nora that you are not going to add to mammas difficulties and mine by being obstinate and disobedient he paused a moment and then added i do not think that there is anything more to be said  papa  my dear i think you had better say nothing further about it if you cannot bring yourself at the present moment to promise that there shall be an end of it you had better hold your tongue you have heard what i say and you have heard what mamma says i do not for a moment suppose that you dream of carrying on a communication with this gentleman in opposition to our wishes  but i do  do what  papa you had better listen to me sir marmaduke when he heard this assumed an air of increased authority in which he intended that paternal anger should be visible but he seated himself and prepared to receive at any rate some of the arguments with which nora intended to bolster up her bad cause i have promised mr stanbury that i will be his wife  that is all nonsense  do listen to me papa i have listened to you and you ought to listen to me i have promised him and i must keep my promise i shall keep my promise if he wishes it there is a time when a girl must be supposed to know what is best for herselfjust as there is for a man  i never heard such stuff in all my life do you mean that youll go out and marry him like a beggar with nothing but what you stand up in with no friend to be with you an outcast thrown off by your motherwith your fatherscurse  oh papa do not say that you would not curse me you could not  if you do it at all that will be the way  that will not be the way papa you could not treat me like that  and how are you proposing to treat me  but papa in whatever way i do it i must do it i do not say today or tomorrow but it must be the intention and purpose of my life and i must declare that it is everywhere i have made up my mind about it i am engaged to him and i shall always say sounless he breaks it i dont care a bit about fortune i thought i did once but i have changed all that  because this scoundrel has talked sedition to you  he is not a scoundrel papa and he has not talked sedition i dont know what sedition is i thought it meant treason and im sure he is not a traitor he has made me love him and i shall be true to him  hereupon sir marmaduke began almost to weep there came first a halfsmothered oath and then a sob and he walked about the room and struck the table with his fist and rubbed his bald head impatiently with his hand nora he said i thought you were so different from this if i had believed this of you you never should have come to england with emily  it is too late for that now papa  your mamma always told me that you had such excellent ideas about marriage  so i havei think said she smiling  she always believed that you would make a match that would be a credit to the family  i tried it papathe sort of match that you mean indeed i was mercenary enough in what i believed to be my views of life i meant to marry a rich manif i could and did not think much whether i should love him or not but when the rich man came  what rich man  i suppose mamma has told you about mr glascock  who is mr glascock i have not heard a word about mr glascock then nora was forced to tell her storywas called upon to tell it with all its aggravating details by degrees sir marmaduke learned that this mr glascock who had desired to be his soninlaw was in very truth the heir to the peterborough title and estateswould have been such a soninlaw as almost to compensate by the brilliance of the connection for that other unfortunate alliance he could hardly control his agony when he was made to understand that this embryo peer had in truth been in earnest do you mean that he went down after you into devonshire  yes papa  and you refused him thena second time  yes papa  whywhywhy you say yourself that you liked himthat you thought that you would accept him  when it came to speaking the word papa i found that i could not pretend to love him when i did not love him i did not care for himand i liked somebody else so much better i just told him the plain truthand so he went away  the thought of all that he had lost of all that might so easily have been his for a time overwhelmed sir marmaduke and drove the very memory of hugh stanbury almost out of his head he could understand that a girl should not marry a man whom she did not like but he could not understand how any girl should not love such a suitor as was mr glascock and had she accepted this pearl of men with her position with her manners and beauty and appearance such a connection would have been as good as an assured marriage for every one of sir marmadukes numerous daughters nora was just the woman to look like a great lady a lady of high ranksuch a lady as could almost command men to come and throw themselves at her unmarried sisters feet sir marmaduke had believed in his daughter nora had looked forward to see her do much for the family and when the crash had come upon the trevelyan household had thought almost as much of her injured prospects as he had of the misfortune of her sister but now it seemed that more than all the good things of what he had dreamed had been proposed to this unruly girl in spite of that great crashand had been rejected and he saw more than thisas he thought these good things would have been accepted had it not been for this rascal of a pennyaliner this friend of that other rascal trevelyan who had come in the way of their family to destroy the happiness of them all sir marmaduke in speaking of stanbury after this would constantly call him a pennyaliner thinking that the contamination of the penny communicated itself to all transactions of the daily record  you have made your bed for yourself nora and you must lie upon it  just so papa  i mean that as you have refused mr glascocks offer you can never again hope for such an opening in life  of course i cannot i am not such a child as to suppose that there are many mr glascocks to come and run after me and if there were ever so many papa it would be no good as you say i have chosen for myself and i must put up with it when i see the carriages going about in the streets and remember how often i shall have to go home in an omnibus i do think about it a good deal  im afraid you will think when it is too late  it isnt that i dont like carriages papa i do like them and pretty dresses and brooches and men and women who have nothing to do and balls and the opera buti love this man and that is more to me than all the rest i cannot help myself if it were ever so papa you mustnt be angry with me pray pray pray do not say that horrid word again  this was the end of the interview sir marmaduke found that he had nothing further to say nora when she reached her last prayer to her father referring to that curse with which he had threatened her was herself in tears and was leaning on him with her head against his shoulder of course he did not say a word which could be understood as sanctioning her engagement with stanbury he was as strongly determined as ever that it was his duty to save her from the perils of such a marriage as that but nevertheless he was so far overcome by her as to be softened in his manners towards her he kissed her as he left her and told her to go to her mother then he went out and thought of it all and felt as though paradise had been opened to his child and she had refused to enter the gate     chapter lxxi  shewing what hugh stanbury thought about the duty of man   in the conference which took place between sir marmaduke and his wife after the interview between him and nora it was his idea that nothing further should be done at all i dont suppose the man will come here if he be told not said sir marmaduke and if he does nora of course will not see him he then suggested that nora would of course go back with them to the mandarins and that when once there she would not be able to see stanbury any more there must be no correspondence or anything of that sort and so the thing will die away but lady rowley declared that this would not quite suffice mr stanbury had made his offer in due form and must be held to be entitled to an answer sir marmaduke therefore wrote the following letter to the pennyaliner mitigating the asperity of his language in compliance with his wifes counsels      manchester street april 20th 186     my dear sir     lady rowley has told me of your proposal to my daughter    nora and she has told me also what she learned from you    as to your circumstances in life i need hardly point out    to you that no father would be justified in giving his    daughter to a gentleman upon so small an income and upon    an income so very insecure     i am obliged to refuse my consent and i must therefore    ask you to abstain from visiting and from communicating    with my daughter     yours faithfully     marmaduke rowley     hugh stanbury esq   this letter was directed to stanbury at the office of the d r and sir marmaduke as he wrote the pernicious address felt himself injured in that he was compelled to write about his daughter to a man so circumstanced stanbury when he got the letter read it hastily and then threw it aside he knew what it would contain before he opened it he had heard enough from lady rowley to be aware that sir marmaduke would not welcome him as a soninlaw indeed he had never expected such welcome he was halfashamed of his own suit because of the lowliness of his positionhalfregretful that he should have induced such a girl as nora rowley to give up for his sake her hopes of magnificence and splendour but sir marmadukes letter did not add anything to this feeling he read it again and smiled as he told himself that the father would certainly be very weak in the hands of his daughter then he went to work again at his article with a persistent resolve that so small a trifle as such a note should have no effect upon his daily work of course sir marmaduke would refuse his consent of course it would be for him stanbury to marry the girl he loved in opposition to her father her father indeed if nora chose to take himand as to that he was very doubtful as to noras wisdombut if nora would take him what was any fathers opposition to him he wanted nothing from noras father he was not looking for money with his wifenor for fashion nor countenance such a bohemian was he that he would be quite satisfied if his girl would walk out to him and become his wife with any morninggown on and with any old hat that might come readiest to hand he wanted neither cards nor breakfast nor carriages nor fine clothes if his nora should choose to come to him as she was he having had all previous necessary arrangements duly madesuch as calling of banns or procuring of licence if possiblehe thought that a fathers opposition would almost add something to the pleasure of the occasion so he pitched the letter on one side and went on with his article and he finished his article but it may be doubted whether it was completed with the full strength and pith needed for moving the pulses of the national mindas they should be moved by leading articles in the d r as he was writing he was thinking of noraand thinking of the letter which noras father had sent to him trivial as was the letter he could not keep himself from repeating the words of it to himself need hardly point outoh neednt he then why does he refusing his consent i wonder what the old buffers think is the meaning of their consent when they are speaking of daughters old enough to manage for themselves abstain from visiting or communicating with her but if she visits and communicates with mewhat then i cant force my way into the house but she can force her way out does he imagine that she can be locked up in the nursery or put into the corner so he argued with himself and by such arguments he brought himself to the conviction that it would be well for him to answer sir marmadukes letter this he did at oncebefore leaving the office of the d r      250 fleet street 20th april     my dear sir marmaduke rowley     i have just received your letter and am indeed sorry that    its contents should be so little favourable to my hopes    i understand that your objection to me is simply in regard    to the smallness and insecurity of my income on the first    point i may say that i have fair hopes that it may be    at once increased as to the second i believe i may    assert that it is as sure at least as the income of other    professional men such as barristers merchants and    doctors i cannot promise to say that i will not see your    daughter if she desires me to do so of course i shall    be guided by her views i wish that i might be allowed an    opportunity of seeing you as i think i could reverse or    at least mitigate some of the objections which you feel to    our marriage     yours most faithfully     hugh stanbury   on the next day but one sir marmaduke came to him he was sitting at the office of the d r in a very small and dirty room at the back of the house and sir marmaduke found his way thither through a confused crowd of compositors pressmen and printers boys he thought that he had never before been in a place so foul so dark so crowded and so comfortless he himself was accustomed to do his work out in the islands with many of the appanages of viceroyalty around him he had his secretary and his private secretary and his innerroom and his waitingroom and not unfrequently he had the honour of a dusky sentinel walking before the door through which he was to be approached he had an idea that all gentlemen at their work had comfortable appurtenances around themsuch as carpets dispatchboxes unlimited stationery easy chairs for temporary leisure big tablespace and a small world of books around them to give at least a look of erudition to their pursuits there was nothing of the kind in the miserably dark room occupied by stanbury he was sitting at a wretched little table on which there was nothing but a morsel of blotting paper a small inkbottle and the paper on which he was scribbling there was no carpet there and no dispatchbox and the only book in the room was a little dogseared dictionary sir marmaduke i am so much obliged to you for coming said hugh i fear you will find this place a little rough but we shall be all alone  the place mr stanbury will not signify i think  not in the leastif you dont mind it i got your letter you know sir marmaduke  and i have had your reply i have come to you because you have expressed a wish for an interviewbut i do not see that it will do any good  you are very kind for coming indeed sir marmadukevery kind i thought i might explain something to you about my income  can you tell me that you have any permanent income  it goes on regularly from month to monthsir marmaduke did not feel the slightest respect for an income that was paid monthly according to his ideas a gentlemans income should be paid quarterly or perhaps halfyearly according to his view a monthly salary was only one degree better than weekly wagesand i suppose that is permanence said hugh stanbury  i cannot say that i so regard it  a barrister gets his you know very irregularly there is no saying when he may have it  but a barristers profession is recognised as a profession among gentlemen mr stanbury  and is not ours recognised which of us barristers or men of literature have the most effect on the world at large who is most thought of in london sir marmadukethe lord chancellor or the editor of the jupiter  the lord chancellor a great deal said sir marmaduke quite dismayed by the audacity of the question  by no means sir marmaduke said stanbury throwing out his hand before him so as to give the energy of action to his words he has the higher rank i will admit that  i should think so said sir marmaduke  and the larger income  very much larger i should say said sir marmaduke with a smile  and he wears a wig  yeshe wears a wig said sir marmaduke hardly knowing in what spirit to accept this assertion  and nobody cares one brass button for him or his opinions said stanbury bringing down his hand heavily on the little table for the sake of emphasis  what sir  if youll think of it it is so  nobody cares for the lord chancellor it certainly is the fact that gentlemen living in the mandarin islands do think more of the lord chancellor and the lord mayor and the lordlieutenant and the lord chamberlain than they whose spheres of life bring them into closer contact with those august functionaries i presume mr stanbury that a connection with a penny newspaper makes such opinions as these almost a necessity  quite a necessity sir marmaduke no man can hold his own in print nowadays unless he can see the difference between tinsel and gold  and the lord chancellor of course is tinsel  i do not say so he may be a great lawyerand very useful but his lordship and his wig and his woolsack are tinsel in comparison with the real power possessed by the editor of a leading newspaper if the lord chancellor were to go to bed for a month would he be much missed  i dont know sir im not in the secrets of the cabinet i should think he would  about as much as my grandmotherbut if the editor of the jupiter were to be taken ill it would work quite a commotion for myself i should be gladon public groundsbecause i dont like his mode of business but it would have an effectbecause he is a leading man  i dont see what all this leads to mr stanbury  only to thisthat we who write for the press think that our calling is recognised and must be recognised as a profession talk of permanence sir marmaduke are not the newspapers permanent do not they come out regularly every dayand more of them and still more of them are always coming out you do not expect a collapse among them  there will be plenty of newspapers i do not doubtmore than plenty perhaps  somebody must write themand the writers will be paid  anybody could write the most of them i should say  i wish you would try sir marmaduke just try your hand at a leading article tonight and read it yourself tomorrow morning  ive a great deal too much to do mr stanbury  just so you have no doubt the affairs of your government to look to we are all so apt to ignore the work of our neighbours it seems to me that i could go over and govern the mandarins without the slightest trouble in the world but no doubt i am mistakenjust as you are about writing for the newspapers  i do not know said sir marmaduke rising from his chair with dignity that i called here to discuss such matters as these as it happens you mr stanbury are not the governor of the mandarins and i have not the honour to write for the columns of the penny newspaper with which you are associated it is therefore useless to discuss what either of us might do in the position held by the other  altogether useless sir marmadukeexcept just for the fun of the thing  i do not see the fun mr stanbury i came here at your request to hear what you might have to urge against the decision which i expressed to you in reference to my daughter as it seems that you have nothing to urge i will not take up your time further  but i have a great deal to urge and have urged a great deal  have you indeed  you have complained that my work is not permanent i have shewn that it is so permanent that there is no possibility of its coming to an end there must be newspapers and the people trained to write them must be employed i have been at it now about two years you know what i earn could i have got so far in so short a time as a lawyer a doctor a clergyman a soldier a sailor a government clerk or in any of those employments which you choose to call professions i think that is urging a great deal i think it is urging everything  very well mr stanbury i have listened to you and in a certain degree i admire youryouryour zeal and ingenuity shall i say  i didnt mean to call for admiration sir marmaduke but suppose you saygood sense and discrimination  let that pass you must permit me to remark that your position is not such as to justify me in trusting my daughter to your care as my mind on that matter is quite made up as is that also of lady rowley i must ask you to give me your promise that your suit to my daughter shall be discontinued  what does she say about it sir marmaduke  what she has said to me has been for my ears and not for yours  what i say is for her ears and for yours and for her mothers ears and for the ears of any who may choose to hear it i will never give up my suit to your daughter till i am forced to do so by a full conviction that she has given me up it is best to be plain sir marmaduke of course  i do not understand this mr stanbury  i mean to be quite clear  i have always thought that when a gentleman was told by the head of a family that he could not be made welcome in that family it was considered to be the duty of that gentlemanas a gentlemanto abandon his vain pursuit i have been brought up with that idea  and i sir marmaduke have been brought up in the idea that when a man has won the affections of a woman it is the duty of that manas a manto stick to her through thick and thin and i mean to do my duty according to my idea  then sir i have nothing further to say but to take my leave i must only caution you not to enter my doors as the passages were dark and intricate it was necessary that stanbury should shew sir marmaduke out and this he did in silence when they parted each of them lifted his hat and not a word more was said  that same night there was a note put into noras hands as she was following her mother out of one of the theatres in the confusion she did not even see the messenger who had handed it to her her sister lucy saw that she had taken the note and questioned her about it afterwardswith discretion however and in privacy this was the note      dearest love     i have seen your father who is sternafter the manner    of fathers what granite equals a parents flinty bosom    for myself i do not prefer clandestine arrangements    and rope ladders and you dear have nothing of the    lydia about you but i do like my own way and like it    especially when you are at the end of the path it is    quite out of the question that you should go back to those    islands i think i am justified in already assuming enough    of the husband to declare that such going back must not be    held for a moment in question my proposition is that you    should authorise me to make such arrangements as may be    needed in regard to licence banns or whatever else and    that you should then simply walk from the house to the    church and marry me you are of age and can do as you    please neither your father nor mother can have any right    to stop you i do not doubt but that your mother would    accompany you if she were fully satisfied of your    purpose write to me to the d r     your own ever and ever and always     h s     i shall try and get this given to you as you leave the    theatre if it should fall into other hands i dont much    care im not in the least ashamed of what i am doing and    i hope that you are not     chapter lxxii  the delivery of the lamb      illustration  it is hoped that a certain quarter of lamb will not have been forgottena quarter of lamb that was sent as a peaceoffering from exeter to nuncombe putney by the hands of miss stanburys martha not with purposes of corruption not intended to buy back the allegiance of dorothyfolded delicately and temptingly in one of the best table napkins with no idea of bribery but sent as presents used to be sent of old in the trains of great ambassadors as signs of friendship and marks of true respect miss stanbury was no doubt most anxious that her niece should return to her but was not herself low spirited enough to conceive that a quarter of lamb could be efficacious in procuring such return if it might be that dorothys heart could be touched by mention of the weariness of her aunts solitary life and if therefore she would return it would be very well but it could not be well so unless the offer should come from dorothy herself all of which martha had been made to understand by her mistress considerable ingenuity having been exercised in the matter on each side  on her arrival at lessboro martha had hired a fly and been driven out to nuncombe putney but she felt she knew not why a dislike to be taken in her carriage to the door of the cottage and was put down in the middle of the village from whence she walked out to mrs stanburys abode with the basket upon her arm it was a good half mile and the lamb was heavy for miss stanbury had suggested that a bottle of sherry should be put in under the napkinand martha was becoming tired of her burden whenwhom should she see on the road before her but brooke burgess as she said herself afterwards it immediately occurred to her that all the fat was in the fire here had this young man come down passing through exeter without even a visit to miss stanbury and had clandestinely sought out the young woman whom he wasnt to marry and here was the young woman herself flying in her aunts face when one scratch of a pen might ruin them both martha entertained a sacred awful overcoming feeling about her mistresss will that she was to have something herself she supposed and her anxiety was not on that score but she had heard so much about it had realised so fully the great power which miss stanbury possessed and had had her own feelings so rudely invaded by alterations in miss stanburys plans that she had come to entertain an idea that all persons around her should continually bear that will in their memory hugh had undoubtedly been her favourite and could martha have dictated the will herself she would still have made hugh the heir but she had realised the resolution of her mistress so far as to confess that the bulk of the property was to go back to a burgess but there were very many burgesses and here was the one who had been selected flying in the very face of the testatrix what was to be done were she to go back and not tell her mistress that she had seen brooke burgess at nuncombe thenshould the fact be found outwould the devoted anger of miss stanbury fall upon her own head it would be absolutely necessary that she should tell the story let the consequences be what they mightbut the consequences probably would be very dreadful mr brooke that is not you she said as she came up to him putting her basket down in the middle of the dusty road  then who can it be said brooke giving her his hand to shake  but what do bring you here mr brooke goodness me what will missus say  i shall make that all straight im going back to exeter tomorrow then there were many questions and many answers he was sojourning at mrs crockets and had been there for the last two days dear dear dear she said over and over again deary me deary me and then she asked him whether it was all along of miss dorothy that he had come of course it was all along of miss dorothy brooke made no secret about it he had come down to see dorothys mother and sister and to say a bit of his own mind about future affairsand to see the beauties of the country when he talked about the beauties of the country martha looked at him as the people of lessboro and nuncombe putney should have looked at colonel osborne when he talked of the church porch at cockchaffington beauties of the country mr brookeyou ought to be ashamed of yourself said martha  but i aintthe least in the world said brooke  then martha took up her basket and went on to the cottage which had been close in sight during their conversation in the road she felt angry with dorothy in such matters a woman is always angry with the womanwho has probably been quite passive and rarely with the man who is ever the real transgressor having a man down after her at nuncombe putney it had never struck martha as very horrible that brooke burgess should fall in love with dorothy in the citybut this meeting in the remoteness of the country out of sight even of the village was almost indecent and all too with miss stanburys will just as one might say on the balance dorothy ought to have buried herself rather than have allowed brooke to see her at nuncombe putney and dorothys mother and priscilla must be worse she trudged on however with her lamb and soon found herself in the presence of the three ladies  whatmartha said dorothy  yes misshere i am id have been here halfanhour ago amost if i hadnt been stopped on the road  and who stopped you asked priscilla  whymr brooke of course  and what did mr brooke say to you asked dorothy  martha perceived at once that dorothy was quite radiant she told her mistress that she had never seen miss dorothy look half so comely before laws maam she brightened up and speckled about till it did your heart good to see her in spite of all but this was some time afterwards  he didnt say very much replied martha gravely  but ive got very much to tell you continued dorothy im engaged to be married to mr brooke and you must congratulate me it is settled now and mamma and my sister know all about it  martha when she was thus asked directly for congratulation hardly knew at once how to express herself being fully aware of miss stanburys objection to the marriage she could not venture to express her approbation of it it was very improper in marthas mind that any young woman should have a follower when the missus didnt approve of it she understood well enough that in that matter of followers privileges are allowed to young ladies which are not accorded to maid servants a young lady may do thingshave young men to walk and talk with them to dance with them and embrace them and perhaps even more than thiswhen for half so much a young woman would be turned into the streets without a character martha knew all this and knew also that miss dorothy though her mother lived in a very little cottage was not altogether debarred in the matter of followers from the privileges of a lady but yet miss dorothys position was so very peculiar look at that willor rather at that embryo will which might be made any day which now probably would be made and which might affect them both so terribly people who have not got money should not fly in the face of those who have such at least was marthas opinion very strongly how could she congratulate miss dorothy under the existing circumstances i do hope you will be happy missthat you knows said martha in her difficulty and now maammiss i mean she added correcting herself in obedience to miss stanburys direct orders about the presentmissus has just sent me over with a bit of lamb and a letter as is here in the basket and to ask how you isand the other ladies  we are very much obliged said mrs stanbury who had not understood the point of marthas speech  my sister is im sure said priscilla who had understood it  dorothy had taken the letter and had gone aside with it and was reading it very carefully it touched her nearly and there had come tears into both her eyes as she dwelt upon it there was something in her aunts allusion to the condition of unmarried women which came home to her especially she knew her aunts past history and now she knew or hoped that she knew something of her own future destiny her aunt was desolate whereas upon her the world smiled most benignly brooke had just informed her that he intended to make her his wife as speedily as possiblewith her aunts consent if possible but if not then without it he had ridiculed the idea of his being stopped by miss stanburys threats and had said all this in such fashion that even priscilla herself had only listened and obeyed he had spoken not a word of his own income and none of them had dreamed even of asking him a question he had been as a god in the little cottage and all of them had been ready to fall down and worship him mrs stanbury had not known how to treat him with sufficient deference and at the same time with sufficient affection he had kissed them all round and priscilla had felt an elation which was hardly intelligible to herself dorothy who was so much honoured had come to enjoy a status in her mothers estimation very different from that which she had previously possessed and had grown to be quite beautiful in her mothers eyes  there was once a family of three ancient maiden ladies much respected and loved in the town in which they lived their manners of life were well known among their friends and excited no surprise but a stranger to the locality once asked of the elder why miss matilda the younger always went first out of the room matilda once had an offer of marriage said the dear simple old lady who had never been so graced and who felt that such an episode in life was quite sufficient to bestow brevet rank it was believed by mrs stanbury that dorothys honours would be carried further than those of miss matilda but there was much of the same feeling in the bosom of the mother towards the fortunate daughter who in the eyes of a man had seemed goodly enough to be his wife  with this swelling happiness round her heart dorothy read her aunts letter and was infinitely softened i had gotten somehow to love to see your pretty face dorothy had thought little enough of her own beauty but she liked being told by her aunt that her face had been found to be pretty i am very desolate and solitary here her aunt said and then had come those words about the state of maiden womenand then those other words about womens duties and her aunts prayer on her behalf dear dorothy be not such an one she held the letter to her lips and to her bosom and could hardly continue its perusal because of her tears such prayers from the aged addressed to the young are generally held in light esteem but this adjuration was valued by the girl to whom it was addressed she put together the invitationor rather the permission accorded to her to make a visit to exeterand the intimation in the postscript that martha knew her mistresss mind and then she returned to the sittingroom in which martha was still seated with her mother and took the old servant apart martha she said is my aunt happy now  wellmiss  she is strong again is she not  sir peter says she is getting well and mr martin but mr martin isnt much account  she eats and drinks again  pretty wellnot as it used to be you know miss i tell her she ought to go somewheresbut she dont like moving nohow she never did i tell her if shed go to dawlishjust for a week but she dont think theres a bed fit to sleep on nowhere except just her own  she would go if sir peter told her  she says that these movings are newfangled fashions and that the air didnt use to want changing for folk when she was young i heard her tell sir peter herself that if she couldnt live at exeter she would die there she wont go nowheres miss dorothy she aint careful to live  tell me something martha will you  what is it miss dorothy  be a dear good woman now and tell me true would she be better if i were with her  she dont like being alone miss i dont know nobody as does  but now about mr brooke you know  yes mr brooke thats it  of course martha i love him better than anything in all the world i cant tell you how it was but i think i loved him the very first moment i saw him  dear dear dear  i couldnt help it marthabut its no good talking about it for of course i shant try to help it now only thisthat i would do anything in the world for my auntexcept that  but she dont like it miss dorothy that is the truth you know  it cant be helped now martha and of course shell be told at once shall i go and tell her id go today if you think she would like it  and mr brooke  he is to go tomorrow  and will you leave him here  why not nobody will hurt him i dont mind a bit about having him with me now but i can tell you this when he went away from us once it made me very unhappy would aunt stanbury be glad to see me martha  marthas reserve was at last broken down and she expressed herself in strong language there was nothing on earth her mistress wanted so much as to have her favourite niece back again martha acknowledged that there were great difficulties about brooke burgess and she did not see her way clearly through them dorothy declared her purpose of telling her aunt boldlyat once martha shook her head admiring the honesty and courage but doubting the result she understood better than did any one else the peculiarity of mind which made her mistress specially anxious that none of the stanbury family should enjoy any portion of the burgess money beyond that which she herself had saved out of the income there had been moments in which martha had hoped that this prejudice might be overcome in favour of hugh but it had become stronger as the old woman grew to be older and more feebleand it was believed now to be settled as fate shed sooner give it all to old barty over the way martha had once said than let it go to her own kith and kin and if she do hate any human creature she do hate barty burgess she assented however to dorothys proposal and though mrs stanbury and priscilla were astounded by the precipitancy of the measure they did not attempt to oppose it  and what am i to do said brooke when he was told  youll come tomorrow of course said dorothy  but it may be that the two of us together will be too many for the dear old lunatic  you shant call her a lunatic brooke she isnt so much a lunatic as you are to run counter to her and disobey her and all that kind of thing  and how about yourself  how can i help it brooke it is you that say it must be so  of course it must who is to be stayed from doing what is reasonable because an old woman has a bee on her bonnet i dont believe in peoples wills  she can do what she likes about it brooke  of course she can and of course she will what i mean is that it never pays to do this or that because somebody may alter his will or may make a will or may not make a will you become a slave for life and then your dead tyrant leaves you a mourningring and grins at you out of his grave all the same shell kick up a row i fancy and youll have to bear the worst of it  ill tell her the truth and if she be very angry ill just come home again but i think ill come home tomorrow any way so that ill pass you on the road that will be best she wont want us both together only then brooke i shant see you again  not till june  and is it to be really in june  you say you dont like may  you are such a goose brooke it will be may almost tomorrow i shall be such a poor wife for you brooke as for getting my things ready i shall not bring hardly any things at all have you thought what it is to take a body so very poor  i own i havent thought as much about it dollyas i ought to have done perhaps  it is too late now brooke  i suppose it is  quite too late a week ago i could have borne it i had almost got myself to think that it would be better that i should bear it but you have come and banished all the virtue out of my head i am ashamed of myself because i am so unworthy but i would put up with that shame rather than lose you now brooke brooke i will so try to be good to you  in the afternoon martha and dorothy started together for exeter brooke and priscilla accompanying them as far as mrs crockets where the lessboro fly was awaiting them dorothy said little or nothing during the walk nor indeed was she very communicative during the journey into exeter she was going to her aunt instigated simply by the affection of her full heart but she was going with a tale in her mouth which she knew would be very unwelcome she could not save herself from feeling that in having accepted brooke and in having not only accepted him but even fixed the day for her marriage she had been ungrateful to her aunt had it not been for her aunts kindness and hospitality she would never have seen brooke burgess and as she had been under her aunts care at exeter she doubted whether she had not been guilty of some great fault in falling in love with this man in opposition as it were to express orders should her aunt still declare that she would in no way countenance the marriage that she would still oppose it and use her influence with brooke to break it off then would dorothy return on the morrow to her mothers cottage at nuncombe putney so that her lover might be free to act with her aunt as he might think fit and should he yield she would endeavourshe would struggle hard to think that he was still acting for the best i must tell her myself martha said dorothy as they came near to exeter  certainly missonly youll do it tonight  yesat once as soon after i get there as possible     chapter lxxiii  dorothy returns to exeter   miss stanbury perfectly understood that martha was to come back by the train reaching exeter at 7 pm and that she might be expected in the close about a quarterofanhour after that time she had been nervous and anxious all dayso much so that mr martin had told her that she must be very careful thats all very well the old woman had said but you havent got any medicine for my complaint mr martin the apothecary had assured her that the worst of her complaint was in the east wind and had gone away begging her to be very careful it is not gods breezes that are hard to any one the old lady had said to herselfbut our own hearts after her lonely dinner she had fidgeted about the room and had rung twice for the girl not knowing what order to give when the servant came to her she was very anxious about her tea but would not have it brought to her till after martha should have arrived she was halfminded to order that a second cup and saucer should be placed there but she had not the courage to face the disappointment which would fall upon her should the cup and saucer stand there for no purpose and yet should she come how nice it would be to shew her girl that her old aunt had been ready for her thrice she went to the window after the cathedral clock had struck seven to see whether her ambassador was returning from her window there was only one very short space of pathway on which she could have seen herand as it happened there came the ring at the door and no ambassador had as yet been viewed miss stanbury was immediately off her seat and out upon the landing here we are again miss dorothy said martha then miss stanbury could not restrain herselfbut descended the stairs moving as she had never moved since she had first been ill my bairn she said my dearest bairn i thought that perhaps it might be so jane another teacup and saucer upstairs what a pity that she had not ordered it before and get a hot cake jane you will be ever so hungry my darling after your journey  are you glad to see me aunt stanbury said dorothy  glad my pretty one then she put up her hands and smoothed down the girls cheeks and kissed her and patted martha on the back and scolded her at the same time for not bringing miss dorothy from the station in a cab and what is the meaning of that little bag she said you shall go back for the rest yourself martha because it is your own fault martha knew that all this was pleasant enoughbut then her mistresss moods would sometimes be changed so suddenly how would it be when miss stanbury knew that brooke burgess had been left behind at nuncombe putney  you see i didnt stay to eat any of the lamb said dorothy smiling  you shall have a calf instead my dear said miss stanbury because you are a returned prodigal  all this was very pleasant and miss stanbury was so happy dispensing her tea and the hot cake and the clotted cream and was so intent upon her little methods of caressing and petting her niece that dorothy had no heart to tell her story while the plates and cups were still upon the table she had not perhaps cared much for the hot cake having such a weight upon her mind but she had seemed to care understanding well that she might so best conduce to her aunts comfort miss stanbury was a woman who could not bear that the good things which she had provided for a guest should not be enjoyed she could taste with a friends palate and drink with a friends throat but when debarred these vicarious pleasures by what seemed to her to be the caprice of her guests she would be offended it had been one of the original sins of camilla and arabella french that they would declare at her teatable that they had dined late and could not eat teacake dorothy knew all thisand did her dutybut with a heavy heart there was the story to be told and she had promised martha that it should be told tonight she was quite aware too independently of her promise that it was necessary that it should be told tonight it was very sadvery grievous that the dear old ladys happiness should be disturbed so soon but it must be done when the teathings were being taken away her aunt was still purring round her and saying gentle loving words dorothy bore it as well as she couldbore it well smiling and kissing her aunts hand and uttering now and then some word of affection but the thing had to be done and as soon as the room was quiet for a moment she jumped up from her chair and began aunt stanbury i must tell you something at once who do you think is at nuncombe putney  not brooke burgess  yes he is he is there now and is to be here with you tomorrow  the whole colour and character of miss stanburys face was changed in a moment she had been still purring up to the moment in which this communication had been made to her her gratification had come to her from the idea that her pet had come back to her from love of heras in very truth had been the case but now it seemed that dorothy had returned to ask for a great favour for herself and she reflected at once that brooke had passed through exeter without seeing her if he was determined to marry without reference to her he might at any rate have had the grace to come to her and say so she in the fulness of her heart had written words of affection to dorothyand both dorothy and brooke had at once taken advantage of her expressions for their own purposes such was her reading of the story of the day he need not trouble himself to come here now she said  dear aunt do not say that  i do say it he need not trouble himself to come now when i said that i should be glad to see you i did not intend that you should meet mr burgess under my roof i did not wish to have you both together  how could i help coming when you wrote to me like that  it is very wellbut he need not come he knows the way from nuncombe to london without stopping at exeter  aunt stanbury you must let me tell it you all  there is no more to tell i should think  but there is more you knew what he thought about me and what he wished  he is his own master my dearand you are your own mistress  if you speak to me like that you will kill me aunt stanbury i did not think of coming only when martha brought your dear letter i could not help it but he was coming he meant to come tomorrow and he will of course he must defend himself if you are angry with him  he need not defend himself at all  i told them and i told him that i would only stay one nightif you did not wish that we should be here together you must see him aunt stanbury you would not refuse to see him  if you please my dear you must allow me to judge whom i will see  after that the discussion ceased between them for awhile and miss stanbury left the room that she might hold a consultation with martha dorothy went up to her chamber and saw that everything had been prepared for her with most scrupulous care nothing could be whiter neater cleaner nicer than was everything that surrounded her she had perceived while living under her aunts roof how gradually small delicate feminine comforts had been increased for her martha had been told that miss dorothy ought to have this and that miss dorothy ought to have that till at last she who had hitherto known nothing of the small luxuries that come from an easy income had felt ashamed of the prettinesses that had been added to her now she could see at once that infinite care had been used to make her room bright and smilingonly in the hope that she would return as soon as she saw it all she sat down on her bed and burst out into tears was it not hard upon her that she should be forced into such ingratitude every comfort prepared for her was a coal of hot fire upon her head and yet what had she done that she ought not to have done was it unreasonable that she should have loved this man when they two were brought together and had she even dared to think of him otherwise than as an acquaintance till he had compelled her to confess her love and after that had she not tried to separate herself from him so that they twoher aunt and her lovermight be divided by no quarrel had not priscilla told her that she was right in all that she was doing nevertheless in spite of all this she could not refrain from accusing herself of ingratitude towards her aunt and she began to think it would have been better for her now to have remained at home and have allowed brooke to come alone to exeter than to have obeyed the impulse which had arisen from the receipt of her aunts letter when she went down again she found herself alone in the room and she was beginning to think that it was intended that she should go to bed without again seeing her aunt but at last miss stanbury came to her with a sad countenance but without that look of wrath which dorothy knew so well my dear she said it will be better that mr burgess should go up to london tomorrow i will see him of course if he chooses to come and martha shall meet him at the station and explain it if you do not mind i would prefer that you should not meet him here  i meant only to stay one night aunt  that is nonsense if i am to part with either of you i will part with him you are dearer to me than he is dorothy you do not know how dear to me you are  dorothy immediately fell on her knees at her aunts feet and hid her face in her aunts lap miss stanbury twined round her fingers the soft hair which she loved so wellbecause it was a grace given by god and not bought out of a shopand caressed the girls head and muttered something that was intended for a prayer if he will let me aunt i will give him up said dorothy looking up into her aunts face if he will say that i may though i shall love him always he may go  he is his own master said miss stanbury of course he is his own master  will you let me return tomorrowjust for a few daysand then you can talk to him as you please i did not mean to come to stay i wished him goodbye because i knew that i should not meet him here  you always talk of going away dorothy as soon as ever you are in the house you are always threatening me  i will come again the moment you tell me if he goes in the morning i will be here the same evening and i will write to him aunt stanbury and tell himthat he isquite freequite freequite free  miss stanbury made no reply to this but sat still playing with her nieces hair i think i will go to bed she said at last it is past ten you need not go to nuncombe dorothy martha shall meet him and he can see me here but i do not wish him to stay in the house you can go over and call on mrs machugh mrs machugh will take it well of you that you should call on her dorothy made no further opposition to this arrangement but kissed her aunt and went to her chamber  how was it all to be for her for the last two days she had been radiant with new happiness everything had seemed to be settled her lover in his highhanded way had declared that in no important crisis of life would he allow himself to be driven out of his way by the fear of what an old woman might do in her will when dorothy assured him that not for worlds would she though she loved him dearly injure his material prospects he had thrown it all aside after a grand fashion that had really made the girl think that all miss stanburys money was as nothing to his love for her she and priscilla and her mother had been carried away so entirely by brookes oratory as to feel for the time that the difficulties were entirely conquered but now the aspect of things was so different whatever brooke might owe to miss stanbury she dorothy owed her aunt everything she would immolate herselfif brooke would only let her she did not quite understand her aunts stubborn opposition but she knew that there was some great cause for her aunts feeling on the matter there had been a promise made or an oath sworn that the property of the burgess family should not go into the hands of any stanbury dorothy told herself that were she married she would be a stanbury no longerthat her aunt would still comply with the obligation she had fixed for herself but nevertheless she was ready to believe that her aunt might be right her aunt had always declared that it should be so and dorothy knowing this confessed to herself that she should have kept her heart under better control thinking of these things she went to the table where paper and ink and pens had all been prepared for her so prettily and began her letter to brooke dearest dearest brooke but then she thought that this was not a fair keeping of her promise and she began again my dear brooke the letter however did not get itself written that night it was almost impossible for her to write it i think it will be better for you she had tried to say to be guided by my aunt but how could she say this when she did not believe it it was her wish to make him understand that she would never think ill of him for a moment if he would make up his mind to abandon herbut she could not find the words to express herselfand she went at last to bed leaving the halfcovered paper upon the table  she went to bed and cried herself to sleep it had been so sweet to have a lovera man of her own to whom she could say what she pleased from whom she had a right to ask for counsel and protection a man who delighted to be near her and to make much of her in comparison with her old mode of living her old ideas of life her life with such a lover was passed in an elysium she had entered from barren lands into so rich a paradise but there is no paradise as she now found without apples which must be eaten and which lead to sorrow she regretted in this hour that she had ever seen brooke burgess after all with her aunts love and care for her with her mother and sister near her with the respect of those who knew her why should the lands have been barren even had there been no entrance for her into that elysium and did it not all result in thisthat the elysium to be desired should not be here that the paradise without the apples must be waited for till beyond the grave it is when things go badly with us here and for most of us only then that we think that we can see through the dark clouds into the joys of heaven but at last she slept and in her dreams brooke was sitting with her in niddon park with his arm tight clasped round her waist  she slept so soundly that when a step crept silently into her room and when a light was held for awhile over her face neither the step nor the light awakened her she was lying with her head back upon the pillow and her arm hung by the bedside and her lips were open and her loose hair was spread upon the pillow the person who stood there with the light thought that there never had been a fairer sight everything there was so pure so sweet so good she was one whose only selfish happiness could come to her from the belief that others loved her the step had been very soft and even the breath of the intruder was not allowed to pass heavily into the air but the light of the candle shone upon the eyelids of the sleeper and she moved her head restlessly on the pillow dorothy are you awake can you speak to me  then the disturbed girl gradually opened her eyes and gazed upwards and raised herself in her bed and sat wondering is anything the matter aunt she said  only the vagaries of an old woman my petof an old woman who cannot sleep in her bed      illustration only the vagaries of an old woman   but what is it aunt  kiss me dearest then with something of slumber still about her dorothy raised herself in her bed and placed her arm on her aunts shoulder and embraced her and now for my news said miss stanbury  what news aunt it isnt morning yet is it  noit is not morning you shall sleep again presently i have thought of it and you shall be brookes wife and i will have it here and we will all be friends  what  you will like thatwill you not  and you will not quarrel with him what am i to say what am i to do she was in truth awake now and not knowing what she did she jumped out of bed and stood holding her aunt by the arm  it is not a dream said miss stanbury  are you sure that it is not a dream and may he come here tomorrow  of course he will come tomorrow  and may i see him aunt stanbury  not if you go home my dear  but i wont go home and will you tell him oh dear oh dear aunt stanbury i do not think that i believe it yet  you will catch cold my dear if you stay there trying to believe it you have nothing on get into bed and believe it there you will have time to think of it before the morning then miss stanbury went back to her own chamber and dorothy was left alone to realise her bliss  she thought of all her life for the last twelve monthsof the first invitation to exeter and the doubts of the family as to its acceptance of her arrival and of her own doubts as to the possibility of her remaining of mr gibsons courtship and her aunts disappointment of brookes coming of her love and of hisand then of her departure back to nuncombe after that had come the triumph of brookes visit and then the terrible sadness of her aunts displeasure but now everything was good and glorious she did not care for money herself she thought that she never could care much for being rich but had she made brooke poor by marrying him that must always have been to her matter of regret if not of remorse but now it was all to be smooth and sweet now a paradise was to be opened to her with no apples which she might not eatno apples which might not but still must be eaten she thought that it would be impossible that she should sleep again that night but she did sleep and dreamed that brooke was holding her in niddon park tighter than ever  when the morning came she trembled as she walked down into the parlour might it not still be possible that it was all a dream or what if her aunt should again have changed her purpose but the first moment of her aunts presence told her that there was nothing to fear how did you sleep dorothy said the old lady  dear aunt i do not know was it all sleep  what shall we say to brooke when he comes  you shall tell him  no dearest you must tell him and you must say to him that if he is not good to my girl and does not love her always and cling to her and keep her from harm and be in truth her loving husband i will hold him to be the most ungrateful of human beings and before brooke came she spoke again i wonder whether he thinks you as pretty as i do dolly  he never said that he thought me pretty at all  did he not then he shall say so or he shall not have you it was your looks won me first dollylike an old fool as i am it is so pleasant to have a little nature after such a deal of artifice in which latter remarks it was quite understood that miss stanbury was alluding to her enemies at heavitree     chapter lxxiv  the lioness aroused   brooke burgess had been to exeter and had gonefor he only remained there one nightand everything was apparently settled it was not exactly told through exeter that miss stanburys heir was to be allowed to marry miss stanburys niece but martha knew it and giles hickbody guessed it and dorothy was allowed to tell her mother and sister and brooke himself in his own careless way had mentioned the matter to his uncle barty as miss stanbury had also told the secret in confidence to mrs machugh it cannot be said that it was altogether well kept four days after brookes departure the news reached the frenches at heavitree it was whispered to camilla by one of the shopmen with whom she was still arranging her marriage trousseau and was repeated by her to her mother and sister with some additions which were not intended to be goodnatured he gets her and the money together as a bargainof course said camilla i only hope the money wont be found too dear  perhaps he wont get it after all said arabella  that would be cruel replied camilla i dont think that even miss stanbury is so false as that  things were going very badly at heavitree there was war there almost everlastingly though such little playful conversations as the above shewed that there might be an occasional lull in the battle mr gibson was not doing his duty that was clear enough even mrs french when she was appealed to with almost frantic energy by her younger daughter could not but acknowledge that he was very remiss as a lover and camilla in her fury was very imprudent that very frantic energy which induced her to appeal to her mother was in itself proof of her imprudence she knew that she was foolish but she could not control her passion twice had she detected arabella in receiving notes from mr gibson which she did not see and of which it had been intended that she should know nothing and once when she spent a night away at ottery st mary with a frienda visit which was specially prefatory to marriage and made in reference to bridesmaids dressesarabella had hadso at least camilla was made to believea secret meeting with mr gibson in some of the lanes which lead down from heavitree to the topsham road  i happened to meet him and spoke two words to him said arabella would you have me cut him  ill tell you what it is bellaif there is any underhand game going on that i dont understand all exeter shall be on fire before you shall carry it out  bella made no answer to this but shrugged her shoulders camilla was almost at a loss to guess what might be the truth would not any sister so accused on such an occasion rebut the accusation with awful wrath but arabella simply shrugged her shoulders and went her way it was now the 15th of april and there wanted but one short fortnight to their marriage the man had not the courage to jilt her she felt sure that he had not heart enough to do a deed of such audacity and her sister too was weak and a coward and would lack the power to stand on her legs and declare herself to be the perpetrator of such villany her mother as she knew well would always have preferred that her elder daughter should be the bride but her mother was not the woman to have the hardihood now in the eleventh hour to favour such an intrigue let her wish be what it might she would not be strong enough to carry through the accomplishment of it they would all know that that threat of hers of setting exeter on fire would be carried out after some fashion that would not be inadequate to the occasion a sister a mother a promised lover all falseall so damnably cruelly false it was impossible no history no novel of most sensational interest no wonderful villany that had ever been wrought into prose or poetry would have been equal to this it was impossible she told herself so a score of times a day and yet the circumstances were so terribly suspicious mr gibsons conduct as a lover was simply disgraceful to him as a man and a clergyman he was full of excuses which she knew to be false he would never come near her if he could help it when he was with her he was as cold as an archbishop both in word and in action nothing would tempt him to any outward manifestation of affection he would talk of nothing but the poor women of st petercumpumpkin in the city and the fraudulent idleness of a certain colleague in the cathedral services who was always shirking his work he made her no presents he never walked with her he was always gloomyand he had indeed so behaved himself in public that people were beginning to talk of poor mr gibson and yet he could meet arabella on the sly in the lanes and send notes to her by the greengrocers boy poor mr gibson indeed let her once get him well over the 29th of april and the people of exeter might talk about poor mr gibson if they pleased and bellas conduct was more wonderful almost than that of mr gibson with all her cowardice she still held up her headheld it perhaps a little higher than was usual with her and when that grievous accusation was made against hermade and repeatedan accusation the very thought and sound of which would almost have annihilated her had there been a decent feeling in her bosom she would simply shrug her shoulders and walk away camilla she had once said you will drive that man mad before you have done what is it to you how i drive him camilla had answered in her fury then arabella had again shrugged her shoulders and walked away between camilla and her mother too there had come to be an almost internecine quarrel on a collateral point camilla was still carrying on a vast arrangement which she called the preparation of her trousseau but which both mrs french and bella regarded as a spoliation of the domestic nest for the proud purposes of one of the younger birds and this had grown so fearfully that in two different places mrs french had found herself compelled to request that no further articles might be supplied to miss camilla the bride elect had rebelled alleging that as no fortune was to be provided for her she had a right to take with her such things as she could carry away in her trunks and boxes money could be had at the bank she said and after all what were fifty pounds more or less on such an occasion as this and then she went into a calculation to prove that her mother and sister would be made so much richer by her absence and that she was doing so much for them by her marriage that nothing could be more mean in them than that they should hesitate to supply her with such things as she desired to make her entrance into mr gibsons house respectable but mrs french was obdurate and mr gibson was desired to speak to her mr gibson in fear and trembling told her that she ought to repress her spirit of extravagance and camilla at once foresaw that he would avail himself of this plea against her should he find it possible at any time to avail himself of any plea she became ferocious and turning upon him told him to mind his own business was it not all for him that she was doing it she was not she said disposed to submit to any control in such matters from him till he had assumed his legal right to it by standing with her before the altar it came however to be known all over exeter that miss camillas expenditure had been checked and that in spite of the joys naturally incidental to a wedding things were not going well with the ladies at heavitree  at last the blow came camilla was aware that on a certain morning her mother had been to mr gibsons house and had held a long conference with him she could learn nothing of what took place there for at that moment she had taken upon herself to place herself on nonspeaking terms with her mother in consequence of those disgraceful orders which had been given to the tradesmen but bella had not been at mr gibsons house at the time and camilla though she presumed that her own conduct had been discussed in a manner very injurious to herself did not believe that any step was being then arranged which would be positively antagonistic to her own views the day fixed was now so very near that there could she felt be no escape for the victim but she was wrong  mr gibson had been found by mrs french in a very excited state on that occasion he had wept and pulled his hair and torn open his waistcoat had spoken of himself as a wretchpleading however at the same time that he was more sinned against than sinning had paced about the room with his hands dashing against his brows and at last had flung himself prostrate on the ground the meaning of it all was that he had tried very hard and had found at last that he couldnt do it i am ready to submit said he to any verdict that you may pronounce against me but i should deceive you and deceive her if i didnt say at once that i cant do it he went on to explain that since he had unfortunately entered into his present engagement with camillaof whose position he spoke in quite a touching mannerand since he had found what was the condition of his own heart and feelings he had consulted a friendwho if any merely human being was capable of advising might be implicitly trusted for advice in such a matterand that his friend had told him that he was bound to give up the marriage let the consequences to himself or to others be what they might although the skies should fall on me i cannot stand at the hymeneal altar with a lie in my mouth said mr gibson immediately upon his rising from his prostrate condition on the floor in such a position as this a mothers fury would surely be very great but mrs french was hardly furious she cried and begged him to think better of it and assured him that camilla when she should be calmed down by matrimony would not be so bad as she seemedbut she was not furious the truth is mr gibson she said through her tears that after all you like bella best mr gibson owned that he did like bella best and although no bargain was made between them then and thereand such making of a bargain then and there would hardly have been practicableit was understood that mrs french would not proceed to extremities if mr gibson would still make himself forthcoming as a husband for the advantage of one of the daughters of the family  so far mr gibson had progressed towards a partial liberation from his thraldom with a considerable amount of courage but he was well aware that the great act of daring still remained to be done he had suggested to mrs french that she should settle the matter with camillabut this mrs french had altogether declined to do it must she said come from himself if she were to do it she must sympathise with her child and such sympathy would be obstructive of the future arrangements which were still to be made she always knew that i liked bella best said mr gibsonstill sobbing still tearing his hair still pacing the room with his waistcoat torn open i would not advise you to tell her that said mrs french then mrs french went home and early on the following morning it was thought good by arabella that she also should pay a visit at ottery st marys goodbye cammy said arabella as she went bella said camilla i wonder whether you are a serpent i do not think you can be so base a serpent as that i declare cammy you do say such odd things that no one can understand what you mean and so she went  on that morning mr gibson was walking at an early hour along the road from exeter to cowley contemplating his position and striving to arrange his plans what was he to do and how was he to do it he was prepared to throw up his living to abandon the cathedral to leave the dioceseto make any sacrifice rather than take camilla to his bosom within the last six weeks he had learned to regard her with almost a holy horror he could not understand by what miracle of selfneglect he had fallen into so perilous an abyss he had long known camillas temper but in those days in which he had been beaten like a shuttlecock between the stanburys and the frenches he had lost his head and had donehe knew not what those whom the god chooses to destroy he first maddens said mr gibson to himself of himself throwing himself back upon early erudition and pagan philosophy then he looked across to the river exe and thought that there was hardly water enough there to cover the multiplicity of his sorrows  but something must be done he had proceeded so far in forming a resolution as he reached st davids church on his return homewards his sagacious friend had told him that as soon as he had altered his mind he was bound to let the lady know of it without delay you must remember said the sagacious friend that you will owe her muchvery much mr gibson was perplexed in his mind when he reflected how much he might possibly be made to owe her if she should decide on appealing to a jury of her countrymen for justice but anything would be better than his home at st peterscumpumpkin with camilla sitting opposite to him as his wife were there not distant lands in which a clergyman unfortunate but still energetic might find work to do was there not all americaand were there not australia new zealand natal all open to him would not a missionary career among the chinese be better for him than st peterscumpumpkin with camilla french for his wife by the time he had reached home his mind was made up he would write a letter to camilla at once and he would marry arabella at onceon any day that might be fixedon condition that camilla would submit to her defeat without legal redress if legal redress should be demanded he would put in evidence the fact that her own mother had been compelled to caution the tradesmen of the city in regard to her extravagance  he did write his letterin an agony of spirit i sit down camilla with a sad heart and a reluctant hand he said      to communicate to you a fatal truth but truth should be    made to prevail and there is nothing in man so cowardly    so detrimental and so unmanly as its concealment i have    looked into myself and have inquired of myself and have    assured myself that were i to become your husband i    should not make you happy it would be of no use for me    now to dilate on the reasons which have convinced mebut    i am convinced and i consider it my duty to inform you so    at once i have been closeted with your mother and have    made her understand that it is so     i have not a word to say in my own justification but    thisthat i am sure i am acting honestly in telling you    the truth i would not wish to say a word animadverting    on yourself if there must be blame in this matter i am    willing to take it all on my own shoulders but things    have been done of late and words have been spoken and    habits have displayed themselves which would not i am    sure conduce to our mutual comfort in this world or to    our assistance to each other in our struggles to reach the    happiness of the world to come     i think that you will agree with me camilla that when    a man or a woman has fallen into such a mistake as    that which i have now made it is best that it should    be acknowledged i know well that such a change of    arrangements as that which i now propose will be regarded    most unfavourably but will not anything be better than    the binding of a matrimonial knot which cannot be again    unloosed and which we should both regret     i do not know that i need add anything further what can    i add further only thisthat i am inflexible having    resolved to take this stepand to bear the evil things    that may be said of mefor your happiness and for my own    tranquilityi shall not now relinquish my resolution i    do not ask you to forgive me i doubt much whether i shall    ever be quite able to forgive myself the mistake which    i have made is one which should not have been committed    i do not ask you to forgive me but i do ask you to pray    that i may be forgiven     yours with feelings of the truest friendship     thomas gibson   the letter had been very difficult but he was rather proud of it than otherwise when it was completed he had felt that he was writing a letter which not improbably might become public property it was necessary that he should be firm that he should accuse himself a little in order that he might excuse himself much and that he should hint at causes which might justify the rupture though he should so veil them as not to appear to defend his own delinquency by ungenerous counteraccusation when he had completed the letter he thought that he had done all this rather well and he sent the despatch off to heavitree by the clerk of st peters church with something of that feeling of expressible relief which attends the final conquest over some fatal and all but insuperable misfortune he thought that he was sure now that he would not have to marry camilla on the 29th of the monthand there would probably be a period of some hours before he would be called upon to hear or read camillas reply  camilla was alone when she received the letter but she rushed at once to her mother there said she therei knew that it was coming mrs french took the paper into her hands and gasped and gazed at her daughter without speaking you knew of it mother  yesterdaywhen he told me i knew of it  and bella knows it  not a word of it  she does i am sure she does but it is all nothing i will not accept it he cannot treat me so i will drag him therebut he shall come  you cant make him my dear  i will make him and you would help me mamma if you had any spirit whata fortnight before the time when the things are all bought look at the presents that have been sent mamma he doesnt know me and he never would have done it if it had not been for bellanever she had better take care or there shall be such a tragedy that nobody ever heard the like if she thinks that she is going to be that mans wifeshe ismistaken then there was a pause for a moment mamma she said i shall go to him at once i do not care in the least what anybody may say i shallgo to himat once mrs french felt that at this moment it was best that she should be silent     chapter lxxv  the rowleys go over the alps      illustration  by the thirteenth of may the rowley family had established itself in florence purposing to remain either there or at the baths of lucca till the end of june at which time it was thought that sir marmaduke should begin to make preparations for his journey back to the islands their future prospects were not altogether settled it was not decided whether lady rowley should at once return with him whether mrs trevelyan should return with himnor was it settled among them what should be the fate of nora rowley nora rowley was quite resolved herself that she would not go back to the islands and had said as much to her mother lady rowley had not repeated this to sir marmaduke and was herself in doubt as to what might best be done girls are understood by their mothers better than they are by their fathers lady rowley was beginning to be aware that noras obstinacy was too strong to be overcome by mere words and that other steps must be taken if she were to be weaned from her pernicious passion for hugh stanbury mr glascock was still in florence might she not be cured by further overtures from mr glascock the chance of securing such a soninlaw was so important so valuable that no trouble was too great to be incurred even though the probability of success might not be great  it must not however be supposed that lady rowley carried off all the family to italy including sir marmaduke simply in chase of mr glascock anxious as she was on the subject she was too proud and also too wellconditioned to have suggested to herself such a journey with such an object trevelyan had escaped from willesden with the child and they had heardagain through stanburythat he had returned to italy they had all agreed that it would be well that they should leave london for awhile and see something of the continent and when it was told to them that little louis was probably in florence that alone was reason enough for them to go thither they would go to the city till the heat was too great and the mosquitoes too powerful and then they would visit the baths of lucca for a month this was their plan of action and the cause for their plan but lady rowley found herself able to weave into it another little plan of her own of which she said nothing to anybody she was not running after mr glascock but if mr glascock should choose to run after themor her who could say that any harm had been done  nora had answered that proposition of her lovers to walk out of the house in manchester street and get married at the next church in a most discreet manner she had declared that she would be true and firm but that she did not wish to draw upon herself the displeasure of her father and mother she did not she said look upon a clandestine marriage as a happy resource butthis she added at the end of a long and very sensible lettershe intended to abide by her engagement and she did not intend to go back to the mandarins she did not say what alternative she would choose in the event of her being unable to obtain her fathers consent before his return she did not suggest what was to become of her when sir marmadukes leave of absence should be expired but her statement that she would not go back to the islands was certainly made with more substantial vigour though perhaps with less of reasoning than any other of the propositions made in her letter then in her postscript she told him that they were all going to italy papa and mamma think that we ought to follow poor mr trevelyan the lawyer says that nothing can be done while he is away with the boy we are therefore all going to start to florence the journey is delightful i will not say whose presence will be wanting to make it perfect  before they started there came a letter to nora from dorothy which shall be given entire because it will tell the reader more of dorothys happiness than would be learned from any other mode of narrative      the close thursday     dearest nora     i have just had a letter from hugh and that makes me feel    that i should like to write to you dear hugh has told me    all about it and i do so hope that things may come right    and that we may be sisters he is so good that i do not    wonder that you should love him he has been the best son    and the best brother in the world and everybody speaks    well of himexcept my dear aunt who is prejudiced    because she does not like newspapers i need not praise    him to you for i dare say you think quite as well of him    as i do i cannot tell you all the beautiful things he    says about you but i dare say he has told them to you    himself     i seem to know you so well because priscilla has talked    about you so often she says that she knew that you and    my brother were fond of each other because you growled at    each other when you were together at the clock house and    never had any civil words to say before people i dont    know whether growling is a sign of love but hugh does    growl sometimes when he is most affectionate he growls at    me and i understand him and i like to be growled at i    wonder whether you like him to growl at you     and now i must tell you something about myselfbecause    if you are to be my sister you ought to know it all i    also am going to be married to a man whom i loveoh so    dearly his name is mr brooke burgess and he is a great    friend of my aunts at first she did not like our being    engaged because of some family reasonbut she has got    over that and nothing can be kinder and nicer than she    is we are to be married here some day in junethe 11th    i think it will be how i do wish you could have been here    to be my bridesmaid it would have been so nice to have    had hughs sweetheart with me he is a friend of hughs    and no doubt you will hear all about him the worst of it    is that we must live in london because my husband as will    beyou see i call him mine alreadyis in an office    there and so poor aunt stanbury will be left all alone    it will be very sad and she is so wedded to exeter that i    fear we shall not get her up to london     i would describe mr burgess to you only i do not suppose    you would care to hear about him he is not so tall as    hugh but he is a great deal better looking with you two    the good looks are to be with the wife but with us with    the husband perhaps you think hugh is handsome we used    to declare that he was the ugliest boy in the country    i dont suppose it makes very much difference brooke is    handsome but i dont think i should like him the less if    he were ever so ugly     do you remember hearing about the miss frenches when you    were in devonshire there has come up such a terrible    affair about them a mr gibson a clergyman was going to    marry the younger but has changed his mind and wants to    take the elder i think he was in love with her first   dorothy did not say a word about the little intermediate stage of attachment to herself      all this is making a great noise in the city and some    people think he should be punished severely it seems to    me that a gentleman ought not to make such a mistake but    if he does he ought to own it i hope they will let him    marry the elder one aunt stanbury says it all comes from    their wearing chignons i wish you knew aunt stanbury    because she is so good perhaps you wear a chignon i    think priscilla said that you did it must not be large    if you come to see aunt stanbury     pray write to meand believe that i hope to be your most    affectionate sister     dorothy stanbury     psi am so happy and i do so hope that you will be the    same   this was received only a day before the departure of the rowleys for italy and was answered by a short note promising that nora would write to her correspondent from florence  there could be no doubt that trevelyan had started with his boy fearing the result of the medical or legal interference with his affairs which was about to be made at sir marmadukes instance he had written a few words to his wife neither commencing nor ending his note after any usual fashion telling her that he thought it expedient to travel that he had secured the services of a nurse for the little boy and that during his absence a certain income would as heretofore be paid to her he said nothing as to his probable return or as to her future life nor was there anything to indicate whither he was going stanbury however had learned from the faithless and frightened bozzle that trevelyans letters were to be sent after him to florence mr bozzle in giving this information had acknowledged that his employer was becoming no longer quite himself under his troubles and had expressed his opinion that he ought to be looked after bozzle had made his money and now with a grain of humanity mixed with many grains of faithlessness reconciled it to himself to tell his masters secrets to his masters enemies what would a counsel be able to say about his conduct in a court of law that was the question which bozzle was always asking himself as to his own business that he should be abused by a barrister to a jury and exposed as a spy and a fiend was he thought a matter of course to be so abused was a part of his profession but it was expedient for him in all cases to secure some loophole of apparent duty by which he might in part escape from such censures he was untrue to his employer now because he thought that his employer ought to be looked after he did no doubt take a fivepound note from hugh stanbury but then it was necessary that he should live he must be paid for his time in this way trevelyan started for florence and within a week afterwards the rowleys were upon his track  nothing had been said by sir marmaduke to nora as to her lover since that stormy interview in which both father and daughter had expressed their opinions very strongly and very little had been said by lady rowley lady rowley had spoken more than once of noras return to the mandarins and had once alluded to it as a certainty but i do not know that i shall go back nora had said my dear the mother had replied unless you are married i suppose your home must be with your parents nora having made her protest did not think it necessary to persevere and so the matter was dropped it was known however that they must all come back to london before they started for their seat of government and therefore the subject did not at present assume its difficult aspect there was a tacit understanding among them that everything should be done to make the journey pleasant to the young mother who was in search of her son and in addition to this lady rowley had her own little understanding which was very tacit indeed that in mr glascock might be found an escape from one of their great family difficulties  you had better take this papa mrs trevelyan had said when she received from the office of mr bideawhile a cheque payable to her order for the money sent to her by her husbands direction  i do not want the mans money said sir marmaduke  but you are going to this place for my sake papaand it is right that he should bear the expense for his own wife and papa you must remember always that though his mind is distracted on this horrible business he is not a bad man no one is more liberal or more just about money sir marmadukes feelings on the matter were very much the same as those which had troubled mr outhouse and he personally refused to touch the money but his daughter paid her own share of the expenses of the journey  they travelled at their ease stopping at paris and at geneva and at milan lady rowley thought that she was taken very fast because she was allowed to sleep only two nights at each of these places and sir rowley himself thought that he had achieved something of a hannibalian enterprise in taking five ladies and two maids over the simplon and down into the plains of lombardy with nobody to protect him but a single courier he had been a little nervous about it being unaccustomed to european travelling and had not at first realised the fact that the journey is to be made with less trouble than one from the marble arch to mile end my dears he said to his younger daughters as they were rattling round the steep downward twists and turns of the great road you must sit quite still on these descents or you do not know where you may go the least thing would overset us but lucy and sophy soon knew better and became so intimate with the mountain under the friendly guidance of their courier that before the plains were reached they were in and out and here and there and up and down as though they had been bred among the valleys of the pass there would come a ringing laugh from some rock above their head and lady rowley looking up would see their dresses fluttering on a pinnacle which appeared to her to be fit only for a bird and there would be the courier behind them with two parasols and a shawl and a cloak and an eyeglass and a fine pair of grizzled whiskers they made an alpine club of their own refusing to admit their father because he would not climb up a rock and nora thought of the letters about it which she would write to her loveronly that she had determined that she would not write to him at all without telling her motherand mrs trevelyan would for moments almost forget that she had been robbed of her child  from milan they went on to florence and though they were by that time quite at home in italy and had become critical judges of italian inns and italian railways they did not find that journey to be quite so pleasant there is a romance to us still in the name of italy which a near view of many details in the country fails to realise shall we say that a journey through lombardy is about as interesting as one through the flats of cambridgeshire and the fens of norfolk and the station of bologna is not an interesting spot in which to spend an hour or two although it may be conceded that provisions may be had there much better than any that can be procured at our own railway stations from thence they went still by rail over the apennines and unfortunately slept during the whole time the courier had assured them that if they would only look out they would see the castles of which they had read in novels but the day had been very hot and sir marmaduke had been cross and lady rowley had been weary and so not a castle was seen pistoia me lady this said the courier opening the doorto stop half an hour oh why was it not florence another hour and a half so they all went to sleep again and were very tired when they reached the beautiful city  during the next day they rested at their inn and sauntered through the duomo and broke their necks looking up at the inimitable glories of the campanile such a one as sir marmaduke had of course not come to florence without introductions the foreign office is always very civil to its nextdoor neighbour of the coloniescivil and cordial though perhaps a little patronising a minister is a bigger man than a governor and the smallest of the diplomatic fry are greater swells than even secretaries in quite important dependencies the attaché though he be unpaid dwells in a capital and flirts with a countess the governors righthand man is confined to an island and dances with a planters daughter the distinction is quite understood but is not incompatible with much excellent good feeling on the part of the superior department sir marmaduke had come to florence fairly provided with passports to florentine society and had been mentioned in more than one letter as the distinguished governor of the mandarins who had been called home from his seat of government on a special mission of great importance on the second day he went out to call at the embassy and to leave his cards have you been able to learn whether he is here asked lady rowley of her husband in a whisper as soon as they were alone  whotrevelyan  i did not suppose you could learn about him because he would be hiding himself but is mr glascock here  i forgot to ask said sir marmaduke  lady rowley did not reproach him it is impossible that any father should altogether share a mothers anxiety in regard to the marriage of their daughters but what a thing it would be lady rowley thought that she could compound for all misfortunes in other respects if she could have a daughter married to the future lord peterborough she had been told in england that he was faultlessnot very clever not very active not likely to be very famous but as a husband simply faultless he was very rich very goodnatured easily managed more likely to be proud of his wife than of himself addicted to no jealousies afflicted by no vices so respectable in every way that he was sure to become great as an english nobleman by the very weight of his virtues and it had been represented also to lady rowley that this paragon among men had been passionately attached to her daughter perhaps she magnified a little the romance of the story but it seemed to her that this greatly endowed lover had rushed away from his country in despair because her daughter nora would not smile upon him now they were as she hoped in the same city with him but it was indispensable to her success that she should not seem to be running after him to nora not a word had been said of the prospect of meeting mr glascock at florence hardly more than a word had been said to her sister emily and that under injunction of strictest secrecy it must be made to appear to all the world that other motives had brought them to florenceas indeed other motives had brought them not for worlds would lady rowley have run after a man for her daughter but still stillstill seeing that the man was himself so unutterably in love with her girl seeing that he was so fully justified by his position to be in love with any girl seeing that such a maximum of happiness would be the result of such a marriage she did feel that even for his sake she must be doing a good thing to bring them together something though not much of all this she had been obliged to explain to sir marmadukeand yet he had not taken the trouble to inquire whether mr glascock was in florence  on the third day after their arrival the wife of the british minister came to call upon lady rowley and the wife of the british minister was goodnatured easymannered and very much given to conversation she preferred talking to listening and in the course of a quarter of an hour had told lady rowley a good deal about florence but she had not mentioned mr glascocks name it would have been so pleasant if the requisite information could have been obtained without the asking of any direct question on the subject but lady rowley who from many years practice of similar though perhaps less distinguished courtesies on her part knew well the first symptom of the coming end of her guests visit found that the ministers wife was about to take her departure without an allusion to mr glascock and yet the names had been mentioned of so many english residents in florence who neither in wealth rank or virtue were competent to hold a candle to that phoenix she was forced therefore to pluck up courage and to ask the question have you had a mr glascock here this spring said lady rowley  whatlord peterboroughs son oh dear yes such a singular being  lady rowley thought that she could perceive that her phoenix had not made himself agreeable at the embassy it might perhaps be that he had buried himself away from society because of his love and is here now asked lady rowley  i cannot say at all he is sometimes here and sometimes with his father at naples but when here he lives chiefly with the americans they say he is going to marry an american girltheir ministers niece there are three of them i think and he is to take the eldest lady rowley asked no more questions and let her august visitor go almost without another word     chapter lxxvi  we shall be so poor   mr glascock at that moment was not only in florence but was occupying rooms in the very hotel in which the rowleys were staying lady rowley when she heard that he was engaged to marry an american lady became suddenly very sick at heartsick with a sickness that almost went beyond her heart she felt ill and was glad to be alone the rumour might be untrue such rumours generally are untrue but then as lady rowley knew very well they generally have some foundation in truth mr glascock if he were not actually engaged to the american girl had probably been flirting with herand if so where was that picture which lady rowley had been painting for herself of a lovelorn swain to be brought back to the pleasures and occupations of the world only by the girl of whom he was enamoured but still she would not quite give up the project mr glascock if he was in italy would no doubt see by the newspapers that sir marmaduke and his family were in florenceand would probably come to them then if nora would only behave herself the american girl might still be conquered  during two or three days after this nothing was seen or heard of mr glascock had lady rowley thought of mentioning the name to the waiter at the hotel she would have learned that he was living in the next passage but it did not occur to her to seek information in that fashion nor did she ask direct questions in other quarters about mr glascock himself she did however make inquiry about americans living in florenceespecially about the american ministerand before a week had passed overhead had been introduced to the spaldings mrs spalding was very civil and invited lady rowley and all the girls and sir marmaduke to come to her on her fridays she received her friends every friday and would continue to do so till the middle of june she had nieces who would she said be so happy to make the acquaintance of the miss rowleys  by this time the picture galleries the churches and the palaces in florence had nearly all been visited poor lady rowley had dragged herself wearily from sight to sight hoping always to meet with mr glascock ignorant of the fact that residents in a town do not pass their mornings habitually in looking after pictures during this time inquiries were being made through the police respecting trevelyan and sir marmaduke had obtained information that an english gentleman with a little boy had gone on to siena and had located himself there there seemed to be but little doubt that this was trevelyanthough nothing had been learned with certainty as to the gentlemans name it had been decided that sir marmaduke with his courier and mrs trevelyan should go on to siena and endeavour to come upon the fugitive and they had taken their departure on a certain morning on that same day lady rowley was walking with nora and one of the other girls through the hall of the hotel when they were met in full faceby mr glascock lady rowley and lucy were in front and they of course did not know the man nora had seen him at once and in her confusion hardly knew how to bear herself mr glascock was passing by her without recognising herhad passed her mother and sister and had so far gone on that nora had determined to make no sign when he chanced to look up and see who it was that was so close to him miss rowley he said who thought of meeting you in florence lady rowley of course turned round and there was an introduction poor nora though she knew nothing of her mothers schemes was confused and ill at ease mr glascock was very civil but at the same time rather cold lady rowley was all smiles and courtesy she had she said heard his name from her daughters and was very happy to make his acquaintance lucy looked on somewhat astonished to find that the lover whom her sister had been blamed for rejecting and who was spoken of with so many encomiums was so old a man mr glascock asked after mrs trevelyan and lady rowley in a low melancholy whisper told him that they were now all in florence in the hope of meeting mr trevelyan you have heard the sad story i know mr glascockand therefore i do not mind telling you mr glascock acknowledged that he did know the story and informed her that he had seen mr trevelyan in florence within the last ten days this was so interesting that at lady rowleys request he went with them up to their rooms and in this way the acquaintance was made it turned out that mr glascock had spoken to mr trevelyan and that trevelyan had told him that he meant for the present to take up his residence in some small italian town and how was he looking mr glascock  very ill lady rowleyvery ill indeed  do not tell her so mr glascock she has gone now with her father to siena we think that he is there with the boyor at least that he may be heard of there and youyou are living here mr glascock said that he was living between naples and florencegoing occasionally to naples a place that he hated to see his father and coming back at intervals to the capital nora sat by and hardly spoke a word she was nicely dressed with an exquisite little bonnet which had been bought as they came through paris and lady rowley with natural pride felt that if he was ever in love with her child that love must come back upon him now american girls she had been told were hard and dry and sharp and angular she had seen some at the mandarins with whom she thought it must be impossible that any englishman should be in love there never surely had been an american girl like her nora are you fond of pictures mr glascock she asked mr glascock was not very fond of pictures and thought that he was rather tired of them what was he fond of of sitting at home and doing nothing that was his reply at least and a very unsatisfactory reply it was as lady rowley could hardly propose that they should come and sit and do nothing with him could he have been lured into churches or galleries nora might have been once more thrown into his company then lady rowley took courage and asked him whether he knew the spaldings they were going to mrs spaldings that very eveningshe and her daughters mr glascock replied that he did know the spaldings and that he also should be at their house lady rowley thought that she discovered something like a blush about his cheekbones and brow as he made his answer then he left them giving his hand to nora as he wentbut there was nothing in his manner to justify the slightest hope  i dont think he is nice at all said lucy  dont be so foolish lucy said lady rowley angrily  i think he is very nice said nora he was only talking nonsense when he said that he liked to sit still and do nothing he is not at all an idle manat least i am told so  but he is as old as methuselah said lucy  he is between thirty and forty said lady rowley of course we know that from the peerage lady rowley however was wrong had she consulted the peerage she would have seen that mr glascock was over forty  nora as soon as she was alone and could think about it all felt quite sure that mr glascock would never make her another offer this ought not to have caused her any sorrow as she was very well aware that she would not accept him should he do so yet perhaps there was a moment of some feeling akin to disappointment of course she would not have accepted him how could she her faith was so plighted to hugh stanbury that she would be a byword among women for ever were she to be so false and as she told herself she had not the slightest feeling of affection for mr glascock it was quite out of the question and a matter simply for speculation nevertheless it would have been a very grand thing to be lady peterborough and she almost regretted that she had a heart in her bosom  she had become fully aware during that interview that her mother still entertained hopes and almost suspected that lady rowley had known something of mr glascocks residence in florence she had seen that her mother had met mr glascock almost as though some such meeting had been expected and had spoken to him almost as though she had expected to have to speak to him would it not be better that she should at once make her mother understand that all this could be of no avail if she were to declare plainly that nothing could bring about such a marriage would not her mother desist she almost made up her mind to do so but as her mother said nothing to her before they started for mr spaldings house neither did she say anything to her mother she did not wish to have angry words if they could be avoided and she felt that there might be anger and unpleasant words were she to insist upon her devotion to hugh stanbury while this rich prize was in sight if her mother should speak to her then indeed she would declare her own settled purpose but she would do nothing to accelerate the evil hour  there were but few people in mrs spaldings drawingroom when they were announced and mr glascock was not among them miss wallachia petrie was there and in the confusion of the introduction was presumed by lady rowley to be one of the nieces introduced she had been distinctly told that mr glascock was to marry the eldest and this lady was certainly older than the other two in this way lady rowley decided that miss wallachia petrie was her daughters hated rival and she certainly was much surprised at the gentlemans taste but there is nothingnothing in the way of an absurd matrimonial engagementinto which a man will not allow himself to be entrapped by pique nora would have a great deal to answer for lady rowley thought if the unfortunate man should be driven by her cruelty to marry such a woman as this one now before her  it happened that lady rowley soon found herself seated by miss petrie and she at once commenced her questionings she intended to be very discreet but the subject was too near her heart to allow her to be altogether silent i believe you know mr glascock she said  yes said wallachia i do know him now the peculiar nasal twang which our cousins over the water have learned to use and which has grown out of a certain national instinct which coerces them to express themselves with selfassertionlet the reader go into his closet and talk through his nose for awhile with steady attention to the effect which his own voice will have and he will find that this theory is correctthis intonation which is so peculiar among intelligent americans had been adopted con amore and as it were taken to her bosom by miss petrie her ears had taught themselves to feel that there could be no vitality in speech without it and that all utterance unsustained by such tone was effeminate vapid useless unpersuasive unmusicaland english it was a complaint frequently made by her against her friends caroline and olivia that they debased their voices and taught themselves the puling british mode of speech i do know the gentleman said wallachiaand lady rowley shuddered could it be that such a woman as this was to reign over monkhams and become the future lady peterborough  he told me that he is acquainted with the family said lady rowley he is staying at our hotel and my daughter knew him very well when he was living in london  i dare say i believe that in london the titled aristocrats do hang pretty much together it had never occurred to poor lady rowley since the day in which her husband had been made a knight at the advice of the colonial minister in order that the inhabitants of some island might be gratified by the opportunity of using the title that she and her children had thereby become aristocrats were her daughter nora to marry mr glascock nora would become an aristocrator would rather be ennobledall which lady rowley understood perfectly  i dont know that london society is very exclusive in that respect said lady rowley  i guess you are pretty particular said miss petrie and it seems to me you dont have much regard to intellect or eruditionbut fix things up straight according to birth and money  i hope we are not quite so bad as that said lady rowley i do not know london well myself as i have passed my life in very distant places  the distant places are in my estimation the best the further the mind is removed from the contamination incidental to the centres of longestablished luxury the more chance it has of developing itself according to the intention of the creator when he bestowed his gifts of intellect upon us lady rowley when she heard this eloquence could hardly believe that such a man as mr glascock should really be intent upon marrying such a lady as this who was sitting next to her  in the meantime nora and the real rival were together and they also were talking of mr glascock caroline spalding had said that mr glascock had spoken to her of nora rowley and nora acknowledged that there had been some acquaintance between them in london almost more than that i should have thought said miss spalding if one might judge by his manner of speaking of you      illustration the rivals   he is a little given to be enthusiastic said nora laughing  the least so of all mankind i should have said you must know he is very intimate in this house it begun in this wayolivia and i were travelling together and there wasa difficulty as we say in our country when three or four gentlemen shoot each other then there came up mr glascock and another gentleman bythebye the other gentleman was your brotherinlaw  poor mr trevelyan  he is very illis he not  we think so my sister is with us you know that is to say she is at siena today  i have heard about him and it is so sad mr glascock knows him as i said they were travelling together when mr glascock came to our assistance since that we have seen him very frequently i dont think he is enthusiasticexcept when he talks of you  i ought to be very proud said nora  i think you oughtas mr glascock is a man whose good opinion is certainly worth having here he is mr glascock i hope your ears are tingling they ought to do so because we are saying all manner of fine things about you  i could not be well spoken of by two on whose good word i should set a higher value said he  and whose do you value the most said caroline  i must first know whose eulogium will run the highest  then nora answered him mr glascock other people may praise you louder than i can do but no one will ever do so with more sincerity there was a pretty earnestness about her as she spoke which lady rowley ought to have heard mr glascock bowed and miss spalding smiled and nora blushed  if you are not overwhelmed now said miss spalding you must be so used to flattery that it has no longer any effect upon you you must be like a drunkard to whom wine is as water and who thinks that brandy is not strong enough  i think i had better go away said mr glascock for fear the brandy should be watered by degrees and so he left them  nora had become quite aware without much process of thinking about it that her former lover and this american young lady were very intimate with each other the tone of the conversation had shewn that it was soand then how had it come to pass that mr glascock had spoken to this american girl about hernora rowley it was evident that he had spoken of her with warmth and had done so in a manner to impress his hearer for a minute or two they sat together in silence after mr glascock had left them but neither of them stirred then caroline spalding turned suddenly upon nora and took her by the hand i must tell you something said she only it must be a secret for awhile  i will not repeat it  thank you dear i am engaged to himas his wife he asked me this very afternoon and nobody knows it but my aunt when i had accepted him he told me all the story about you he had very often spoken of you before and i had guessed how it must have been he wears his heart so open for those whom he loves that there is nothing concealed he had seen you just before he came to me but perhaps i am wrong to tell you that now he ought to have been thinking of you again at such a time  i did not want him to think of me again  of course you did not of course i am joking you might have been his wife if you wished it he has told me all that and he especially wants us to be friends is there anything to prevent it  on my part oh dear noexcept that you will be such grand folk and we shall be so poor  we said caroline laughing i am so glad that there is a we     chapter lxxvii  the future lady peterborough   if you have not sold yourself for british gold and for british acres and for british rank i have nothing to say against it said miss wallachia petrie that same evening to her friend caroline spalding  you know that i have not sold myself as you call it said caroline there had been a long friendship between these two ladies and the younger one knew that it behoved her to bear a good deal from the elder miss petrie was honest clever and in earnest we in england are not usually favourably disposed to women who take a pride in a certain antagonism to men in general and who are anxious to shew the world that they can get on very well without male assistance but there are many such in america who have noble aspirations good intellects much energy and who are by no means unworthy of friendship the hope in regard to all such womenthe hope entertained not by themselves but by those who are solicitous for themis that they will be cured at last by a husband and halfadozen children in regard to wallachia petrie there was not perhaps much ground for such hope she was so positively wedded to womens rights in general and to her own rights in particular that it was improbable that she should ever succumb to any manand where would be the man brave enough to make the effort from circumstances caroline spalding had been the beloved of her heart since caroline spalding was a very little girl and she had hoped that caroline would through life have borne arms along with her in that contest which she was determined to wage against man and which she always waged with the greatest animosity against men of the british race she hated rank she hated riches she hated monarchyand with a true womans instinct in battle felt that she had a specially strong point against englishmen in that they submitted themselves to dominion from a woman monarch and now the chosen friend of her youththe friend who had copied out all her poetry who had learned by heart all her sonnets who had as she thought reciprocated all her ideas was going to be marriedand to be married to an english lord she had seen that it was coming for some time and had spoken out very plainly hoping that she might still save the brand from the burning now the evil was done and caroline spalding when she told her news knew well that she would have to bear some heavy reproaches  how many of us are there who never know whether we sell ourselves or not said wallachia the senator who longs for office and who votes this way instead of that in order that he may get it thinks that he is voting honestly the minister who calls himself a teacher of gods word thinks that it is gods word that he preaches when he strains his lungs to fill his church the question is this carolinewould you have loved the same man had he come to you with a woodmans axe in his hand or a clerks quill behind his ear i guess not  as to the woodmans axe wally it is very well in theory but  things good in theory caroline will be good also when practised you may be sure of that we dislike theory simply because our intelligences are higher than our wills but we will let that pass  pray let it pass wally do not preach me sermons tonight i am so happy and you ought to wish me joy  if wishing you joy would get you joy i would wish it you while i lived i cannot be happy that you should be taken from us whither i shall never see you again  but you are to come to us i have told him so and it is settled  no dear i shall not do that what should i be in the glittering halls of an english baron could there be any visiting less fitting any admixture less appropriate could i who have held up my voice in the music hall of lacedæmon amidst the glories of the west in the great and free state of illinois against the corruption of an english aristocracycould i who have been listened to by two thousand of my countrywomenand menwhile i spurned the unmanly inhuman errors of primogeniturecould i think you hold my tongue beneath the roof of a feudal lord caroline spalding knew that her friend could not hold her tongue and hesitated to answer there had been that fatal triumph of a lecture on the joint rights of men and women and it had rendered poor wallachia petrie unfit for ordinary society  you might come there without talking politics wally said caroline  no caroline no i will go into the house of no man in which the free expression of my opinion is debarred me i will not sit even at your table with a muzzled tongue when you are gone caroline i shall devote myself to what after all must be the work of my life and i shall finish the biographical history of our great hero in versewhich i hope may at least be not ephemeral from month to month i shall send you what i do and you will not refuse me your friendly criticismand perhaps some slight meed of approbationbecause you are dwelling beneath the shade of a throne oh caroline let it not be a upas tree  the miss petries of the world have this advantagean advantage which rarely if ever falls to the lot of a manthat they are never convinced of error men let them be ever so much devoted to their closets let them keep their work ever so closely veiled from public scrutiny still find themselves subjected to criticism and under the necessity of either defending themselves or of succumbing if indeed a man neither speaks nor writesif he be dumb as regards opinionhe passes simply as one of the crowd and is in the way neither of convincing nor of being convinced but a woman may speak and almost write as she likes without danger of being wounded by sustained conflict who would have the courage to begin with such a one as miss petrie and endeavour to prove to her that she is wrong from the beginning a little word of halfdissent a smile a shrug and an ambiguous compliment which is misunderstood are all the forms of argument which can be used against her wallachia petrie in her heart of hearts conceived that she had fairly discussed her great projects from year to year with indomitable eloquence and unanswerable truthand that none of her opponents had had a leg to stand upon and this she believed because the chivalry of men had given to her sex that protection against which her life was one continued protest  here he is said caroline as mr glascock came up to them try and say a civil word to him if he speaks about it though he is to be a lord still he is a man and a brother  caroline said the stern monitress you are already learning to laugh at principles which have been dear to you since you left your mothers breast alas how true it is you cannot touch pitch and not be defiled  the further progress of these friendly and feminine amenities was stopped by the presence of the gentleman who had occasioned them miss petrie said the hero of the hour caroline was to tell you of my good fortune and no doubt she has done so  i cannot wait to hear the pretty things he has to say said caroline and i must look after my aunts guests there is poor signor buonarosci without a soul to say a syllable to him and i must go and use my ten italian words  you are about to take with you to your old country mr glascock said miss petrie one of the brightest stars in our young american firmament there could be no doubt from the tone of miss petries voice that she now regarded this star however bright as one of a sort which is subjected to falling  i am going to take a very nice young woman said mr glascock  i hate that word woman sir uttered with the halfhidden sneer which always accompanies its expression from the mouth of a man  sneer miss petrie  i quite allow that it is involuntary and not analysed or understood by yourselves if you speak of a dog you intend to do so with affection but there is always contempt mixed with it the socalled chivalry of man to woman is all begotten in the same spirit i want no favour but i claim to be your equal  i thought that american ladies were generally somewhat exacting as to those privileges which chivalry gives them  it is true sir that the only rank we know in our country is in that precedence which man gives to woman whether we maintain that or whether we abandon it we do not intend to purchase it at the price of an acknowledgment of intellectual inferiority for myself i hate chivalrywhat you call chivalry i can carry my own chair and i claim the right to carry it whithersoever i may please  mr glascock remained with her for some time but made no opportunity for giving that invitation to monkhams of which caroline had spoken as he said afterwards he found it impossible to expect her to attend to any subject so trivial and when afterwards caroline told him with some slight mirththe capability of which on such a subject was coming to her with her new ideas of lifethat though he was partly saved as a man and a brother still he was partly the reverse as a feudal lord he began to reflect that wallachia petrie would be a guest with whom he would find it very difficult to make things go pleasant at monkhams does she not bully you horribly he asked  of course she bullies me caroline answered and i cannot expect you to understand as yet how it is that i love her and like her but i do if i were in distress tomorrow she would give everything she has in the world to put me right  so would i said he  ah youthat is a matter of course that is your business now and she would give everything she has in the world to set the world right would you do that  it would depend on the amount of my faith if i could believe in the result i suppose i should do it  she would do it on the slightest hope that such giving would have any tendency that way her philanthropy is all real of course she is a bore to you  i am very patient  i hope i shall find you soalways and of course she is ridiculousin your eyes i have learned to see it and to regret it but i shall never cease to love her  i have not the slightest objection her lessons will come from over the water and mine will come fromwhere shall i sayover the table if i cant talk her down with so much advantage on my side i ought to be made a womansright man myself  poor lady rowley had watched miss petrie and mr glascock during those moments that they had been together and had half believed the rumour and had half doubted thinking in the moments of her belief that mr glascock must be mad and in the moments of unbelief that the rumours had been set afloat by the english ministers wife with the express intention of turning mr glascock into ridicule it had never occurred to her to doubt that wallachia was the eldest of that family of nieces could it be possible that a man who had known her nora who had undoubtedly loved her norawho had travelled all the way from london to nuncombe putney to ask nora to be his wifeshould within twelve months of that time have resolved to marry a woman whom he must have selected simply as being the most opposite to nora of any female human being that he could find it was not credible to her and if it were not true there might still be a hope nora had met him and had spoken to him and it had seemed that for a moment or two they had spoken as friends lady rowley when talking to mrs spalding had watched them closely and she had seen that noras eyes had been bright and that there had been something between them which was pleasant suddenly she found herself close to wallachia and thought that she would trust herself to a word  have you been long in florence asked lady rowley in her softest voice  a pretty considerable time maamthat is since the fall began  what a voicewhat an accentand what words was there a man living with sufficient courage to take this woman to england and shew her to the world as lady peterborough  are you going to remain in italy for the summer continued lady rowley  i guess i shallor perhaps locate myself in the purer atmosphere of the swiss mountains  switzerland in summer must certainly be much pleasanter  i was thinking at the moment of the political atmosphere said miss petrie for although certainly much has been done in this country in the way of striking off shackles and treading sceptres under foot still lady rowley there remains here that pernicious thinga king the feeling of the dominion of a single manand that of a single woman is for aught i know worsewith me so clouds the air that the breath i breathe fails to fill my lungs wallachia as she said this put forth her hand and raised her chin and extended her arm she paused feeling that justice demanded that lady rowley should have a right of reply but lady rowley had not a word to say and wallachia petrie went on i cannot adapt my body to the sweet savours and the soft luxuries of the outer world with any comfort to my inner self while the circumstances of the society around me are oppressive to my spirit when our war was raging all around me i was lightspirited as the lark that mounts through the morning sky  i should have thought it was very dreadful said lady rowley  full of dread of awe and of horror were those fiery days of indiscriminate slaughter but they were not days of desolation because hope was always there by our side there was a hope in which the soul could trust and the trusting soul is ever light and buoyant  i dare say it is said lady rowley  but apathy and serfdom and kinghood and dominion drain the fountain of its living springs and the soul becomes like the plummet of lead whose only tendency is to hide itself in subaqueous mud and unsavoury slush  subaqueous mud and unsavoury slush lady rowley repeated the words to herself as she made good her escape and again expressed to herself her conviction that it could not possibly be so the subaqueous mud and unsavoury slush with all that had gone before it about the soul was altogether unintelligible to her but she knew that it was american buncom of a high order of eloquence and she told herself again and again that it could not be so she continued to keep her eyes upon mr glascock and soon saw him again talking to nora it was hardly possible she thought that nora should speak to him with so much animation or he to her unless there was some feeling between them which if properly handled might lead to a renewal of the old tenderness she went up to nora having collected the other girls and said that the carriage was then waiting for them mr glascock immediately offered lady rowley his arm and took her down to the hall could it be that she was leaning upon a future soninlaw there was something in the thought which made her lay her weight upon him with a freedom which she would not otherwise have used ohthat her nora should live to be lady peterborough we are apt to abuse mothers for wanting high husbands for their daughtersbut can there be any point in which the true maternal instinct can shew itself with more affectionate enthusiasm this poor mother wanted nothing for herself from mr glascock she knew very well that it was her fate to go back to the mandarins and probably to die there she knew also that such men as mr glascock when they marry beneath themselves in rank and fortune will not ordinarily trouble themselves much with their mothersinlaw there was nothing desired for herself were such a match accomplished she might perhaps indulge herself in talking among the planters wives of her daughters coronet but at the present moment there was no idea even of this in her mind it was of nora herself and of noras sisters that she was thinkingfor them that she was plottingthat the one might be rich and splendid and the others have some path opened for them to riches and splendour husbandhunting mothers may be injudicious but surely they are maternal and unselfish mr glascock put her into the carriage and squeezed her handand then he squeezed noras hand she saw it and was sure of it i am so glad you are going to be happy nora had said to him before this as far as i have seen her i like her so much if you do not come and visit her in her own house i shall think you have no spirit of friendship he said i will nora had repliedi will this had been said upstairs just as lady rowley was coming to them and on this understanding on this footing mr glascock had pressed her hand  as she went home lady rowleys mind was full of doubt as to the course which it was best that she should follow with her daughter she was not unaware how great was the difficulty before her hugh stanburys name had not been mentioned since they left london but at that time nora was obstinately bent on throwing herself away upon the pennyaliner she had never been brought to acknowledge that such a marriage would be even inappropriate and had withstood gallantly the expression of her fathers displeasure but with such a spirit as noras it might be easier to prevail by silence than by many words lady rowley was quite sure of thisthat it would be far better to say nothing further of hugh stanbury let the cure come if it might be possible from absence and from her daughters good sense the only question was whether it would be wise to say any word about mr glascock in the carriage she was not only forbearing but flattering in her manner to nora she caressed her girls hand and spoke to heras mothers know how to speak when they want to make much of their girls and to have it understood that those girls are behaving as girls should behave there was to be nobody to meet them tonight as it had been arranged that sir marmaduke and mrs trevelyan should sleep at siena hardly a word had been spoken in the carriage but upstairs in their drawingroom there came a moment in which lucy and sophie had left them and nora was alone with her mother lady rowley almost knew that it would be most prudent to be silentbut a word spoken in seasonhow good it is and the thing was so near to her that she could not hold her peace i must say nora she began that i do like your mr glascock  he is not my mr glascock mamma said nora smiling  you know what i mean dear lady rowley had not intended to utter a word that should appear like pressure on her daughter at this moment she had felt how imprudent it would be to do so but now nora seemed to be leading the way herself to such discourse of course he is not your mr glascock you cannot eat your cake and have it nor can you throw it away and have it  i have thrown my cake away altogether and certainly i cannot have it she was still smiling as she spoke and seemed to be quite merry at the idea of regarding mr glascock as the cake which she had declined to eat  i can see one thing quite plainly dear  what is that mamma  that in spite of what you have done you can still have your cake whenever you choose to take it  why mamma he is engaged to be married  mr glascock  yes mr glascock its quite settled is it not sad  to whom is he engaged lady rowleys solemnity as she asked this question was piteous to behold  to miss spaldingcaroline spalding  the eldest of those nieces  yesthe eldest  i cannot believe it  mamma they both told me so i have sworn an eternal friendship with her already  i did not see you speaking to her  but i did talk to her a great deal  and he is really going to marry that dreadful woman  dreadful mamma  perfectly awful she talked to me in a way that i have read about in books but which i did not before believe to be possible do you mean that he is going to be married to that hideous old maidthat bellclapper  oh mamma what slander i think her so pretty  pretty  very pretty and mamma ought i not to be happy that he should have been able to make himself so happy it was quite quite quite impossible that i should have been his wife i have thought about it ever so much and i am so glad of it i think she is just the girl that is fit for him  lady rowley took her candle and went to bed professing to herself that she could not understand it but what did it signify it was at any rate certain now that the man had put himself out of noras reach and if he chose to marry a republican virago with a red nose it could now make no difference to nora lady rowley almost felt a touch of satisfaction in reflecting on the future misery of his married life     chapter lxxviii  casalunga   sir marmaduke had been told at the florence postoffice that he would no doubt be able to hear tidings of trevelyan and to learn his address from the officials in the postoffice at siena at florence he had been introduced to some gentleman who was certainly of importancea superintendent who had clerks under him and who was a big man this person had been very courteous to him and he had gone to siena thinking that he would find it easy to obtain trevelyans addressor to learn that there was no such person there but at siena he and his courier together could obtain no information they rambled about the huge cathedral and the picturesque marketplace of that quaint old city for the whole day and on the next morning after breakfast they returned to florence they had learned nothing the young man at the postoffice had simply protested that he knew nothing of the name of trevelyan if letters should come addressed to such a name he would keep them till they were called for but to the best of his knowledge he had never seen or heard the name at the guardhouse of the gendarmerie they could not or would not give him any information and sir marmaduke came back with an impression that everybody at siena was ignorant idiotic and brutal mrs trevelyan was so dispirited as to be ill and both sir marmaduke and lady rowley were disposed to think that the world was all against them you have no conception of the sort of woman that man is going to marry said lady rowley  what man  mr glascock a horrid american female as old almost as i am who talks through her nose and preaches sermons about the rights of women it is incredible and nora might have had him just for lifting up her hand but sir marmaduke could not interest himself much about mr glascock when he had been told that his daughter had refused the heir to a great estate and a peerage it had been matter of regret but he had looked upon the affair as done and cared nothing now though mr glascock should marry a transatlantic xantippe he was angry with nora because by her obstinacy she was adding to the general perplexities of the family but he could not make comparisons on mr glascocks behalf between her and miss spaldingas his wife was doing either mentally or aloud from hour to hour i suppose it is too late now said lady rowley shaking her head  of course it is too late the man must marry whom he pleases i am beginning to wonder that anybody should ever want to get married i am indeed  but what are the girls to do  i dont know what anybody is to do here is a man as mad as a march hare and yet nobody can touch him if it was not for the child i should advise emily to put him out of her head altogether  but though sir marmaduke could not bring himself to take any interest in mr glascocks affairs and would not ask a single question respecting the fearful american female whom this unfortunate man was about to translate to the position of an english peeress yet circumstances so fell out that before three days were over he and mr glascock were thrown together in very intimate relations sir marmaduke had learned that mr glascock was the only englishman in florence to whom trevelyan had been known and that he was the only person with whom trevelyan had been seen to speak while passing through the city in his despair therefore sir marmaduke had gone to mr glascock and it was soon arranged that the two gentlemen should renew the search at siena together without having with them either mrs trevelyan or the courier mr glascock knew the ways of the people better than did sir marmaduke and could speak the language he obtained a passport to the good offices of the police of siena and went prepared to demand rather than to ask for assistance they started very early before breakfast and on arriving at siena at about noon first employed themselves in recruiting exhausted nature by the time that they had both declared that the hotel at siena was the very worst in all italy and that a breakfast without eatable butter was not to be considered a breakfast at all they had become so intimate that mr glascock spoke of his own intended marriage he must have done this with the conviction on his mind that nora rowley would have told her mother of his former intention and that lady rowley would have told sir marmaduke but he did not feel it to be incumbent on himself to say anything on that subject he had nothing to excuse he had behaved fairly and honourably it was not to be expected that he should remain unmarried for ever for the sake of a girl who had twice refused him of course there are very many in england he said who will think me foolish to marry a girl from another country  it is done every day said sir marmaduke  no doubt it is i admit however that i ought to be more careful than some other persons there is a title and an estate to be perpetuated and i cannot perhaps be justified in taking quite so much liberty as some other men may do but i think i have chosen a woman born to have a high position and who will make her own way in any society in which she may be placed  i have no doubt she will said sir marmaduke who had still sounding in his ears the alarming description which his wife had given him of this infatuated mans proposed bride but he would have been bound to say as much had mr glascock intended to marry as lowly as did king cophetua  she is highly educated gentlemannered as sweetly soft as any english girl i ever met and very pretty you have met her i think  i do not remember that i have observed her  she is too young for me perhaps said mr glascock but that is a fault on the right side sir marmaduke as he wiped his beard after his breakfast remembered what his wife had told him about the ladys age but it was nothing to him she is fourandtwenty i think said mr glascock if mr glascock chose to believe that his intended wife was fourandtwenty instead of something over forty that was nothing to sir marmaduke  the very best age in the world said he  they had sent for an officer of the police and before they had been three hours in siena they had been told that trevelyan lived about seven miles from the town in a small and very remote country house which he had hired for twelve months from one of the city hospitals he had hired it furnished and had purchased a horse and small carriage from a man in the town to this man they went and it soon became evident to them that he of whom they were in search was living at this house which was called casalunga and was not as the police officer told them on the way to any place they must leave siena by the road for rome take a turn to the left about a mile beyond the city gate and continue on along the country lane till they saw a certain round hill to the right on the top of that round hill was casalunga as the country about siena all lies in round hills this was no adequate descriptionbut it was suggested that the country people would know all about it they got a small open carriage in the marketplace and were driven out their driver knew nothing of casalunga and simply went whither he was told but by the aid of the country people they got along over the unmade lanes and in little more than an hour were told at the bottom of the hill that they must now walk up to casalunga though the hill was roundtopped and no more than a hill still the ascent at last was very steep and was paved with stones set edgeway in a manner that could hardly have been intended to accommodate wheels when mr glascock asserted that the signor who lived there had a carriage of his own the driver suggested that he must keep it at the bottom of the hill it was clearly not his intention to attempt to drive up the ascent and sir marmaduke and mr glascock were therefore obliged to walk it was now in the latter half of may and there was a blazing italian sky over their heads mr glascock was acclimated to italian skies and did not much mind the work but sir marmaduke who never did much in walking declared that italy was infinitely hotter than the mandarins and could hardly make his way as far as the house door  it seemed to both of them to be a most singular abode for such a man as trevelyan at the top of the hill there was a huge entrance through a wooden gateway which seemed to have been constructed with the intention of defying any intruders not provided with warlike ammunition the gates were indeed open at the period of their visit but it must be supposed that they were intended to be closed at any rate at night immediately on the right as they entered through the gates there was a large barn in which two men were coopering wine vats from thence a path led slanting to the house of which the door was shut and all the front windows blocked with shutters the house was very long and only of one story for a portion of its length over that end at which the door was placed there were upper rooms and there must have been space enough for a large family with many domestics there was nothing round or near the residence which could be called a garden so that its look of desolation was extreme there were various large barns and outhouses as though it had been intended by the builder that corn and hay and cattle should be kept there but it seemed now that there was nothing there except the empty vats at which the two men were coopering had the englishmen gone farther into the granary they would have seen that there were winepresses stored away in the dark corners  they stopped and looked at the men and the men halted for a moment from their work and looked at them but the men spoke never a word mr glascock then asked after mr trevelyan and one of the coopers pointed to the house then they crossed over to the door and mr glascock finding there neither knocker nor bell first tapped with his knuckles and then struck with his stick but no one came there was not a sound in the house and no shutter was removed i dont believe that there is a soul here said sir marmaduke  well not give it up till weve seen it all at any rate said mr glascock and so they went round to the other front  on this side of the house the tilled ground either ploughed or dug with the spade came up to the very windows there was hardly even a particle of grass to be seen a short way down the hill there were rows of olive trees standing in prim order and at regular distances from which hung the vines that made the coopering of the vats necessary olives and vines have pretty names and call up associations of landscape beauty but here they were in no way beautiful the ground beneath them was turned up and brown and arid so that there was not a blade of grass to be seen on some furrows the maize or indian corn was sprouting and there were patches of growth of other kindseach patch closely marked by its own straight lines and there were narrow paths so constructed as to take as little room as possible but all that had been done had been done for economy and nothing for beauty the occupiers of casalunga had thought more of the produce of their land than of picturesque or attractive appearance  the sun was blazing fiercely hot hotter on this side sir marmaduke thought even than on the other and there was not a wavelet of a cloud in the sky a balcony ran the whole length of the house and under this sir marmaduke took shelter at once leaning with his back against the wall there is not a soul here at all said he  the men in the barn told us that there was said mr glascock and at any rate we will try the windows so saying he walked along the front of the house sir marmaduke following him slowly till they came to a door the upper half of which was glazed and through which they looked into one of the rooms two or three of the other windows in this frontage of the house came down to the ground and were made for egress and ingress but they had all been closed with shutters as though the house was deserted but they now looked into a room which contained some signs of habitation there was a small table with a marble top on which lay two or three books and there were two armchairs in the room with gilded arms and legs and a morsel of carpet and a clock on a shelf over a stove anda rockinghorse the boy is here you may be sure said mr glascock the rockinghorse makes that certain but how are we to get at any one  i never saw such a place for an englishman to come and live in before said sir marmaduke what on earth can he do here all day as he spoke the door of the room was opened and there was trevelyan standing before them looking at them through the window he wore an old red english dressinggown which came down to his feet and a small braided italian cap on his head his beard had been allowed to grow and he had neither collar nor cravat his trousers were unbraced and he shuffled in with a pair of slippers which would hardly cling to his feet he was paler and still thinner than when he had been visited at willesden and his eyes seemed to be larger and shone almost with a brighter brilliancy  mr glascock tried to open the door but found that it was closed sir marmaduke and i have come to visit you said mr glascock aloud is there any means by which we can get into the house trevelyan stood still and stared at them we knocked at the front door but nobody came continued mr glascock i suppose this is the way you usually go in and out  he does not mean to let us in whispered sir marmaduke  can you open this door said mr glascock or shall we go round again trevelyan had stood still contemplating them but at last came forward and put back the bolt that is all right said mr glascock entering i am sure you will be glad to see sir marmaduke  i should be glad to see himor you if i could entertain you said trevelyan his voice was harsh and hard and his words were uttered with a certain amount of intended grandeur any of the family would be welcome were it not  were it not what asked mr glascock  it can be nothing to you sir what troubles i have here this is my own abode in which i had flattered myself that i could be free from intruders i do not want visitors i am sorry that you should have had trouble in coming here but i do not want visitors i am very sorry that i have nothing that i can offer you mr glascock  emily is in florence said sir marmaduke  who brought her did i tell her to come let her go back to her home i have come here to be free from her and i mean to be free if she wants my money let her take it  she wants her child said mr glascock  he is my child said trevelyan and my right to him is better than hers let her try it in a court of law and she shall see why did she deceive me with that man why has she driven me to this look here mr glascockmy whole life is spent in this seclusion and it is her fault  your wife is innocent of all fault trevelyan said mr glascock  any woman can say as much as thatand all women do say it yetwhat are they worth  do you mean sir to take away your wifes character said sir marmaduke coming up in wrath remember that she is my daughter and that there are things which flesh and blood cannot stand  she is my wife sir and that is ten times more do you think that you would do more for her than i would dodrink more of esill you had better go away sir marmaduke you can do no good by coming here and talking of your daughter i would have given the world to save herbut she would not be saved  you are a slanderer said sir marmaduke in his wrath  mr glascock turned round to the father and tried to quiet him it was so manifest to him that the balance of the poor mans mind was gone that it seemed to him to be ridiculous to upbraid the sufferer he was such a piteous sight to behold that it was almost impossible to feel indignation against him you cannot wonder said mr glascock advancing close to the master of the house that the mother should want to see her only child you do not wish that your wife should be the most wretched woman in the world  am not i the most wretched of men can anything be more wretched than this is her life worse than mine and whose fault was it had i any friend to whom she objected was i untrue to her in a single thought  if you say that she was untrue it is a falsehood said sir marmaduke  you allow yourself a liberty of expression sir because you are my wifes father said trevelyan which you would not dare to take in other circumstances  i say that it is a false calumnya lie and i would say so to any man on earth who should dare to slander my childs name  your child sir she is my wifemy wifemy wife trevelyan as he spoke advanced close up to his fatherinlaw and at last hissed out his words with his lips close to sir marmadukes face your right in her is gone sir she is mineminemine and you see the way in which she has treated me mr glascock everything i had was hers but the words of a greyhaired sinner were sweeter to her than all my love i wonder whether you think that it is a pleasant thing for such a one as i to come out here and live in such a place as this i have not a frienda companionhardly a book there is nothing that i can eat or drink i do not stir out of the houseand i am illvery ill look at me see what she has brought me to mr glascock on my honour as a man i never wronged her in a thought or a word  mr glascock had come to think that his best chance of doing any good was to get trevelyan into conversation with himself free from the interruption of sir marmaduke the father of the injured woman could not bring himself to endure the hard words that were spoken of his daughter during this last speech he had broken out once or twice but trevelyan not heeding him had clung to mr glascocks arm sir marmaduke said he would you not like to see the boy  he shall not see the boy said trevelyan you may see him he shall not what is he that he should have control over me  this is the most fearful thing i ever heard of said sir marmaduke what are we to do with him  mr glascock whispered a few words to sir marmaduke and then declared that he was ready to be taken to the child and he will remain here asked trevelyan a pledge was then given by sir marmaduke that he would not force his way farther into the house and the two other men left the chamber together sir marmaduke as he paced up and down the room alone perspiring at every pore thoroughly uncomfortable and ill at ease thought of all the hard positions of which he had ever read and that his was harder than them all here was a man married to his daughter in possession of his daughters child manifestly madand yet he could do nothing to him he was about to return to the seat of his government and he must leave his own child in this madmans power of course his daughter could not go with him leaving her child in this madmans hands he had been told that even were he to attempt to prove the man to be mad in italy the process would be slow and before it could be well commenced trevelyan would be off with the child elsewhere there never was an embarrassment thought sir marmaduke out of which it was so impossible to find a clear way  in the meantime mr glascock and trevelyan were visiting the child it was evident that the father let him be ever so mad had discerned the expediency of allowing some one to see that his son was alive and in health mr glascock did not know much of children and could only say afterwards that the boy was silent and very melancholy but clean and apparently well it appeared that he was taken out daily by his father in the cool hours of the morning and that his father hardly left him from the time that he was taken up till he was put to bed but mr glascocks desire was to see trevelyan alone and this he did after they had left the boy and now trevelyan he said what do you mean to do  to do  in what way do you propose to live i want you to be reasonable with me  they do not treat me reasonably  are you going to measure your own conduct by that of other people in the first place you should go back to england what good can you do here trevelyan shook his head but remained silent you cannot like this life  no indeed but whither can i go now that i shall like to live  why not home  i have no home  why not go back to england ask your wife to join you and return with her she would go at a word the poor wretch again shook his head i hope you think that i speak as your friend said mr glascock  i believe you do  i will say nothing of any imprudence but you cannot believe that she has been untrue to you trevelyan would say nothing to this but stood silent waiting for mr glascock to continue let her come back to youhere and then as soon as you can arrange it go to your own home  shall i tell you something said trevelyan  what is it  he came up close to mr glascock and put his hand upon his visitors shoulder i will tell you what she would do at once i dare say that she would come to me i dare say that she would go with me i am sure she would and directly she got me there she wouldsay that i wasmad shemy wife would do it hethat furious ignorant old man below tried to do it before his wife said that i was mad he paused a moment as though waiting for a reply but mr glascock had none to make it had not been his object in the advice which he had given to entrap the poor fellow by a snare and to induce him so to act that he should deliver himself up to keepers but he was well aware that wherever trevelyan might be it would be desirable that he should be placed for awhile in the charge of some physician he could not bring himself at the spur of the moment to repudiate the idea by which trevelyan was actuated perhaps you think that she would be right said trevelyan  i am quite sure that she would do nothing that is not for the best said mr glascock  i can see it all i will not go back to england mr glascock i intend to travel i shall probably leave this and go tototo greece perhaps it is a healthy place this and i like it for that reason but i shall not stay here if my wife likes to travel with me she can come butto england i will not go  you will let the child go to his mother  certainly not if she wants to see the child he is here if she will comewithout her fathershe shall see him she shall not take him from hence nor shall she return to live with me without full acknowledgment of her fault and promises of an amended life i know what i am saying mr glascock and have thought of these things perhaps more than you have done i am obliged to you for coming to me but now if you please i would prefer to be alone  mr glascock seeing that nothing further could be done joined sir marmaduke and the two walked down to their carriage at the bottom of the hill mr glascock as he went declared his conviction that the unfortunate man was altogether mad and that it would be necessary to obtain some interference on the part of the authorities for the protection of the child how this could be done or whether it could be done in time to intercept a further flight on the part of trevelyan mr glascock could not say it was his idea that mrs trevelyan should herself go out to casalunga and try the force of her own persuasion  i believe that he would murder her said sir marmaduke  he would not do that there is a glimmer of sense in all his madness which will keep him from any actual violence     chapter lxxix  i can sleep on the boards   three days after this there came another carriage to the bottom of the hill on which casalunga stood and a lady got out of it all alone it was emily trevelyan and she had come thither from siena in quest of her husband and her child on the previous day sir marmadukes courier had been at the house with a note from the wife to the husband and had returned with an answer in which mrs trevelyan was told that if she would come quite alone she should see her child sir marmaduke had been averse to any further intercourse with the man other than what might be made in accordance with medical advice and if possible with government authority lady rowley had assented to her daughters wish but had suggested that she should at least be allowed to go alsoat any rate as far as the bottom of the hill but emily had been very firm and mr glascock had supported her he was confident that the man would do no harm to her and he was indisposed to believe that any interference on the part of the italian government could be procured in such a case with sufficient celerity to be of use he still thought it might be possible that the wife might prevail over the husband or the mother over the father sir marmaduke was at last obliged to yield and mrs trevelyan went to siena with no other companion but the courier from siena she made the journey quite alone and having learned the circumstances of the house from mr glascock she got out of the carriage and walked up the hill there were still the two men coopering at the vats but she did not stay to speak to them she went through the big gates and along the slanting path to the door not doubting of her wayfor mr glascock had described it all to her making a small plan of the premises and even explaining to her the position of the room in which her boy and her husband slept she found the door open and an italian maidservant at once welcomed her to the house and assured her that the signor would be with her immediately she was sure that the girl knew that she was the boys mother and was almost tempted to ask questions at once as to the state of the household but her knowledge of italian was slight and she felt that she was so utterly a stranger in the land that she could dare to trust no one though the heat was great her face was covered with a thick veil her dress was black from head to foot and she was as a woman who mourned for her husband she was led into the room which her father had been allowed to enter through the window and here she sat in her husbands house feeling that in no position in the world could she be more utterly separated from the interests of all around her in a few minutes the door was opened and her husband was with her bringing the boy in his hand he had dressed himself with some care but it may be doubted whether the garments which he wore did not make him appear thinner even and more haggard than he had looked to be in his old dressinggown he had not shaved himself but his long hair was brushed back from his forehead after a fashion quaint and very foreign to his former ideas of dress his wife had not expected that her child would come to her at oncehad thought that some entreaties would be necessary some obedience perhaps exacted from her before she would be allowed to see him and now her heart was softened and she was grateful to her husband but she could not speak to him till she had had the boy in her arms she tore off her bonnet and then clinging to the child covered him with kisses louey my darling louey you remember mamma the child pressed himself close to the mothers bosom but spoke never a word he was cowed and overcome not only by the incidents of the moment but by the terrible melancholy of his whole life he had been taught to understand without actual spoken lessons that he was to live with his father and that the former womangiven happinesses of his life were at an end in this second visit from his mother he did not forget her he recognised the luxury of her love but it did not occur to him even to hope that she might have come to rescue him from the evil of his days trevelyan was standing by the while looking on but he did not speak till she addressed him  i am so thankful to you for bringing him to me she said  i told you that you should see him he said perhaps it might have been better that i should have sent him by a servant but there are circumstances which make me fear to let him out of my sight  do you think that i did not wish to see you also louis why do you do me so much wrong why do you treat me with such cruelty then she threw her arms round his neck and before he could repulse herbefore he could reflect whether it would be well that he should repulse her or notshe had covered his brow and cheeks and lips with kisses louis she said louis speak to me  it is hard to speak sometimes he said      illustration it is hard to speak sometimes   you love me louis  yesi love you but i am afraid of you  what is it that you fear i would give my life for you if you would only come back to me and let me feel that you believed me to be true he shook his head and began to thinkwhile she still clung to him he was quite sure that her father and mother had intended to bring a mad doctor down upon him and he knew that his wife was in her mothers hands should he yield to her nowshould he make her any promisemight not the result be that he would be shut up in dark rooms robbed of his liberty robbed of what he loved better than his libertyhis power as a man she would thus get the better of him and take the child and the world would say that in this contest between him and her he had been the sinning one and she the one against whom the sin had been done it was the chief object of his mind the one thing for which he was eager that this should never come to pass let it once be conceded to him from all sides that he had been right and then she might do with him almost as she willed he knew well that he was ill when he thought of his child he would tell himself that he was dying he was at some moments of his miserable existence fearfully anxious to come to terms with his wife in order that at his death his boy might not be without a protector were he to die then it would be better that his child should be with its mother in his happy days immediately after his marriage he had made a will in which he had left his entire property to his wife for her life providing for its subsequent descent to his childor children it had never even occurred to his poor shattered brain that it would be well for him to alter his will had he really believed that his wife had betrayed him doubtless he would have done so he would have hated her have distrusted her altogether and have believed her to be an evil thing he had no such belief but in his desire to achieve empire and in the sorrows which had come upon him in his unsuccessful struggle his mind had wavered so frequently that his spoken words were no true indicators of his thoughts and in all his arguments he failed to express either his convictions or his desires when he would say something stronger than he intended and it would be put to him by his wife by her father or mother or by some friend of hers whether he did believe that she had been untrue to him he would recoil from the answer which his heart would dictate lest he should seem to make an acknowledgment that might weaken the ground upon which he stood then he would satisfy his own conscience by assuring himself that he had never accused her of such sin she was still clinging to him now as his mind was working after this fashion louis she said let it all be as though there had been nothing  how can that be my dear  not to othersbut to us it can be so there shall be no word spoken of the past again he shook his head will it not be best that there should be no word spoken  forgiveness may be spoken with the tongue he said beginning to quote from a poem which had formerly been frequent in his hands  cannot there be real forgiveness between you and mebetween husband and wife who in truth love each other do you think that i would tell you of it again he felt that in all that she said there was an assumption that she had been right and that he had been wrong she was promising to forgive she was undertaking to forget she was willing to take him back to the warmth of her love and the comfort of her kindnessbut was not asking to be taken back this was what he could not and would not endure he had determined that if she behaved well to him he would not be harsh to her and he was struggling to keep up to his resolve he would accuse her of nothingif he could help it but he could not say a word that would even imply that she need forgetthat she should forgive it was for him to forgiveand he was willing to do it if she would accept forgiveness i will never speak a word louis she said laying her head upon his shoulder  your heart is still hardened he replied slowly  hard to you  and your mind is dark you do not see what you have done in our religion emily forgiveness is sure not after penitence but with repentance  what does that mean  it means this that though i would welcome you back to my arms with joy i cannot do so till you haveconfessed your fault  what fault louis if i have made you unhappy i do indeed grieve that it has been so  it is of no use said he i cannot talk about it do you suppose that it does not tear me to the very soul to think of it  what is it that you think louis as she had been travelling thither she had determined that she would say anything that he wished her to saymake any admission that might satisfy him that she could be happy again as other women are happy she did not expect but if it could be conceded between them that bygones should be bygones she might live with him and do her duty and at least have her child with her her father had told her that her husband was mad but she was willing to put up with his madness on such terms as these what could her husband do to her in his madness that he could not do also to the child tell me what you want me to say and i will say it she said  you have sinned against me he said raising her head gently from his shoulder  never she exclaimed as god is my judge i never have as she said this she retreated and took the sobbing boy again into her arms  he was at once placed upon his guard telling himself that he saw the necessity of holding by his child how could he tell might there not be a policeman down from florence ready round the house to seize the boy and carry him away though all his remaining life should be a torment to him though infinite plagues should be poured upon his head though he should die like a dog alone unfriended and in despair while he was fighting this battle of his he would not give way that is sufficient he said louey must return now to his own chamber  i may go with him  no emily you cannot go with him now i will thank you to release him that i may take him she still held the little fellow closely pressed in her arms do not reward me for my courtesy by further disobedience he said  you will let me come again to this he made no reply tell me that i may come again  i do not think that i shall remain here long  and i may not stay now  that would be impossible there is no accommodation for you  i could sleep on the boards beside his cot said mrs trevelyan  that is my place he replied you may know that he is not disregarded with my own hands i tend him every morning i take him out myself i feed him myself he says his prayers to me he learns from me and can say his letters nicely you need not fear for him no mother was ever more tender with her child than i am with him then he gently withdrew the boy from her arms and she let her child go lest he should learn to know that there was a quarrel between his father and his mother if you will excuse me he said i will not come down to you again today my servant will see you to your carriage  so he left her and she with an italian girl at her heels got into her vehicle and was taken back to siena there she passed the night alone at the inn and on the next morning returned to florence by the railway     chapter lxxx  will they despise him   gradually the news of the intended marriage between mr glascock and miss spalding spread itself over florence and people talked about it with that energy which subjects of such moment certainly deserve that caroline spalding had achieved a very great triumph was of course the verdict of all men and of all women and i fear that there was a corresponding feeling that poor mr glascock had been triumphed over and as it were subjugated in some respects he had been remiss in his duties as a bachelor visitor to florenceas a visitor to florence who had manifestly been much in want of a wife he had not given other girls a fair chance but had thrown himself down at the feet of this american female in the weakest possible manner and then it got about the town that he had been refused over and over again by nora rowley it is too probable that lady rowley in her despair and dismay had been indiscreet and had told secrets which should never have been mentioned by her and the wife of the english minister who had some grudges of her own lifted her eyebrows and shook her head and declared that all the glascocks at home would be outraged to the last degree my dear lady rowley she said i dont know whether it wont become a question with them whether they should issue a commission de lunatico lady rowley did not know what a commission de lunatico meant but was quite willing to regard poor mr glascock as a lunatic and there is poor lord peterborough at naples just at deaths door continued the british ministers wife in this she was perhaps nearly correct but as lord peterborough had now been in the same condition for many months as his mind had altogether gone and as the doctor declared that he might live in his present condition for a year or for years it could not fairly be said that mr glascock was acting without due filial feeling in engaging himself to marry a young lady and she such a creature said lady rowley with emphasis this the british ministers wife noticed simply by shaking her head caroline spalding was undoubtedly a pretty girl but as the british ministers wife said afterwards it was not surprising that poor lady rowley should be nearly out of her mind  this had occurred a full week after the evening spent at mr spaldings house and even yet lady rowley had never been put right as to that mistake of hers about wallachia petrie that other trouble of hers and her eldest daughters journey to siena had prevented them from going out and though the matter had often been discussed between lady rowley and nora there had not as yet come between them any proper explanation nora would declare that the future bride was very pretty and very delightful and lady rowley would throw up her hands in despair and protest that her daughter was insane why should he not marry whom he likes mamma nora once said almost with indignation  because he will disgrace his family  i cannot understand what you mean mamma they are at any rate as good as we are mr spalding stands quite as high as papa does  she is an american said lady rowley  and her family might say that he is an englishman said nora  my dear if you do not understand the incongruity between an english peer and a yankeefemale i cannot help you i suppose it is because you have been brought up within the limited society of a small colony if so it is not your fault but i had hoped you had been in europe long enough to have learned what was what do you think my dear that she will look well when she is presented to her majesty as lord peterboroughs wife  splendid said nora she has just the brow for a coronet  heavens and earth said lady rowley throwing up her hands and you believe that he will be proud of her in england  i am sure he will  my belief is that he will leave her behind him or that they will settle somewhere in the wilds of americaout in mexico or massachusetts or the rocky mountains i do not think that he will have the courage to shew her in london  the marriage was to take place in the protestant church at florence early in june and then the bride and bridegroom were to go over the alps and to remain there subject to tidings as to the health of the old man at naples mr glascock had thrown up his seat in parliament some month or two ago knowing that he could not get back to his duties during the present session and feeling that he would shortly be called upon to sit in the other house he was thus free to use his time and to fix his days as he pleased and it was certainly clear to those who knew him that he was not ashamed of his american bride he spent much of his time at the spaldings house and was always to be seen with them in the cascine and at the opera mrs spalding the aunt was of course in great glory a triumphant happy or even simply a splendid marriage for the rising girl of a family is a great glory to the maternal mind mrs spalding could not but be aware that the very air around her seemed to breathe congratulations into her ears her friends spoke to her even on indifferent subjects as though everything was going well with herbetter with her than with anybody else and there came upon her in these days a dangerous feeling that in spite of all the preachings of the preachers the next world might perhaps be not so very much better than this she was in fact the reverse of the medal of which poor lady rowley filled the obverse and the american minister was certainly an inch taller than before and made longer speeches being much more regardless of interruption olivia was delighted at her sisters success and heard with rapture the description of monkhams which came to her secondhand through her sister it was already settled that she was to spend her next christmas at monkhams and perhaps there might be an idea in her mind that there were other eldest sons of old lords who would like american brides everything around caroline spalding was pleasantexcept the words of wallachia petrie  everything around her was pleasant till there came to her a touch of a suspicion that the marriage which mr glascock was going to make would be detrimental to her intended husband in his own country there were many in florence who were saying this besides the wife of the english minister and lady rowley of course caroline spalding herself was the last to hear it and to her the idea was brought by wallachia petrie i wish i could think you would make yourself happyor him wallachia had said croaking  why should i fail to make him happy  because you are not of the same blood or race or manners as himself they say that he is very wealthy in his own country and that those who live around him will look coldly on you  so that he does not look coldly i do not care how others may look said caroline proudly  but when he finds that he has injured himself by such a marriage in the estimation of all his friendshow will it be then  this set caroline spalding thinking of what she was doing she began to realise the feeling that perhaps she might not be a fit bride for an english lords son and in her agony she came to nora rowley for counsel after all how little was it that she knew of the home and the country to which she was to be carried she might not perhaps get adequate advice from nora but she would probably learn something on which she could act there was no one else among the english at florence to whom she could speak with freedom when she mentioned her fears to her aunt her aunt of course laughed at her mrs spalding told her that mr glascock might be presumed to know his own business best and that she as an american lady of high standingthe niece of a ministerwas a fitting match for any englishman let him be ever so much a lord but caroline was not comforted by this and in her suspense she went to nora rowley she wrote a line to nora and when she called at the hotel was taken up to her friends bedroom she found great difficulty in telling her story but she did tell it miss rowley she said if this is a silly thing that he is going to do i am bound to save him from his own folly you know your own country better than i do will they think that he has disgraced himself  certainly not that said nora  shall i be a load round his neck miss rowley for my own sake i would not endure such a position as that not even though i love him but for his sake think of that if i find that people think ill of himbecause of me  no one will think ill of him  is it esteemed needful that such a one as he should marry a woman of his own rank i can bear to end it all now but i shall not be able to bear his humiliation and my own despair if i find that i have injured him tell me plainlyis it a marriage that he should not make nora paused for a while before she answered and as she sat silent the other girl watched her face carefully nora on being thus consulted was very careful that her tongue should utter nothing that was not her true opinion as best she knew how to express it her sympathy would have prompted her to give such an answer as would at once have made caroline happy in her mind she would have been delighted to have been able to declare that these doubts were utterly groundless and this hesitation needless but she conceived that she owed it as a duty from one woman to another to speak the truth as she conceived it on so momentous an occasion and she was not sure but that mr glascock would be considered by his friends in england to be doing badly in marrying an american girl what she did not remember was thisthat her very hesitation was in fact an answer and such an answer as she was most unwilling to give i see that it would be so said caroline spalding  nonot that  what then will they despise himand me  no one who knows you can despise you no one who sees you can fail to admire you nora as she said this thought of her mother but told herself at once that in this matter her mothers judgment had been altogether destroyed by her disappointment what i think will take place will be this his family when first they hear of it will be sorry  then said caroline i will put an end to it  you cant do that dear you are engaged and you havent a right i am engaged to a man and all my friends object to it but i shant put an end to it i dont think i have a right i shall not do it any way however  but if it were for his good  it couldnt be for his good he and i have got to go along together somehow  you wouldnt hurt him said caroline  i wont if i can help it but he has got to take me along with him any how and mr glascock has got to take you if i were you i shouldnt ask any more questions  it isnt the same you said that you were to be poor but he is very rich and i am beginning to understand that these titles of yours are something like kings crowns the man who has to wear them cant do just as he pleases with them noblesse oblige i can see the meaning of that even when the obligation itself is trumpery in its nature if it is a mans duty to marry a talbot because hes a howard i suppose he ought to do his duty after a pause she went on again i do believe that i have made a mistake it seemed to be absurd at the first to think of it but i do believe it now even what you say to me makes me think it  at any rate you cant go back said nora enthusiastically  i will try  go to himself and ask him you must leave him to decide it at last i dont see how a girl when she is engaged is to throw a man over unless he consents of course you can throw yourself into the arno  and get the water into my shoesfor it wouldnt do much more at present  and you canjilt him said nora  it would not be jilting him  he must decide that if he so regards it it will be so i advise you to think no more about it but if you speak to anybody it should be to him this was at last the result of noras wisdom and then the two girls descended together to the room in which lady rowley was sitting with her other daughters lady rowley was very careful in asking after miss spaldings sister and miss spalding assured her that olivia was quite well then lady rowley made some inquiry about olivia and mr glascock and miss spalding assured her that no two persons were ever such allies and that she believed that they were together at this moment investigating some old church lady rowley simpered and declared that nothing could be more proper and expressed a hope that olivia would like england caroline spalding having still in her mind the trouble that had brought her to nora had not much to say about this if she goes again to england i am sure she will like it replied miss spalding  but of course she is going said lady rowley  of course she will some day and of course shell like it said miss spalding we both of us have been there already  but i mean monkhams said lady rowley still simpering  i declare i believe mamma thinks that your sister is to be married to mr glascock said lucy  and so she isisnt she said lady rowley  oh mamma said nora jumping up it is carolinethis one this one this oneand nora took her friend by the arm as she spokeit is this one that is to be mrs glascock  it is a most natural mistake to make said caroline  lady rowley became very red in the face and was unhappy i declare she said that they told me it was your elder sister  but i have no elder sister said caroline laughing  of course she is oldest said noraand looks to be so ever so much dont you miss spalding  i have always supposed so  i dont understand it at all said lady rowley who had no image before her minds eye but that of wallachia petrie and who was beginning to feel that she had disgraced her own judgment by the criticisms she had expressed everywhere as to mr glascocks bride i dont understand it at all do you mean that both your sisters are younger than you miss spalding  i have only got one lady rowley  mamma you are thinking of miss petrie said nora clapping both her hands together  i mean the lady that wears the black bugles  of course you domiss petrie mamma has all along thought that mr glascock was going to carry away with him the republican browning  oh mamma how can you have made such a blunder said sophie rowley mamma does make such delicious blunders  sophie my dear that is not a proper way of speaking  but dear mamma dont you  if somebody has told me wrong that has not been my fault said lady rowley  the poor woman was so evidently disconcerted that caroline spalding was quite unhappy my dear lady rowley there has been no fault and why shouldnt it have been so wallachia is so clever that it is the most natural thing in the world to have thought  i cannot say that i agree with you there said lady rowley somewhat recovering herself  you must know the whole truth now said nora turning to her friend and you must not be angry with us if we laugh a little at your poetess mamma has been frantic with mr glascock because he has been going to marrywhom shall i sayher edition of you she has sworn that he must be insane when we have sworn how beautiful you were and how nice and how jolly and all the rest of itshe has sworn that you were at least a hundred and that you had a red nose you must admit that miss petrie has a red nose  is that a sin  not at all in the woman who has it but in the man who is going to marry ityes cant you see how we have all been at crosspurposes and what mamma has been thinking and saying of poor mr glascock you mustnt repeat it of course but we have had such a battle here about it we thought that mamma had lost her eyes and her ears and her knowledge of things in general and now it has all come out you wont be angry  why should i be angry  miss spalding said lady rowley i am really unhappy at what has occurred and i hope that there may be nothing more said about it i am quite sure that somebody told me wrong or i should not have fallen into such an error i beg your pardonand mr glascocks  beg mr glascocks pardon certainly said lucy  miss spalding looked very pretty smiled very gracefully and coming up to lady rowley to say goodbye kissed her on her cheeks this overcame the spirit of the disappointed mother and lady rowley never said another word against caroline spalding or her marriage now mamma what do you think of her said nora as soon as caroline was gone  was it odd my dear that i should be astonished at his wanting to marry that other woman  but mamma when we told you that she was young and pretty and bright  i thought that you were all demented i did indeed i still think it a pity that he should take an american i think that miss spalding is very nice but there are english girls quite as nicelooking as her after that there was not another word said by lady rowley against caroline spalding  nora when she thought of it all that night felt that she had hardly spoken to miss spalding as she should have spoken as to the treatment in england which would be accorded to mr glascocks wife she became aware of the effect which her own hesitation must have had and thought that it was her duty to endeavour to remove it perhaps too the conversion of her mother had some effect in making her feel that she had been wrong in supposing that there would be any difficulty in carolines position in england she had heard so much adverse criticism from her mother that she had doubted in spite of her own convictionsbut now it had come to light that lady rowleys criticisms had all come from a most absurd blunder only fancyshe said to herselfmiss petrie coming out as lady peterborough poor mamma and then she thought of the reception which would be given to caroline and of the place the future lady peterborough would fill in the world and of the glories of monkhams resolving that she would do her best to counteract any evil which she might have done she seated herself at her desk and wrote the following letter to miss spalding      my dear caroline     i am sure you will let me call you so as had you not felt    towards me like a friend you would not have come to me    today and told me of your doubts i think that i did not    answer you as i ought to have done when you spoke to me    i did not like to say anything offhand and in that way    i misled you i feel quite sure that you will encounter    nothing in england as mr glascocks wife to make you    uncomfortable and that he will have nothing to repent    of course englishmen generally marry englishwomen and    perhaps there may be some people who will think that such    a prize should not be lost to their countrywomen but that    will be all mr glascock commands such universal respect    that his wife will certainly be respected and i do not    suppose that anything will ever come in your way that can    possibly make you feel that he is looked down upon i hope    you will understand what i mean     as for your changing now that is quite impossible if i    were you i would not say a word about it to any living    being but just go onstraight forwardin your own    way and take the good the gods provide youas the poet    says to the king in the ode and i think the gods have    provided for you very welland for him     i do hope that i may see you sometimes i cannot explain    to you how very much out of your line we shall befor    of course there is a we people are more separated with    us than they are i suppose with you and my we is    a very poor man who works hard at writing in a dingy    newspaper office and we shall live in a garret and have    brown sugar in our tea and eat hashed mutton and i shall    have nothing a year to buy my clothes with still i mean    to do it and i dont mean to be long before i do do it    when a girl has made up her mind to be married she had    better go on with it at once and take it all afterwards    as it may come nevertheless perhaps we may see each    other somewhere and i may be able to introduce you to the    dearest honestest very best and most affectionate man    in the world and he is very very clever     yours very affectionately     nora rowley     thursday morning     chapter lxxxi  mr glascock is master      illustration  caroline spalding when she received noras letter was not disposed to give much weight to it she declared to herself that the girls unpremeditated expression of opinion was worth more than her studied words but she was not the less grateful or the less loving towards her new friend she thought how nice it would be to have nora at that splendid abode in england of which she had heard so muchbut she thought also that in that splendid abode she herself ought never to have part or share if it were the case that this were an unfitting match it was clearly her duty to decide that there should be no marriage nora had been quite right in bidding her speak to mr glascock himself and to mr glascock she would go but it was very difficult for her to determine on the manner in which she would discuss the subject with him she thought that she could be firm if her mind were once made up she believed that perhaps she was by nature more firm than he in all their intercourse together he had ever yielded to her and though she had been always pleased and grateful there had grown upon her an idea that he was perhaps too easythat he was a man as to whom it was necessary that they who loved him should see that he was not led away by weakness into folly but she would want to learn something from him before her decision was finally reached and in this she foresaw a great difficulty in her trouble she went to her usual counsellorthe republican browning in such an emergency she could hardly have done worse wally she said we talk about england and italy and france as though we knew all about them but how hard it is to realise the difference between ones own country and others  we can at least learn a great deal that is satisfactory said wallachia about one out of every five italians can read a book about two out of every five englishmen can read a book out of every five new englanders four and fourfifths can read a book i guess that is knowing a good deal  i dont mean in statistics  i cannot conceive how you are to learn anything about any country except by statistics i have just discovered that the number of illegitimate children  oh wally i cant talk about thatnot now at least what i cannot realise is thiswhat sort of a life it is that they will lead at monkhams  plenty to eat and drink i guess and youll always have to go round in fine clothes  and that will be all  nonot all there will be carriages and horses and all manner of people there who wont care much about you if he is firmvery firmif he have that firmness which one does not often meet even in an american man he will be able after a while to give you a position as an english woman of rank it is to be feared that wallachia petrie had been made aware of carolines idea as to mr glascocks want of purpose  and that will be all  if you have a baby theyll let you go and see it two or three times a day i dont suppose you will be allowed to nurse it because they never do in england you have read what the saturday review says in every other respect the saturday review has been the falsest of all false periodicals but i guess it has been pretty true in what it has said about english women  i wish i knew more about it really  when a man has to leap through a window in the dark caroline of course he doubts whether the feather bed said to be below will be soft enough for him  i shouldnt fear the leap for myself if it wouldnt hurt him do you think it possible that society can be so formed that a man should lose caste because he doesnt marry just one of his own set  it has been so all over the world my dear if like to like is to be true anywhere it should be true in marriage  yesbut with a difference he and i are like to like we come of the same race we speak the same language we worship the same god we have the same ideas of culture and of pleasures the difference is one that is not patent to the eye or to the ear it is a difference of accidental incident not of nature or of acquirement  i guess you would find caroline that a jury of english matrons sworn to try you fairly would not find you to be entitled to come among them as one of themselves  and how will that affect him  less powerfully than many others because he is not impassioned he is perhapslethargic  no wally he is not lethargic  if you ask me i must speak it would harass some men almost to death it will not do so with him he would probably find his happiness best in leaving his old country and coming among your people  the idea of mr glascockthe future lord peterboroughleaving england abandoning monkhams deserting his duty in the house of lords and going away to live in an american town in order that he might escape the miseries which his wife had brought upon him in his own country was more than caroline could bear she knew that at any rate it would not come to that the lord of monkhams would live at monkhams though the heavens should fallin regard to domestic comforts it was clear to caroline that wallachia petrie had in truth never brought home to her own imagination the position of an english peer i dont think you understand the people at all she said angrily  you think that you can understand them better because you are engaged to this man said miss petrie with wellpronounced irony you have found generally that when the sun shines in your eyes your sight is improved by it you think that the lovetalk of a few weeks gives clearer instruction than the laborious reading of many volumes and thoughtful converse with thinking persons i hope that you may find it so caroline so saying wallachia petrie walked off in great dudgeon  miss petrie not having learned from her many volumes and her much converse with thoughtful persons to read human nature aright was convinced by this conversation that her friend caroline was blind to all results and was determined to go on with this dangerous marriage having the rays of that sun of monkhams so full upon her eyes that she could not see at all she was specially indignant at finding that her own words had no effect but unfortunately her words had had much effect and caroline though she had contested her points had done so only with the intention of producing her mentors admonitions of course it was out of the question that mr glascock should go and live in providence rhode island from which thriving town caroline spalding had come but because that was impossible it was not the less probable that he might be degraded and made miserable in his own home that suggested jury of british matrons was a frightful conclave to contemplate and caroline was disposed to believe that the verdict given in reference to herself would be adverse to her so she sat and meditated and spoke not a word further to any one on the subject till she was alone with the man that she loved  mr spalding at this time inhabited the ground floor of a large palace in the city from which there was access to a garden which at this period of the year was green bright and shady and which as being in the centre of a city was large and luxurious from one end of the house there projected a covered terrace or loggia in which there were chairs and tables sculptured ornaments busts and old monumental relics let into the wall in profusion it was half chamber and half gardensuch an adjunct to a house as in our climate would give only an idea of cold rheumatism and a false romance but under an italian sky is a luxury daily to be enjoyed during most months of the year here mr glascock and caroline had passed many hoursand here they were now seated late in the evening while all others of the family were away as far as regarded the rooms occupied by the american minister they had the house and garden to themselves and there never could come a time more appropriate for the saying of a thing difficult to be said mr glascock had heard from his fathers physician and had said that it was nearly certain now that he need not go down to naples again before his marriage caroline was trembling not knowing how to speak not knowing how to beginbut resolved that the thing should be done he will never know you carry said mr glascock it is perhaps hardly a sorrow to me but it is a regret  it would have been a sorrow perhaps to him had he been able to know me said she taking the opportunity of rushing at her subject  why so of all human beings he was the softesthearted  not softerhearted than you charles but soft hearts have to be hardened  what do you mean am i becoming obdurate  i am charles she said i have got something to say to you what will your uncles and aunts and your mothers relations say of me when they see me at monkhams  they will swear to me that you are charming and thenwhen my back is turnedtheyll pick you to pieces a little among themselves i believe that is the way of the world and i dont suppose that we are to do better than others  and if you had married an english girl a lady augusta somebodywould they pick her to pieces  i guess they would as you say  just the same  i dont think anybody escapes as far as i can see but that wont prevent their becoming your bosom friends in a few weeks time  no one will say that you have been wrong to marry an american girl  now carry what is the meaning of all this  do you know any man in your position who ever did marry an american girlany man of your rank in england mr glascock began to think of the case and could not at the moment remember any instance charles i do not think you ought to be the first  and yet somebody must be first if the thing is ever to be doneand i am too old to wait on the chance of being the second  she felt that at the rate she was now progressing she would only run from one little suggestion to another and that he either wilfully or in sheer simplicity would take such suggestions simply as jokes and she was aware that she lacked the skill to bring the conversation round gradually to the point which she was bound to reach she must make another dash let it be ever so sudden her mode of doing so would be crude uglyalmost vulgar she feared but she would attain her object and say what she had to say when once she had warmed herself with the heat which argument would produce then she was pretty sure she would find herself at least as strong as he i dont know that the thing ought to be done at all she said during the last moment or two he had put his arm round her waist and she not choosing to bid him desist from embracing her but unwilling in her present mood to be embraced got up and stood before him i have thought and thought and thought and feel that it should not be done in marriage like should go to like she despised herself for using wallachias words but they fitted in so usefully that she could not refrain from them i was wrong not to know it before but it is better to know it now than not to have known it till too late everything that i hear and see tells me that it would be so if you were simply an englishman i would go anywhere with you but i am not fit to be the wife of an english lord the time would come when i should be a disgrace to you and then i should die  i think i should go near dying myself said he if you were a disgrace to me he had not risen from his chair and sat calmly looking up into her face  we have made a mistake and let us unmake it she continued i will always be your friend i will correspond with you i will come and see your wife  that will be very kind  charles if you laugh at me i shall be angry with you it is right that you should look to your future life as it is right that i should do so also do you think that i am joking do you suppose that i do not mean it  you have taken an extra dose this morning of wallachia petrie and of course you mean it  if you think that i am speaking her mind and not my own you do not know me  and what is it you propose he said still keeping his seat and looking calmly up into her face  simply that our engagement should be over  and why  because it is not a fitting one for you to have made i did not understand it before but now i do it will not be good for you to marry an american girl it will not add to your happiness and may destroy it i have learned at last to know how much higher is your position than mine  and i am to be supposed to know nothing about it  your fault is only thisthat you have been too generous i can be generous also  now look here caroline you must not be angry with me if on such a subject i speak plainly you must not even be angry if i laugh a little  pray do not laugh at menot now  i must a little carry why am i to be supposed to be so ignorant of what concerns my own happiness and my own duties if you will not sit down i will get up and we will take a turn together he rose from his seat but they did not leave the covered terrace they moved on to the extremity and then he stood hemming her in against a marble table in the corner in making this rather wild proposition have you considered me at all  i have endeavoured to consider you and you only  and how have you done it by the aid of some misty farfetched ideas respecting english society for which you have no basis except your own dreamsand by the fantasies of a rabid enthusiast  she is not rabid said caroline earnestly other people think just the same  my dear there is only one person whose thinking on this subject is of any avail and i am that person of course i cant drag you into church to be married but practically you can not help yourself from being taken there now as there need be no question about our marriagewhich is a thing as good as done  it is not done at all said caroline  i feel quite satisfied you will not jilt me and as i shall insist on having the ceremony performed i choose to regard it as a certainty passing that by then i will go on to the results my uncles and aunts and cousins and the people you talk of were very reasonable folk when i last saw them and quite sufficiently alive to the fact that they had to regard me as the head of their family i do not doubt that we shall find them equally reasonable when we get home but should they be changed should there be any sign shewn that my choice of a wife had occasioned displeasuresuch displeasure would not affect you  but it would affect you  not at all in my own house i am masterand i mean to continue to be so you will be mistress there and the only fear touching such a position is that it may be recognised by others too strongly you have nothing to fear carry  it is of you i am thinking  nor have i what if some old women or even some young women should turn up their noses at the wife i have chosen because she has not been chosen from among their own countrywomen is that to be a cause of suffering to us can not we rise above thatlasting as it would do for a few weeks a month or two perhapssay a yeartill my caroline shall have made herself known i think that we are strong enough to live down a trouble so light he had come close to her as he was speaking and had again put his arm round her waist she tried to escape from his embracenot with persistency not with the strength which always suffices for a woman when the embrace is in truth a thing to be avoided but clutching at his fingers with hers pressing them rather than loosening their grasp no carry he continued we have got to go through with it now and we will try and make the best of it you may trust me that we shall not find it difficultnot at least on the ground of your present fears i can bear a heavier burden than you will bring upon me  i know that i ought to prove to you that i am right she said still struggling with his hand  and i know that you can prove nothing of the kind dearest it is fixed between us now and do not let us be so silly as to raise imaginary difficulties of course you would have to marry me even if there were cause for such fears if there were any great cause still the game would be worth the candle there could be no going back let the fear be what it might but there need be no fear if you will only love me she felt that he was altogether too strong for herthat she had mistaken his character in supposing that she could be more firm than he he was so strong that he treated her almost as a childand yet she loved him infinitely the better for so treating her of course she knew now that her objection whether true or unsubstantial could not avail as he stood with his arm round her she was powerless to contradict him in anything she had so far acknowledged this that she no longer struggled with him but allowed her hand to remain quietly within his if there was no going back from this bargain that had been madewhy then there was no need for combating and when he stooped over and kissed her lips she had not a word to say be good to me he said and tell me that i am right  you must be master i suppose whether you are right or wrong a man always thinks himself entitled to his own way  why yes when he has won the battle he claims his captive now the truth is this i have won the battle and your friend miss petrie has lost it i hope she will understand that she has been beaten at last out of the field as he said this he heard a step behind them and turning round saw wallachia there almost before he could drop his arm  i am sorry that i have intruded on you she said very grimly  not in the least said mr glascock caroline and i have had a little dispute but we have settled it without coming to blows  i do not suppose that an english gentleman ever absolutely strikes a lady said wallachia petrie  not except on strong provocation said mr glascock in reference to wives a stick is allowed as big as your thumb  i have heard that it is so by the laws of england said wallachia  how can you be so ridiculous wally said caroline there is nothing that you would not believe  i hope that it may never be true in your case said wallachia  a couple of days after this miss spalding found that it was absolutely necessary that she should explain the circumstances of her position to nora she had left nora with the purpose of performing a very highminded action of sacrificing herself for the sake of her lover of giving up all her golden prospects and of becoming once again the bosom friend of wallachia petrie with this simple consolation for her future lifethat she had refused to marry an english nobleman because the english noblemans condition was unsuited to her it would have been an episode in female life in which pride might be takenbut all that was now changed she had made her little attempthad made it as she felt in a very languid manner and had found herself treated as a child for doing so of course she was happy in her ill success of course she would have been brokenhearted had she succeeded but nevertheless she was somewhat lowered in her own esteem and it was necessary that she should acknowledge the truth to the friend whom she had consulted a day or two had passed before she found herself alone with nora but when she did so she confessed her failure at once  you told him all then said nora  oh yes i told him all that is i could not really tell him when the moment came i had no words  and what did he say  he had words enough i never knew him to be eloquent before  he can speak out if he likes said nora  so i have foundwith a vengeance nobody was ever so put down as i was dont you know that there are times when it does not seem to be worth your while to put out your strength against an adversary so it was with him he just told me that he was my master and that i was to do as he bade me  and what did you say  i promised to be a good girl said caroline and not to pretend to have any opinion of my own ever again and so we kissed and were friends  i dare say there was a kiss my dear  of course there wasand he held me in his arms and comforted me and told me how to behavejust as you would do a little girl its all over now of course and if there be a mistake it is his fault i feel that all responsibility is gone from myself and that for all the rest of my life i have to do just what he tells me  and what says the divine wallachia  poor wally she says nothing but she thinks that i am a castaway and a recreant i am a recreant i knowbut yet i think that i was right i know i could not help myself  of course you were right my dear said the sage nora if you had the notion in your head it was wise to get rid of it but i knew how it would be when you spoke to him  you were not so weak when he came to you  that was altogether another thing it was not arranged in heaven that i was to become his captive  after that wallachia petrie never again tried her influence on her former friend but admitted to herself that the evil was done and that it could not be remedied according to her theory of life caroline spalding had been wrong and weakhad shewn herself to be comfortloving and luxuriouslyminded had looked to get her happiness from soft effeminate pleasures rather than from rational work and the useful independent exercise of her own intelligence in the privacy of her little chamber wallachia petrie shednot absolute tearsbut many tearful thoughts over her friend it was to her a thing very terrible that the chosen one of her heart should prefer the career of an english lords wife to that of an american citizeness with all manner of capability for female voting female speechmaking female poetising and perhaps female political action before her it was a thousand pities you may take a horse to watersaid wallachia to herself thinking of the everfreshly springing fountain of her own mind at which caroline spalding would always have been made welcome freely to quench her thirstbut you cannot make him drink if he be not athirst in the future she would have no friend never again would she subject herself to the disgrace of such a failure but the sacrifice was to be made and she knew that it was bootless to waste her words further on caroline spalding she left florence before the wedding and returned alone to the land of liberty she wrote a letter to caroline explaining her conduct and caroline spalding shewed the letter to her husbandas one that was both loving and eloquent  very loving and very eloquent he said but nevertheless one does think of sour grapes  there i am sure you wrong her said caroline     chapter lxxxii  mrs frenchs carving knife   during these days there were terrible doings at exeter camilla had sworn that if mr gibson did not come to there should be a tragedy and it appeared that she was inclined to keep her word immediately after the receipt of her letter from mr gibson she had had an interview with that gentleman in his lodgings and had asked him his intentions he had taken measures to fortify himself against such an attack but whatever those measures were camilla had broken through them she had stood before him as he sat in his armchair and he had been dumb in her presence it had perhaps been well for him that the eloquence of her indignation had been so great that she had hardly been able to pause a moment for a reply will you take your letter back again she had said i should be wrong to do that he had lisped out in reply because it is true as a christian minister i could not stand with you at the altar with a lie in my mouth in no other way did he attempt to excuse himselfbut that twice repeated filled up all the pause which she made for him      illustration camillas wrath   there never had been such a case beforeso impudent so cruel so gross so uncalled for so unmanly so unnecessary so unjustifiable so damnableso sure of eternal condemnation all this she said to him with loud voice and clenched fist and starting eyesregardless utterly of any listeners on the stairs or of outside passers in the street in very truth she was moved to a sublimity of indignation her low nature became nearly poetic under the wrong inflicted upon her she was almost tempted to tear him with her hands and inflict upon him at the moment some terrible vengeance which should be told of for ever in the annals of exeter a man so mean as he so weak so cowardly one so little of a herothat he should dare to do it and dare to sit there before her and to say that he would do it your gown shall be torn off your back sir and the very boys of exeter shall drag you through the gutters to this threat he said nothing but sat mute hiding his face in his hands and now tell me this siris there anything between you and bella but there was no voice in reply answer my question sir i have a right to ask it still he said not a word listen to me sooner than that you and she should be man and wife i would stab her yes i wouldyou poor paltry lying cowardly creature she remained with him for more than half an hour and then banged out of the room flashing back a look of scorn at him as she went martha before that day was over had learned the whole story from mr gibsons cook and had told her mistress  i did not think he had so much spirit in him was miss stanburys answer throughout exeter the great wonder arising from the crisis was the amount of spirit which had been displayed by mr gibson  when he was left alone he shook himself and began to think that if there were danger that such interviews might occur frequently he had better leave exeter for good as he put his hand over his forehead he declared to himself that a very little more of that kind of thing would kill him when a couple of hours had passed over his head he shook himself again and sat down and wrote a letter to his intended motherinlaw      i do not mean to complain he said god knows i have    no right but i cannot stand a repetition of what has    occurred just now if your younger daughter comes to see    me again i must refuse to see her and shall leave the    town i am ready to make what reparation may be possible    for the mistake into which i have fallen     t g   mrs french was no doubt much afraid of her younger daughter but she was less afraid of her than were other people familiarity they say breeds contempt and who can be so familiar with a child as its parent she did not in her heart believe that camilla would murder anybody and she fully realised the conviction that even after all that was come and gone it would be better that one of her daughters should have a husband than that neither should be so blessed if only camilla could be got out of exeter for a few monthshow good a thing it would be for them all she had a brother in gloucesterif only he could be got to take camilla for a few months and then too she knew that if the true rights of her two daughters were strictly and impartially examined arabellas claim was much stronger than any that camilla could put forward to the hand of mr gibson  you must not go there again camilla the mother said  i shall go whenever i please replied the fury  now camilla we may as well understand each other i will not have it done if i am provoked i will send to your uncle at gloucester now the uncle at gloucester was a timber merchant a man with protuberant eyes and a great square chinknown to be a very stern man indeed and not at all afraid of young women  what do i care for my uncle my uncle would take my part  no he would not the truth is camilla you interfered with bella first  mamma how dare you say so  you did my dear and these are the consequences  and you mean to say that she is to be mrs gibson  i say nothing about that but i do not see why they shouldnt be married if their hearts are inclined to each other  i will die first  your dying has nothing to do with it camilla  and i will kill her  if you speak to me again in that way i will write to your uncle at gloucester i have done the best i could for you both and i will not bear such treatment  and how am i treated  you should not have interfered with your sister  you are all in a conspiracy together shouted camilla you are there never was anybody so badly treatednevernevernever what will everybody say of me  they will pity you if you will be quiet  i dont want to be pitiedi wont be pitied i wish i could dieand i will die anybody else would at any rate have had their mother and sister with them then she burst into a flood of real true womanly tears  after this there was a lull at heavitree for a few days camilla did not speak to her sister but she condescended to hold some intercourse with her mother and to take her meals at the family table she did not go out of the house but she employed herself in her own room doing no one knew what with all that new clothing and household gear which was to have been transferred in her train to mr gibsons house mrs french was somewhat uneasy about the new clothing and household gear feeling that in the event of bellas marriage at least a considerable portion of it must be transferred to the new bride but it was impossible at the present moment to open such a subject to camillait would have been as a proposition to a lioness respecting the taking away of her whelps nevertheless the day must soon come in which something must be said about the clothing and household gear all the property that had been sent into the house at camillas orders could not be allowed to remain as camillas perquisites now that camilla was not to be married do you know what she is doing my dear said mrs french to her elder daughter  perhaps she is picking out the marks said bella  i dont think she would do that as yet said mrs french  she might just as well leave it alone said bella feeling that one of the two letters would do for her but neither of them dared to speak to her of her occupation in these first days of her despair  mr gibson in the meantime remained at home or only left his house to go to the cathedral or to visit the narrow confines of his little parish when he was out he felt that everybody looked at him and it seemed to him that people whispered about him when they saw him at his usual desk in the choir his friends passed him merely bowing to him and he was aware that he had done that which would be regarded by every one around him as unpardonable and yetwhat ought he to have done he acknowledged to himself that he had been very foolish madquite demented at the momentwhen he allowed himself to think it possible that he should marry camilla french but having found out how mad he had been at that moment having satisfied himself that to live with her as his wife would be impossible was he not right to break the engagement could anything be so wicked as marrying a woman whom hehated thus he tried to excuse himself but yet he knew that all the world would condemn him life in exeter would be impossible if no way to social pardon could be opened for him he was willing to do anything within bounds in mitigation of his offence he would give up fifty pounds a year to camilla for his lifeor he would marry bella yes he would marry bella at onceif camilla would only consent and give up that idea of stabbing some one bella french was not very nice in his eyes but she was quiet he thought and it might be possible to live with her nevertheless he told himself over and over again that the manner in which unmarried men with incomes were set upon by ladies in want of husbands was very disgraceful to the country at large that mission to natal which had once been offered to him would have had charms for him now of which he had not recognised the force when he rejected it  do you think that he ever was really engaged to her dorothy said to her aunt dorothy was now living in a seventh heaven of happiness writing loveletters to brooke burgess every other day and devoting to this occupation a number of hours of which she ought to have been ashamed making her purchases for her weddingwith nothing however of the magnificence of a camillabut discussing everything with her aunt who urged her on to extravagances which seemed beyond the scope of her own economical ideas settling or trying to settle little difficulties which perplexed her somewhat and wondering at her own career she could not of course be married without the presence of her mother and sister and her auntwith something of a grim courtesyhad intimated that they should be made welcome to the house in the close for the special occasion but nothing had been said about hugh the wedding was to be in the cathedral and dorothy had a little scheme in her head for meeting her brother among the aisles he would no doubt come down with brooke and nothing perhaps need be said about it to aunt stanbury but still it was a trouble her aunt had been so good that dorothy felt that no step should be taken which would vex the old woman it was evident enough that when permission had been given for the visit of mrs stanbury and priscilla hughs name had been purposely kept back there had been no accidental omission dorothy therefore did not dare to mention itand yet it was essential for her happiness that he should be there at the present moment miss stanburys intense interest in the stanbury wedding was somewhat mitigated by the excitement occasioned by mr gibsons refusal to be married dorothy was so shocked that she could not bring herself to believe the statement that had reached them through martha  of course he was engaged to her we all knew that said miss stanbury  i think there must have been some mistake said dorothy i dont see how he could do it  there is no knowing what people can do my dear when theyre hard driven i suppose we shall have a lawsuit now and hell have to pay ever so much money well well well see what a deal of trouble you might have saved  but hed have done the same to me auntonly you know i never could have taken him isnt it better as it is aunt tell me  i suppose young women always think it best when they can get their own ways an old woman like me has only got to do what she is bid  but this was best auntwas it not  my dear youve had your way and let that be enough poor camilla french is not allowed to have hers at all dear dear dear i didnt think the man would ever have been such a fool to begin withor that he would ever have had the heart to get out of it afterwards it astonished dorothy to find that her aunt was not loud in reprobation of mr gibsons very dreadful conduct  in the meantime mrs french had written to her brother at gloucester the maidservant in making miss camillas bed and in putting the room to rights as she called itwhich description probably was intended to cover the circumstances of an accurate searchhad discovered hidden among some linena carving knife such a knife as is used for the cutting up of fowls and after two days interval had imparted the discovery to mrs french instant visit was made to the pantry and it was found that a very aged but unbroken and sharplypointed weapon was missing mrs french at once accused camilla and camilla after some hesitation admitted that it might be there molly she said was a nasty sly wicked thing to go looking in her drawers and she would never leave anything unlocked again the knife she declared had been taken upstairs because she had wanted something very sharp to cutthe bones of her stays the knife was given up but mrs french thought it best to write to her brother mr crump she was in great doubt about sundry matters had the carving knife really pointed to a domestic tragedyand if so what steps ought a poor widow to take with such a daughter and what ought to be done about mr gibson it ran through mrs frenchs mind that unless something were done at once mr gibson would escape scot free it was her wish that he should yet become her soninlaw poor bella was entitled to her chance but if bella was to be disappointedfrom fear of carving knives or for other reasonsthen there came the question whether mr gibson should not be made to pay in purse for the mischief he had done with all these thoughts and doubts running through her head mrs french wrote to her brother at gloucester  there came back an answer from mr crump in which that gentleman expressed a very strong idea that mr gibson should be prosecuted for damages with the utmost virulence and with the least possible delay no compromise should be accepted mr crump would himself come to exeter and see the lawyer as soon as he should be told that there was a lawyer to be seen as to the carving knife mr crump was of opinion that it did not mean anything mr crump was a gentleman who did not believe in strong romance but who had great trust in all pecuniary claims the frenches had always been genteel the late captain french had been an officer in the army and at ordinary times and seasons the frenches were rather ashamed of the crump connection but now the timber merchant might prove himself to be a useful friend  mrs french shewed her brothers letter to bellaand poor bella was again sorehearted seeing that nothing was said in it of her claims it will be dreadful scandal to have it all in the papers said bella  but what can we do  anything would be better than that said bella and you dont want to punish mr gibson mamma  but my dear you see what your uncle says what can i do except go to him for advice  why dont you go to mr gibson yourself mamma  but nothing was said to camilla about mr crumpnothing as yet camilla did not love mr crump but there was no other house except that of mr crumps at gloucester to which she might be sent if it could be arranged that mr gibson and bella should be made one mrs french took her eldest daughters advice and went to mr gibsontaking mr crumps letter in her pocket for herself she wanted nothingbut was it not the duty of her whole life to fight for her daughters poor woman if somebody would only have taught her how that duty might best be done she would have endeavoured to obey the teaching you know i do not want to threaten you she said to mr gibson but you see what my brother says of course i wrote to my brother what could a poor woman do in such circumstances except write to her brother  if you choose to set the bloodhounds of the law at me of course you can said mr gibson  i do not want to go to law at allgod knows i do not said mrs french then there was a pause poor dear bella ejaculated mrs french  dear bella echoed mr gibson  what do you mean to do about bella asked mrs french  i sometimes think that i had better take poison and have done with it said mr gibson feeling himself to be very hard pressed     chapter lxxxiii  bella victrix   mr crump arrived at exeter camilla was not told of his coming till the morning of the day on which he arrived and then the tidings were communicated because it was necessary that a change should be made in the bedrooms she and her sister had separate rooms when there was no visitor with them but now mr crump must be accommodated there was a long consultation between bella and mrs french but at last it was decided that bella should sleep with her mother there would still be too much of the lioness about camilla to allow of her being regarded as a safe companion through the watches of the night why is uncle jonas coming now she asked  i thought it better to ask him said mrs french  after a long pause camilla asked another question does uncle jonas mean to see mr gibson  i suppose he will said mrs french  then he will see a low mean fellowthe lowest meanest fellow that ever was heard of but that wont make much difference to uncle jonas i wouldnt have him now if he was to ask me ever sothat i wouldnt  mr crump came and kissed his sister and two nieces the embrace with camilla was not very affectionate so your joe has been and jilted you said uncle jonasits like one of them clergymen they say so many prayers they think they may do almost anything afterwards another man would have had his head punched  the less talk there is about it the better said camilla  on the following day mr crump called by appointment on mr gibson and remained closeted with that gentleman for the greater portion of the morning camilla knew well that he was going and went about the house like a perturbed spirit during his absence there was a look about her that made them all doubt whether she was not in truth losing her mind her mother more than once went to the pantry to see that the knives were right and as regarded that sharppointed weapon was careful to lock it up carefully out of her daughters way mr crump had declared himself willing to take camilla back to gloucester and had laughed at the obstacles which his niece might perhaps throw in the way of such an arrangement she mustnt have much luggagethat is all said mr crump for mr crump had been made aware of the circumstances of the trousseau about three oclock mr crump came back from mr gibsons and expressed a desire to be left alone with camilla mrs french was prepared for everything and mr crump soon found himself with his younger niece  camilla my dear said he this has been a bad business  i dont know what business you mean uncle jonas  yes you do my dearyou know and i hope it wont come too late to prove to you that young women shouldnt be too keen in setting their caps at the gentlemen its better for them to be hunted than to hunt  uncle jonas i will not be insulted  stick to that my dear and you wont get into a scrape again now look here this man can never be made to marry you anyhow  i wouldnt touch him with a pair of tongs if he were kneeling at my feet  thats right stick to that of course you wouldnt now after all that has come and gone no girl with any spirit would  hes a coward and a thief and hell bedamned for what he has done some of these days  tch tch tch that isnt a proper way for a young lady to talk thats cursing and swearing  it isnt cursing and swearingits what the bible says  then well leave him to the bible in the meantime mr gibson wants to marry some one else and that cant hurt you  he may marry whom he likesbut he shant marry bellathats all  it is bella that he means to marry  then he wont ill forbid the banns ill write to the bishop ill go to the church and prevent its being done ill make such a noise in the town that it cant be done its no use your looking at me like that uncle jonas ive got my own feelings and he shall never marry bella its what they have been intending all through and it shant be done  it will be done  uncle jonas ill stab her to the heart and him too before ill see it done though i were to be killed the next day i would could you bear it  im not a young woman now ill tell you what i want you to do  ill not do anything  just pack up your things and start with me to gloucester tomorrow  iwont  then youll be carried my dear ill write to your aunt to say that youre coming and well be as jolly as possible when we get you home  i wont go to gloucester uncle jonas i wont go away from exeter i wont let it be done she shall never never never be that mans wife  nevertheless on the day but one after this camilla french did go to gloucester before she went however things had to be done in that house which almost made mrs french repent that she had sent for so stern an assistant camilla was at last told in so many words that the things which she had prepared for her own wedding must be given up for the wedding of her sister and it seemed that this item in the list of her sorrows troubled her almost more than any other she swore that whither she went there should go the dresses and the handkerchiefs and the hats the bonnets and the boots let her have them bella had pleaded but mr crump was inexorable he had looked into his sisters affairs and found that she was already in debt to his practical mind it was an absurdity that the unmarried sister should keep things that were wholly unnecessary and that the sister that was to be married should be without things that were needed there was a big trunk of which camilla had the key but which unfortunately for her had been deposited in her mothers room upon this she sat and swore that nothing should move her but a promise that her plunder should remain untouched but there came this advantage from the terrible question of the wedding raimentsthat in her energy to keep possession of them she gradually abandoned her opposition to her sisters marriage she had been driven from one point to another till she was compelled at last to stand solely upon her possessions perhaps we had better let her keep them said mrs french trash and nonsense said mr crump if she wants a new frock let her have it as for the sheets and tablecloths youd better keep them yourself but bella must have the rest  it was found on the eve of the day on which she was told that she was to depart that she had in truth armed herself with a dagger or clasp knife she actually displayed it when her uncle told her to come away from the chest on which she was sitting she declared that she would defend herself there to the last gasp of her life but of course the knife fell from her hand the first moment that she was touched i did think once that she was going to make a poke at me mr crump said afterwards but she had screamed herself so weak that she couldnt do it  when the morning came she was taken to the fly and driven to the station without any further serious outbreak she had even condescended to select certain articles leaving the rest of the hymeneal wealth behind her bella early on that morning of departure with great humility implored her sister to forgive her but no entreaties could induce camilla to address one gracious word to the proposed bride youve been cheating me all along she said and that was the last word she spoke to poor bella  she went and the field was once more open to the amorous vicar of st peterscumpumpkin it is astonishing how the greatest difficulties will sink away and become as it were nothing when they are encountered face to face it is certain that mr gibsons position had been one most trying to the nerves he had speculated on various modes of escapea curacy in the north of england would be welcome or the duties of a missionary in new zealandor death to tell the truth he had during the last week or two contemplated even a return to the dominion of camilla that there should ever again be things pleasant for him in exeter seemed to be quite impossible and yet on the evening of the day but one after the departure of camilla he was seated almost comfortably with his own arabella there is nothing that a man may not do nothing that he may not achieve if he have only pluck enough to go through with it  you do love me bella said to him it was natural that she should ask him but it would have been better perhaps if she had held her tongue had she spoken to him about his house or his income or the servants or the duties of his parish church it would have been easier for him to make a comfortable reply  yesi love you he replied of course i love you we have always been friends and i hope things will go straight now i have had a great deal to go through bella and so have youbut god will temper the wind to the shorn lambs how was the wind to be tempered for the poor lamb who had gone forth shorn down to the very skin  soon after this mrs french returned to the room and then there was no more romance mrs french had by no means forgiven mr gibson all the trouble he had brought into the family and mixed a certain amount of acrimony with her entertainment of him she dictated to him treated him with but scant respect and did not hesitate to let him understand that he was to be watched very closely till he was actually and absolutely married the poor man had in truth no further idea of escape he was aware that he had done that which made it necessary that he should bear a great deal and that he had no right to resent suspicion when a day was fixed in june on which he should be married at the church of heavitree and it was proposed that he should be married by banns he had nothing to urge to the contrary and when it was also suggested to him by one of the prebendaries of the cathedral that it might be well for him to change his clerical duties for a period with the vicar of a remote parish in the north of cornwallso as to be out of the way of remark from those whom he had scandalised by his conducthe had no objection to make to that arrangement when mrs machugh met him in the close and told him that he was a gay lothario he shook his head with a melancholy selfabasement and passed on without even a feeling of anger when they smite me on the right cheek i turn unto them my left he said to himself when one of the cathedral vergers remarked to him that after all he was going to be married at last even bella became dominant over him and assumed with him occasionally the air of one who had been injured  bella wrote a touching letter to her sistera letter that ought to have touched camilla begging for forgiveness and for one word of sisterly love camilla answered the letter but did not send a word of sisterly love according to my way of thinking you have been a nasty sly thing and i dont believe youll ever be happy as for him ill never speak to him again that was nearly the whole of her letter you must leave it to time said mrs french wisely shell come round some day and then mrs french thought how bad it would be for her if the daughter who was to be her future companion did not come round some day  and so it was settled that they should be married in heavitree churchmr gibson and his first loveand things went on pretty much as though nothing had been done amiss the gentleman from cornwall came down to take mr gibsons place at st peterscumpumpkin while his duties in the cathedral were temporarily divided among the other priestvicarswith some amount of grumbling on their part bella commenced her modest preparations without any of the éclat which had attended camillas operations but she felt more certainty of ultimate success than had ever fallen to camillas lot in spite of all that had come and gone bella never feared again that mr gibson would be untrue to her in regard to him it must be doubted whether nemesis ever fell upon him with a hand sufficiently heavy to punish him for the great sins which he had manifestly committed he had encountered a bad week or two and there had been days in which as has been said he thought of natal of ecclesiastical censures and even of annihilation but no real punishment seemed to fall upon him it may be doubted whether when the whole arrangement was settled for him and when he heard that camilla had yielded to the decrees of fate he did not rather flatter himself on being a successful man of intriguewhether he did not take some glory to himself for his good fortune with women and pride himself amidst his selfreproaches for the devotion which had been displayed for him by the fair sex in general it is quite possible that he taught himself to believe that at one time dorothy stanbury was devotedly in love with him and that when he reckoned up his sins she was one of those in regard to whom he accounted himself to have been a sinner the spirit of intrigue with women as to which men will flatter themselves is customarily so vile so mean so vapid a reflection of a feeling so aimless resultless and utterly unworthy passion exists and has its sway vice has its votariesand there is too that wornout longing for vice prurient yet passionless coldstudied lewdness which drags on a feeble continuance with the aid of money but the commonest folly of man in regard to women is a weak taste for intrigue with little or nothing on which to feed ita worse than feminine aptitude for male coquetry which never ascends beyond a desire that somebody shall hint that there is something peculiar and which is shocked and retreats backwards into its boots when anything like a consequence forces itself on the apprehension such men have their glory in their own estimation we remember how falstaff flouted the pride of his companion whose victory in the fields of love had been but little glorious but there are victories going nowadays so infinitely less glorious that falstaffs page was a lothario a very don juan in comparison with the heroes whose praises are too often sung by their own lips there is this recompensethat their defeats are always sung by lips louder than their own mr gibson when he found that he was to escape apparently unscathedthat people standing respectably before the world absolutely dared to whisper words to him of congratulation on this third attempt at marriage within little more than a year took pride to himself and bethought himself that he was a gay deceiver he believed that he had selected his wifeand that he had done so in circumstances of peculiar difficulty poor mr gibsonwe hardly know whether most to pity him or the unfortunate poor woman who ultimately became mrs gibson  and so bella french is to be the fortunate woman after all said miss stanbury to her niece  it does seem to me to be so odd said dorothy i wonder how he looked when he proposed it  like a foolas he always does  dorothy refrained from remarking that miss stanbury had not always thought that mr gibson looked like a fool but the idea occurred to her mind i hope they will be happy at last she said  pshaw such people cant be happy and cant be unhappy i dont suppose it much matters which he marries or whether he marries them both or neither they are to be married by banns they sayat heavitree  i dont see anything bad in that  only camilla might step out and forbid them said aunt stanbury i almost wish she would  she has gone away auntto an uncle who lives at gloucester  it was well to get her out of the way no doubt theyll be married before you now dolly  that wont break my heart aunt  i dont suppose therell be much of a wedding they havent anybody belonging to them except that uncle at gloucester then there was a pause i think it is a nice thing for friends to collect together at a wedding continued aunt stanbury  i think it is said dorothy in the mildest softest voice  i suppose we must make room for that black sheep of a brother of yours dollyor else you wont be contented  dear dear dearest aunt said dorothy falling down on her knees at her aunts feet     chapter lxxxiv  selfsacrifice      illustration  trevelyan when his wife had left him sat for hours in silence pondering over his own position and hers he had taken his child to an upper room in which was his own bed and the boys cot and before he seated himself he spread out various toys which he had been at pains to purchase for the unhappy little fellowa regiment of garibaldian soldiers all with red shirts and a drum to give the regiment martial spirit and a soft fluffy italian ball and a battledore and a shuttlecockinstruments enough for juvenile joy if only there had been a companion with whom the child could use them but the toys remained where the father had placed them almost unheeded and the child sat looking out of the window melancholy silent and repressed even the drum did not tempt him to be noisy doubtless he did not know why he was wretched but he was fully conscious of his wretchedness in the meantime the father sat motionless in an old wornout but once handsome leathern armchair with his eyes fixed against the opposite wall thinking of the wreck of his life  thought deep correct continued and energetic is quite compatible with madness at this time trevelyans mind was so far unhinged his ordinary faculties were so greatly impaired that they who declared him to be mad were justified in their declaration his condition was such that the happiness and welfare of no human beingnot even his owncould safely be entrusted to his keeping he considered himself to have been so injured by the world to have been the victim of so cruel a conspiracy among those who ought to have been his friends that there remained nothing for him but to flee away from them and remain in solitude but yet through it all there was something approaching to a conviction that he had brought his misery upon himself by being unlike to other men and he declared to himself over and over again that it was better that he should suffer than that others should be punished when he was alone his reflections respecting his wife were much juster than were his words when he spoke either with her or to others of her conduct he would declare to himself not only that he did not believe her to have been false to him but that he had never accused her of such crime he had demanded from her obedience and she had been disobedient it had been incumbent upon himso ran his own ideas as expressed to himself in these long unspoken soliloquiesto exact obedience or at least compliance let the consequences be what they might she had refused to obey or even to comply and the consequences were very grievous but though he pitied himself with a pity that was feminine yet he acknowledged to himself that her conduct had been the result of his own moody temperament every friend had parted from him all those to whose counsels he had listened had counselled him that he was wrong the whole world was against him had he remained in england the doctors and lawyers among them would doubtless have declared him to be mad he knew all this and yet he could not yield he could not say that he had been wrong he could not even think that he had been wrong as to the cause of the great quarrel he was one so miserable and so unfortunateso he thoughtthat even in doing right he had fallen into perdition  he had had two enemies and between them they had worked his ruin these were colonel osborne and bozzle it may be doubted whether he did not hate the latter the more strongly of the two he knew now that bozzle had been untrue to him but his disgust did not spring from that so much as from the feeling that he had defiled himself by dealing with the man though he was quite assured that he had been right in his first cause of offence he knew that he had fallen from bad to worse in every step that he had taken since colonel osborne had marred his happiness by vanity by wicked intrigue by a devilish delight in doing mischief but he he himself had consummated the evil by his own folly why had he not taken colonel osborne by the throat instead of going to a lowborn vile mercenary spy for assistance he hated himself for what he had doneand yet it was impossible that he should yield  it was impossible that he should yieldbut it was yet open to him to sacrifice himself he could not go back to his wife and say that he was wrong but he could determine that the destruction should fall upon him and not upon her if he gave up his child and then dieddied alone without any friend near him with no word of love in his ears in that solitary and miserable abode which he had found for himselfthen it would at least be acknowledged that he had expiated the injury that he had done she would have his wealth his name his child to comfort herand would be troubled no longer by demands for that obedience which she had sworn at the altar to give him and which she had since declined to render to him perhaps there was some feeling that the coals of fire would be hot upon her head when she should think how much she had received from him and how little she had done for him and yet he loved her with all his heart and would even yet dream of bliss that might be possible with herhad not the terrible hand of irresistible fate come between them and marred it all it was only a dream now it could be no more than a dream he put out his thin wasted hands and looked at them and touched the hollowness of his own cheeks and coughed that he might hear the hacking sound of his own infirmity and almost took glory in his weakness it could not be long before the coals of fire would be heaped upon her head  louey he said at last addressing the child who had sat for an hour gazing through the window without stirring a limb or uttering a sound louey my boy would you like to go back to mamma the child turned round on the floor and fixed his eyes on his fathers face but made no immediate reply louey dear come to papa and tell him would it be nice to go back to mamma and he stretched out his hand to the boy louey got up and approached slowly and stood between his fathers knees tell me darlingyou understand what papa says  altro said the boy who had been long enough among italian servants to pick up the common words of the language of course he would like to go back how indeed could it be otherwise  then you shall go to her louey  today papa  not today nor tomorrow  but the day after  that is sufficient you shall go it is not so bad with you that one day more need be a sorrow to you you shall goand then you will never see your father again trevelyan as he said this drew his hands away so as not to touch the child the little fellow had put out his arm but seeing his fathers angry gesture had made no further attempt at a caress he feared his father from the bottom of his little heart and yet was aware that it was his duty to try to love papa he did not understand the meaning of that last threat but slunk back passing his untouched toys to the window and there seated himself again filling his mind with the thought that when two more long long days should have crept by he should once more go to his mother  trevelyan had tried his best to be soft and gentle to his child all that he had said to his wife of his treatment of the boy had been true to the letter he had spared no personal trouble he had done all that he had known how to do he had exercised all his intelligence to procure amusement for the boybut louey had hardly smiled since he had been taken from his mother and now that he was told that he was to go and never see his father again the tidings were to him simply tidings of joy there is a curse upon me said trevelyan it is written down in the book of my destiny that nothing shall ever love me  he went out from the house and made his way down by the narrow path through the olives and vines to the bottom of the hill in front of the villa it was evening now but the evening was very hot and though the olive trees stood in long rows there was no shade quite at the bottom of the hill there was a little sluggish muddy brook along the sides of which the reeds grew thickly and the dragonflies were playing on the water there was nothing attractive in the spot but he was weary and sat himself down on the dry hard bank which had been made by repeated clearing of mud from the bottom of the little rivulet he sat watching the dragonflies as they made their short flights in the warm air and told himself that of all gods creatures there was not one to whom less power of disporting itself in gods sun was given than to him surely it would be better for him that he should die than live as he was now living without any of the joys of life the solitude of casalunga was intolerable to him and yet there was no whither that he could go and find society he could travel if he pleased he had money at command and at any rate as yet there was no embargo on his personal liberty but how could he travel aloneeven if his strength might suffice for the work there had been moments in which he had thought that he would be happy in the love of his childthat the companionship of an infant would suffice for him if only the infant would love him but all such dreams as that were over to repay him for his tenderness his boy was always dumb before him louey would not prattle as he had used to do he would not even smile or give back the kisses with which his father had attempted to win him in mercy to the boy he would send him back to his motherin mercy to the boy if not to the mother also it was in vain that he should look for any joy in any quarter were he to return to england they would say that he was mad      illustration trevelyan at casalunga   he lay there by the brookside till the evening was far advanced and then he arose and slowly returned to the house the labour of ascending the hill was so great to him that he was forced to pause and hold by the olive trees as he slowly performed his task the perspiration came in profusion from his pores and he found himself to be so weak that he must in future regard the brook as being beyond the tether of his daily exercise eighteen months ago he had been a strong walker and the snowbound paths of swiss mountains had been a joy to him he paused as he was slowly dragging himself on and looked up at the wretched desolate comfortless abode which he called his home its dreariness was so odious to him that he was halfminded to lay himself down where he was and let the night air come upon him and do its worst in such case however some italian doctor would be sent down who would say that he was mad above all the things and to the last he must save himself from that degradation  when he had crawled up to the house he went to his child and found that the woman had put the boy to bed then he was angry with himself in that he himself had not seen to this and kept up his practice of attending the child to the last he would at least be true to his resolution and prepare for the boys return to his mother not knowing how otherwise to manage it he wrote that night the following note to mr glascock      casalunga thursday night     my dear sir     since you last were considerate enough to call upon me i    have resolved to take a step in my affairs which though    it will rob me of my only remaining gratification will    tend to lessen the troubles under which mrs trevelyan is    labouring if she desires it as no doubt she does i will    consent to place our boy again in her custodytrusting    to her sense of honour to restore him to me should i    demand it in my present unfortunate position i cannot    suggest that she should come for the boy i am unable to    support the excitement occasioned by her presence i will    however deliver up my darling either to you or to any    messenger sent by you whom i can trust i beg heartily    to apologise for the trouble i am giving you and to    subscribe myself yours very faithfully     louis trevelyan     the hon c glascock     psit is as well perhaps that i should explain that    i must decline to receive any visit from sir marmaduke    rowley sir marmaduke has insulted me grossly on each    occasion on which i have seen him since his return home     chapter lxxxv  the baths of lucca   june was now far advanced and the rowleys and the spaldings had removed from florence to the baths of lucca mr glascock had followed in their wake and the whole party were living at the baths in one of those hotels in which so many english and americans are wont to congregate in the early weeks of the italian summer the marriage was to take place in the last week of the month and all the party were to return to florence for the occasionwith the exception of sir marmaduke and mrs trevelyan she was altogether unfitted for wedding joys and her father had promised to bear her company when the others left her mr glascock and caroline spalding were to be married in florence and were to depart immediately from thence for some of the cooler parts of switzerland after that sir marmaduke and lady rowley were to return to london with their daughters preparatory to that dreary journey back to the mandarins and they had not even yet resolved what they had better do respecting that unfortunate man who was living in seclusion on the hilltop near siena they had consulted lawyers and doctors in florence but it had seemed that everybody there was afraid of putting the law in force against an englishman doubtless there was a law in respect to the custody of the insane and it was admitted that if trevelyan were dangerously mad something could be done but it seemed that nobody was willing to stir in such a case as that which now existed something it was said might be done at some future time but the difficulties were so great that nothing could be done now  it was very sad because it was necessary that some decision should be made as to the future residence of mrs trevelyan and of nora emily had declared that nothing should induce her to go to the islands with her father and mother unless her boy went with her since her journey to casalunga she had also expressed her unwillingness to leave her husband her heart had been greatly softened towards him and she had declared that where he remained there would she remainas near to him as circumstances would admit it might be that at last her care would be necessary for his comfort he supplied her with means of living and she would use these means as well as she might be able in his service  then there had arisen the question of noras future residence and there had come troubles and storms in the family nora had said that she would not go back to the mandarins but had not at first been able to say where or how she would live she had suggested that she might stay with her sister but her father had insisted that she could not live on the income supplied by trevelyan then when pressed hard she had declared that she intended to live on hugh stanburys income she would marry him at oncewith her fathers leave if she could get it but without it if it needs must be so her mother told her that hugh stanbury was not himself ready for her he had not even proposed so hasty a marriage nor had he any home fitted for her lady rowley in arguing this had expressed no assent to the marriage even as a distant arrangement but had thought thus to vanquish her daughter by suggesting small but insuperable difficulties on a sudden however lady rowley found that all this was turned against her by an offer that came direct from mr glascock his caroline he said was very anxious that nora should come to them at monkhams as soon as they had returned home from switzerland they intended to be there by the middle of august and would hurry there sooner if there was any intermediate difficulty about finding a home for nora mr glascock said nothing about hugh stanbury but of course lady rowley understood that nora had told all her troubles and hopes to caroline and that caroline had told them to her future husband lady rowley in answer to this could only say that she would consult her husband  there was something very grievous in the proposition to lady rowley if nora had not been selfwilled and stiffnecked beyond the usual selfwilledness and stiffneckedness of young women she might have been herself the mistress of monkhams it was proposed now that she should go there to wait till a poor man should have got together shillings enough to buy a few chairs and tables and a bed to lie upon the thought of this was very bitter i cannot think nora how you could have the heart to go there said lady rowley  i cannot understand why not mamma caroline and i are friends and surely he and i need not be enemies he has never injured me and if he does not take offence why should i  if you dont see it i cant help it said lady rowley  and then mrs spaldings triumph was terrible to lady rowley mrs spalding knew nothing of her future soninlaws former passion and spoke of her caroline as having achieved triumphs beyond the reach of other girls lady rowley bore it never absolutely telling the tale of her daughters fruitless victory she was too good at heart to utter the boastbut it was very hard to repress it upon the whole she would have preferred that mr glascock and his bride should not have become the fast friends of herself and her family there was more of pain than of pleasure in the alliance but circumstances had been too strong for her mr glascock had been of great use in reference to trevelyan and caroline and nora had become attached to each other almost on their first acquaintance here they were together at the baths of lucca and nora was to be one of the four bridesmaids when sir marmaduke was consulted about this visit to monkhams he became fretful and would give no answer the marriage he said was impossible and nora was a fool he could give her no allowance more than would suffice for her clothes and it was madness for her to think of stopping in england but he was so full of cares that he could come to no absolute decision on this matter nora however had come to a very absolute decision  caroline she said if you will have me i will go to monkhams  of course we will have you has not charles said how delighted he would be  oh yesyour charles said nora laughing  he is mine now dear you must not expect him to change his mind again i gave him the chance you know and he would not take it but nora come to monkhams and stay as long as it suits i have talked it all over with him and we both agree that you shall have a home there you shall be just like a sister olivia is coming too after a bit but he says there is room for a dozen sisters of course it will be all right with mr stanbury after a while and so it was settled among them that nora rowley should find a home at monkhams if a home in england should be wanted for her  it wanted but four days to that fixed for the marriage at florence and but six to that on which the rowleys were to leave italy for england when mr glascock received trevelyans letter it was brought to him as he was sitting at a late breakfast in the garden of the hotel and there were present at the moment not only all the spalding family but the rowleys also sir marmaduke was there and lady rowley and the three unmarried daughters but mrs trevelyan as was her wont had remained alone in her own room mr glascock read the letter and read it again without attracting much attention caroline who was of course sitting next to him had her eyes upon him and could see that the letter moved him but she was not curious and at any rate asked no question he himself understood fully how great was the offer madehow allimportant to the happiness of the poor motherand he was also aware or thought that he was aware how likely it might be that the offer would be retracted as regarded himself a journey from the baths at lucca to casalunga and back before his marriage would be a great infliction on his patience it was his plan to stay where he was till the day before his marriage and then to return to florence with the rest of the party all this must be altered and sudden changes must be made if he decided on going to siena himself the weather now was very hot and such a journey would be most disagreeable to him of course he had little schemes in his head little amatory schemes for prænuptial enjoyment which in spite of his mature years were exceedingly agreeable to him the chestnut woods round the baths of lucca are very pleasant in the early summer and there were excursions planned in which caroline would be close to his sidealmost already his wife but if he did not go whom could he send it would be necessary at least that he should consult her the mother of the child before any decision was formed  at last he took lady rowley aside and read to her the letter she understood at once that it opened almost a heaven of bliss to her daughterand she understood also how probable it might be that that wretched man with his shaken wits should change his mind i think i ought to go said mr glascock  but how can you go now  i can go said he there is time for it it need not put off my marriageto which of course i could not consent i do not know whom i could send  monnier could go said lady rowley naming the courier  yeshe could go but it might be that he would return without the child and then we should not forgive ourselves i will go lady rowley after all what does it signify i am a little old i sometimes think for this philandering you shall take this letter to your daughter and i will explain it all to caroline  caroline had not a word to say she could only kiss him and promise to make him what amends she could when he came back of course you are right she said do you think that i would say a word against it even though the marriage were to be postponed  i shoulda good many words but i will be back in time for that and will bring the boy with me  mrs trevelyan when her husbands letter was read to her was almost overcome by the feelings which it excited in her first paroxysm of joy she declared that she would herself go to siena not for her childs sake but for that of her husband she felt at once that the boy was being given up because of the fathers weaknessbecause he felt himself to be unable to be a protector to his sonand her womans heart was melted with softness as she thought of the condition of the man to whom she had once given her whole heart since then doubtless her heart had revolted from him since that time there had come hours in which she had almost hated him for his cruelty to her there had been moments in which she had almost cursed his name because of the aspersion which it had seemed that he had thrown upon her but this was now forgotten and she remembered only his weakness mamma she said i will go it is my duty to go to him but lady rowley withheld her explaining that were she to go the mission might probably fail in its express purpose let louey be sent to us first said lady rowley and then we will see what can be done afterwards  and so mr glascock started taking with him a maidservant who might help him with the charge of the child it was certainly very hard upon him in order to have time for his journey to siena and back and time also to go out to casalunga it was necessary that he should leave the baths at five in the morning if ever there was a hero of romance you are he said nora to him  the heroes of life are so much better than the heroes of romance said caroline  that is a lesson from the lips of the american browning said mr glascock nevertheless i think i would rather ride a charge against a paynim knight in palestine than get up at halfpast four in the morning  we will get up too and give the knight his coffee said nora they did get up and saw him off and when mr glascock and caroline parted with a lovers embrace nora stood by as a sister might have done let us hope that she remembered that her own time was coming  there had been a promise given by nora when she left london that she would not correspond with hugh stanbury while she was in italy and this promise had been kept it may be remembered that hugh had made a proposition to his ladylove that she should walk out of the house one fine morning and get herself married without any reference to her fathers or her mothers wishes but she had not been willing to take upon herself as yet independence so complete as this would have required she had assured her lover that she did mean to marry him some day even though it should be in opposition to her father but that she thought that the period for filial persuasion was not yet over and then in explaining all this to her mother she had given a promise neither to write nor to receive letters during the short period of her sojourn in italy she would be an obedient child for so longbut after that she must claim the right to fight her own battle she had told her lover that he must not write and of course she had not written a word herself but now when her mother threw it in her teeth that stanbury would not be ready to marry her she thought that an unfair advantage was being taken of herand of him how could he be expected to say that he was readydeprived as he was of the power of saying anything at all  mamma she said the day before they went to florence has papa fixed about your leaving england yet i suppose youll go now on the last saturday in july  i suppose we shall my dear  has not papa written about the berths  i believe he has my dear  because he ought to know who are going i will not go  you will not nora is that a proper way of speaking  dear mamma i mean it to be proper i hope it is proper but is it not best that we should understand each other all my life depends on my going or my staying now i must decide  after what has passed you do not i suppose mean to live in mr glascocks house  certainly not i mean to live withwithwith my husband mamma i promised not to write and i have not written and he has not writtenbecause i told him not therefore nothing is settled but it is not fair to throw it in my teeth that nothing is settled  i have thrown nothing in your teeth nora  papa talks sneeringly about chairs and tables of course i know what he is thinking of as i cannot go with him to the mandarins i think i ought to be allowed to look after the chairs and tables  what do you mean my dear  that you should absolve me from my promise and let me write to mr stanbury i do not want to be left without a home  you cannot wish to write to a gentleman and ask him to marry you  why not we are engaged i shall not ask him to marry methat is already settled but i shall ask him to make arrangements  your papa will be very angry if you break your word to him  i will write and show you the letter papa may see it and if he will not let it go it shall not go he shall not say that i broke my word but mamma i will not go out to the islands i should never get back again and i should be brokenhearted lady rowley had nothing to say to this and nora went and wrote her letter dear hugh the letter ran papa and mamma leave england on the last saturday in july i have told mamma that i cannot return with them of course you know why i stay mr glascock is to be married the day after tomorrow and they have asked me to go with them to monkhams some time in august i think i shall do so unless emily wants me to remain with her at any rate i shall try to be with her till i go there you will understand why i tell you all this papa and mamma know that i am writing it is only a business letter and therefore i shall say no more except that i am ever and always yoursnora there she said handing her letter to her mother i think that that ought to be sent if papa chooses to prevent its going he can  lady rowley when she handed the letter to her husband recommended that it should be allowed to go to its destination she admitted that if they sent it they would thereby signify their consent to her engagementand she alleged that nora was so strong in her will and that the circumstances of their journey out to the antipodes were so peculiar that it was of no avail for them any longer to oppose the match they could not force their daughter to go with them but i can cast her off from me if she be disobedient said sir marmaduke lady rowley however had no desire that her daughter should be cast off and was aware that sir marmaduke when it came to the point of casting off would be as little inclined to be stern as she was herself sir marmaduke still hoping that firmness would carry the day and believing that it behoved him to maintain his parental authority ended the discussion by keeping possession of the letter and saying that he would take time to consider the matter what security have we that he will ever marry her if she does stay he asked the next morning lady rowley had no doubt on this score and protested that her opposition to hugh stanbury arose simply from his want of income i should never be justified said sir marmaduke if i were to go and leave my girl as it were in the hands of a pennyaliner the letter in the end was not sent and nora and her father hardly spoke to each other as they made their journey back to florence together  emily trevelyan before the arrival of that letter from her husband had determined that she would not leave italy it had been her purpose to remain somewhere in the neighbourhood of her husband and child and to overcome her difficultiesor be overcome by them as circumstances might direct now her plans were again changedor rather she was now without a plan she could form no plan till she should again see mr glascock should her child be restored to her would it not be her duty to remain near her husband all this made noras line of conduct the more difficult for her it was acknowledged that she could not remain in italy mrs trevelyans position would be most embarrassing but as all her efforts were to be used towards a reconciliation with her husband and as his state utterly precluded the idea of a mixed householdof any such a family arrangement as that which had existed in curzon streetnora could not remain with her mrs trevelyan herself had declared that she would not wish it and in that case where was nora to bestow herself when sir marmaduke and lady rowley had sailed caroline offered to curtail those honeymoon weeks in switzerland but it was impossible to listen to an offer so magnanimous and so unreasonable nora had a dim romantic idea of sharing priscillas bedroom in that small cottage near nuncombe putney of which she had heard and of there learning lessons in strict economybut of this she said nothing the short journey from the baths of lucca to florence was not a pleasant one and the rowley family were much disturbed as they looked into the future lodgings had now been taken for them and there was the great additional doubt whether mrs trevelyan would find her child there on her arrival  the spaldings went one way from the florence station and the rowleys another the american minister had returned to the city some days previouslydrawn there nominally by pleas of business but in truth by the necessities of the wedding breakfastand he met them at the station has mr glascock come back nora was the first to ask yeshe had come he had been in the city since two oclock and had been up at the american ministers house for half a minute and has he brought the child asked caroline relieved of doubt on her own account mr spalding did not knowindeed he had not interested himself quite so intently about mrs trevelyans little boy as had all those who had just returned from the baths mr glascock had said nothing to him about the child and he had not quite understood why such a man should have made a journey to siena leaving his sweetheart behind him just on the eve of his marriage he hurried his womenkind into their carriage and they were driven away and then sir marmaduke was driven away with his womenkind caroline spalding had perhaps thought that mr glascock might have been there to meet her     chapter lxxxvi  mr glascock as nurse   a message had been sent by the wires to trevelyan to let him know that mr glascock was himself coming for the boy whether such message would or would not be sent out to casalunga mr glascock had been quite ignorantbut it could at any rate do no harm he did feel it hard as in this hot weather he made the journey first to florence and then on to siena what was he to the rowleys or to trevelyan himself that such a job of work should fall to his lot at such a period of his life he had been very much in love with nora no doubt but luckily for him as he thought nora had refused him as for trevelyantrevelyan had never been his friend as for sir marmadukesir marmaduke was nothing to him he was almost angry even with mrs trevelyan as he arrived tired heated and very dusty at siena it was his purpose to sleep at siena that night and to go out to casalunga early the next morning if the telegram had not been forwarded he would send a message on that evening on inquiry however he found that the message had been sent and that the paper had been put into the signores own hand by the sienese messenger then he got into some discourse with the landlord about the strange gentleman at casalunga trevelyan was beginning to become the subject of gossip in the town and people were saying that the stranger was very strange indeed the landlord thought that if the signore had any friends at all it would be well that such friends should come and look after him mr glascock asked if mr trevelyan was ill it was not only that the signore was out of healthso the landlord heardbut that he was also somewhat and then the landlord touched his head he eat nothing and went nowhere and spoke to no one and the people at the hospital to which casalunga belonged were beginning to be uneasy about their tenant perhaps mr glascock had come to take him away mr glascock explained that he had not come to take mr trevelyan awaybut only to take away a little boy that was with him for this reason he was travelling with a maidservanta fact for which mr glascock clearly thought it necessary that he should give an intelligible and credible explanation the landlord seemed to think that the people at the hospital would have been much rejoiced had mr glascock intended to take mr trevelyan away also  he started after a very early breakfast and found himself walking up over the stone ridges to the house between nine and ten in the morning he himself had sat beside the driver and had put the maid inside the carriage he had not deemed it wise to take an undivided charge of the boy even from casalunga to siena at the door of the house as though waiting for him he found trevelyan not dirty as he had been before but dressed with much appearance of smartness he had a brocaded cap on his head and a shirt with a laced front and a worked waistcoat and a frock coat and coloured bright trousers mr glascock knew at once that all the clothes which he saw before him had been made for italian and not for english wear and could almost have said that they had been bought in siena and not in florence i had not intended to impose this labour on you mr glascock trevelyan said raising his cap to salute his visitor  for fear there might be mistakes i thought it better to come myself said mr glascock you did not wish to see sir marmaduke  certainly not sir marmaduke said trevelyan with a look of anger that was almost grotesque  and you thought it better that mrs trevelyan should not come  yesi thought it betterbut not from any feeling of anger towards her if i could welcome my wife here mr glascock without a risk of wrath on her part i should be very happy to receive her i love my wife mr glascock i love her dearly but there have been misfortunes never mind there is no reason why i should trouble you with them let us go in to breakfast after your drive you will have an appetite  poor mr glascock was afraid to decline to sit down to the meal which was prepared for him he did mutter something about having already eaten but trevelyan put this aside with a wave of his hand as he led the way into a spacious room in which had been set out a table with almost a sumptuous banquet the room was very bare and comfortless having neither curtains nor matting and containing not above half a dozen chairs but an effort had been made to give it an air of italian luxury the windows were thrown open down to the ground and the table was decorated with fruits and three or four longnecked bottles trevelyan waved with his hand towards an armchair and mr glascock had no alternative but to seat himself he felt that he was sitting down to breakfast with a madman but if he did not sit down the madman might perhaps break out into madness then trevelyan went to the door and called aloud for catarina in these remote places said he one has to do without the civilisation of a bell perhaps one gains as much in quiet as one loses in comfort then catarina came with hot meats and fried potatoes and mr glascock was compelled to help himself  i am but a bad trencherman myself said trevelyan but i shall lament my misfortune doubly if that should interfere with your appetite then he got up and poured out wine into mr glascocks glass they tell me that it comes from the barons vineyard said trevelyan alluding to the winefarm of ricasoli and that there is none better in tuscany i never was myself a judge of the grape but this to me is as palatable as any of the costlier french wines how grand a thing would wine really be if it could make glad the heart of man how truly would one worship bacchus if he could make ones heart to rejoice but if a man have a real sorrow wine will not wash it awaynot though a man were drowned in it as clarence was  mr glascock hitherto had spoken hardly a word there was an attempt at joviality about this breakfastor at any rate of the usual comfortable luxury of hospitable entertainmentwhich coming as it did from trevelyan almost locked his lips he had not come there to be jovial or luxurious but to perform a most melancholy mission and he had brought with him his saddest looks and was prepared for a few sad words trevelyans speech indeed was sad enough but mr glascock could not take up questions of the worship of bacchus at half a minutes warning he eat a morsel and raised his glass to his lips and felt himself to be very uncomfortable it was necessary however that he should utter a word do you not let your little boy come in to breakfast he said  he is better away said trevelyan gloomily  but as we are to travel together said mr glascock we might as well make acquaintance  you have been a little hurried with me on that score said trevelyan i wrote certainly with a determined mind but things have changed somewhat since then  you do not mean that you will not send him  you have been somewhat hurried with me i say if i remember rightly i named no time but spoke of the future could i have answered the message which i received from you i would have postponed your visit for a week or so  postponed it whyi am to be married the day after tomorrow it was just as much as i was able to do to come here at all mr glascock now pushed his chair back from the table and prepared himself to speak up your wife expects her child now and you will break her heart by refusing to send him  nobody thinks of my heart mr glascock  but this is your own offer  yes it was my own offer certainly i am not going to deny my own words which have no doubt been preserved in testimony against me  mr trevelyan what do you mean then when he was on the point of boiling over with passion mr glascock remembered that his companion was not responsible for his expressions i do hope you will let the child go away with me he said you cannot conceive the state of his mothers anxiety and she will send him back at once if you demand it  is that to be in good faith  certainly in good faith i would lend myself to nothing mr trevelyan that was not said and done in good faith  she will not break her word excusing herself because i ammad  i am sure that there is nothing of the kind in her mind  perhaps not now but such things grow there is no iniquity no breach of promise no treason that a woman will not excuse to herselfor a man eitherby the comfortable selfassurance that the person to be injured ismad a hound without a friend is not so cruelly treated the outlaw the murderer the perjurer has surer privileges than the man who is in the way and to whom his friends can point as beingmad mr glascock knew or thought that he knew that his host in truth was mad and he could not therefore answer this tirade by an assurance that no such idea was likely to prevail have they told you i wonder continued trevelyan how it was that driven to force and an ambuscade for the recovery of my own child i waylaid my wife and took him from her i have done nothing to forfeit my right as a man to the control of my own family i demanded that the boy should be sent to me and she paid no attention to my words i was compelled to vindicate my own authority and then because i claimed the right which belongs to a father they said that i wasmad ay and they would have proved it too had i not fled from my country and hidden myself in this desert think of that mr glascock now they have followed me herenot out of love for me and that man whom they call a governor comes and insults me and my wife promises to be good to me and says that she will forgive and forget can she ever forgive herself her own folly and the cruelty that has made shipwreck of my life they can do nothing to me here but they would entice me home because there they have friends and can fee doctorswith my own moneyand suborn lawyers and put me awaysomewhere in the dark where i shall be no more heard of among men as you are a man of honour mr glascocktell me is it not so  i know nothing of their plansbeyond this that you wrote me word that you would send them the boy  but i know their plans what you say is true i did write you wordand i meant it mr glascock sitting here alone from morning to night and lying down from night till morning without companionship without love in utter misery i taught myself to feel that i should think more of her than of myself  if you are so unhappy here come back yourself with the child your wife would desire nothing better  yesand submit to her and her father and her mother nomr glascock never never let her come to me  but you will not receive her  let her come in a proper spirit and i will receive her she is the wife of my bosom and i will receive her with joy but if she is to come to me and tell me that she forgives meforgives me for the evil that she has donethen sir she had better stay away mr glascock you are going to be married believe meno man should submit to be forgiven by his wife everything must go astray if that be done i would rather encounter their mad doctors one of them after another till they had made me madi would encounter anything rather than that but sir you neither eat nor drink and i fear that my speech disturbs you  it was like enough that it may have done so trevelyan as he had been speaking had walked about the room going from one extremity to the other with hurried steps gesticulating with his arms and every now and then pushing back with his hands the long hair from off his forehead mr glascock was in truth very much disturbed he had come there with an express object but whenever he mentioned the child the father became almost rabid in his wrath i have done very well thank you said mr glascock i will not eat any more and i believe i must be thinking of going back to siena  i had hoped you would spend the day with me mr glascock  i am to be married you see in two days and i must be in florence early tomorrow i am to meet mywife as she will be and the rowleys and your wife upon my word i cant stay wont you just say a word to the young woman and let the boy be got ready  i think notno i think not  and am i to have had all this journey for nothing you will have made a fool of me in writing to me  i intended to be honest mr glascock  stick to your honesty and send the boy back to his mother it will be better for you trevelyan  better for me nothing can be better for me all must be worst it will be better for me you say and you ask me to give up the last drop of cold water wherewith i can touch my parched lips even in my hell i had so much left to me of a limpid stream and you tell me that it will be better for me to pour it away you may take him mr glascock the woman will make him ready for you what matters it whether the fiery furnace be heated seven times or only sixin either degree the flames are enough you may take himyou may take him so saying trevelyan walked out of the window leaving mr glascock seated in his chair he walked out of the window and went down among the olive trees he did not go far however but stood with his arm round the stem of one of them playing with the shoots of a vine with his hand mr glascock followed him to the window and stood looking at him for a few moments but trevelyan did not turn or move there he stood gazing at the pale cloudless heatladen motionless sky thinking of his own sorrows and remembering too doubtless with the vanity of a madman that he was probably being watched in his reverie  mr glascock was too practical a man not to make the most of the offer that had been made to him and he went back among the passages and called for catarina before long he had two or three women with him including her whom he had brought from florence and among them louey was soon made to appear dressed for his journey together with a small trunk in which were his garments it was quite clear that the order for his departure had been given before that scene at the breakfasttable and that trevelyan had not intended to go back from his promise nevertheless mr glascock thought it might be as well to hurry his departure and he turned back to say the shortest possible word of farewell to trevelyan in the garden but when he got to the window trevelyan was not to be found among the olive trees mr glascock walked a few steps down the hill looking for him but seeing nothing of him returned to the house the elder woman said that her master had not been there and mr glascock started with his charge trevelyan was manifestly mad and it was impossible to treat him as a sane man would have been treated nevertheless mr glascock felt much compunction in carrying the child away without a final kiss or word of farewell from its father but it was not to be so he had got into the carriage with the child having the servant seated opposite to himfor he was moved by some undefinable fear which made him determine to keep the boy close to him and he had not therefore returned to the drivers seatwhen trevelyan appeared standing by the roadside at the bottom of the hill would you take him away from me without one word said trevelyan bitterly  i went to look for you but you were gone said mr glascock  no sir i was not gone i am here it is the last time that i shall ever gladden my eyes with his brightness louey my love will you come to your father louey did not seem to be particularly willing to leave the carriage but he made no loud objection when mr glascock held him up to the open space above the door the child had realised the fact that he was to go and did not believe that his father would stop him now but he was probably of opinion that the sooner the carriage began to go on the better it would be for him mr glascock thinking that his father intended to kiss him over the door held him by his frock but the doing of this made trevelyan very angry am i not to be trusted with my own child in my arms said he give him to me sir i begin to doubt now whether i am right to deliver him to you mr glascock immediately let go his hold of the boys frock and leaned back in the carriage louey will tell papa that he loves him before he goes said trevelyan the poor little fellow murmured something but it did not please his father who had him in his arms you are like the rest of them louey he said because i cannot laugh and be gay all my love for you is nothingnothing you may take him he is all that i haveall that i haveand i shall never see him again so saying he handed the child into the carriage and sat himself down by the side of the road to watch till the vehicle should be out of sight as soon as the last speck of it had vanished from his sight he picked himself up and dragged his slow footsteps back to the house  mr glascock made sundry attempts to amuse the child with whom he had to remain all that night at siena but his efforts in that line were not very successful the boy was brisk enough and happy and social by nature but the events or rather the want of events of the last few months had so cowed him that he could not recover his spirits at the bidding of a stranger if i have any of my own said mr glascock to himself i hope they will be of a more cheerful disposition  as we have seen he did not meet caroline at the stationthereby incurring his ladyloves displeasure for the period of halfaminute but he did meet mrs trevelyan almost at the door of sir marmadukes lodgings yes mrs trevelyan he is here  how am i ever to thank you for such goodness said she and mr trevelyanyou saw him  yesi saw him  before he could answer her further she was upstairs and had her child in her arms it seemed to be an age since the boy had been stolen from her in the early spring in that unknown dingy street near tottenham court road twice she had seen her darling since thattwice during his captivity but on each of these occasions she had seen him as one not belonging to herself and had seen him under circumstances which had robbed the greeting of almost all its pleasure but now he was her own again to take whither she would to dress and to undress to feed to coax to teach and to caress and the child lay close up to her as she hugged him putting up his little cheek to her chin and burying himself happily in her embrace he had not much as yet to say but she could feel that he was contented  mr glascock had promised to wait for her a few minuteseven at the risk of carolines displeasureand mrs trevelyan ran down to him as soon as the first craving of her mothers love was satisfied her boy would at any rate be safe with her now and it was her duty to learn something of her husband it was more than her dutyif only her services might be of avail to him and you say he was well she asked she had taken mr glascock apart and they were alone together and he had determined that he would tell her the truth  i do not know that he is illthough he is pale and altered beyond belief  yesi saw that  i never knew a man so thin and haggard  my poor louis  but that is not the worst of it  what do you mean mr glascock  i mean that his mind is astray and that he should not be left alone there is no knowing what he might do he is so much more alone there than he would be in england there is not a soul who could interfere  do you mean that you thinkthat he is in dangerfrom himself  i would not say so mrs trevelyan but who can tell i am sure of thisthat he should not be left alone if it were only because of the misery of his life he should not be left alone  but what can i do he would not even see papa  he would see you  but he would not let me guide him in anything i have been to him twice and he breaks outas if i werea bad woman  let him break out what does it matter  am i to own to a falsehoodand such a falsehood  own to anything and you will conquer him at once that is what i think you will excuse what i say mrs trevelyan  oh mr glascock you have been such a friend what should we have done without you  you cannot take to heart the words that come from a disordered reason in truth he believes no ill of you  but he says so  it is hard to know what he says declare that you will submit to him and i think that he will be softened towards you try to bring him back to his own country it may be that were he todie there alone the memory of his loneliness would be heavy with you in after days then having so spoken he rushed off declaring with a forced laugh that caroline spalding would never forgive him  the next day was the day of the wedding and emily trevelyan was left all alone it was of course out of the question that she should join any party the purport of which was to be festive sir marmaduke went with some grumbling declaring that wine and severe food in the morning were sins against the plainest rules of life and the three rowley girls went nora officiating as one of the bridesmaids but mrs trevelyan was left with her boy and during the day she was forced to resolve what should be the immediate course of her life two days after the wedding her family would return to england it was open to her to go with them and to take her boy with her but a few days since how happy she would have been could she have been made to believe that such a mode of returning would be within her power but now she felt that she might not return and leave that poor suffering wretch behind her as she thought of him she tried to interrogate herself in regard to her feelings was it love or duty or compassion which stirred her she had loved him as fondly as any bright young woman loves the man who is to take her away from everything else and make her a part of his house and of himself she had loved him as nora now loved the man whom she worshipped and thought to be a god doing godlike work in the dingy recesses of the d r office emily trevelyan was forced to tell herself that all that was over with her her husband had shown himself to be weak suspicious unmanlyby no means like a god she had learned to feel that she could not trust her comfort in his handsthat she could never know what his thoughts of her might be but still he was her husband and the father of her child and though she could not dare to look forward to happiness in living with him she could understand that no comfort would be possible to her were she to return to england and to leave him to perish alone at casalunga fate seemed to have intended that her life should be one of misery and she must bear it as best she might  the more she thought of it however the greater seemed to be her difficulties what was she to do when her father and mother should have left her she could not go to casalunga if her husband would not give her entrance and if she did go would it be safe for her to take her boy with her were she to remain in florence she would be hardly nearer to him for any useful purpose than in england and even should she pitch her tent at siena occupying there some desolate set of huge apartments in a deserted palace of what use could she be to him could she stay there if he desired her to go and was it probable that he would be willing that she should be at siena while he was living at casalungano more than two leagues distant how should she begin her work and if he repulsed her how should she then continue it  but during these wedding hours she did make up her mind as to what she would do for the present she would certainly not leave italy while her husband remained there she would for a while keep her rooms in florence and there should her boy abide but from time to timetwice a week perhapsshe would go down to siena and casalunga and there form her plans in accordance with her husbands conduct she was his wife and nothing should entirely separate her from him now that he so sorely wanted her aid     chapter lxxxvii  mr glascocks marriage completed      illustration  the glascock marriage was a great affair in florenceso much so that there were not a few who regarded it as a strengthening of peaceful relations between the united states and the united kingdom and who thought that the alabama claims and the question of naturalisation might now be settled with comparative ease an english lord was about to marry the niece of an american minister to a foreign court the bridegroom was not indeed quite a lord as yet but it was known to all men that he must be a lord in a very short time and the bride was treated with more than usual bridal honours because she belonged to a legation she was not indeed an ambassadors daughter but the niece of a daughterless ambassador and therefore almost as good as a daughter the wives and daughters of other ambassadors and the other ambassadors themselves of course came to the wedding and as the palace in which mr spalding had apartments stood alone in a garden with a separate carriage entrance it seemed for all wedding purposes as though the whole palace were his own the english minister came and his wifealthough she had never quite given over turning up her nose at the american bride whom mr glascock had chosen for himself it was such a pity she said that such a man as mr glascock should marry a young woman from providence rhode island who in england would know anything of providence rhode island and it was so expedient in her estimation that a man of family should strengthen himself by marrying a woman of family it was so necessary she declared that a man when marrying should remember that his child would have two grandfathers and would be called upon to account for four greatgrandfathers nevertheless mr glascock wasmr glascock and let him marry whom he would his wife would be the future lady peterborough remembering this the english ministers wife gave up the point when the thing was really settled and benignly promised to come to the breakfast with all the secretaries and attachés belonging to the legation and all the wives and daughters thereof what may a man not do and do with éclat if he be heir to a peer and have plenty of money in his pocket  mr and mrs spalding were covered with glory on the occasion and perhaps they did not bear their glory as meekly as they should have done mrs spalding laid herself open to some ridicule from the british ministers wife because of her inability to understand with absolute clearness the condition of her nieces husband in respect to his late and future seat in parliament to the fact of his being a commoner and a nobleman at the same time and to certain information which was conveyed to her surely in a most unnecessary manner that if mr glascock were to die before his father her niece would never become lady peterborough although her nieces son if she had one would be the future lord no doubt she blundered as was most natural and then the british ministers wife made the most of the blunders and when once mrs spalding ventured to speak of caroline as her ladyship not to the british ministers wife but to the sister of one of the secretaries a story was made out of it which was almost as false as it was illnatured poor caroline was spoken of as her ladyship backward and forwards among the ladies of the legation in a manner which might have vexed her had she known anything about it but nevertheless all the ladies prepared their best flounces to go to the wedding the time would soon come when she would in truth be a ladyship and she might be of social use to any one of the ladies in question  but mr spalding was for the time the most disturbed of any of the party concerned he was a tall thin clever republican of the northvery fond of hearing himself talk and somewhat apt to take advantage of the courtesies of conversation for the purpose of making unpardonable speeches as long as there was any give and take going on in the mêlée of words he would speak quickly and with energy seizing his chances among others but the moment he had established his right to the flooras soon as he had won for himself the position of having his turn at the argument he would dole out his words with considerable slowness raise his hand for oratorial effect and proceed as though time were annihilated and he would go further even than this forfearing by experience the escape of his victimshe would catch a man by the buttonhole of his coat or back him ruthlessly into the corner of a room and then lay on to him without quarter since the affair with mr glascock had been settled he had talked an immensity about englandnot absolutely taking honour to himself because of his intended connection with a lord but making so many references to the aristocratic side of the british constitution as to leave no doubt on the minds of his hearers as to the source of his arguments in old days before all this was happening mr spalding though a courteous man in his personal relations had constantly spoken of england with the bitter indignation of the ordinary american politician england must be made to disgorge england must be made to do justice england must be taught her place in the world england must give up her claims in hot moments he had gone further and had declared that england must bewhipped he had been specially loud against that aristocracy of england which according to a figure of speech often used by him was always feeding on the vitals of the people but now all this was very much changed he did not go the length of expressing an opinion that the house of lords was a valuable institution but he discussed questions of primogeniture and hereditary legislation in reference to their fitness for countries which were gradually emerging from feudal systems with an equanimity an impartiality and a perseverance which soon convinced those who listened to him where he had learned his present lessons and why the conservative nature of your institutions sir he said to poor sir marmaduke at the baths of lucca a very few days before the marriage has to be studied with great care before its effects can be appreciated in reference to a people who perhaps i may be allowed to say have more in their composition of constitutional reverence than of educated intelligence sir marmaduke having suffered before had endeavoured to bolt but the american had caught him and pinned him and the governor of the mandarins was impotent in his hands the position of the great peer of parliament is doubtless very splendid and may be very useful continued mr spalding who was intending to bring round his argument to the evil doings of certain scandalously extravagant young lords and to offer a suggestion that in such cases a committee of aged and respected peers should sit and decide whether a second son or some other heir should not be called to the inheritance both of the title and the property but mrs spalding had seen the sufferings of sir marmaduke and had rescued him mr spalding she had said it is too late for politics and sir marmaduke has come out here for a holiday then she took her husband by the arm and led him away helpless  in spite of these drawbacks to the successif ought can be said to be a drawback on success of which the successful one is unconsciousthe marriage was prepared with great splendour and everybody who was anybody in florence was to be present there were only to be four bridesmaids caroline herself having strongly objected to a greater number as wallachia petrie had fled at the first note of preparation for these trivial and unpalatable festivities another american young lady was found and the sister of the english secretary of legation who had so maliciously spread that report about her ladyship gladly agreed to be the fourth  as the reader will remember the whole party from the baths of lucca reached florence only the day before the marriage and nora at the station promised to go up to caroline that same evening mr glascock will tell me about the little boy said caroline but i shall be so anxious to hear about your sister so nora crossed the bridge after dinner and went up to the american ministers palatial residence caroline was then in the loggia and mr glascock was with her and for a while they talked about emily trevelyan and her misfortunes mr glascock was clearly of opinion that trevelyan would soon be either in an asylum or in his grave i could not bring myself to tell your sister so he said but i think your father should be toldor your mother something should be done to put an end to that fearful residence at casalunga then by degrees the conversation changed itself to noras prospects and caroline with her friends hand in hers asked after hugh stanbury  you will not mind speaking before himwill you said caroline putting her hand on her own lovers arm  not unless he should mind it said nora smiling she had meant nothing beyond a simple reply to her friends question but he took her words in a different sense and blushed as he remembered his visit to nuncombe putney  he thinks almost more of your happiness than he does of mine said caroline which isnt fair as i am sure that mr stanbury will not reciprocate the attention and now dear when are we to see you  who on earth can say  i suppose mr stanbury would say somethingonly he is not here  and papa wont send my letter said nora  you are sure that you will not go out to the islands with him  quite sure said nora i have made up my mind so far as that  and what will your sister do  i think she will stay i think she will say goodbye to papa and mamma here in florence  i am quite of opinion that she should not leave her husband alone in italy said mr glascock  she has not told us with certainty said nora but i feel sure that she will stay papa thinks she ought to go with them to london  your papa seems to have two very intractable daughters said caroline  as for me declared nora solemnly nothing shall make me go back to the islandsunless mr stanbury should tell me to do so  and they start at the end of july  on the last saturday  and what will you do then nora  i believe there are casual wards that people go to  casual wards said caroline  miss rowley is condescending to poke her fun at you said mr glascock  she is quite welcome and shall poke as much as she likes only we must be serious now if it be necessary we will get back by the end of julywont we charles  you will do nothing of the kind said nora whatgive up your honeymoon to provide me with board and lodgings how can you suppose that i am so selfish or so helpless i would go to my aunt mrs outhouse  we know that that wouldnt do said caroline you might as well be in italy as far as mr stanbury is concerned  if miss rowley would go to monkhams she might wait for us suggested mr glascock old mrs richards is there and though of course she would be dull  it is quite unnecessary said nora i shall take a twopair back in a respectable feminine quarter like any other young woman who wants such accommodation and shall wait there till my young man can come and give me his arm to church that is about the way we shall do it i am not going to give myself any airs mr glascock or make any difficulties papa is always talking to me about chairs and tables and fryingpans and i shall practise to do with as few of them as possible as i am headstrong about having my young manand i own that i am headstrong about thati guess ive got to fit myself for that sort of life and nora as she said this pronounced her words with something of a nasal twang imitating certain countrywomen of her friends  i like to hear you joking about it nora because your voice is so cheery and you are so bright when you joke but nevertheless one has to be reasonable and to look the facts in the face i dont see how you are to be left in london alone and you know that your aunt mrs outhouseor at any rate your unclewould not receive you except on receiving some strong antistanbury pledge  i certainly shall not give an antistanbury pledge  and therefore that is out of the question you will have a fortnight or three weeks in london in all the bustle of their departure and i declare i think that at the last moment you will go with them  neverunless he says so  i dont see how you are even to meethim and talk it over  ill manage that my promise not to write lasts only while we are in italy  i think we had better get back to england charles and take pity on this poor destitute one  if you talk of such a thing i will swear that i will never go to monkhams you will find that i shall manage it it may be that i shall do something very shockingso that all your patronage will hardly be able to bring me round afterwards but i will do something that will serve my purpose i have not gone so far as this to be turned back now nora as she spoke of having gone so far was looking at mr glascock who was seated in an easy armchair close to the girl whom he was to make his wife on the morrow and she was thinking no doubt of the visit which he had made to nuncombe putney and of the first irretrievable step which she had taken when she told him that her love was given to another that had been her rubicon and though there had been periods with her since the passing of it in which she had felt that she had crossed it in vain that she had thrown away the splendid security of the other bank without obtaining the perilous object of her ambitionthough there had been moments in which she had almost regretted her own courage and noble action still having passed the river there was nothing for her but to go on to rome she was not going to be stopped now by the want of a house in which to hide herself for a few weeks she was without money except so much as her mother might be able almost surreptitiously to give her she was without friends to help herexcept these who were now with her whose friendship had come to her in so singular a manner and whose power to aid her at the present moment was cruelly curtailed by their own circumstances nothing was settled as to her own marriage in consequence of the promise that had been extorted from her that she should not correspond with stanbury she knew nothing of his present wishes or intention her father was so offended by her firmness that he would hardly speak to her and it was evident to her that her mother though disposed to yield was still in hopes that her daughter in the press and difficulty of the moment would allow herself to be carried away with the rest of the family to the other side of the world she knew all thisbut she had made up her mind that she would not be carried away it was not very pleasant the thought that she would be obliged at last to ask her young man as she called him to provide for her but she would do that and trust herself altogether in his hands sooner than be taken to the antipodes i can be very resolute if i please my dear she said looking at caroline mr glascock almost thought that she must have intended to address him  they sat there discussing the matter for some time through the long cool evening hours but nothing could be settled furtherexcept that nora would write to her friend as soon as her affairs had begun to shape themselves after her return to england at last caroline went into the house and for a few minutes mr glascock was alone with nora he had remained determining that the moment should come but now that it was there he was for awhile unable to say the words that he wished to utter at last he spoke miss rowley caroline is so eager to be your friend  i know she is and i do love her so dearly but without joke mr glascock there will be as it were a great gulf between us  i do not know that there need be any gulf great or little but i did not mean to allude to that what i want to say is this my feelings are not a bit less warm or sincere than hers you know of old that i am not very good at expressing myself  i know nothing of the kind  there is no such gulf as what you speak of all that is mostly gone by and a nobleman in england though he has advantages as a gentleman is no more than a gentleman but that has nothing to do with what i am saying now i shall never forget my journey to devonshire i wont pretend to say now that i regret its result  i am quite sure you dont  no i do notthough i thought then that i should regret it always but remember this miss rowleythat you can never ask me to do anything that i will not if possible do for you you are in some little difficulty now  it will disappear mr glascock difficulties always do  but we will do anything that we are wanted to do and should a certain event take place  it will take place some day  then i hope that we may be able to make mr stanbury and his wife quite at home at monkhams after that he took noras hand and kissed it and at that moment caroline came back to them  tomorrow mr glascock she said you will i believe be at liberty to kiss everybody but today you should be more discreet  it was generally admitted among the various legations in florence that there had not been such a wedding in the city of flowers since it had become the capital of italia mr glascock and miss spalding were married in the chapel of the legationa legation chapel on the ground floor having been extemporised for the occasion this greatly enhanced the pleasantness of the thing and saved the necessity of matrons and bridesmaids packing themselves and their finery into close fusty carriages a portion of the guests attended in the chapel and the remainder when the ceremony was over were found strolling about the shady garden the whole affair of the breakfast was very splendid and lasted some hours in the midst of this the bride and bridegroom were whisked away with a pair of grey horses to the railway station and before the last toast of the day had been proposed by the belgian councillor of legation they were half way up the apennines on their road to bologna mr spalding behaved himself like a man on the occasion nothing was spared in the way of expense and when he made that celebrated speech in which he declared that the republican virtue of the new world had linked itself in a happy alliance with the aristocratic splendour of the old and went on with a simile about the lion and the lamb everybody accepted it with good humour in spite of its being a little too long for the occasion  it has gone off very well mamma has it not said nora as she returned home with her mother to her lodgings  yes my dear much i fancy as these things generally do  i thought it was so nice and she looked so very well and he was so pleasant and so much like a gentlemannot noisy you knowand yet not too serious  i dare say my love  it is easy enough mamma for a girl to be married for she has nothing to do but to wear her clothes and look as pretty as she can and if she cries and has a red nose it is forgiven her but a man has so difficult a part to play if he tries to carry himself as though it were not a special occasion he looks like a fool that way and if he is very special he looks like a fool the other way i thought mr glascock did it very well  to tell you the truth my dear i did not observe him  i didnarrowly he hadnt tied his cravat at all nicely  how you could think of his cravat nora with such memories as you must have and such regrets i cannot understand  mamma my memories of mr glascock are pleasant memories and as for regretsi have not one can i regret mamma that i did not marry a man whom i did not loveand that i rejected him when i knew that i loved another you cannot mean that mamma  i know thisthat i was thinking all the time how proud i should have been and how much more fortunate he would have been had you been standing there instead of that american young woman as she said this lady rowley burst into tears and nora could only answer her mother by embracing her they were alone together their party having been too large for one carriage and sir marmaduke having taken his two younger daughters of course i feel it said lady rowley through her tears it would have been such a position for my child and that young manwithout a shilling in the world and writing in that way just for bare bread nora had nothing more to say a feeling that in herself would have been base was simply affectionate and maternal in her mother it was impossible that she should make her mother see it as she saw it  there was but one intervening day and then the rowleys returned to england there had been as it were a tacit agreement among them that in spite of all their troubles their holiday should be a holiday up to the time of the glascock marriage then must commence at once the stern necessity of their return homehome not only to england but to those antipodean islands from which it was too probable that some of them might never come back and the difficulties in their way seemed to be almost insuperable first of all there was to be the parting from emily trevelyan she had determined to remain in florence and had written to her husband saying that she would do so and declaring her willingness to go out to him or to receive him in florence at any time and in any manner that he might appoint she had taken this as a first step intending to go to casalunga very shortly even though she should receive no answer from him the parting between her and her mother and father and sisters was very bitter sir marmaduke as he had become estranged from nora had grown to be more and more gentle and loving with his elder daughter and was nearly overcome at the idea of leaving her in a strange land with a husband near her mad and yet not within her custody but he could do nothingcould hardly say a wordtoward opposing her though her husband was mad he supplied her with the means of living and when she said that it was her duty to be near him her father could not deny it the parting came i will return to you the moment you send to me were noras last words to her sister i dont suppose i shall send said emily i shall try to bear it without assistance  then the journey from italy to england was made without much gratification or excitement and the rowley family again found themselves at greggs hotel     chapter lxxxviii  cropper and burgess   we must now go back to exeter and look after mr brooke burgess and miss dorothy stanbury it is rather hard upon readers that they should be thus hurried from the completion of hymeneals at florence to the preparations for other hymeneals in devonshire but it is the nature of a complex story to be entangled with many weddings towards its close in this little history there are we fear three or four more to come we will not anticipate by alluding prematurely to hugh stanburys treachery or deathor the possibility that he after all may turn out to be the real descendant of the true lord peterborough and the actual inheritor of the title and estate of monkhams nor will we speak of noras certain fortitude under either of these emergencies but the instructed reader must be aware that camilla french ought to have a husband found for her that colonel osborne should be caught in some matrimonial trapas how otherwise should he be fitly punishedand that something should be at least attempted for priscilla stanbury who from the first has been intended to be the real heroine of these pages that martha should marry giles hickbody and barty burgess run away with mrs machugh is of course evident to the meanest novelexpounding capacity but the fate of brooke burgess and of dorothy will require to be evolved with some delicacy and much detail  there was considerable difficulty in fixing the day in the first place miss stanbury was not very welland then she was very fidgety she must see brooke again before the day was fixed and after seeing brooke she must see her lawyer to have a lot of money to look after is more plague than profit my dear she said to dorothy one day particularly when you dont quite know what you ought to do with it dorothy had always avoided any conversation with her aunt about money since the first moment in which she had thought of accepting brooke burgess as her husband she knew that her aunt had some feeling which made her averse to the idea that any portion of the property which she had inherited should be enjoyed by a stanbury after her death and dorothy guided by this knowledge had almost convinced herself that her love for brooke was treason either against him or against her aunt if by engaging herself to him she should rob him of his inheritance how bitter a burden to him would her love have been if on the other hand she should reward her aunt for all that had been done for her by forcing herself a stanbury into a position not intended for her how base would be her ingratitude these thoughts had troubled her much and had always prevented her from answering any of her aunts chance allusions to the property for her things had at last gone very right she did not quite know how it had come about but she was engaged to marry the man she loved and her aunt was at any rate reconciled to the marriage but when miss stanbury declared that she did not know what to do about the property dorothy could only hold her tongue she had had plenty to say when it had been suggested to her that the marriage should be put off yet for a short while and that in the meantime brooke should come again to exeter she swore that she did not care for how long it was put offonly that she hoped it might not be put off altogether and as for brookes coming that for the present would be very much nicer than being married out of hand at once dorothy in truth was not at all in a hurry to be married but she would have liked to have had her lover always coming and going since the courtship had become a thing permitted she had had the privilege of welcoming him twice at the house in the close and that running down to meet him in the little front parlour and the getting up to make his breakfast for him as he started in the morning were among the happiest epochs of her life and then as soon as ever the breakfast was eaten and he was gone she would sit down to write him a letter oh those letters so beautifully crossed more than one of which was copied from beginning to end because some word in it was not thought to be sweet enoughwhat a heaven of happiness they were to her the writing of the first had disturbed her greatly and she had almost repented of the privilege before it was ended but with the first and second the difficulties had disappeared and had she not felt somewhat ashamed of the occupation she could have sat at her desk and written him letters all day brooke would answer them with fair regularity but in a most cursory mannersending seven or eight lines in return for two sheets fully crossed but this did not discompose her in the least he was worked hard at his office and had hundreds of other things to do he too could sayso thought dorothymore in eight lines than she could put into as many pages  she was quite happy when she was told that the marriage could not take place till august but that brooke must come again in july brooke did come in the first week of july and somewhat horrified dorothy by declaring to her that miss stanbury was unreasonable  if i insist upon leaving london so often for a day or two said he how am i to get anything like leave of absence when the time comes in answer to this dorothy tried to make him understand that business should not be neglected and that as far as she was concerned she could do very well without that trip abroad which he had proposed for her im not going to be done in that way said brooke and now that i am here she has nothing to say to me ive told her a dozen times that i dont want to know anything about her will and that ill take it all for granted there is something to be settled on you that she calls her own  she is so generous brooke  she is generous enough but she is very whimsical she is going to make her whole will over again and now she wants to send some message to uncle barty i dont know what it is yet but i am to take it as far as i can understand she has sent all the way to london for me in order that i may take a message across the close  you talk as though it were very disagreeable coming to exeter said dorothy with a little pout  so it isvery disagreeable  oh brooke  very disagreeable if our marriage is to be put off by it i think it will be so much nicer making love somewhere on the rhine than having snatches of it here and talking all the time about wills and tenements and settlements as he said this with his arm round her waist and his face quite close to hersshewing thereby that he was not altogether averse even to his present privilegesshe forgave him  on that same afternoon just before the banking hours were over brooke went across to the house of cropper and burgess having first been closeted for nearly an hour with his auntand as he went his step was sedate and his air was serious he found his uncle barty and was not very long in delivering his message it was to this effectthat miss stanbury particularly wished to see mr bartholomew burgess on business at some hour on that afternoon or that evening brooke himself had been made acquainted with the subject in regard to which this singular interview was desired but it was not a part of his duty to communicate any information respecting it it had been necessary that his consent to certain arrangements should be asked before the invitation to barty burgess could be given but his present mission was confined to an authority to give the invitation  old mr burgess was much surprised and was at first disposed to decline the proposition made by the old harridan as he called her he had never put any restraint on his language in talking of miss stanbury with his nephew and was not disposed to do so now because she had taken a new vagary into her head but there was something in his nephews manner which at last induced him to discuss the matter rationally  and you dont know what its all about said uncle barty  i cant quite say that i suppose i do know pretty well at any rate i know enough to think that you ought to come but i must not say what it is  will it do me or anybody else any good  it cant do you any harm she wont eat you  but she can abuse me like a pickpocket and i should return it and then there would be a scolding match i always have kept out of her way and i think i had better do so still  nevertheless brooke prevailedor rather the feeling of curiosity which was naturally engendered prevailed for very very many years barty burgess had never entered or left his own house of business without seeing the door of that in which miss stanbury livedand he had never seen that door without a feeling of detestation for the owner of it it would perhaps have been a more rational feeling on his part had he confined his hatred to the memory of his brother by whose will miss stanbury had been enriched and he had been as he thought impoverished but there had been a contest and litigation and disputes and contradictions and a long course of those incidents in life which lead to rancour and ill blood after the death of the former brooke burgess and as the result of all this miss stanbury held the property and barty burgess held his hatred he had never been ashamed of it and had spoken his mind out to all who would hear him and to give miss stanbury her due it must be admitted that she had hardly been behind him in the warmth of her expressionof which old barty was well aware he hated and knew that he was hated in return and he knew or thought that he knew that his enemy was not a woman to relent because old age and weakness and the fear of death were coming on her his enemy with all her faults was no coward it could not be that now at the eleventh hour she should desire to reconcile him by any act of tardy justicenor did he wish to be reconciled at this the eleventh hour his hatred was a pleasant excitement to him his abuse of miss stanbury was a chosen recreation his unuttered daily curse as he looked over to her door was a relief to him nevertheless he would go as brooke had saidno harm could come of his going he would go and at least listen to her proposition  about seven in the evening his knock was heard at the door miss stanbury was sitting in the small upstairs parlour dressed in her second best gown and was prepared with considerable stiffness and state for the occasion dorothy was with her but was desired in a quick voice to hurry away the moment the knock was heard as though old barty would have jumped from the hall door into the room at a bound dorothy collected herself with a little start and went without a word she had heard much of barty burgess but had never spoken to him and was subject to a feeling of great awe when she would remember that the grim old man of whom she had heard so much evil would soon be her uncle according to arrangement mr burgess was shewn upstairs by his nephew barty burgess had been born in this very house but had not been inside the walls of it for more than thirty years he also was somewhat awed by the occasion and followed his nephew without a word brooke was to remain at hand so that he might be summoned should he be wanted but it had been decided by miss stanbury that he should not be present at the interview as soon as her visitor entered the room she rose in a stately way and curtseyed propping herself with one hand upon the table as she did so she looked him full in the face meanwhile and curtseying a second time asked him to seat himself in a chair which had been prepared for him she did it all very well and it may be surmised that she had rehearsed the little scene perhaps more than once when nobody was looking at her he bowed and walked round to the chair and seated himself but finding that he was so placed that he could not see his neighbours face he moved his chair he was not going to fight such a duel as this with the disadvantage of the sun in his eyes      illustration barty burgess   hitherto there had hardly been a word spoken miss stanbury had muttered something as she was curtseying and barty burgess had made some return then she began mr burgess she said i am indebted to you for your complaisance in coming here at my request to this he bowed again i should not have ventured thus to trouble you were it not that years are dealing more hardly with me than they are with you and that i could not have ventured to discuss a matter of deep interest otherwise than in my own room it was her room now certainly by law but barty burgess remembered it when it was his mothers room and when she used to give them all their meals therenow so many many years ago he bowed again and said not a word he knew well that she could sooner be brought to her point by his silence than by his speech  she was a long time coming to her point before she could do so she was forced to allude to times long past and to subjects which she found it very difficult to touch without saying that which would either belie herself or seem to be severe upon him though she had prepared herself she could hardly get the words spoken and she was greatly impeded by the obstinacy of his silence but at last her proposition was made to him she told him that his nephew brooke was about to be married to her niece dorothy and that it was her intention to make brooke her heir in the bulk of the property which she had received under the will of the late mr brooke burgess indeed she said all that i received at your brothers hands shall go back to your brothers family unimpaired he only bowed and would not say a word then she went on to say that it had at first been a matter to her of deep regret that brooke should have set his affections upon her niece as there had been in her mind a strong desire that none of her own people should enjoy the reversion of the wealth which she had always regarded as being hers only for the term of her life but that she had found that the young people had been so much in earnest and that her own feeling had been so near akin to a prejudice that she had yielded when this was said barty smiled instead of bowing and miss stanbury felt that there might be something worse even than his silence his smile told her that he believed her to be lying nevertheless she went on she was not fool enough to suppose that the whole nature of the man was to be changed by a few words from her so she went on the marriage was a thing fixed and she was thinking of settlements and had been talking to lawyers about a new will  i do not know that i can help you said barty finding that a longer pause than usual made some word from him absolutely necessary  i am going on to that and i regret that my story should detain you so long mr burgess and she did go on she had she said made some saving out of her income she was not going to trouble mr burgess with this matteronly that she might explain to him that what she would at once give to the young couple and what she would settle on dorothy after her own death would all come from such savings and that such gifts and bequests would not diminish the family property barty again smiled as he heard this and miss stanbury in her heart likened him to the devil in person but still she went on she was very desirous that brooke burgess should come and live at exeter his property would be in the town and the neighbourhood it would be a seemly thingsuch were her wordsthat he should occupy the house that had belonged to his grandfather and his greatgrandfather and then moreovershe acknowledged that she spoke selfishlyshe dreaded the idea of being left alone for the remainder of her own years her proposition at last was uttered it was simply this that barty burgess should give to his nephew brooke his share in the bank  i am damned if i do said barty burgess rising up from his chair  but before he had left the room he had agreed to consider the proposition miss stanbury had of course known that any such suggestion coming from her without an adequate reason assigned would have been mere idle wind she was prepared with such adequate reason if mr burgess could see his way to make the proposed transfer of his share of the bank business she miss stanbury would hand over to him for his life a certain proportion of the burgess property which lay in the city the income of which would exceed that drawn by him from the business would he at his time of life take that for doing nothing which he now got for working hard that was the meaning of it and then too as far as the portion of the property wentand it extended to the houses owned by miss stanbury on the bank side of the closeit would belong altogether to barty burgess for his life it will simply be this mr burgessthat brooke will be your heiras would be natural  i dont know that it would be at all natural said he i should prefer to choose my own heir  no doubt mr burgessin respect to your own property said miss stanbury  at last he said that he would think of it and consult his partner and then he got up to take his leave for myself said miss stanbury i would wish that all animosities might be buried  we can say that they are buried said the grim old manbut nobody will believe us  what mattersif we could believe it ourselves  but suppose we didnt i dont believe that much good can come from talking of such things miss stanbury you and i have grown too old to swear a friendship i will think of this thing and if i find that it can be made to suit without much difficulty i will perhaps entertain it then the interview was over and old barty made his way downstairs and out of the house he looked over to the tenements in the close which were offered to him every circumstance of each one of which he knew and felt that he might do worse were he to leave the bank he could not take his entire income with him and it had been long said of him that he ought to leave it the croppers who were his partnersand whom he had never lovedwould be glad to welcome in his place one of the old family who would have money and then the name would be perpetuated in exeter which even to barty burgess was something  on that night the scheme was divulged to dorothy and she was in ecstasies london had always sounded bleak and distant and terrible to her and her heart had misgiven her at the idea of leaving her aunt if only this thing might be arranged when brooke spoke the next morning of returning at once to his office he was rebuked by both the ladies what was the ecclesiastical commission office to any of them when matters of such importance were concerned but brooke would not be talked out of his prudence he was very willing to be made a banker at exeter and to go to school again and learn banking business but he would not throw up his occupation in london till he knew that there was another ready for him in the country one day longer he spent in exeter and during that day he was more than once with his uncle he saw also the messrs cropper and was considerably chilled by the manner in which they at first seemed to entertain the proposition indeed for a couple of hours he thought that the scheme must be abandoned it was pointed out to him that mr barty burgesss life would probably be short and that hebartyhad but a small part of the business at his disposal but gradually a way to terms was seennot quite so simple as that which miss stanbury had suggested and brooke when he left exeter did believe it possible that he after all might become the family representative in the old bankinghouse of the burgesses  and how long will it take aunt stanbury dorothy asked  dont you be impatient my dear  i am not the least impatient but of course i want to tell mamma and priscilla it will be so nice to live here and not go up to london are we to stay herein this very house  have you not found out yet that brooke will be likely to have an opinion of his own on such things  but would you wish us to live here aunt  i hardly know dear i am a foolish old woman and cannot say what i would wish i cannot bear to be alone  of course we will stay with you  and yet i should be jealous if i were not mistress of my own house  of course you will be mistress  i believe dolly that it would be better that i should die i have come to feel that i can do more good by going out of the world than by remaining in it dorothy hardly answered this in words but sat close by her aunt holding the old womans hand and caressing it and administering that love of which miss stanbury had enjoyed so little during her life and which had become so necessary to her  the news about the bank arrangements though kept of course as a great secret soon became common in exeter it was known to be a good thing for the firm in general that barty burgess should be removed from his share of the management he was oldfashioned unpopular and very stubborn and he and a certain mr julius cropper who was the leading man among the croppers had not always been comfortable together it was at first hinted that old miss stanbury had been softened by sudden twinges of conscience and that she had confessed to some terrible crime in the way of forgery perjury or perhaps worse and had relieved herself at last by making full restitution but such a rumour as this did not last long or receive wide credence when it was hinted to such old friends as sir peter mancrudy and mrs machugh they laughed it to scornand it did not exist even in the vague form of an undivulged mystery for above three days then it was asserted that old barty had been found to have no real claim to any share in the bank and that he was to be turned out at miss stanburys instancethat he was to be turned out and that brooke had been acknowledged to be the owner of the burgess share of her business then came the fact that old barty had been bought out and that the future husband of miss stanburys niece was to be the junior partner a general feeling prevailed at last that there had been another great battle between miss stanbury and old barty and that the old maid had prevailed now as she had done in former days  before the end of july the papers were in the lawyers hands and all the terms had been fixed brooke came down again and again to dorothys great delight and displayed considerable firmness in the management of his own interest if fate intended to make him a banker in exeter instead of a clerk in the ecclesiastical commission office he would be a banker after a respectable fashion there was more than one little struggle between him and mr julius cropper which ended in accession of respect on the part of mr cropper for his new partner mr cropper had thought that the establishment might best be known to the commercial world of the west of england as croppers bank but brooke had been very firm in asserting that if he was to have anything to do with it the old name should be maintained  its to be cropper and burgess he said to dorothy one afternoon they fought hard for cropper cropper and burgessbut i wouldnt stand more than one cropper  of course not said dorothy with something almost of scorn in her voice by this time dorothy had gone very deeply into banking business     chapter lxxxix  i wouldnt do it if i was you   miss stanbury at this time was known all through exeter to be very much altered from the miss stanbury of oldor even from the miss stanbury of two years since the miss stanbury of old was a stalwart lady who would play her rubber of whist five nights a week and could hold her own in conversation against the best woman in exeternot to speak of her acknowledged superiority over every man in that city now she cared little for the glories of debate and though she still liked her rubber and could wake herself up to the old fire in the detection of a revoke or the claim for a second trick her rubbers were few and far between and she would leave her own house on an evening only when all circumstances were favourable and with many precautions against wind and water some said that she was becoming old and that she was going out like the snuff of a candle but sir peter mancrudy declared that she might live for the next fifteen years if she would only think so herself it was true sir peter said that in the winter she had been ill and that there had been danger as to her throat during the east winds of the springbut those dangers had passed away and if she would only exert herself she might be almost as good a woman as ever she had been sir peter was not a man of many words or given to talk frequently of his patients but it was clearly sir peters opinion that miss stanburys mind was ill at ease she had become discontented with life and therefore it was that she cared no longer for the combat of tongues and had become cold even towards the cardtable it was so in truth and yet perhaps the lives of few men or women had been more innocent and few had struggled harder to be just in their dealings and generous in their thoughts  there was ever present to her mind an idea of failure and a fear lest she had been mistaken in her views throughout her life no one had ever been more devoted to peculiar opinions or more strong in the use of language for their expression and she was so far true to herself that she would never seem to retreat from the position she had taken she would still scorn the new fangles of the world around her and speak of the changes which she saw as all tending to evil but through it all there was an idea present to herself that it could not be gods intention that things should really change for the worse and that the fault must be in her because she had been unable to move as others had moved she would sit thinking of the circumstances of her own life and tell herself that with her everything had failed she had loved but had quarrelled with her lover and her love had come to nothingbut barren wealth she had fought for her wealth and had conqueredand had become hard in the fight and was conscious of her own hardness in the early days of her riches and power she had taken her nephew by the handand had thrown him away from her because he would not dress himself in her mirror she had believed herself to be right and would not even now tell herself that she had been wrong but there were doubts and qualms of conscience and an uneasinessbecause her life had been a failure now she was seeking to appease her selfaccusations by sacrificing everything for the happiness of her niece and her chosen hero but as she went on with the work she felt that all would be in vain unless she could sweep herself altogether from off the scene she had told herself that if she could bring brooke to exeter his prospects would be made infinitely brighter than they would be in london and that she in her last days would not be left utterly alone but as the prospect of her future life came nearer to her she saw or thought that she saw that there was still failure before her young people would not want an old woman in the house with themeven though the old woman would declare that she would be no more in the house than a tame cat and she knew herself also too well to believe that she could make herself a tame cat in the home that had so long been subject to her dominion would it not be better that she should go away somewhereand die  if mr brooke is to come here martha said to her one day we ought to begin and make the changes maam  what changes you are always wanting to make changes  if they was never made till i wanted them theyd never be made maam but if there is to be a married couple there should be things proper anyways maam we ought to knowoughtnt we  the truth of this statement was so evident that miss stanbury could not contradict it but she had not even yet made up her mind ideas were running through her head which she knew to be very wild but of which she could not divest herself martha she said after a while i think i shall go away from this myself  leave the house maam said martha awestruck  there are other houses in the world i suppose in which an old woman can live and die  there is houses maam of course  and what is the difference between one and another  i wouldnt do it maam if i was you i wouldnt do it if it was ever so sure the house is big enough for mr brooke and miss dorothy along with you i wouldnt go and make such change as thati wouldnt indeed maam martha spoke out almost with eloquence so much expression was there in her face miss stanbury said nothing more at the moment beyond signifying her indisposition to make up her mind to anything at the present moment yesthe house was big enough as far as rooms were concerned but how often had she heard that an old woman must always be in the way if attempting to live with a newlymarried couple if a motherinlaw be unendurable how much more so one whose connection would be less near she could keep her own house no doubt and let them go elsewhere but what then would come of her old dream that burgess the new banker in the city should live in the very house that had been inhabited by the burgesses the bankers of old there was certainly only one way out of all these troubles and that way would be that she shouldgo from them and be at rest  her will had now been drawn out and completed for the third or fourth time and she had made no secret of its contents either with brooke or dorothy the whole estate she left to brooke including the houses which were to become his after his uncles death and in regard to the property she had made no further stipulation i might have settled it on your children she said to him but in doing so i should have settled it on hers i dont know why an old woman should try to interfere with things after she has gone i hope you wont squander it brooke  i shall be a steady old man by that time he said  i hope youll be steady at any rate but there it is and god must direct you in the use of it if he will it has been a burthen to me but then i have been a solitary old woman half of what she had saved she proposed to give dorothy on her marriage and for doing this arrangements had already been made there were various other legacies and the last she announced was one to her nephew hugh i have left him a thousand pounds she said to dorothyso that he may remember me kindly at last as to this however she exacted a pledge that no intimation of the legacy was to be made to hugh then it was that dorothy told her aunt that hugh intended to marry nora rowley one of the ladies who had been at the clock house during the days in which her mother had lived in grandeur and then it was also that dorothy obtained leave to invite hugh to her own wedding i hope she will be happier than her sister miss stanbury said when she heard of the intended marriage  it wasnt mrs trevelyans fault you know aunt  i say nothing about anybodys fault but this i do say that it was a very great misfortune i fought all that battle with your sister priscilla and i dont mean to fight it again my dear if hugh marries the young lady i hope she will be more happy than her sister there can be no harm in saying that  dorothys letter to her brother shall be given because it will inform the reader of all the arrangements as they were made up to that time and will convey the exeter news respecting various persons with whom our story is concerned      the close july 20th 186     dear hugh     the day for my marriage is now fixed and i wish with all    my heart that it was the same with you pray give my love    to nora it seems so odd that though she was living for a    while with mamma at nuncombe putney i never should have    seen her yet i am very glad that brooke has seen her and    he declares that she is quite magnificently beautiful    those are his own words     we are to be married on the 10th of august a wednesday    and now comes my great news aunt stanbury says that you    are to come and stay in the house she bids me tell you so    with her love and that you can have a room as long as you    like of course you must come in the first place you    must because you are to give me away and brooke wouldnt    have me if i wasnt given away properly and then it will    make me so happy that you and aunt stanbury should be    friends again you can stay as long as you like but of    course you must come the day before the wedding we are    to be married in the cathedral and there are to be two    clergymen but i dont yet know who they will benot mr    gibson certainly as you were good enough to suggest     mr gibson is married to arabella french and they have    gone away somewhere into cornwall camilla has come back    and i have seen her once she looked ever so fierce as    though she intended to declare that she didnt mind what    anybody may think they say that she still protests that    she never will speak to her sister again     i was introduced to mr barty burgess the other day    brooke was here and we met him in the close i hardly    knew what he said to me i was so frightened but brooke    said that he meant to be civil and that he is going    to send me a present i have got a quantity of things    already and yesterday mrs machugh sent me such a    beautiful creamjug if youll come in time on the 9th    you shall see them all before they are put away     mamma and priscilla are to be here and they will come    on the 9th also poor dear mamma is i know terribly    flurried about it and so is aunt stanbury it is so long    since they have seen each other i dont think priscilla    feels it the same way because she is so brave do you    remember when it was first proposed that i should come    here i am so glad i camebecause of brooke he will    come on the 9th quite early and i do so hope you will    come with him     yours most affectionately     dorothy stanbury     give my best best love to nora     chapter xc  lady rowley conquered      illustration  when the rowleys were back in london and began to employ themselves on the terrible work of making ready for their journey to the islands lady rowley gradually gave way about hugh stanbury she had become aware that nora would not go back with themunless under an amount of pressure which she would find it impossible to use and if nora did not go out to the islands what was to become of her unless she married this man sir marmaduke when all was explained to him declared that a girl must do what her parents ordered her to do other girls live with their fathers and mothers and so must she lady rowley endeavoured to explain that other girls lived with their fathers and mothers because they found themselves in established homes from which they are not disposed to run away but noras position was as she alleged very different noras home had latterly been with her sister and it was hardly to be expected that the parental authority should not find itself impaired by the interregnum which had taken place sir marmaduke would not see the thing in the same light and was disposed to treat his daughter with a high hand if she would not do as she was bidden she should no longer be daughter of his in answer to this lady rowley could only repeat her conviction that nora would not go out to the mandarins and that as for disinheriting her casting her off cursing her and the restshe had no belief in such doings at all on the stage they do such things as that she said and perhaps they used to do it once in reality but you know that its out of the question now fancy your standing up and cursing at the dear girl just as we are all starting from southampton sir marmaduke knew as well as his wife that it would be impossible and only muttered something about the dear girl behaving herself with great impropriety  they were all aware that nora was not going to leave england because no berth had been taken for her on board the ship and because while the other girls were preparing for their long voyage no preparations were made for her of course she was not going sir marmaduke would probably have given way altogether immediately on his return to london had he not discussed the matter with his friend colonel osborne it became of course his duty to make some inquiry as to the stanbury family and he knew that osborne had visited mrs stanbury when he made his unfortunate pilgrimage to the porch of cockchaffington church he told osborne the whole story of noras engagement telling also that other most heartbreaking tale of her conduct in regard to mr glascock and asked the colonel what he thought about the stanburys now the colonel did not hold the stanburys in high esteem he had met hugh as the reader may perhaps remember and had had some intercourse with the young man which had not been quite agreeable to him on the platform of the railway station at exeter and he had also heard something of the ladies at nuncombe putney during his short sojourn at the house of mrs crocket my belief is they are beggars said colonel osborne  i suppose so said sir marmaduke shaking his head  when i went over to call on emilythat time i was at cockchaffington you know when trevelyan made himself such a d fooli found the mother and sister living in a decentish house enough but it wasnt their house  not their own you mean  it was a place that trevelyan had got this young man to take for emily and they had merely gone there to be with her they had been living in a little bit of a cottage a sort of a place that anyany ploughman would live in just that kind of cottage  goodness gracious  and theyve gone to another just like itso im told  and cant he do anything better for them than that asked sir marmaduke  i know nothing about him i have met him you know he used to be with trevelyanthat was when nora took a fancy for him of course and i saw him once down in devonshire when i must say he behaved uncommonly badlydoing all he could to foster trevelyans stupid jealousy  he has changed his mind about that i think  perhaps he has but he behaved very badly then let him shew up his incomethat i take it is the question in such a case as this his father was a clergyman and therefore i suppose he must be considered to be a gentleman but has he means to support a wife and keep up a house in london if he has not that is an end to it i should say  but sir marmaduke could not see his way to any such end and although he still looked black upon nora and talked to his wife of his determination to stand no contumacy and hinted at cursing disinheriting and the like he began to perceive that nora would have her own way in his unhappiness he regretted this visit to england and almost thought that the mandarins were a pleasanter residence than london he could do pretty much as he pleased there and could live quietly without the trouble which encountered him now on every side  nora immediately on her return to london had written a note to hugh simply telling him of her arrival and begging him to come and see her mamma she said i must see him and it would be nonsense to say that he must not come here i have done what i have said i would do and you ought not to make difficulties lady rowley declared that sir marmaduke would be very angry if hugh were admitted without his express permission i dont want to do anything in the dark continued nora but of course i must see him i suppose it will be better that he should come to me than that i should go to him lady rowley quite understood the threat that was conveyed in this it would be much better that hugh should come to the hotel and that he should be treated then as an accepted lover she had come to that conclusion but she was obliged to vacillate for awhile between her husband and her daughter hugh came of course and sir marmaduke by his wifes advice kept out of the way lady rowley though she was at home kept herself also out of the way remaining above with her two other daughters nora thus achieved the glory and happiness of receiving her lover alone  my own true girl he said speaking with his arms still round her waist  i am true enough but whether i am your ownthat is another question  you mean to be  but papa doesnt mean it papa says that you are nobody and that you havent got an income and thinks that i had better go back and be an old maid at the mandarins  and what do you think yourself nora  what do i think as far as i can understand young ladies are not allowed to think at all they have to do what their papas tell them that will do hugh you can talk without taking hold of me  it is such a time since i have had a hold of youas you call it  it will be much longer before you can do so again if i go back to the islands with papa i shall expect you to be true you know and it will be ten years at the least before i can hope to be home again  i dont think you mean to go nora  but what am i to do that idea of yours of walking out to the next church and getting ourselves married sounds very nice and independent but you know that it is not practicable  on the other hand i know it is  it is not practicable for me hugh of all things in the world i dont want to be a lydia i wont do anything that anybody shall ever say that your wife ought not to have done young women when they are married ought to have their papas and mammas consent i have been thinking about it a great deal for the last month or two and i have made up my mind to that  what is it all to come to then  i mean to get papas consent that is what it is to come to  and if he is obstinate  i shall coax him round at last when the time for going comes hell yield then  but you will not go with them as he asked this he came to her and tried again to take her by the waist but she retreated from him and got herself clear from his arm if you are afraid of me i shall know that you think it possible that we may be parted  i am not a bit afraid of you hugh  nora i think you ought to tell me something definitely  i think i have been definite enough sir you may be sure of this howeveri will not go back to the islands  give me your hand on that  there is my hand but rememberi had told you just as much before i dont mean to go back i mean to stay here i meanbut i do not think i will tell you all the things i mean to do  you mean to be my wife  certainlysome day when the difficulty about the chairs and tables can settle itself the real question now iswhat am i to do with myself when papa and mamma are gone  become mrs h stanbury at once chairs and tables you shall have chairs and tables as many as you want you wont be too proud to live in lodgings for a few months  there must be preliminaries hugheven for lodgings though they may be very slender papa goes in less than three weeks now and mamma has got something else to think of than my marriage garments and then there are all manner of difficulties money difficulties and others out of which i dont see my way yet hugh began to asseverate that it was his business to help her through all money difficulties as well as others but she soon stopped his eloquence it will be byandby hugh and i hope youll support the burden like a man but just at present there is a hitch i shouldnt have come over at alli should have stayed with emily in italy had i not thought that i was bound to see you  my own darling  when papa goes i think that i had better go back to her  ill take you said hugh picturing to himself all the pleasures of such a tour together over the alps  no you wont because that would be improper when we travel together we must go darby and joan fashion as man and wife i think i had better go back to emily because her position there is so terrible there must come some end to it i suppose soon he will be better or he will become so bad thatthat medical interference will be unavoidable but i do not like that she should be alone she gave me a home when she had oneand i must always remember that i met you there after this there was of course another attempt with hughs right arm which on this occasion was not altogether unsuccessful and then she told him of her friendship for mr glascocks wife and of her intention at some future time to visit them at monkhams      illustration i must always remember that i met you there   and see all the glories that might have been your own he said  and think of the young man who has robbed me of them all and you are to go there too so that you may see what you have done there was a time hugh when i was very nearly pleasing all my friends and shewing myself to be a young lady of high taste and noble fortuneand an obedient good girl  and why didnt you  i thought i would wait just a little longer becausebecausebecause oh hugh how cross you were to me afterwards when you came down to nuncombe and would hardly speak to me  and why didnt i speak to you  i dont know because you were cross and surly and thinking of nothing but your tobacco i believe do you remember how we walked to niddon and you hadnt a word for anybody  i remember i wanted you to go down to the river with me and you wouldnt go  you asked me only once and i did so long to go with you do you remember the rocks in the river i remember the place as though i saw it now and how i longed to jump from one stone to another hugh if we are ever married you must take me there and let me jump on those stones  you pretended that you could not think of wetting your feet  of course i pretendedbecause you were so cross and so cold oh dear i wonder whether you will ever know it all  dont i know it all now  i suppose you do nearly there is mighty little of a secret in it and it is the same thing that is going on always only it seems so strange to me that i should ever have loved any one so dearlyand that for next to no reason at all you never made yourself very charming that i know ofdid you  i did my best it wasnt much i dare say  you did nothing sirexcept just let me fall in love with you and you were not quite sure that you would let me do that  nora i dont think you do understand  i doperfectly why were you cross with me instead of saying one nice word when you were down at nuncombe i do understand  why was it  because you did not think well enough of me to believe that i would give myself to a man who had no fortune of his own i know it now and i knew it then and therefore i wouldnt dabble in the river with you but its all over now and well go and get wet together like dear little children and priscilla shall scold us when we come back  they were alone in the sittingroom for more than an hour and lady rowley was patient upstairs as mothers will be patient in such emergencies sophie and lucy had gone out and left her and there she remained telling herself as the weary minutes went by that as the thing was to be it was well that the young people should be together hugh stanbury could never be to her what mr glascock would have beena soninlaw to sit and think about and dream of and be proud ofwhose existence as her soninlaw would in itself have been a happiness to her out in her banishment at the other side of the world but nevertheless it was natural to her as a softhearted loving mother with many daughters that any soninlaw should be dear to her now that she had gradually brought herself round to believe in noras marriage she was disposed to make the best of hugh to remember that he was certainly a clever man that he was an honest fellow and that she had heard of him as a good son and a kind brother and that he had behaved well in reference to her emily and trevelyan she was quite willing now that hugh should be happy and she sat there thinking that the time was very long but still waiting patiently till she should be summoned you must let me go for mamma for a moment nora said i want you to see her and make yourself a good boy before her if you are ever to be her soninlaw you ought to be in her good graces hugh declared that he would do his best and nora fetched her mother  stanbury found some difficulty in making himself a good boy in lady rowleys presence and lady rowley herself for some time felt very strongly the awkwardness of the meeting she had never formally recognised the young man as her daughters accepted suitor and was not yet justified in doing so by any permission from sir marmaduke but as the young people had been for the last hour or two alone together with her connivance and sanction it was indispensable that she should in some way signify her parental adherence to the arrangement nora began by talking about emily and trevelyans condition and mode of living were discussed then lady rowley said something about their coming journey and hugh with a lucky blunder spoke of noras intended return to italy we dont know how that may be said lady rowley her papa still wishes her to go back with us  mamma you know that that is impossible said nora  not impossible my love  but she will not go back said hugh lady rowley you would not propose to separate us by such a distance as that  it is sir marmaduke that you must ask  mamma mamma exclaimed nora rushing to her mothers side it is not papa that we must asknot now we want you to be our friend dont we hugh and mamma if you will really be our friend of course papa will come round  my dear nora  you know he will mamma and you know that you mean to be good and kind to us of course i cant go back to the islands with you how could i go so far and leave him behind he might have halfadozen wives before i could get back to him  if you have not more trust in him than that  long engagements are awful bores said hugh finding it to be necessary that he also should press forward his argument  i can trust him as far as i can see him said nora and therefore i do not want to lose sight of him altogether  lady rowley of course gave way and embraced her accepted soninlaw after all it might have been worse he saw his way clearly he said to making six hundred a year and did not at all doubt that before long he would do better than that he proposed that they should be married some time in the autumn but was willing to acknowledge that much must depend on the position of trevelyan and his wife he would hold himself ready at any moment he said to start to italy and would do all that could be done by a brother then lady rowley gave him her blessing and kissed him againand nora kissed him too and hung upon him and did not push him away at all when his arm crept round her waist and that feeling came upon him which must surely be acknowledged by all engaged young men when they first find themselves encouraged by mammas in the taking of liberties which they have hitherto regarded as mysteries to be hidden especially from maternal eyesthat feeling of being a fine fat calf decked out with ribbons for a sacrifice     chapter xci  four oclock in the morning   another week went by and sir marmaduke had even yet not surrendered he quite understood that nora was not to go back to the islands and he had visited mr and mrs outhouse at st diddulphs in order to secure a home for her there if it might be possible mr outhouse did not refuse but gave the permission in such a fashion as to make it almost equal to a refusal he was he said much attached to his niece nora but he had heard that there was a love affair sir marmaduke of course could not deny the love affair there was certainly a love affair of which he did not personally approve as the gentleman had no fixed income and as far as he could understand no fixed profession such a love affair thought mr outhouse was a sort of thing that he didnt know how to manage at all if nora came to him was the young man to visit at the house or was he not then mrs outhouse said something as to the necessity of an antistanbury pledge on noras part and sir marmaduke found that that scheme must be abandoned mrs trevelyan had written from florence more than once or twice and in her last letter had said that she would prefer not to have nora with her she was at that time living in lodgings at siena and had her boy there also she saw her husband every other day but neverthelessaccording to her statementsher visits to casalunga were made in opposition to his wishes he had even expressed a desire that she should leave siena and return to england he had once gone so far as to say that if she would do so he would follow her but she clearly did not believe him and in all her letters spoke of him as one whom she could not regard as being under the guidance of reason she had taken her child with her once or twice to the house and on the first occasion trevelyan had made much of his son had wept over him and professed that in losing him he had lost his only treasure but after that he had not noticed the boy and latterly she had gone alone she thought that perhaps her visits cheered him breaking the intensity of his solitude but he never expressed himself gratified by them never asked her to remain at the house never returned with her into siena and continually spoke of her return to england as a step which must be taken soonand the sooner the better he intended to follow her he said and she explained very fully how manifest was his wish that she should go by the temptation to do so which he thought that he held out by this promise he had spoken on every occasion of her presence with him of sir marmadukes attempt to prove him to be a madman but declared that he was afraid of no one in england and would face all the lawyers in chancery lane and all the doctors in savile row nevertheless so said mrs trevelyan he would undoubtedly remain at casalunga till after sir marmaduke should have sailed he was not so mad but that he knew that no one else would be so keen to take steps against him as would sir marmaduke as for his health her account of him was very sad he seemed she said to be withering away his hand was mere skin and bone his hair and beard so covered his thin long cheeks that there was nothing left of his face but his bright large melancholy eyes his legs had become so frail and weak that they would hardly bear his weight as he walked and his clothes though he had taken a fancy to throw aside all that he had brought with him from england hung so loose about him that they seemed as though they would fall from him once she had ventured to send out to him from siena a doctor to whom she had been recommended in florence but he had taken the visit in very bad part had told the gentleman that he had no need for any medical services and had been furious with her because of her offence in having sent such a visitor he had told her that if ever she ventured to take such a liberty again he would demand the child back and refuse her permission inside the gates of casalunga dont come at any rate till i send for you mrs trevelyan said in her last letter to her sister your being here would do no good and would i think make him feel that he was being watched my hope is at last to get him to return with me if you were here i think this would be less likely and then why should you be mixed up with such unutterable sadness and distress more than is essentially necessary my health stands wonderfully well though the heat here is very great it is cooler at casalunga than in the townof which i am glad for his sake he perspires so profusely that it seems to me he cannot stand the waste much longer i know he will not go to england as long as papa is therebut i hope that he may be induced to do so by slow stages as soon as he knows that papa has gone mind you send me a newspaper so that he may see it stated in print that papa has sailed  it followed as one consequence of these letters from florence that nora was debarred from the italian scheme as a mode of passing her time till some house should be open for her reception she had suggested to hugh that she might go for a few weeks to nuncombe putney but he had explained to her the nature of his mothers cottage and had told her that there was no hole there in which she could lay her head there never was such a forlorn young woman she said when papa goes i shall literally be without shelter there had come a letter from mrs glascockat least it was signed caroline glascock though another name might have been useddated from milan saying that they were hurrying back to naples even at that season of the year because lord peterborough was dead and she is lady peterborough said lady rowley unable to repress the expression of the old regrets of course she is lady peterborough mamma what else should she bethough she does not so sign herself we think said the american peeress that we shall be at monkhams before the end of august and charles says that you are to come just the same there will be nobody else there of course because of lord peterboroughs death i saw it in the paper said sir marmaduke and quite forgot to mention it  that same evening there was a long family discussion about noras prospects they were all together in the gloomy sittingroom at greggs hotel and sir marmaduke had not yielded the ladies had begun to feel that it would be well not to press him to yield practically he had yielded there was now no question of cursing and of socalled disinheritance nora was to remain in england of course with the intention of being married to hugh stanbury and the difficulty consisted in the need of an immediate home for her it wanted now but twelve days to that on which the family were to sail from southampton and nothing had been settled if papa will allow me something ever so small and will trust me i will live alone in lodgings said nora  it is the maddest thing i ever heard said sir marmaduke  who would take care of you nora asked lady rowley  and who would walk about with you said lucy  i dont see how it would be possible to live alone like that said sophie  nobody would take care of me and nobody would walk about with me and i could live alone very well said nora i dont see why a young woman is to be supposed to be so absolutely helpless as all that comes to of course it wont be very nicebut it need not be for long  why not for long asked sir marmaduke  not for very long said nora  it does not seem to me said sir marmaduke after a considerable pause that this gentleman himself is so particularly anxious for the match i have heard no day named and no rational proposition made  papa that is unfair most unfairand ungenerous  nora said her mother do not speak in that way to your father  mamma it is unfair papa accuses mr stanbury of beingbeing lukewarm and untrueof not being in earnest  i would rather that he were not in earnest said sir marmaduke  mr stanbury is ready at any time continued nora he would have the banns at once read and marry me in three weeksif i would let him  good gracious nora exclaimed lady rowley  but i have refused to name any day or to make any arrangement because i did not wish to do so before papa had given his consent that is why things are in this way if papa will but let me take a room till i can go to monkhams i will have everything arranged from there you can trust mr glascock for that and you can trust her  i suppose your papa will make you some allowance said lady rowley  she is entitled to nothing as she has refused to go to her proper home said sir marmaduke  the conversation which had now become very disagreeable was not allowed to go any further and it was well that it should be interrupted they all knew that sir marmaduke must be brought round by degrees and that both nora and lady rowley had gone as far as was prudent at present but all trouble on this head was suddenly ended for this evening by the entrance of the waiter with a telegram it was addressed to lady rowley and she opened it with trembling handsas ladies always do open telegrams it was from emily trevelyan louis is much worse let somebody come to me hugh stanbury would be the best  in a few minutes they were so much disturbed that no one quite knew what should be done at once lady rowley began by declaring that she would go herself sir marmaduke of course pointed out that this was impossible and suggested that he would send a lawyer nora professed herself ready to start immediately on the journey but was stopped by a proposition from her sister lucy that in that case hugh stanbury would of course go with her lady rowley asked whether hugh would go and nora asserted that he would go immediately as a matter of course she was sure he would go let the people at the d r say what they might according to her there was always somebody at the call of the editor of the d r to do the work of anybody else when anybody else wanted to go away sir marmaduke shook his head and was very uneasy he still thought that a lawyer would be best feeling no doubt that if stanburys services were used on such an occasion there must be an end of all opposition to the marriage but before halfanhour was over stanbury was sent for the boots of the hotel went off in a cab to the office of the d r with a note from lady rowley dear mr stanburywe have had a telegram from emily and want to see you at once please come we shall sit up and wait for you till you do comee r  it was very distressing to them because let the result be what it might it was all but impossible that mrs trevelyan should be with them before they had sailed and it was quite out of the question that they should now postpone their journey were stanbury to start by the morning train on the following day he could not reach siena till the afternoon of the fourth day and let the result be what it might when he arrived there it would be out of the question that emily trevelyan should come back quite at once or that she should travel at the same speed of course they might hear again by telegram and also by letter but they could not see her or have any hand in her plans if anything were to happen she might have come with us said lady rowley  it is out of the question said sir marmaduke gloomily i could not give up the places i have taken  a few days more would have done it  i dont suppose she would wish to go said nora of course she would not take louey there why should she and then i dont suppose he is so ill as that  there is no saying said sir marmaduke it was very evident that whatever might be sir marmadukes opinion he had no stronglydeveloped wish for his soninlaws recovery  they all sat up waiting for hugh stanbury till eleven twelve one and two oclock at night the boots had returned saying that mr stanbury had not been at the office of the newspaper but that according to information received he certainly would be there that night no other address had been given to the man and the note had therefore of necessity been left at the office sir marmaduke became very fretful and was evidently desirous of being liberated from his night watch but he could not go himself and shewed his impatience by endeavouring to send the others away lady rowley replied for herself that she should certainly remain in her corner on the sofa all night if it were necessary and as she slept very soundly in her corner her comfort was not much impaired nora was pertinacious in refusing to go to bed i should only go to my own room papa and remain there she said of course i must speak to him before he goes sophie and lucy considered that they had as much right to sit up as nora and submitted to be called geese and idiots by their father  sir marmaduke had arisen with a snort from a short slumber and had just sworn that he and everybody else should go to bed when there came a ring at the frontdoor bell the trusty boots had also remained up and in two minutes hugh stanbury was in the room he had to make his excuses before anything else could be said when he reached the d r office between ten and eleven it was absolutely incumbent on him to write a leading article before he left it he had been in the reporters gallery of the house all the evening and he had come away laden with his article it was certainly better that we should remain up than that the whole town should be disappointed said sir marmaduke with something of a sneer  it is so very very good of you to come said nora  indeed it is said lady rowley but we were quite sure you would come having kissed and blessed him as her soninlaw lady rowley was now prepared to love him almost as well as though he had been lord peterborough  perhaps mr stanbury we had better show you this telegram said sir marmaduke who had been standing with the scrap of paper in his hand since the ring of the bell had been heard hugh took the message and read it i do not know what should have made my daughter mention your name continued sir marmadukebut as she has done so and as perhaps the unfortunate invalid himself may have alluded to you we thought it best to send for you  no doubt it was best sir marmaduke  we are so situated that i cannot go it is absolutely necessary that we should leave town for southampton on friday week the ship sails on saturday  i will go as a matter of course said hugh i will start at onceat any time to tell the truth when i got lady rowleys note i thought that it was to be so trevelyan and i were very intimate at one time and it may be that he will receive me without displeasure  there was much to be discussed and considerable difficulty in the discussion this was enhanced too by the feeling in the minds of all of them that hugh and sir marmaduke would not meet againprobably for many years were they to part now on terms of close affection or were they to part almost as strangers had lucy and sophie not persistently remained up nora would have faced the difficulty and taken the bull by the horns and asked her father to sanction her engagement in the presence of her lover but she could not do it before so many persons even though the persons were her own nearest relatives and then there arose another embarrassment sir marmaduke who had taught himself to believe that stanbury was so poor as hardly to have the price of a dinner in his pocketalthough in fact our friend hugh was probably the richer man of the twosaid something about defraying the cost of the journey it is taken altogether on our behalf said sir marmaduke hugh became red in the face looked angry and muttered a word or two about trevelyan being the oldest friend he had in the worldeven if there were nothing else sir marmaduke felt ashamed of himselfwithout cause indeed for the offer was naturalsaid nothing further about it but appeared to be more stiff and ungainly than ever  the bradshaw was had out and consulted and nearly half an hour was spent in poring over that wondrous volume it is the fashion to abuse bradshawwe speak now especially of bradshaw the continentalbecause all the minutest details of the autumn tour just as the tourist thinks that it may be made cannot be made patent to him at once without close research amidst crowded figures after much experience we make bold to say that bradshaw knows more and will divulge more in a quarter of an hour of the properest mode of getting from any city in europe to any other city more than fifty miles distant than can be learned in that first city in a single morning with the aid of a courier a carriage a pair of horses and all the temper that any ordinary tourist possesses the bradshaw was had out and it was at last discovered that nothing could be gained in the journey from london to siena by starting in the morning intending as he did to travel through without sleeping on the road stanbury could not do better than leave london by the night mail train and this he determined to do but when that was arranged then came the nature of his commission what was he to do no commission could be given to him a telegram should be sent to emily the next morning to say that he was coming and then he would hurry on and take his orders from her  they were all in doubt terribly in doubt whether the aggravated malady of which the telegram spoke was malady of the mind or of the body if of the former nature then the difficulty might be very great indeed and it would be highly expedient that stanbury should have some one in italy to assist him it was nora who suggested that he should carry a letter of introduction to mr spalding and it was she who wrote it sir marmaduke had not foregathered very closely with the english minister and nothing was said of assistance that should be peculiarly british then at last about three or four in the morning came the moment for parting sir marmaduke had suggested that stanbury should dine with them on the next day before he started but hugh had declined alleging that as the day was at his command it must be devoted to the work of providing for his absence in truth sir marmaduke had given the invitation with a surly voice and hugh though he was ready to go to the north pole for any others of the family was at the moment in an aggressive mood of mind towards sir marmaduke  i will send a message directly i get there he said holding lady rowley by the hand and will write fullyto youimmediately  god bless you my dear friend said lady rowley crying  good night sir marmaduke said hugh  good night mr stanbury  then he gave a hand to the two girls each of whom as she took it sobbed and looked away from nora nora was standing away from them by herself and away from the door holding on to her chair and with her hands clasped together she had prepared nothingnot a word or an attitude not a thought for his farewell but she had felt that it was coming and had known that she must trust to him for a cue for her own demeanour if he could say adieu with a quiet voice and simply with a touch of the hand then would she do the sameand endeavour to think no worse of him nor had he prepared anything but when the moment came he could not leave her after that fashion he stood a moment hesitating not approaching her and merely called her by her namenora for a moment she was still for a moment she held by her chair and then she rushed into his arms he did not much care for her father now but kissed her hair and her forehead and held her closely to his bosom my own own nora  it was necessary that sir marmaduke should say something there was at first a little scene between all the women during which he arranged his deportment mr stanbury he said let it be so i could wish for my childs sake and also for your own that your means of living were less precarious hugh accepted this simply as an authority for another embrace and then he allowed them all to go to bed     chapter xcii  trevelyan discourses on life   stanbury made his journey without pause or hindrance till he reached florence and as the train for siena made it necessary that he should remain there for four or five hours he went to an inn and dressed and washed himself and had a meal and was then driven to mr spaldings house he found the american minister at home and was received with cordiality but mr spalding could tell him little or nothing about trevelyan they went up to mrs spaldings room and hugh was told by her that she had seen mrs trevelyan once since her nieces marriage and that then she had represented her husband as being very feeble hugh in the midst of his troubles was amused by a second and a third perhaps by a fourth reference to lady peterborough mrs spaldings latest tidings as to the trevelyans had been received through lady peterborough from nora rowley lady peterborough was at the present moment at naples but was expected to pass north through florence in a day or two they the spaldings themselves were kept in florence in this very hot weather by this circumstance they were going up to the tyrolese mountains for a few weeks as soon as lady peterborough should have left them for england lady peterborough would have been so happy to make mr stanburys acquaintance and to have heard something direct from her friend nora then mrs spalding smiled archly showing thereby that she knew all about hugh stanbury and his relation to nora rowley from all which and in accordance with the teaching which we gotalas now many years agofrom a great master on the subject we must conclude that poor dear mrs spalding was a snob nevertheless with all deference to the memory of that great master we think that mrs spaldings allusions to the success in life achieved by her niece were natural and altogether pardonable and that reticence on the subjecta calculated determination to abstain from mentioning a triumph which must have been very dear to herwould have betrayed on the whole a condition of mind lower than that which she exhibited while rank wealth and money are held to be good things by all around us let them be acknowledged as such it is natural that a mother should be as proud when her daughter marries an earls heir as when her son becomes senior wrangler and when we meet a lady in mrs spaldings condition who purposely abstains from mentioning the name of her titled daughter we shall be disposed to judge harshly of the secret workings of that ladys thoughts on the subject we prefer the exhibition which we feel to be natural mr spalding got our friend by the buttonhole and was making him a speech on the perilous condition in which mrs trevelyan was placed but stanbury urged by the circumstances of his position pulled out his watch pleaded the hour and escaped  he found mrs trevelyan waiting for him at the station at siena he would hardly have known hernot from any alteration that was physically personal to herself not that she had become older in face or thin or grey or sicklybut that the trouble of her life had robbed her for the time of that brightness of apparel of that pride of feminine gear of that sheen of highbred womanly bearing with which our wives and daughters are so careful to invest themselves she knew herself to be a wretched woman whose work in life now was to watch over a poor prostrate wretch and who had thrown behind her all ideas of grace and beauty it was not quickly that this condition had come upon her she had been unhappy at nuncombe putney but unhappiness had not then told upon the outward woman she had been more wretched still at st diddulphs and all the outward circumstances of life in her uncles parsonage had been very wearisome to her but she had striven against it all and the sheen and outward brightness had still been there after that her child had been taken from her and the days which she had passed in manchester street had been very grievousbut even yet she had not given way it was not till her child had been brought back to her and she had seen the life which her husband was living and that her angerhot angerhad been changed to pity and that with pity love had returned it was not till this point had come in her sad life that her dress became always black and sombre that a veil habitually covered her face that a bonnet took the place of the jaunty hat that she had worn and that the prettinesses of her life were lain aside it is very good of you to come she said very good i hardly knew what to do i was so wretched on the day that i sent he was so bad that i was obliged to do something stanbury of course inquired after trevelyans health as they were being driven up to mrs trevelyans lodgings on the day on which she had sent the telegram her husband had again been furiously angry with her she had interfered or had endeavoured to interfere in some arrangements as to his health and comfort and he had turned upon her with an order that the child should be at once sent back to him and that she should immediately quit siena when i said that louey could not be sentand who could send a child into such keepinghe told me that i was the basest liar that ever broke a promise and the vilest traitor that had ever returned evil for good i was never to come to him againnever and the gate of the house would be closed against me if i appeared there  on the next day she had gone again however and had seen him and had visited him on every day since nothing further had been said about the child and he had now become almost too weak for violent anger i told him you were coming and though he would not say so i think he is glad of it he expects you tomorrow  i will go this evening if he will let me  not tonight i think he goes to bed almost as the sun sets i am never there myself after four or five in the afternoon i told him that you should be there tomorrowalone i have hired a little carriage and you can take it he said specially that i was not to come with you papa goes certainly on next saturday it was a saturday nowthis day on which stanbury had arrived at siena  he leaves town on friday  you must make him believe that do not tell him suddenly but bring it in by degrees he thinks that i am deceiving him he would go back if he knew that papa were gone  they spent a long evening together and stanbury learned all that mrs trevelyan could tell him of her husbands state there was no doubt she said that his reason was affected but she thought the state of his mind was diseased in a ratio the reverse of that of his body and that when he was weakest in health then were his ideas the most clear and rational he never now mentioned colonel osbornes name but would refer to the affairs of the last two years as though they had been governed by an inexorable fate which had utterly destroyed his happiness without any fault on his part you may be sure she said that i never accuse him even when he says terrible things of mewhich he doesi never excuse myself i do not think i should answer a word if he called me the vilest thing on earth before they parted for the night many questions were of course asked about nora and hugh described the condition in which he and she stood to each other papa has consented then  yesat four oclock in the morningjust as i was leaving them  and when is it to be  nothing has been settled and i do not as yet know where she will go to when they leave london i think she will visit monkhams when the glascock people return to england  what an episode in lifeto go and see the place when it might all now have been hers  i suppose i ought to feel dreadfully ashamed of myself for having marred such promotion said hugh  nora is such a singular girlso firm so headstrong so good and so selfreliant that she will do as well with a poor man as she would have done with a rich shall i confess to you that i did wish that she should accept mr glascock and that i pressed it on her very strongly you will not be angry with me  i am only the more proud of herand of myself  when she was told of all that he had to give in the way of wealth and rank she took the bit between her teeth and would not be turned an inch of course she was in love  i hope she may never regret itthat is all  she must change her nature first everything she sees at monkhams will make her stronger in her choice with all her girlish ways she is like a rocknothing can move her  early on the next morning hugh started alone for casalunga having first however seen mrs trevelyan he took out with him certain little things for the sick mans tableas to which however he was cautioned to say not a word to the sick man himself and it was arranged that he should endeavour to fix a day for trevelyans return to england that was to be the one object in view if we could get him to england she said he and i would at any rate be together and gradually he would be taught to submit himself to advice before ten in the morning stanbury was walking up the hill to the house and wondering at the dreary hot hopeless desolation of the spot it seemed to him that no one could live alone in such a place in such weather without being driven to madness the soil was parched and dusty as though no drop of rain had fallen there for months the lizards glancing in and out of the broken walls added to the appearance of heat the vegetation itself was of a faded yellowish green as though the glare of the sun had taken the fresh colour out of it there was a noise of grasshoppers and a hum of flies in the air hardly audible but all giving evidence of the heat not a human voice was to be heard nor the sound of a human foot and there was no shelter but the sun blazed down full upon everything he took off his hat and rubbed his head with his handkerchief as he struck the door with his stick oh god to what misery had a little folly brought two human beings who had had every blessing that the world could give within their reach  in a few minutes he was conducted through the house and found trevelyan seated in a chair under the verandah which looked down upon the olive trees he did not even get up from his seat but put out his left hand and welcomed his old friend stanbury he said i am glad to see youfor auld lang synes sake when i found out this retreat i did not mean to have friends round me here i wanted to try what solitude wasand by heaven ive tried it he was dressed in a bright italian dressinggown or woollen paletotitalian as having been bought in italy though doubtless it had come from franceand on his feet he had green worked slippers and on his head a brocaded cap he had made but little other preparation for his friend in the way of dressing his long dishevelled hair came down over his neck and his beard covered his face beneath his dressinggown he had on a nightshirt and drawers and was as dirty in appearance as he was gaudy in colours sit down and let us two moralise he said i spend my life here doing nothingnothingnothing while you cudgel your brain from day to day to mislead the british public which of us two is taking the nearest road to the devil  stanbury seated himself in a second armchair which there was there in the verandah and looked as carefully as he dared to do at his friend there could be no mistake as to the restless gleam of that eye and then the affected air of ease and the wouldbe cynicism and the pretence of false motives all told the same story they used to tell us said stanbury that idleness is the root of all evil  they have been telling us since the world began so many lies that i for one have determined never to believe anything again labour leads to greed and greed to selfishness and selfishness to treachery and treachery straight to the devilstraight to the devil ha my friend all your leading articles wont lead you out of that whats the news whos alive who dead who in who out what think you of a man who has not seen a newspaper for two months and who holds no conversation with the world further than is needed for the cooking of his polenta and the cooling of his modest wineflask  you see your wife sometimes said stanbury  my wife now my friend let us drop that subject of all topics of talk it is the most distressing to man in general and i own that i am no exception to the lot wives stanbury are an evil more or less necessary to humanity and i own to being one who has not escaped the world must be populated though for what reason one does not see i have helpedto the extent of one male bantling and if you are one who consider population desirable i will express my regret that i should have done no more  it was very difficult to force trevelyan out of this humour and it was not till stanbury had risen apparently to take his leave that he found it possible to say a word as to his mission there dont you think you would be happier at home he asked  where is my home sir knight of the midnight pen  england is your home trevelyan  no sir england was my home once but i have taken the liberty accorded to me by my creator of choosing a new country italy is now my nation and casalunga is my home  every tie you have in the world is in england  i have no tie sirno tie anywhere it has been my study to untie all the ties and by jove i have succeeded look at me here i have got rid of the trammels pretty wellhavent ihave unshackled myself and thrown off the paddings and the wrappings and the swaddling clothes i have got rid of the conventionalities and can look nature straight in the face i dont even want the daily record stanburythink of that  stanbury paced the length of the terrace and then stopped for a moment down under the blaze of the sun in order that he might think how to address this philosopher have you heard he said at last that i am going to marry your sisterinlaw nora rowley  then there will be two more fullgrown fools in the world certainly and probably an infinity of young fools coming afterwards excuse me stanbury but this solitude is apt to make one plainspoken  i got sir marmadukes sanction the day before i left  then you got the sanction of an illiterate ignorant selfsufficient and most contemptible old man and much good may it do you  let him be what he may i was glad to have it most probably i shall never see him again he sails from southampton for the mandarins on this day week  he doesdoes he may the devil sail along with himthat is all i say and does my muchrespected and evertobebeloved motherinlaw sail with him  they all return togetherexcept nora  who remains to comfort you i hope you may be comfortedthat is all dont be too particular let her choose her own friends and go her own gait and have her own way and do you be blind and deaf and dumb and properly submissive and it may be that shell give you your breakfast and dinner in your own houseso long as your hours dont interfere with her pleasures if she should even urge you beside yourself by her vanity folly and disobedienceso that at last you are driven to express your feelingno doubt she will come to you after a while and tell you with the sweetest condescension that she forgives you when she has been out of your house for a twelvemonth or more she will offer to come back to you and to forget everythingon condition that you will do exactly as she bids you for the future  this attempt at satire so fatuous so plain so false together with the wouldbe jaunty manner of the speaker who however failed repeatedly in his utterances from sheer physical exhaustion was excessively painful to stanbury what can one do at any time with a madman i mentioned my marriage said he to prove my right to have an additional interest in your wifes happiness  you are quite welcome whether you marry the other one or notwelcome to take any interest you please i have got beyond all that stanburyyes by jove a long way beyond all that  you have not got beyond loving your wife and your child trevelyan  upon my word yesi think i have there may be a grain of weakness left you know but what have you to do with my love for my wife  i was thinking more just now of her love for you there she is at siena you cannot mean that she should remain there  certainly not what the deuce is there to keep her there  come with her then to england  why should i go to england with her because you bid me or because she wishes itor simply because england is the most damnable puritanical godforgotten and stupid country on the face of the globe i know no other reason for going to england will you take a glass of wine stanbury hugh declined the offer you will excuse me continued trevelyan i always take a glass of wine at this hour then he rose from his chair and helped himself from a cupboard that was near at hand stanbury watching him as he filled his glass could see that his legs were hardly strong enough to carry him and stanbury saw moreover that the unfortunate man took two glasses out of the bottle go to england indeed i do not think much of this country but it is at any rate better than england  hugh perceived that he could do nothing more on the present occasion having heard so much of trevelyans debility he had been astonished to hear the man speak with so much volubility and attempts at highflown spirit before he had taken the wine he had almost sunk into his chair but still he had continued to speak with the same fluent wouldbe cynicism i will come and see you again said hugh getting up to take his departure  you might as well save your trouble stanbury but you can come if you please you know if you should find yourself locked out you wont be angry a hermit such as i am must assume privileges  i wont be angry said hugh good humouredly  i can smell what you are come about said trevelyan you and my wife want to take me away from here among you and i think it best to stay here i dont want much for myself and why should i not live here my wife can remain at siena if she pleases or she can go to england if she pleases she must give me the same libertythe same libertythe same liberty after this he fell acoughing violently and stanbury thought it better to leave him he had been at casalunga about two hours and did not seem as yet to have done any good he had been astonished both by trevelyans weakness and by his strength by his folly and by his sharpness hitherto he could see no way for his future sisterinlaw out of her troubles  when he was with her at siena he described what had taken place with all the accuracy in his power he has intermittent days said emily tomorrow he will be in quite another frame of mindmelancholy silent perhaps and selfreproachful we will both go tomorrow and we shall find probably that he has forgotten altogether what has passed today between you and him  so their plans for the morrow were formed     chapter xciii  say that you forgive me      illustration  on the following day again early in the morning mrs trevelyan and stanbury were driven out to casalunga the country people along the road knew the carriage well and the lady who occupied it and would say that the english wife was going to see her mad husband mrs trevelyan knew that these words were common in the peoples mouths and explained to her companion how necessary it would be to use these rumours to aid her in putting some restraint over her husband even in this country should they fail in their effort to take him to england she saw the doctor in siena constantly and had learned from him how such steps might be taken the measure proposed would be slow difficult inefficient and very hard to set aside if once takenbut still it might be indispensable that something should be done he would be so much worse off here than he would be at home she saidif we could only make him understand that it would be so then stanbury asked about the wine it seemed that of late trevelyan had taken to drink freely but only of the wine of the country but the wine of the country in these parts is sufficiently stimulating and mrs trevelyan acknowledged that hence had arisen a further cause of fear  they walked up the hill together and mrs trevelyan now well knowing the ways of the place went round at once to the front terrace there he was seated in his armchair dressed in the same way as yesterday dirty dishevelled and gaudy with various colours but stanbury could see at once that his mood had greatly changed he rose slowly dragging himself up out of his chair as they came up to him but shewing as he did soand perhaps somewhat assumingthe impotency of querulous sickness his wife went to him and took him by the hand and placed him back in his chair he was weak he said and had not slept and suffered from the heat and then he begged her to give him wine this she did half filling for him a tumbler of which he swallowed the contents greedily you see me very poorly stanburyvery poorly he said seeming to ignore all that had taken place on the previous day  you want change of climate old fellow said stanbury  change of everythingi want change of everything he said if i could have a new body and a new mind and a new soul  the mind and soul dear will do well enough if you will let us look after the body said his wife seating herself on a stool near his feet stanbury who had settled beforehand how he would conduct himself took out a cigar and lighted itand then they sat together silent or nearly silent for half an hour she had said that if hugh would do so trevelyan would soon become used to the presence of his old friend and it seemed that he had already done so more than once when he coughed his wife fetched him some drink in a cup which he took from her without a word and stanbury the while went on smoking in silence  you have heard louis she said at last that after all nora and mr stanbury are going to be married  ahyes i think i was told of it i hope you may be happy stanburyhappier than i have been this was unfortunate but neither of the visitors winced or said a word  it will be a pity that papa and mamma cannot be present at the wedding said mrs trevelyan  if i had to do it again i should not regret your fathers absence i must say that he has been my enemy yes stanburymy enemy i dont care who hears me say so i am obliged to stay here because that man would swear every shilling i have away from me if i were in england he would strive to do so and the struggle in my state of health would be too much for me  but sir marmaduke sails from southampton this very week said stanbury  i dont know he is always sailing and always coming back again i never asked him for a shilling in my life and yet he has treated me as though i were his bitterest enemy  he will trouble you no more now louis said mrs trevelyan  he cannot trouble you again he will have left england before you can possibly reach it  he will have left other traitors behind himthough none as bad as himself said trevelyan  stanbury when his cigar was finished rose and left the husband and wife together on the terrace there was little enough to be seen at casalunga but he strolled about looking at the place he went into the huge granary and then down among the olive trees and up into the sheds which had been built for beasts he stood and teased the lizards and listened to the hum of the insects and wiped away the perspiration which rose to his brow even as he was standing and all the while he was thinking what he would do next or what say next with the view of getting trevelyan away from the place hitherto he had been very tender with him contradicting him in nothing taking from him good humouredly any absurd insult which he chose to offer pressing upon him none of the evil which he had himself occasioned saying to him no word that could hurt either his pride or his comfort but he could not see that this would be efficacious for the purpose desired he had come thither to help noras sister in her terrible distress and he must take upon himself to make some plan for giving this aid when he had thought of all this and made his plan he sauntered back round the house on to the terrace she was still there sitting at her husbands feet and holding one of his hands in hers it was well that the wife should be tender but he doubted whether tenderness would suffice  trevelyan he said you know why i have come over here  i suppose she told you to come said trevelyan  well yes she did tell me i came to try and get you back to england if you remain here the climate and solitude together will kill you  as for the climate i like itand as for solitude i have got used even to that  and then there is another thing said stanbury  what is that asked trevelyan starting  you are not safe here  how not safe  she could not tell you but i must his wife was still holding his hand and he did not at once attempt to withdraw it but he raised himself in his chair and fixed his eyes fiercely on stanbury they will not let you remain here quietly said stanbury  who will not  the italians they are already saying that you are not fit to be alone and if once they get you into their handsunder some italian medical board perhaps into some italian asylum it might be years before you could get outif ever i have come to tell you what the danger is i do not know whether you will believe me  is it so he said turning to his wife  i believe it is louis  and who has told them who has been putting them up to it now his hand had been withdrawn my god am i to be followed here too with such persecution as this  nobody has told thembut people have eyes  liar traitor fiendit is you he said turning upon his wife  louis as i hope for mercy i have said not a word to any one that could injure you  trevelyan do not be so unjust and so foolish said stanbury it is not her doing do you suppose that you can live here like this and give rise to no remarks do you think that peoples eyes are not open and that their tongues will not speak i tell you you are in danger here  what am i to do where am i to go can not they let me stay till i die whom am i hurting here she may have all my money if she wants it she has got my child  i want nothing louis but to take you where you may be safe and well  why are you afraid of going to england stanbury asked  because they have threatened to put mein a madhouse  nobody ever thought of so treating you said his wife  your father didand your mother they told me so  look here trevelyan sir marmaduke and lady rowley are gone they will have sailed at least before we can reach england whatever may have been either their wishes or their power they can do nothing now here something would be donevery soon you may take my word for that if you will return with me and your wife you shall choose your own place of abode is not that so emily  he shall choose everything his boy will be with him and i will be with him and he shall be contradicted in nothing if he only knew my heart towards him  you hear what she says trevelyan  yes i hear her  and you believe her  im not so sure of that stanbury how should you like to be locked up in a madhouse and grin through the bars till your heart was broken it would not take long with me i know  you shall never be locked upnever be touched said his wife  i am very harmless here he said almost crying very harmless i do not think anybody here will touch me he added afterwards and there are other places there are other places my god that i should be driven about the world like this the conference was ended by his saying that he would take two days to think of it and by his then desiring that they would both leave him they did so and descended the hill together knowing that he was watching themthat he would watch them till they were out of sight from the gatefor as mrs trevelyan said he never came down the hill now knowing that the labour of ascending it was too much for him when they were at the carriage they were met by one of the women of the house and strict injunctions were given to her by mrs trevelyan to send on word to siena if the signore should prepare to move he cannot go far without my knowing it said she because he draws his money in siena and lately i have taken to him what he wants he has not enough with him for a long journey for stanbury had suggested that he might be off to seek another residence in another country and that they would find casalunga vacant when they reached it on the following tuesday but he told himself almost immediatelynot caring to express such an opinion to emilythat trevelyan would hardly have strength even to prepare for such a journey by himself  on the intervening day the monday stanbury had no occupation whatever and he thought that since he was born no day had ever been so long siena contains many monuments of interest and much that is valuable in arthaving had a school of painting of its own and still retaining in its public gallery specimens of its school of which as a city it is justly proud there are palaces there to be beaten for gloomy majesty by none in italy there is a cathedral which was to have been the largest in the world and than which few are more worthy of prolonged inspection the town is old and quaint and picturesque and dirty and attractiveas it becomes a town in italy to be but in july all such charms are thrown away in july italy is not a land of charms to an englishman poor stanbury did wander into the cathedral and finding it the coolest place in the town went to sleep on a stone step he was awoke by the voice of the priests as they began to chant the vespers the goodnatured italians had let him sleep and would have let him sleep till the doors were closed for the night at five he dined with mrs trevelyan and then endeavoured to while away the evening thinking of nora with a pipe in his mouth he was standing in this way at the hotel gateway when on a sudden all siena was made alive by the clatter of an open carriage and four on its way through the town to the railway on looking up stanbury saw lord peterborough in the carriagewith a lady whom he did not doubt to be lord peterboroughs wife he himself had not been recognised but he slowly followed the carriage to the railway station after the italian fashion the arrival was threequarters of an hour before the proper time and stanbury had full opportunity of learning their news and telling his own they were coming up from rome and thought it preferable to take the route by siena than to use the railway through the maremma and they intended to reach florence that night  and do you think he is really mad asked lady peterborough  he is undoubtedly so mad as to be unfit to manage anything for himself but he is not in such a condition that any one would wish to see him put into confinement if he were raving mad there would be less difficulty though there might be more distress  a great deal was said about nora and both lord peterborough and his wife insisted that the marriage should take place at monkhams we shall be home now in less than three weeks said caroline and she must come to us at once but i will write to her from florence and tell her how we saw you smoking your pipe under the archway not that my husband knew you in the least  upon my word no said the husbandone didnt expect to find you here goodbye i hope you may succeed in getting him home i went to him once but could do very little then the train started and stanbury went back to mrs trevelyan  on the next day stanbury went out to casalunga alone he had calculated on leaving england that if any good might be done at siena it could be done in three days and that he would have been able to start on his return on the wednesday morningor on wednesday evening at the latest but now there did not seem to be any chance of thatand he hardly knew how to guess when he might get away he had sent a telegram to lady rowley after his first visit in which he had simply said that things were not at all changed at casalunga and he had written to nora each day since his arrival his stay was prolonged at great expense and inconvenience to himself and yet it was impossible that he should go and leave his work half finished as he walked up the hill to the house he felt very angry with trevelyan and prepared himself to use hard words and dreadful threats but at the very moment of his entrance on the terrace trevelyan professed himself ready to go to england thats right old fellow said hugh i am so glad but in expressing his joy he had hardly noticed trevelyans voice and appearance  i might as well go he said it matters little where i am or whether they say that i am mad or sane  when we have you over there nobody shall say a word that is disagreeable  i only hope that you may not have the trouble of burying me on the road you dont know stanbury how ill i am i cannot eat if i were at the bottom of that hill i could no more walk up it than i could fly i cannot sleep and at night my bed is wet through with perspiration i can remember nothingnothing but what i ought to forget  well put you on to your legs again when we get you to your own climate  i shall be a poor travellera poor traveller but i will do my best  when would he start that was the next question trevelyan asked for a week and stanbury brought him down at last to three days they would go to florence by the evening train on friday and sleep there emily should come out and assist him to arrange his things on the morrow having finished so much of his business stanbury returned to siena  they both feared that he might be found on the next day to have departed from his intention but no such idea seemed to have occurred to him he gave instructions as to the notice to be served on the agent from the hospital as to his house and allowed emily to go among his things and make preparations for the journey he did not say much to her and when she attempted with a soft halfuttered word to assure him that the threat of italian interference which had come from stanbury had not reached stanbury from her he simply shook his head sadly she could not understand whether he did not believe her or whether he simply wished that the subject should be dropped she could elicit no sign of affection from him nor would he willingly accept such from herbut he allowed her to prepare for the journey and never hinted that his purpose might again be liable to change on the friday emily with her child and hugh with all their baggage travelled out on the road to casalunga thinking it better that there should be no halt in the town on their return at casalunga hugh went up the hill with the driver leaving mrs trevelyan in the carriage he had been out at the house before in the morning and had given all necessary ordersbut still at the last moment he thought that there might be failure but trevelyan was ready having dressed himself up with a laced shirt and changed his dressinggown for a blue frockcoat and his brocaded cap for a paris hat very pointed before and behind and closely turned up at the sides but stanbury did not in the least care for his friends dress take my arm he said and we will go down fair and easy emily would not come up because of the heat he suffered himself to be led or almost carried down the hill and three women and the coachman and an old countryman who worked on the farm followed with the luggage it took about an hour and a half to pack the things but at last they were all packed and corded and bound together with sticks as though it were intended that they should travel in that form to moscow trevelyan the meanwhile sat on a chair which had been brought out for him from one of the cottages and his wife stood beside him with her boy now then we are ready said stanbury and in that way they bade farewell to casalunga trevelyan sat speechless in the carriage and would not even notice the child he seemed to be half dreaming and to fix his eyes on vacancy he appears to think of nothing now emily said that evening to stanbury but who can tell how busy and how troubled are the thoughts of a madman  they had now succeeded in their object of inducing their patient to return with them to england but what were they to do with him when they had reached home with him they rested only a night at florence but they found their fellowtraveller so weary that they were unable to get beyond bologna on the second day many questions were asked of him as to where he himself would wish to take up his residence in england but it was found almost impossible to get an answer once he suggested that he would like to go back to mrs fullers cottage at willesden from whence they concluded that he would wish to live somewhere out of london on his first days journey he was moody and silentwilfully assuming the airs of a muchinjured person he spoke hardly at all and would notice nothing that was said to him by his wife he declared once that he regarded stanbury as his keeper and endeavoured to be disagreeable and sullenly combative but on the second day he was too weak for this and accepted without remonstrance the attentions that were paid to him at bologna they rested a day and from thence both stanbury and mrs trevelyan wrote to nora they did not know where she might be now staying but the letters by agreement were addressed to greggs hotel it was suggested that lodgings or if possible a small furnished house should be taken in the neighbourhood of mortlake richmond or teddington and that a telegram as well as a letter should be sent to them at the paris hotel as they could not travel quick there might be time enough for them in this way to know whither they should go on their reaching london  they stayed a day at bologna and then they went on againto turin over the mountains to chambery thence to dijon and on to paris at chambery they remained a couple of days fancying that the air there was cool and that the delay would be salutary to the sick man at turin finding that they wanted further assistance they had hired a courier and at last trevelyan allowed himself to be carried in and out of the carriages and up and down the hotel stairs almost as though he were a child the delay was terribly grievous to stanbury and mrs trevelyan perceiving this more than once begged him to leave them and to allow her to finish the journey with the aid of the courier but this he could not do he wrote letters to his friends at the d r office explaining his position as well as he could and suggesting that this and that able assistant should enlighten the british people on this and that subject which wouldin the course of nature as arranged at the d r officehave fallen into his hands he and mrs trevelyan became as brother and sister to each other on their way homeas indeed it was natural that they should do were they doing right or wrong in this journey that they were taking they could not conceal from themselves that the labour was almost more than the poor wretch could endure and that it might be as he himself had suggested that they would be called on to bury him on the road but that residence at casalunga had been so terriblethe circumstances of it including the solitude sickness madness and habits of life of the wretched hermit had been so dangerousthe probability of interference on the part of some native authority so great and the chance of the house being left in trevelyans possession so small that it had seemed to him that they had no other alternative and yet how would it be if they were killing him by the toil of travelling from chambery they made the journey to paris in two days and during that time trevelyan hardly opened his mouth he slept much and ate better than he had done in the hotter climate on the other side of the alps  they found a telegram at paris which simply contained the promise of a letter for the next day it had been sent by nora before she had gone out on her search but it contained one morsel of strange information lady milborough is going with me on the next day they got a letter saying that a cottage had been taken furnished between richmond and twickenham lady milborough had known of the cottage and everything would be ready then nora would herself meet them at the station in london if they would as she proposed stay a night at dover they were to address to her at lady milboroughs house in eccleston square in that case she would have a carriage for them at the victoria station and would go down with them at once to the cottage  there were to be two days more of weary travelling and then they were to be at home again she and he would have a house together as husband and wife and the curse of their separation would at any rate be over her mind towards him had changed altogether since the days in which she had been so indignant because he had set a policeman to watch over her all feeling of anger was over with her now there is nothing that a woman will not forgive a man when he is weaker than she is herself  the journey was made first to dover and then to london once as they were making their way through the kentish hopfields he put out his hand feebly and touched hers they had the carriage to themselves and she was down on her knees before him instantly oh louis oh louis say that you forgive me what could a woman do more than that in her mercy to a man  yesyes yes he said but do not talk now i am so tired     chapter xciv  a real christian   in the meantime the rowleys were gone on the monday after the departure of stanbury for italy lady rowley had begun to look the difficulty about nora in the face and to feel that she must do something towards providing the poor girl with a temporary home everybody had now agreed that she was to marry hugh stanbury as soon as hugh stanbury could be ready and it was not to be thought of that she should be left out in the world as one in disgrace or under a cloud but what was to be done sir marmaduke was quite incapable of suggesting anything he would make her an allowance and leave her a small sum of ready moneybut as to residence he could only suggest again and again that she should be sent to mrs outhouse now lady rowley was herself not very fond of mrs outhouse and she was aware that nora herself was almost as averse to st diddulphs as she was to the mandarins nora already knew that she had the game in her own hands once when in her presence her father suggested the near relationship and prudent character and intense respectability of mrs outhouse nora who was sitting behind sir marmaduke shook her head at her mother and lady rowley knew that nora would not go to st diddulphs this was the last occasion on which that proposition was discussed  throughout all the trevelyan troubles lady milborough had continued to shew a friendly anxiety on behalf of emily trevelyan she had called once or twice on lady rowley and lady rowley had of course returned the visits she had been forward in expressing her belief that in truth the wife had been but little if at all to blame and had won her way with lady rowley though she had never been a favourite with either of lady rowleys daughters now in her difficulty lady rowley went to lady milborough and returned with an invitation that nora should come to eccleston square either till such time as she might think fit to go to monkhams or till mrs trevelyan should have returned and should be desirous of having her sister with her when nora first heard of this she almost screamed with surprise and if the truth must be told with disappointment also  she never liked me mamma  then she is so much more goodnatured  but i dont want to go to her merely because she is goodnatured enough to receive a person she dislikes i know she is very good i know she would sacrifice herself for anything she thought right but mamma she is such a bore  but lady rowley would not be talked down even by nora in this fashion nora was somewhat touched with an idea that it would be a fine independent thing to live alone if it were only for a week or two just because other young ladies never lived alone perhaps there was some halfformed notion in her mind that permission to do so was part of the reward due to her for having refused to marry a lord stanbury was in some respects a bohemian and it would become her she thought to have a little practice herself in the bohemian line she had indeed declined a bohemian marriage feeling strongly averse to encounter the loud displeasure of her father and motherbut as long as everything was quite proper as long as there should be no running away or subjection of her name to scandal she considered that a little independence would be useful and agreeable she had looked forward to sitting up at night alone by a single tallow candle to stretching a beefsteak so as to last her for two days dinners and perhaps to making her own bed now there would not be the slightest touch of romance in a visit to lady milboroughs house in eccleston square at the end of july lady rowley however was of a different opinion and spoke her mind plainly nora my dear dont be a fool a young lady like you cant go and live in lodgings by herself all manner of things would be said and this is such a very kind offer you must accept itfor hughs sake i have already said that you would accept it  but she will be going out of town  she will stay till you can go to monkhamsif emily is not back before then she knows all about emilys affairs and if she does come backwhich i doubt poor thinglady milborough and you will be able to judge whether you should go to her so it was settled and noras bohemian castle in the air fell into shatters  the few remaining days before the departure to southampton passed quickly but yet sadly sir marmaduke had come to england expecting pleasureand with that undefined idea which men so employed always have on their return home that something will turn up which will make their going back to that same banishment unnecessary what governor of hongkong what minister to bogota what general of the forces at the gold coast ever left the scene of his official or military labours without a hope which was almost an expectation that a grateful country would do something better for him before the period of his return should have arrived but a grateful country was doing nothing better for sir marmaduke and an ungrateful secretary of state at the colonial office would not extend the term during which he could regard himself as absent on special service how thankful he had been when first the tidings reached him that he was to come home at the expense of the crown and without diminution of his official income he had now been in england for five months with a per diem allowance with his very cabs paid for him and he was discontented sullen and with nothing to comfort him but his official grievance because he could not be allowed to extend his period of special service more than two months beyond the time at which those special services were in truth ended there had been a change of ministry in the last month and he had thought that a conservative secretary of state would have been kinder to him the duke says i can stay three months with leave of absenceand have half my pay stopped i wonder whether it ever enters into his august mind that even a colonial governor must eat and drink it was thus he expressed his great grievance to his wife the duke however had been as inexorable as his predecessor and sir rowley with his large family was too wise to remain to the detriment of his pocket in the meantime the clerks in the office who had groaned in spirit over the ignorance displayed in his evidence before the committee were whispering among themselves that he ought not to be sent back to his seat of government at all  lady rowley also was disappointed and unhappy she had expected so much pleasure from her visit to her daughter and she had received so little emilys condition was very sad but in her heart of hearts perhaps she groaned more bitterly over all that nora had lost than she did over the real sorrows of her elder child to have had the cup at her lip and then not to have tasted it and she had the solace of no communion in this sorrow she had accepted hugh stanbury as her soninlaw and not for worlds would she now say a word against him to any one she had already taken him to her heart and she loved him but to have had it almost within her grasp to have had a lord the owner of monkhams for her soninlaw poor lady rowley  sophie and lucy too were returning to their distant and dull banishment without any realisation of their probable but unexpressed ambition they made no complaint but yet it was hard on them that their sisters misfortune should have prevented them from goingalmost to a single dance poor sophie and poor lucy they must go and we shall hear no more about them it was thought well that nora should not go down with them to southampton what good would her going do god bless you my darling said the mother as she held her child in her arms  goodbye dear mamma  give my best love to hugh and tell him that i pray him with my last word to be good to you even then she was thinking of lord peterborough but the memory of what might have been was buried deep in her mind  nora tell me all about it said lucy  there will be nothing to tell said nora  tell it all the same said lucy and bring hugh out to write a book of travels about the mandarins nobody has ever written a book about the mandarins so they parted and when sir marmaduke and his party were taken off in two cabs to the waterloo station nora was taken in one cab to eccleston square  it may be doubted whether any old lady since the world began ever did a more thoroughly christian and friendly act than this which was now being done by lady milborough it was the end of july and she would already have been down in dorsetshire but for her devotion to this good deed for in truth what she was doing was not occasioned by any express love for nora rowley nora rowley was all very well but nora rowley towards her had been flippant impatient and indeed not always so civil as a young lady should be to the elderly friends of her married sister but to lady milborough it had seemed to be quite terrible that a young girl should be left alone in the world without anybody to take care of her young ladies according to her views of life were fragile plants that wanted much nursing before they could be allowed to be planted out in the gardens of the world as married women when she heard from lady rowley that nora was engaged to marry hugh stanburyyou know all about lord peterborough lady milborough but it is no use going back to that nowis it and mr stanbury has behaved so exceedingly well in regard to poor louiswhen lady milborough heard this and heard also that nora was talking of going to live by herselfin lodgingsshe swore to herself like a goodly christian woman as she was that such a thing must not be eccleston square in july and august is not pleasant unless it be to an inhabitant who is interested in the fagend of the parliamentary session lady milborough had no interest in politicshad not much interest even in seeing the social season out to its dregs she ordinarily remained in london till the beginning or middle of july because the people with whom she lived were in the habit of doing sobut as soon as ever she had fixed the date of her departure that day to her was a day of release on this occasion the day had been fixedand it was unfixed and changed and postponed because it was manifest to lady milborough that she could do good by remaining for another fortnight when she made the offer she said nothing of her previous arrangements lady rowley let her come to me as soon as her friend lady peterborough is at monkhams she can go there  thus it was that nora found herself established in eccleston square as she took her place in lady milboroughs drawingrooms she remembered well a certain day now two years ago when she had first heard of the glories of monkhams in that very house lady milborough as goodnatured then as she was now had brought mr glascock and nora together simply because she had heard that the gentleman admired the young lady nora in her pride had resented this as interferencehad felt that the thing had been done and though she had valued the admiration of the man had ridiculed the action of the woman as she thought of it now she was softened by gratitude she had not on that occasion been suited with a husband but she had gained a friend my dear said lady milborough as at her request nora took off her hat i am afraid that the parties are mostly overthat is those i go to but we will drive out every day and the time wont be so very long  it wont be long for me lady milboroughbut i cannot but know how terribly i am putting you out  i am never put out miss rowley said the old lady as long as i am made to think that what i do is taken in good part  indeed indeed it shall be taken in good part said noraindeed it shall and she swore a solemn silent vow of friendship for the dear old woman  then there came letters and telegrams from chambery dijon and paris and the joint expedition in search of the cottage was made to twickenham it was astonishing how enthusiastic and how loving the elder and the younger lady were together before the party from italy had arrived in england nora had explained everything about herselfhow impossible it had been for her not to love hugh stanbury how essential it had been for her happiness and selfesteem that she should refuse mr glascock how terrible had been the tragedy of her sisters marriage lady milborough spoke of the former subject with none of lady rowleys enthusiasm but still with an evident partiality for her own rank which almost aroused nora to indignant eloquence lady milborough was contented to acknowledge that nora might be right seeing that her heart was so firmly fixed but she was clearly of opinion that mr glascock being mr glascock had possessed a better right to the prize in question than could have belonged to any man who had no recognised position in the world seeing that her heart had been given away nora was no doubt right not to separate her hand from her heart but lady milborough was of opinion that young ladies ought to have their hearts under better control so that the men entitled to the prizes should get them it was for the welfare of england at large that the eldest sons of good families should marry the sweetest prettiest brightest and most lovable girls of their age it is a doctrine on behalf of which very much may be said  on that other matter touching emily trevelyan lady milborough frankly owned that she had seen early in the day that he was the one most in fault i must say my dear she said that i very greatly dislike your friend colonel osborne  i am sure that he meant not the slightest harmno more than she did  he was old enough and ought to have known better and when the first hint of an uneasiness in the mind of louis was suggested to him his feelings as a gentleman should have prompted him to remove himself let the suspicion have been ever so absurd he should have removed himself instead of that he went after herinto devonshire  he went to see other friends lady milborough  i hope it may have been soi hope it may have been so but he should have cut off his hand before he rang at the door of the house in which she was living you will understand my dear that i acquit your sister altogether i did so all through and said the same to poor louis when he came to me but colonel osborne should have known better why did he write to her why did he go to st diddulphs why did he let it be thought thatthat she was especially his friend oh dear oh dear oh dear i am afraid he is a very bad man  we had known him so long lady milborough  i wish you had never known him at all poor louis if he had only done what i told him at first all might have been well go to naples with your wife i said go to naples if he had gone to naples there would have been no journeys to siena no living at casalunga no separation but he didnt seem to see it in the same light poor dear louis i wish he had gone to naples when i told him  while they were going backwards and forwards looking at the cottage at twickenham and trying to make things comfortable there for the sick man lady milborough hinted to nora that it might be distasteful to trevelyan in his present condition to have even a sisterinlaw staying in the house with him there was a little chamber which nora had appropriated to herself and at first it seemed to be taken for granted that she should remain there at least till the 10th of august on which day lady peterborough had signified that she and her husband would be ready to receive their visitor but lady milborough slept on the suggestion and on the next morning hinted her disapprobation you shall take them down in the carriage and their luggage can follow in a cabbut the carriage can bring you back you will see how things are then  dear lady milborough you would go out of town at once if i left you  and i shall not go out of town if you dont leave me what difference does it make to an old woman like me i have got no lover coming to look for me and all i have to do is to tell my daughterinlaw that i shall not be there for another week or so augusta is very glad to have me but she is the wisest woman in the world and can get on very well without me  and as i am the silliest i cannot  you shall put it in that way if you like it my dear girls in your position often do want assistance i dare say you think me very straightlaced but i am quite sure mr stanbury will be grateful to me as you are to be married from monkhams it will be quite well that you should pass thither through my house as an intermediate restingplace after leaving your father and mother by all which lady milborough intended to express an opinion that the value of the article which hugh stanbury would receive at the altar would be enhanced by the distinguished purity of the hands through which it had passed before it came into his possessionin which opinion she was probably right as regarded the price put upon the article by the world at large though it may perhaps be doubted whether the recipient himself would be of the same opinion  i hope you know that i am grateful whatever he may be said nora after a pause  i think that you take it as it is meant and that makes me quite comfortable  lady milborough i shall love you for ever and ever i dont think i ever knew anybody so good as you areor so nice  then i shall be more than comfortable said lady milborough after that there was an embrace and the thing was settled     chapter xcv  trevelyan back in england   nora with lady milboroughs carriage and lady milboroughs coach and footman and with a cab ready for the luggage close behind the carriage was waiting at the railway station when the party from dover arrived she soon saw hugh upon the platform and ran to him with her news they had not a word to say to each other of themselves so anxious were they both respecting trevelyan we got a bedcarriage for him at dover said hugh and i think he has borne the journey pretty wellbut he feels the heat almost as badly as in italy you will hardly know him when you see him then when the rush of passengers was gone trevelyan was brought out by hugh and the courier and placed in lady milboroughs carriage he just smiled as his eye fell upon nora but he did not even put out his hand to greet her  i am to go in the carriage with him said his wife  of course you areand so will i and louey i think there will be room it is so large there is a cab for all the things dear emily i am so glad to see you  dearest nora i shall be able to speak to you byandby but you must not be angry with me now how good you have been  has not she been good i dont understand about the cottage it belongs to some friend of hers and i have not been able to say a word about the rent it is so niceand looks upon the river i hope that he will like it  you will be with us  not just at first lady milborough thinks i had better notthat he will like it better i will come down almost every day and will stay if you think he will like it  these few words were said while the men were putting trevelyan into the carriage and then another arrangement was made hugh hired a second cab in which he and the courier made a part of the procession and so they all went to twickenham together hugh had not yet learned that he would be rewarded by coming back alone with nora in the carriage  the cottage by the river thames which as far as the party knew was nameless was certainly very much better than the house on the top of the hill at casalunga and now at last the wife would sleep once more under the same roof with her husband and the separation would be over i suppose that is the thames said trevelyan and they were nearly the only words he spoke in noras hearing that evening before she started on her return journey the two sisters were together for a few minutes and each told her own budget of news in short broken fragments there was not much to tell he is so weak said mrs trevelyan that he can do literally nothing he can hardly speak when we give him wine he will say a few words and his mind seems then to be less astray than it was i have told him just simply that it was all my doingthat i have been in fault all through and every now and then he will say a word to shew me that he remembers that i have confessed  my poor emily  it was better so what does it all matter he had suffered so that i would have said worse than that to give him relief the pride has gone out of me so that i do not regard what anybody may say of course it will be said that iwent astray and that he forgave me  nobody will say that dearest nobody lady milborough is quite aware how it all was  what does it signify there are things in life worse even than a bad name  but he does not think it  nora his mind is a mystery to me i do not know what is in it sometimes i fancy that all facts have been forgotten and that he merely wants the childish gratification of being assured that he is the master then again there come moments in which i feel sure that suspicion is lurking within him that he is remembering the past and guarding against the future when he came into this house a quarter of an hour ago he was fearful lest there was a mad doctor lurking about to pounce on him i can see in his eye that he had some such idea he hardly notices loueythough there was a time even at casalunga when he would not let the child out of his sight  what will you do now  i will try to do my dutythat is all  but you will have a doctor  of course he was content to see one in paris though he would not let me be present hugh saw the gentleman afterwards and he seemed to think that the body was worse than the mind then nora told her the name of a doctor whom lady milborough had suggested and took her departure along with hugh in the carriage  in spite of all the sorrow that they had witnessed and just left their journey up to london was very pleasant perhaps there is no period so pleasant among all the pleasant periods of lovemaking as that in which the intimacy between the lovers is so assured and the coming event so near as to produce and to endure conversation about the ordinary little matters of lifewhat can be done with the limited means at their mutual disposal how that life shall be begun which they are to lead together what idea each has of the others duties what each can do for the other what each will renounce for the other there was a true sense of the delight of intimacy in the girl who declared that she had never loved her lover so well as when she told him how many pairs of stockings she had got it is very sweet to gaze at the stars together and it is sweet to sit out among the haycocks the reading of poetry together out of the same book with brows all close and arms all mingled is very sweet the pouring out of the whole heart in written words which the writer knows would be held to be ridiculous by any eyes and any ears and any sense but the eyes and ears and sense of the dear one to whom they are sent is very sweetbut for the girl who has made a shirt for the man that she loves there has come a moment in the last stitch of it sweeter than any that stars haycocks poetry or superlative epithets have produced nora rowley had never as yet been thus useful on behalf of hugh stanbury had she done so she might perhaps have been happier even than she was during this journeybut without the shirt it was one of the happiest moments of her life there was nothing now to separate them but their own prudential scruplesand of them it must be acknowledged that hugh stanbury had very few according to his shewing he was as well provided for matrimony as the gentleman in the song who came out to woo his bride on a rainy night in live stock he was not so well provided as the irish gentleman to whom we allude but in regard to all other provisions for comfortable married life he had or at a moments notice could have all that was needed nora could live just where she pleasednot exactly in whitehall gardens or belgrave square but the new road lupus street montague place the north bank or kennington oval with all their surrounding crescents terraces and rows offered according to him a choice so wide either for lodgings or small houses that their only embarrassment was in their riches he had already insured his life for a thousand pounds and after paying yearly for that and providing a certain surplus for saving five hundred a year was the income on which they were to commence the world of course i wish it were five thousand for your sake he said and i wish i were a cabinet minister or a duke or a brewer but even in heaven you know all the angels cant be archangels nora assured him that she would be quite content with virtues simply angelic i hope you like muttonchops and potatoes i do he said then she told him of her ambition about the beefsteak acknowledging that as it must now be shared between two the glorious idea of putting a part of it away in a cupboard must be abandoned i dont believe in beefsteaks he said a beefsteak may mean anything at our club a beefsteak is a sumptuous and expensive luxury now a muttonchop means something definite and must be economical  then we will have the muttonchops at home said nora and you shall go to your club for the beefsteak  when they reached eccleston square nora insisted on taking hugh stanbury up to lady milborough it was in vain that he pleaded that he had come all the way from dover on a very dusty dayall the way from dover including a journey in a hansom cab to twickenham and back without washing his hands and face nora insisted that lady milborough was such a dear good considerate creature that she would understand all that and hugh was taken into her presence i am delighted to see you mr stanbury said the old lady and hope you will think that nora is in good keeping  she has been telling me how very kind you have been to her i do not know where she could have bestowed herself if you had not received her  there norai told you he would say so i wont tell tales mr stanbury but she had all manner of wild plans which i knew you wouldnt approve but she is very amiable and if she will only submit to you as well as she does to me  i dont mean to submit to him at all lady milboroughof course not i am going to marry for liberty  my dear what you say you say in joke but a great many young women of the present day do i really believe go up to the altar and pronounce their marriage vows with the simple idea that as soon as they have done so they are to have their own way in everything and then people complain that young men wont marry who can wonder at it  i dont think the young men think much about the obedience said nora some marry for money and some for love but i dont think they marry to get a slave  what do you say mr stanbury asked the old lady  i can only assure you that i shant marry for money said he  two or three days after this nora left her friend in eccleston square and domesticated herself for awhile with her sister mrs trevelyan declared that such an arrangement would be comfortable for her and that it was very desirable now as nora would so soon be beyond her reach then lady milborough was enabled to go to dorsetshire which she did not do however till she had presented nora with the veil which she was to wear on the occasion of her wedding of course i cannot see it my dear as it is to take place at monkhams but you must write and tell me the dayand i will think of you and you when you put on the veil must think of me so they parted and nora knew that she had made a friend for life      illustration noras veil   when she first took her place in the house at twickenham as a resident trevelyan did not take much notice of herbut after awhile he would say a few words to her especially when it might chance that she was with him in her sisters absence he would speak of dear emily and poor emily and shake his head slowly and talk of the pity of it the pity of it iago oh the pity of it he said once the allusion to her was so terrible that she almost burst out in anger as she would have done formerly she almost told him that he had been as wrong throughout as was the jealous husband in the play whose words he quoted and that his jealousy if continued was likely to be as tragical but she restrained herself and kept close to her needlemaking let us hope an auspicious garment for hugh stanbury she has seen it now he continued she has seen it now still she went on with her hemming in silence it certainly could not be her duty to upset at a word all that her sister had achieved you know that she has confessed he asked  pray pray do not talk about it louis  i think you ought to know he said then she rose from her seat and left the room she could not stand it even though he were madeven though he were dying  she went to her sister and repeated what had been said you had better not notice it said emily it is only a proof of what i told you there are times in which his mind is as active as ever it was but it is active in so terrible a direction  i cannot sit and hear it and what am i to say when he asks me a question as he did just now he said that you had confessed  so i have do none confess but the guilty what is all that we have read about the inquisition and the old tortures i have had to learn that torturing has not gone out of the worldthat is all  i must go away if he says the same thing to me so again  that is nonsense nora if i can bear it cannot you would you have me drive him into violence again by disputing with him upon such a subject  but he may recoverand then he will remember what you have said  if he recovers altogether he will suspect nothing i must take my chance of that you cannot suppose that i have not thought about it i have often sworn to myself that though the world should fall around me nothing should make me acknowledge that i had ever been untrue to my duty as a married woman either in deed or word or thought i have no doubt that the poor wretches who were tortured in their cells used to make the same resolutions as to their confessions but yet when their nails were dragged out of them they would own to anything my nails have been dragged out and i have been willing to confess anything when he talks of the pity of it of course i know what he means there has been something some remainder of a feeling which has still kept him from asking me that question may god in his mercy continue to him that feeling  but you would answer truly  how can i say what i might answer when the torturer is at my nails if you knew how great was the difficulty to get him away from that place in italy and bring him here and what it was to feel that one was bound to stay near him and that yet one was impotentand to know that even that refuge must soon cease for him and that he might have gone out and died on the roadside or have done anything which the momentary strength of madness might have dictatedif you could understand all this you would not be surprised at my submitting to any degradation which would help to bring him here  stanbury was often down at the cottage and nora could discuss the matter better with him than with her sister and stanbury could learn more thoroughly from the physician who was now attending trevelyan what was the state of the sick man than emily could do according to the doctors idea there was more of ailment in the body than in the mind he admitted that his patients thoughts had been forced to dwell on one subject till they had become distorted untrue jaundiced and perhaps monomaniacal but he seemed to doubt whether there had ever been a time at which it could have been decided that trevelyan was so mad as to make it necessary that the law should interfere to take care of him a manso argued the doctorneed not be mad because he is jealous even though his jealousy be ever so absurd and trevelyan in his jealousy had done nothing cruel nothing wasteful nothing infamous in all this nora was very little inclined to agree with the doctor and thought nothing could be more infamous than trevelyans conduct at the present momentunless indeed he could be screened from infamy by that plea of madness but then there was more behind trevelyan had been so wasted by the kind of life which he had led and possessed by nature stamina so insufficient to resist such debility that it was very doubtful whether he would not sink altogether before he could be made to begin to rise but one thing was clear he should be contradicted in nothing if he chose to say that the moon was made of green cheese let it be conceded to him that the moon was made of green cheese should he make any other assertion equally removed from the truth let it not be contradicted who would oppose a man with one foot in the grave  then hugh the sooner i am at monkhams the better said nora who had again been subjected to inuendoes which had been unendurable to her this was on the 7th of august and it still wanted three days to that on which the journey to monkhams was to be made  he never says anything to me on the subject said hugh  because you have made him afraid of you i almost think that emily and the doctor are wrong in their treatment and that it would be better to stand up to him and tell him the truth but the three days passed away and nora was not driven to any such vindication of her sisters character towards her sisters husband     chapter xcvi  monkhams      illustration  on the 10th of august nora rowley left the cottage by the riverside at twickenham and went down to monkhams the reader need hardly be told that hugh brought her up from twickenham and sent her off in the railway carriage they agreed that no day could be fixed for their marriage till something further should be known of trevelyans state while he was in his present condition such a marriage could not have been other than very sad nora when she left the cottage was still very bitter against her brotherinlaw quoting the doctors opinion as to his sanity and expressing her own as to his conduct under that supposition she also believed that he would rally in health and was therefore on that account less inclined to pity him than was his wife emily trevelyan of course saw more of him than did her sister and understood better how possible it was that a man might be in such a condition as to be neither mad nor sanenot mad so that all power over his own actions need be taken from him nor sane so that he must be held to be accountable for his words and thoughts trevelyan did nothing and attempted to do nothing that could injure his wife and child he submitted himself to medical advice he did not throw away his money he had no bozzle now waiting at his heels he was generally passive in his wifes hands as to all outward things he was not violent in rebuke nor did he often allude to their past unhappiness but he still maintained by a word spoken every now and then that he had been right throughout in his contest with his wifeand that his wife had at last acknowledged that it was so she never contradicted him and he became bolder and bolder in his assertions endeavouring on various occasions to obtain some expression of an assent from nora but nora would not assent and he would scowl at her saying words both in her presence and behind her back which implied that she was his enemy why not yield to him her sister said the day before she went i have yielded and your doing so cannot make it worse  i cant do it it would be false it is better that i should go away i cannot pretend to agree with him when i know that his mind is working altogether under a delusion when the hour for her departure came and hugh was waiting for her she thought that it would be better that she should go without seeing trevelyan there will only be more anger she pleaded but her sister would not be contented that she should leave the house in this fashion and urged at last with tears running down her cheeks that this might possibly be the last interview between them  say a word to him in kindness before you leave us said mrs trevelyan then nora went up to her brotherinlaws bedside and told him that she was going and expressed a hope that he might be stronger when she returned and as she did so she put her hand upon the bedside intending to press his in token of affection but his face was turned from her and he seemed to take no notice of her louis said his wife nora is going to monkhams you will say goodbye to her before she goes  if she be not my enemy i will said he  i have never been your enemy louis said nora and certainly i am not now  she had better go he said it is very little more that i expect of any one in this worldbut i will recognise no one as my friend who will not acknowledge that i have been sinned against during the last two yearssinned against cruelly and utterly emily who was standing at the bedhead shuddered as she heard this but made no reply nor did nora speak again but crept silently out of the roomand in half a minute her sister followed her  i feared how it would be said nora  we can only do our best god knows that i try to do mine  i do not think you will ever see him again said hugh to her in the train  would you have had me act otherwise it is not that it would have been a lie i would not have minded that to ease the shattered feelings of one so infirm and suffering as he in dealing with mad people i suppose one must be false but i should have been accusing her and it may be that he will get well and it might be that he would then remember what i had said  at the station near monkhams she was met by lady peterborough in the carriage a tall footman in livery came on to the platform to shew her the way and to look after her luggage and she could not fail to remember that the man might have been her own servant instead of being the servant of her who now sat in lord peterboroughs carriage and when she saw the carriage and her ladyships great bay horses and the glittering harness and the respectably responsible coachman and the arms on the panel she smiled to herself at the sight of these first outward manifestations of the rank and wealth of the man who had once been her lover there are men who look as though they were the owners of bay horses and responsible coachmen and family blazonsfrom whose outward personal appearance demeanour and tone of voice one would expect a following of liveries and a magnificence of belongings but mr glascock had by no means been such a man it had suited his taste to keep these things in abeyance and to place his pride in the oaks and elms of his park rather than in any of those appanages of grandeur which a man may carry about with him he could talk of his breed of sheep on an occasion but he never talked of his horses and though he knew his position and all its glories as well as any nobleman in england he was ever inclined to hang back a little in going out of a room and to bear himself as though he were a small personage in the world some perception of all this came across noras mind as she saw the equipage and tried to reflect at a moments notice whether the case might have been different with her had mr glascock worn a little of his tinsel outside when she first met him of course she told herself that had he worn it all on the outside and carried it ever so gracefully it could have made no difference  it was very plain however that though mr glascock did not like bright feathers for himself he chose that his wife should wear them nothing could be prettier than the way in which caroline spalding whom we first saw as she was about to be stuck into the interior of the diligence at st michel now filled her carriage as lady peterborough the greeting between them was very affectionate and there was a kiss in the carriage even though the two pretty hats perhaps suffered something we are so glad to have you at last said lady peterborough of course we are very quiet but you wont mind that nora declared that no house could be too quiet for her and then said something of the melancholy scene which she had just left and no time is fixed for your own marriage but of course it has not been possible and why should you be in a hurry we quite understand that this is to be your home till everything has arranged itself there was a drive of four or five miles before they reached the park gates and nothing could be kinder or more friendly than was the new peeress but nora told herself that there was no forgetting that her friend was a peeress she would not be so illconditioned as to suggest to herself that her friend patronised herand indeed had she done so the suggestion would have been falsebut she could not rid herself of a certain sensation of external inferiority and of a feeling that the superiority ought to be on her side as all this might have been hersonly that she had not thought it worth her while to accept it as these ideas came into her mind she hated herself for entertaining them and yet come they would while she was talking about her emblematic beefsteak with hugh she had no regret no uneasiness no conception that any state of life could be better for her than that state in which an emblematic beefsteak was of vital importance but she could not bring her mind to the same condition of unalloyed purity while sitting with lady peterborough in lord peterboroughs carriage and for her default in this respect she hated herself  this is the beginning of the park said her friend  and where is the house  you cant see the house for ever so far yet it is two miles off there is about a mile before you come to the gates and over a mile afterwards one has a sort of feeling when one is in that one cant get outit is so big in so speaking it was lady peterboroughs special endeavour to state without a boast facts which were indifferent but which must be stated  it is very magnificent said nora there was in her voice the slightest touch of sarcasm which she would have given the world not to have uttered but it had been irrepressible  lady peterborough understood it instantly and forgave it not attributing to it more than its true meaning acknowledging to herself that it was natural dear nora she saidnot knowing what to say blushing as she spokethe magnificence is nothing but the mans love is everything  nora shook herself and determined that she would behave well the effort should be made and the required result should be produced by it the magnificence as an adjunct is a great deal she said and for his sake i hope that you enjoy it  of course i enjoy it  wallachias teachings and preachings have all been thrown to the wind i hope  not quite all poor dear wally i got a letter from her the other day which she began by saying that she would attune her correspondence to my changed condition in life i understood the reproach so thoroughly and when she told me little details of individual men and women and of things she had seen and said not a word about the rights of women or even of politics generally i felt that i was a degraded creature in her sight but though you laugh at her she did me goodand will do good to others here we are inside monkhams and now you must look at the avenue  nora was now rather proud of herself she had made the effort and it had been successful and she felt that she could speak naturally and express her thoughts honestly i remember his telling me about the avenue the first time i ever saw himand here it is i did not think then that i should ever live to see the glories of monkhams does it go all the way like this to the house  not quitewhere you see the light at the end the road turns to the right and the house is just before you there are great iron gates and terraces and wondrous paraphernalia before you get up to the door i can tell you monkhams is quite a wonder i have to shut myself up every wednesday morning and hand the house over to mrs crutch the housekeeper who comes out in a miraculous brown silk gown to shew it to visitors on other days youll find mrs crutch quite civil and usefulbut on wednesdays she is majestic charles always goes off among his sheep on that day and i shut myself up with a pile of books in a little room you will have to be imprisoned with me i do so long to peep at the visitors  and i dare say they want to peep at you  i proposed at first to shew them round myselfbut charles wouldnt let me  it would have broken mrs crutchs heart  thats what charles said he thinks that mrs crutch tells them that im locked up somewhere and that that gives a zest to the search some people from nottingham once did break into old lady peterboroughs room and the shew was stopped for a year there was such a row about it it prevented charles coming up for the county but he wouldnt have got in and therefore it was lucky and saved money  by this time nora was quite at her ease but still there was before her the other difficulty of meeting lord peterborough they were driven out of the avenue and round to the right and through the iron gate and up to the huge front door there upon the top step was standing lord peterborough with a billycock hat and a very old shooting coat and nankeen trousers which were considerably too short for him it was one of the happinesses of his life to dress just as he pleased as he went about his own place and it certainly was his pleasure to wear older clothes than any one else in his establishment miss rowley he said coming forward to give her a hand out of the carriage i am delighted that you should see monkhams at last  you see i have kept you to your promise caroline has been telling me everything about it but she is not quite a complete guide as yet she does not know where the seven oaks are do you remember telling me of the seven oaks  of course i do they are five miles offat clatton farm carry i dont think you have been near clatton yet we will ride there tomorrow and thus nora rowley was made at home at monkhams  she was made at home and after a week or two she was very happy she soon perceived that her host was a perfect gentleman and as such a man to be much loved she had probably never questioned the fact whether mr glascock was a gentleman or not and now she did not analyse it it probably never occurred to her even at the present time to say to herself that he was certainly that thing so impossible of definition and so capable of recognition but she knew that she had to do with one whose presence was always pleasant to her whose words and acts towards her extorted her approbation whose thoughts seemed to her to be always good and manly of course she had not loved him because she had previously known hugh stanbury there could be no comparison between the two men there was a brightness about hugh which lord peterborough could not rival otherwiseexcept for this reasonit seemed to her to be impossible that any young woman should fail to love lord peterborough when asked to do so  about the middle of september there came a very happy time for her when hugh was asked down to shoot partridgesin the doing of which however all his brightness did not bring him near in excellence to his host lord peterborough had been shooting partridges all his life and shot them with a precision which excited hughs envy to own the truth stanbury did not shoot well and was treated rather with scorn by the gamekeeper but in other respects he spent three or four of the happiest days of his life he had his work to do and after the second day over the stubbles declared that the exigencies of the d r were too severe to enable him to go out with his gun again but those rambles about the park with nora for which among the exigencies of the d r he did find opportunity were never to be forgotten  of course i remember that it might have been mine she said sitting with him under an old hollow withered sloping stump of an oak which still however had sufficient of a head growing from one edge of the trunk to give them the shade they wanted and if you wish me to own to regretsi will  it would kill me i think if you did and yet i cannot get it out of my head that if it had not been for me your rank and position in life might have been soso suitable to you  no hugh there youre wrong i have thought about it a good deal too and i know very well that the cold beefsteak in the cupboard is the thing for me caroline will do very well here she looks like a peeress and bears her honours grandly but they will never harden her i too could have been magnificent with fine feathers most birds are equal to so much as that i fancy that i could have looked the part of the fine english lady and could have patronised clergymens wives in the country could have held my own among my peers in london and could have kept mrs crutch in order but it would have hardened me and i should have learned to think that to be a lady of fashion was everything  i do not believe a bit of it  it is better as it is hughfor me at least i had always a sort of conviction that it would be better though i had a longing to play the other part then you came and you have saved me nevertheless it is very nice hugh to have the oaks to sit under stanbury declared that it was very nice      illustration monkhams   but still nothing was settled about the wedding trevelyans condition was so uncertain that it was very difficult to settle anything though nothing was said on the subject between stanbury and mrs trevelyan and nothing written between nora and her sister it could not but be remembered that should trevelyan die his widow would require a home with them they were deterred from choosing a house by this reflection and were deterred from naming a day also by the consideration that were they to do so trevelyans state might still probably prevent it but this was arranged that if trevelyan lived through the winter or even if he should not live their marriage should not be postponed beyond the end of march till that time lord peterborough would remain at monkhams and it was understood that noras invitation extended to that period  if my wife does not get tired of you i shall not lord peterborough said to nora the thing is that when you do go we shall miss you so terribly in september too there happened another event which took stanbury to exeter and all needful particulars as to that event shall be narrated in the next chapter     chapter xcvii  mrs brooke burgess   it may be doubted whether there was a happier young woman in england than dorothy stanbury when that september came which was to make her the wife of mr brooke burgess the new partner in the firm of cropper and burgess her early aspirations in life had been so low and of late there had come upon her such a succession of soft showers of successmingled now and then with slight threatenings of storms which had passed awaythat the close at exeter seemed to her to have become a very paradise her aunts temper had sometimes been to her as the threat of a storm and there had been the gibson marriage treaty and the shortlived opposition to the other marriage treaty which had seemed to her to be so very preferable but everything had gone at last as though she had been fortunes favouriteand now had come this beautiful arrangement about cropper and burgess which would save her from being carried away to live among strangers in london when she first became known to us on her coming to exeter in compliance with her aunts suggestion she was timid silent and altogether without selfreliance even they who knew her best had never guessed that she possessed a keen sense of humour a nice appreciation of character and a quiet reticent wit of her own under that staid and frightened demeanour since her engagement with brooke burgess it seemed to those who watched her that her character had become changed as does that of a flower when it opens itself in its growth the sweet gifts of nature within became visible the petals sprang to view and the leaves spread themselves and the sweet scent was felt upon the air had she remained at nuncombe it is probable that none would ever have known her but her sister it was necessary to this flower that it should be warmed by the sun of life and strengthened by the breezes of opposition and filled by the showers of companionship before it could become aware of its own loveliness dorothy was one who had she remained ever unseen in the retirement of her mothers village cottage would have lived and died ignorant of even her own capabilities for enjoyment she had not dreamed that she could win a mans lovehad hardly dreamed till she had lived at exeter that she had love of her own to give back in return she had not known that she could be firm in her own opinion that she could laugh herself and cause others to laugh that she could be a lady and know that other women were not so that she had good looks of her own and could be very happy when told of them by lips that she loved the flower that blows the quickest is never the sweetest the fruit that ripens tardily has ever the finest flavour it is often the same with men and women the lad who talks at twenty as men should talk at thirty has seldom much to say worth the hearing when he is forty and the girl who at eighteen can shine in society with composure has generally given over shining before she is a fullgrown woman with dorothy the scent and beauty of the flower and the flavour of the fruit had come late but the fruit will keep and the flower will not fall to pieces with the heat of an evening  how marvellously your bride has changed since she has been here said mrs machugh to miss stanbury we thought she couldnt say boo to a goose at first but she holds her own now among the best of em  of course she doeswhy shouldnt she i never knew a stanbury yet that was a fool  they are a wonderful family of course said mrs machugh but i think that of all of them she is the most wonderful old barty said something to her at my house yesterday that wasnt intended to be kind  when did he ever intend to be kind  but he got no change out of her the burgesses have been in exeter a long time she said and i dont see why we should not get on at any rate as well as those before us barty grunted and growled and slunk away he thought she would shake in her shoes when he spoke to her  he has never been able to make a stanbury shake in her shoes yet said the old lady  early in september dorothy went to nuncombe putney to spend a week with her mother and sister at the cottage she had insisted on this though priscilla had hinted somewhat unnecessarily that dorothy with her past comforts and her future prospects would find the accommodation at the cottage very limited i suppose you and i pris can sleep in the same bed as we always did she said with a tear in each eye then priscilla had felt ashamed of herself and had bade her come  the truth is dolly said the elder sister that we feel so unlike marrying and giving in marriage at nuncombe that im afraid youll lose your brightness and become dowdy and grim and misanthropic as we are when mamma and i sit down to what we call dinner i always feel that there is a grace hovering in the air different to that which she says  and what is it pris  pray god dont quite starve us and let everybody else have indigestion we dont say it out loud but there it is and the spirit of it might damp the orange blossoms  she went of course and the orange blossoms were not damped she had long walks with her sister round by niddon and ridleigh and even as far distant as cockchaffington where much was said about that wicked colonel as they stood looking at the porch of the church i shall be so happy said dorothy when you and mother come to us it will be such a joy to me that you should be my guests  but we shall not come  why not priscilla  i know it will be so mamma will not care for going if i do not go  and why should you not come  for a hundred reasons all of which you know dolly i am stiff impracticable illconditioned and very bad at going about visiting i am always thinking that other people ought to have indigestion and perhaps i might come to have some such feeling about you and brooke  i should not be at all afraid of that  i know that my place in the world is here at nuncombe putney i have a pride about myself and think that i never did wrong but oncewhen i let mamma go into that odious clock house it is a bad pride and yet im proud of it i havent got a gown fit to go and stay with you when you become a grand lady in exeter i dont doubt youd give me any sort of gown i wanted  of course i would aint we sisters pris  i shall not be so much your sister as he will be your husband besides i hate to take things when hugh sends money and for mammas sake it is accepted i always feel uneasy while it lasts and think that that plague of an indigestion ought to come upon me also do you remember the lamb that came when you went away it made me so sick  but priscillaisnt that morbid  of course it is you dont suppose i really think it grand i am morbid but i am strong enough to live on and not get killed by the morbidity heaven knows how much more there may be of itforty years perhaps and probably the greater portion of that absolutely alone  noyoull be with us thenif it should come  i think not dolly not to have a hole of my own would be intolerable to me but as i was saying i shall not be unhappy to enjoy life as you do is i suppose out of the question for me but i have a satisfaction when i get to the end of the quarter and find that there is not halfacrown due to any one things get dearer and dearer but i have a comfort even in that i have a feeling that i should like to bring myself to the straw a day of course there were offers made of aidoffers which were rather prayersand plans suggested of what might be done between brooke and hugh but priscilla declared that all such plans were odious to her why should you be unhappy about us she continued we will come and see youat least i willperhaps once in six months and you shall pay for the railway ticket only i wont stay because of the gown  is not that nonsense pris  just at present it is because mamma and i have both got new gowns for the wedding hugh sent them and ever so much money to buy bonnets and gloves  he is to be married himself soondown at a place called monkhams nora is staying there  yeswith a lord said priscilla we shant have to go there at any rate  you liked nora when she was here  very muchthough i thought her selfwilled but she is not worldly and she is conscientious she might have married that lord herself if she would i do like her when she comes to you at exeter if the wedding gown isnt quite worn out i shall come and see her i knew she liked him when she was here but she never said so  she is very pretty is she not he sent me her photograph  she is handsome rather than pretty i wonder why it is that you two should be married and so grandly married and that i shall never never have any one to love  oh priscilla do not say that if i have a child will you not love it  it will be your childnot mine do not suppose that i complain i know that it is right i know that you ought to be married and i ought not i know that there is not a man in devonshire who would take me or a man in devonshire whom i would accept i know that i am quite unfit for any other kind of life than this i should make any man wretched and any man would make me wretched but why is it so i believe that you would make any man happy  i hope to make brooke happy  of course you will and therefore you deserve it well go home now dear and get mammas things ready for the great day  on the afternoon before the great day all the visitors were to come and during the forenoon old miss stanbury was in a great fidget luckily for dorothy her own preparations were already made so that she could give her time to her aunt without injury to herself miss stanbury had come to think of herself as though all the reality of her life had passed away from her every resolution that she had formed had been broken she had had the great enemy of her life barty burgess in the house with her upon terms that were intended to be amicable and had arranged with him a plan for the division of the family property her sisterinlaw whom in the heyday of her strength she had chosen to regard as her enemy and with whom even as yet there had been no reconciliation was about to become her guest as was also priscillawhom she had ever disliked almost as much as she had respected she had quarrelled utterly with hughin such a manner as to leave no possible chance of a reconciliationand he also was about to be her guest and then as to her chosen heir she was now assisting him in doing the only thing as to which she had declared that if he did do it he should not be her heir as she went about the house under an idea that such a multiplicity of persons could not be housed and fed without superhuman exertion she thought of all this and could not help confessing to herself that her life had been very vain it was only when her eyes rested on dorothy and she saw how supremely happy was the one person whom she had taken most closely to her heart that she could feel that she had done anything that should not have been left undone i think ill sit down now dorothy she said or i shant be able to be with you tomorrow  do aunt everything is all ready and nobody will be here for an hour yet nothing can be nicer than the rooms and nothing ever was done so well before im only thinking how lonely youll be when were gone  itll be only for six weeks  but six weeks is such a long time  what would it have been if he had taken you up to london my pet are you sure your mother wouldnt like a fire in her room dorothy  a fire in september aunt  people live so differently one never knows  they never have but one fire at nuncombe aunt summer or winter  thats no reason they shouldnt be comfortable here however she did not insist on having the fire lighted  mrs stanbury and priscilla came first and the meeting was certainly very uncomfortable poor mrs stanbury was shy and could hardly speak a word miss stanbury thought that her visitor was haughty and though she endeavoured to be gracious did it with a struggle they called each other maam which made dorothy uneasy each of them was so dear to her that it was a pity that they should glower at each other like enemies priscilla was not at all shy but she was combative and as her aunt said of her afterwards would not keep her prickles in i hope priscilla you like weddings said miss stanbury to her not knowing where to find a subject for conversation  in the abstract i like them said priscilla miss stanbury did not know what her niece meant by liking weddings in the abstract and was angry  i suppose you do have weddings at nuncombe putney sometimes she said  i hope they do said priscilla but i never saw one tomorrow will be my first experience  your own will come next my dear said miss stanbury  i think not said priscilla it is quite as likely to be yours aunt this miss stanbury thought was almost an insult and she said nothing more on the occasion  then came hugh and the bridegroom the bridegroom as a matter of course was not accommodated in the house but he was allowed to come there for his tea he and hugh had come together and for hugh a bedroom had been provided his aunt had not seen him since he had been turned out of the house because of his bad practices and dorothy had anticipated the meeting between them with alarm it was however much more pleasant than had been that between the ladies hugh she said stiffly i am glad to see you on such an occasion as this  aunt he said i am glad of any occasion that can get me an entrance once more into the dear old house i am so pleased to see you she allowed her hand to remain in his a few moments and murmured something which was intended to signify her satisfaction i must tell you that i am going to be married myself to one of the dearest sweetest and loveliest girls that ever were seen and you must congratulate me  i do i do and i hope you may be happy  we mean to try to be and some day you must let me bring her to you and shew her i shall not be satisfied if you do not know my wife she told martha afterwards that she hoped that mr hugh had sown his wild oats and that matrimony would sober him when however martha remarked that she believed mr hugh to be as hardworking a young man as any in london miss stanbury shook her head sorrowfully things were being very much changed with her but not even yet was she to be brought to approve of work done on behalf of a penny newspaper  on the following morning at ten oclock there was a procession from miss stanburys house into the cathedral which was made entirely on footindeed no assistance could have been given by any carriage for there is a back entrance to the cathedral near to the lady chapel exactly opposite miss stanburys house there were many of the inhabitants of the close there to see the procession and the cathedral bells rang out their peals very merrily brooke the bridegroom gave his arm to miss stanbury which was no doubt very improperas he should have appeared in the church as coming from quite some different part of the world then came the bride hanging on her brother then two bridesmaidsfriends of dorothys living in the town and lastly priscilla with her mother for nothing would induce priscilla to take the part of a bridesmaid you might as well ask an owl to sing to you she said and then all the frippery would be thrown away upon me but she stood close to dorothy and when the ceremony had been performed was the first after brooke to kiss her  everybody acknowledged that the bride was a winsome bride mrs machugh was at the breakfast and declared afterwards that dorothy burgessas she then was pleased to call herwas a girl very hard to be understood she came here said mrs machugh two years ago a plain silent shy dowdy young woman and we all said that miss stanbury would be tired of her in a week there has never come a time in which there was any visible difference in her and now she is one of our city beauties with plenty to say to everybody with a fortune in one pocket and her aunt in the other and everybody is saying what a fortunate fellow brooke burgess is to get her in a year or two shell be at the top of everything in the city and will make her way in the county too  the compiler of this history begs to add his opinion to that of everybody as quoted above by mrs machugh he thinks that brooke burgess was a very fortunate fellow to get his wife     chapter xcviii  acquitted   during this time while hugh was sitting with his love under the oak trees at monkhams and dorothy was being converted into mrs brooke burgess in exeter cathedral mrs trevelyan was living with her husband in the cottage at twickenham her life was dreary enough and there was but very little of hope in it to make its dreariness supportable as often happens in periods of sickness the single friend who could now be of service to the one or to the other was the doctor he came daily to them and with that quick growth of confidence which medical kindness always inspires trevelyan told to this gentleman all the history of his married lifeand all that trevelyan told to him he repeated to trevelyans wife it may therefore be understood that trevelyan between them was treated like a child  dr nevill had soon been able to tell mrs trevelyan that her husbands health had been so shattered as to make it improbable that he should ever again be strong either in body or in mind he would not admit even when treating his patient like a child that he had ever been mad and spoke of sir marmadukes threat as unfortunate but what could papa have done asked the wife  it is often no doubt difficult to know what to do but threats are seldom of avail to bring a man back to reason your father was angry with him and yet declared that he was mad that in itself was hardly rational one does not become angry with a madman  one does not become angry with a madman but while a man has power in his hands over others and when he misuses that power grossly and cruelly who is there that will not be angry the misery of the insane more thoroughly excites our pity than any other suffering to which humanity is subject but it is necessary that the madness should be acknowledged to be madness before the pity can be felt one can forgive or at any rate make excuses for any injury when it is done but it is almost beyond human nature to forgive an injury when it is adoing let the condition of the doer be what it may emily trevelyan at this time suffered infinitely she was still willing to yield in all things possible because her husband was illbecause perhaps he was dying but she could no longer satisfy herself with thinking that all that she admittedall that she was still ready to admithad been conceded in order that her concessions might tend to soften the afflictions of one whose reason was gone dr nevill said that her husband was not madand indeed trevelyan seemed now to be so clear in his mind that she could not doubt what the doctor said to her she could not think that he was madand yet he spoke of the last two years as though he had suffered from her almost all that a husband could suffer from a wifes misconduct she was in doubt about his health he may recover the doctor said but he is so weak that the slightest additional ailment would take him off at this time trevelyan could not raise himself from his bed and was carried like a child from one room to another he could eat nothing solid and believed himself to be dying in spite of his weaknessand of his savage memories in regard to the pasthe treated his wife on all ordinary subjects with consideration he spoke much of his money telling her that he had not altered and would not alter the will that he had made immediately on his marriage under that will all his property would be hers for her life and would go to their child when she was dead to her this will was more than justit was generous in the confidence which it placed in her and he told his lawyer in her presence that to the best of his judgment he need not change it but still there passed hardly a day in which he did not make some allusion to the great wrong which he had endured throwing in her teeth the confessions which she had madeand almost accusing her of that which she certainly never had confessed even when in the extremity of her misery at casalunga she had thought that it little mattered what she said so that for the moment he might be appeased if he died was he to die in this belief if he lived was he to live in this belief and if he did so believe was it possible that he should still trust her with his money and with his child  emily he said one day it has been a terrible tragedy has it not she did not answer his question sitting silent as it was her custom to do when he addressed her after such fashion as this at such times she would not answer him but she knew that he would press her for an answer i blame him more than i do you continued trevelyaninfinitely more he was a serpent intending to sting me from the firstnot knowing perhaps how deep the sting would go there was no question in this and the assertion was one which had been made so often that she could let it pass you are young emily and it may be that you will marry again  never she said with a shudder it seemed to her then that marriage was so fearful a thing that certainly she could never venture upon it again  all i ask of you is that should you do so you will be more careful of your husbands honour  louis she said getting up and standing close to him tell me what it is that you mean it was now his turn to remain silent and hers to demand an answer i have borne much she continued because i would not vex you in your illness  you have borne much  indeed and indeed yes what woman has ever borne more  and i said he  dear louis let us understand each other at last of what do you accuse me let us at any rate know each others thoughts on this matter of which each of us is ever thinking  i make no new accusation  i must protest then against your using words which seem to convey accusation since marriages were first known upon earth no woman has ever been truer to her husband than i have been to you  were you lying to me then at casalunga when you acknowledged that you had been false to your duties  if i acknowledged that i did lie i never said that but yet i did liebelieving it to be best for you that i should do so for your honours sake for the childs sake weak as you are louis i must protest that it was so i have never injured you by deed or thought  and yet you have lied to me is a lie no injuryand such a lie emily why did you lie to me you will tell me tomorrow that you never lied and never owned that you had lied  though it should kill him she must tell him the truth now you were very ill at casalunga she said after a pause  but not so ill as i am now i could breathe that air i could live there had i remained i should have been well nowbut what of that  louis you were dying there pray pray listen to me we thought that you were dying and we knew also that you would be taken from that house  that was my affair do you mean that i could not keep a house over my head at this moment he was half lying half sitting in a large easy chair in the little drawingroom of their cottage to which he had been carried from the adjoining bedroom when not excited he would sit for hours without moving gazing through the open window sometimes with some pretext of a book lying within the reach of his hand but almost without strength to lift it and certainly without power to read it but now he had worked himself up to so much energy that he almost raised himself up in his chair as he turned towards his wife had i not the world before me to choose a house in  they would have put you somewhere and i could not have reached you  in a madhouse you mean yesif you had told them  will you listen dear louis we knew that it was our duty to bring you home and as you would not let me come to you and serve you and assist you to come here where you are safeunless i owned that you had been right i said that you had been right  and it was a lieyou say now  all that is nothing i cannot go through it nor should you there is the only question you do not think that i have been i need not say the thing you do not think that as she asked the question she knelt beside him and took his hand in hers and kissed it say that you do not think that and i will never trouble you further about the past  yesthat is it you will never trouble me she glanced up into his face and saw there the old look which he used to wear when he was at willesden and at casalunga and there had come again the old tone in which he had spoken to her in the bitterness of his wraththe look and the tone which had made her sure that he was a madman the craft and subtlety of women passes everything he said and so at last i am to tell you that from the beginning it has been my doing i will never say so though i should die in refusing to do it  after that there was no possibility of further conversation for there came upon him a fit of coughing and then he swooned and in halfanhour he was in bed and dr nevill was by his side you must not speak to him at all on this matter said the doctor but if he speaks to me she asked let it pass said the doctor let the subject be got rid of with as much ease as you can he is very ill now and even this might have killed him nevertheless though this seemed to be stern dr nevill was very kind to her declaring that the hallucination in her husbands mind did not really consist of a belief in her infidelity but arose from an obstinate determination to yield nothing he does not believe it but he feels that were he to say as much his hands would be weakened and yours strengthened  can he then be in his sane mind  in one sense all misconduct is proof of insanity said the doctor in his case the weakness of the mind has been consequent upon the weakness of the body  three days after that nora visited twickenham from monkhams in obedience to a telegram from her sister louis she said had become so much weaker that she hardly dared to be alone with him would nora come to her nora came of course and hugh met her at the station and brought her with him to the cottage he asked whether he might see trevelyan but was told that it would be better that he should not he had been almost continually silent since the last dispute which he had with his wife but he had given little signs that he was always thinking of the manner in which he had been brought home by her from italy and of the story she had told him of her mode of inducing him to come hugh stanbury had been her partner in that struggle and would probably be received if not with sullen silence then with some attempt at rebuke but hugh did see dr nevill and learned from him that it was hardly possible that trevelyan should live many hours he has worn himself out said the doctor and there is nothing left in him by which he can lay hold of life again of nora her brotherinlaw took but little notice and never again referred in her hearing to the great trouble of his life he said to her a word or two about monkhams and asked a question now and again as to lord peterboroughwhom however he always called mr glascock but hugh stanburys name was never mentioned by him there was a feeling in his mind that at the very last he had been duped in being brought to england and that stanbury had assisted in the deception to his wife he would whisper little petulant regrets for the loss of the comforts of casalunga and would speak of the air of italy and of italian skies and of the italian sun as though he had enjoyed at his sienese villa all the luxuries which climate can give and would have enjoyed them still had he been allowed to remain there to all this she would say nothing she knew now that he was failing quickly and there was only one subject on which she either feared or hoped to hear him speak before he left her for ever and ever would he tell her that he had not doubted her faith  she had long discussions with nora on the matter as though all the future of her life depended on it it was in vain that nora tried to make her understand that if hereafter the spirit of her husband could know anything of the troubles of his mortal life could ever look back to the things which he had done in the flesh then would he certainly know the truth and all suspicion would be at an end and if not if there was to be no such retrospect what did it matter now for these few last hours before the coil should be shaken off and all doubt and all sorrow should be at an end but the wife who was soon to be a widow yearned to be acquitted in this world by him to whom her guilt or her innocence had been matter of such vital importance he has never thought it said nora  but if he would say so if he would only look it it will be all in all to me as long as i live in this world and then though they had determined between themselves in spoken words never to regard him again as one who had been mad in all their thoughts and actions towards him they treated him as though he were less responsible than an infant and he was madmad though every doctor in england had called him sane had he not been mad he must have been a fiendor he could not have tortured as he had done the woman to whom he owed the closest protection which one human being can give to another  during these last days and nights she never left him she had done her duty to him well at any rate since the time when she had been enabled to come near him in italy it may be that in the first days of their quarrel she had not been regardful as she should have been of a husbands willthat she might have escaped this tragedy by submitting herself to the mans wishes as she had always been ready to submit herself to his words had she been able always to keep her neck in the dust under his foot their married life might have been passed without outward calamity and it is possible that he might still have lived but if she erred surely she had been scourged for her error with scorpions as she sat at his bedside watching him she thought of her wasted youth of her faded beauty of her shattered happiness of her fallen hopes she had still her childbut she felt towards him that she herself was so sad a creature so sombre so dark so necessarily wretched from this time forth till the day of her death that it would be better for the boy that she should never be with him there could be nothing left for her but garments dark with woe eyes red with weeping hours sad from solitude thoughts weary with memory and even yetif he would only now say that he did not believe her to have been guilty how great would be the change in her future life  then came an evening in which he seemed to be somewhat stronger than he had been he had taken some refreshment that had been prepared for him and stimulated by its strength had spoken a word or two both to nora and to his wife his words had been of no especial interestalluding to some small detail of his own condition such as are generally the chosen topics of conversation with invalids but he had been pronounced to be better and nora spoke to him cheerfully when he was taken into the next room by the man who was always at hand to move him his wife followed him and soon afterwards returned and bade nora good night she would sit by her husband and nora was to go to the room below that she might receive her lover there he was expected out that evening but mrs trevelyan said that she would not see him hugh came and went and nora took herself to her chamber the hours of the night went on and mrs trevelyan was still sitting by her husbands bed it was still september and the weather was very warm but the windows had been all closed since an hour before sunset she was sitting there thinking thinking thinking dr nevill had told her that the time now was very near she was not thinking now how very near it might be but whether there might yet be time for him to say that one word to her  emily he said in the lowest whisper  darling she answered turning round and touching him with her hand  my feet are cold there are no clothes on them  she took a thick shawl and spread it double across the bottom of the bed and put her hand upon his arm though it was clammy with perspiration it was chill and she brought the warm clothes up close round his shoulders i cant sleep he said if i could sleep i shouldnt mind then he was silent again and her thoughts went harping on still on the same subject she told herself that if ever that act of justice were to be done for her it must be done that night after a while she turned round over him ever so gently and saw that his large eyes were open and fixed upon the wall  she was kneeling now on the chair close by the bed head and her hand was on the rail of the bedstead supporting her louis she said ever so softly  well  can you say one word for your wife dear dear dearest husband  what word  i have not been a harlot to youhave i  what name is that  but what a thing louis kiss my hand louis if you believe me and very gently she laid the tips of her fingers on his lips for a moment or two she waited and the kiss did not come would he spare her in this the last moment left to him either for justice or for mercy for a moment or two the bitterness of her despair was almost unendurable she had time to think that were she once to withdraw her hand she would be condemned for everand that it must be withdrawn but at length the lips moved and with struggling ear she could hear the sound of the tongue within and the verdict of the dying man had been given in her favour he never spoke a word more either to annul it or to enforce it  some time after that she crept into noras room nora she said waking the sleeping girl it is all over  is hedead  it is all over mrs richards is there it is better than an hour since now let me come in she got into her sisters bed and there she told the tale of her tardy triumph he declared to me at last that he trusted me she saidalmost believing that real words had come from his lips to that effect then she fell into a flood of tears and after a while she also slept     chapter xcix  conclusion   at last the maniac was dead and in his last moments he had made such reparation as was in his power for the evil that he had done with that slight touch of his dry fevered lips he had made the assertion on which was to depend the future peace and comfort of the woman whom he had so cruelly misused to her mind the acquittal was perfect but she never explained to human earsnot even to those of her sisterthe manner in which it had been given her life as far as we are concerned with it has been told for the rest it cannot be but that it should be better than that which was passed if there be any retribution for such sufferings in money liberty and outward comfort such retribution she possessedfor all that had been his was now hers he had once suggested what she should do were she ever to be married again and she felt that of such a career there could be no possibility anything but that we all know that widows practices in this matter do not always tally with wives vows but as regards mrs trevelyan we are disposed to think that the promise will be kept she has her child and he will give her sufficient interest to make life worth having  early in the following spring hugh stanbury was married to nora rowley in the parish church of monkhamsat which place by that time nora found herself to be almost as much at home as she might have been under other circumstances they had prayed that the marriage might be very privatebut when the day arrived there was no very close privacy the parish church was quite full there were halfadozen bridesmaids there was a great breakfast mrs crutch had a new brown silk gown given to her there was a long article in the county gazette and there were short paragraphs in various metropolitan newspapers it was generally thought among his compeers that hugh stanbury had married into the aristocracy and that the fact was a triumph for the profession to which he belonged it shewed what a bohemian could do and that men of the press in england might gradually hope to force their way almost anywhere so great was the name of monkhams he and his wife took for themselves a very small house near the regents park at which they intend to remain until hugh shall have enabled himself to earn an additional two hundred ayear mrs trevelyan did not come to live with them but kept the cottage near the river at twickenham hugh stanbury was very averse to any protracted connection with comforts to be obtained from poor trevelyans income and told nora that he must hold her to her promise about the beefsteak in the cupboard it is our opinion that mr and mrs hugh stanbury will never want for a beefsteak and all comfortable additions until the inhabitants of london shall cease to require newspapers on their breakfast tables  brooke and mrs brooke established themselves in the house in the close on their return from their wedding tour and brooke at once put himself into intimate relations with the messrs croppers taking his fair share of the bank work dorothy was absolutely installed as mistress in her aunts house with many wonderful ceremonies with the unlocking of cupboards the outpouring of stores the giving up of keys and with many speeches made to martha this was all very painful to dorothy who could not bring herself to suppose it possible that she should be the mistress of that house during her aunts life miss stanbury however of course persevered speaking of herself as a wornout old woman with one foot in the grave who would soon be carried away and put out of sight but in a very few days things got back into their places and aunt stanbury had the keys again i knew how it would be miss said martha to her young mistress and i didnt say nothing cause you understand her so well  mrs stanbury and priscilla still live at the cottage which however to priscillas great disgust has been considerably improved and prettily furnished this was done under the auspices of hugh but with funds chiefly supplied from the house of brooke dorothy and co priscilla comes into exeter to see her sister perhaps every other week but will never sleep away from home and very rarely will eat or drink at her sisters table i dont know why i dont she said to dorothy but somehow it puts me out it delays me in my efforts to come to the straw a day nevertheless the sisters are dear friends  i fear that in some previous number a half promise was made that a husband should be found for camilla french that halfpromise cannot be treated in the manner in which any whole promise certainly would have been handled there is no husband ready for cammy french the reader however will be delighted to know that she made up her quarrel with her sister and mr gibson and is now rather fond of being a guest at mr gibsons house on her first return to exeter after the gibsons had come back from their little cornish rustication camilla declared that she could not and would not bring herself to endure a certain dress of which bella was very fondand as this dress had been bought for camilla with special reference to the glories of her anticipated married life this objection was almost natural but bella treated it as absurd and camilla at last gave way  it need only further be said that though giles hickbody and martha are not actually married as yetmen and women in their class of life always moving towards marriage with great precautionit is quite understood that the young people are engaged and are to be made happy together at some future time
