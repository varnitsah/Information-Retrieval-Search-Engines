gate and a thick shrubby growth of young apple orchard almost hid the little weathergrey house from the road this was why the young man who opened the sagging gate could not see that it was boarded up and did not cease his cheerful whistling until he had pressed through the crowding trees and found himself almost on the sunken stone doorstep over which in olden days honeysuckle had been wont to arch now only a few straggling uncaredfor vines clung forlornly to the shingles and the windows were as has been said all boarded up  the whistle died on the young mans lips and an expression of blank astonishment and dismay settled down on his facea good kindly honest face it was although perhaps it did not betoken any pronounced mental gifts on the part of its owner  what can have happened he said to himself uncle tom and aunt sally cant be deadid have seen their deaths in the paper if they was and id athought if theyd moved away itd been printed too they cant have been gone longthat flowerbed must have been made up last spring well this is a kind of setback for a fellow here ive been tramping all the way from the station athinking how good it would be to see aunt sallys sweet old face again and hear uncle toms laugh and all i find is a boardedup house going to seed spose i might as well toddle over to stetsons and inquire if they havent disappeared too  he went through the old firs back of the lot and across the field to a rather shabby house beyond a cheeryfaced woman answered his knock and looked at him in a puzzled fashion have you forgot me mrs stetson dont you remember lovell stevens and how you used to give him plum tarts when hed bring your turkeys home  mrs stetson caught both his hands in a hearty clasp  i guess i havent forgotten she declared well well and youre lovell i think i ought to know your face though youve changed a lot fifteen years have made a big difference in you come right in pa this is lovellyou mind lovell the boy aunt sally and uncle tom had for years  reckon i do drawled jonah stetson with a friendly grin aint likely to forget some of the capers you used to be cutting up youve filled out considerable where have you been for the last ten years aunt sally fretted a lot over you thinking you was dead or gone to the bad  lovells face clouded  i know i ought to have written he said repentantly but you know im a terrible poor scholar and id do most anything than try to write a letter but wheres uncle tom and aunt sally gone surely they aint dead  no said jonah stetson slowly nobut i guess theyd rather be theyre in the poorhouse  the poorhouse aunt sally in the poorhouse exclaimed lovell  yes and its a burning shame declared mrs stetson aunt sallys just breaking her heart from the disgrace of it but it didnt seem as if it could be helped uncle tom got so crippled with rheumatism he couldnt work and aunt sally was too frail to do anything they hadnt any relations and there was a mortgage on the house  there wasnt any when i went away  no they had to borrow money six years ago when uncle tom had his first spell of rheumatic fever this spring it was clear that there was nothing for them but the poorhouse they went three months ago and terrible hard they took it especially aunt sally i felt awful about it myself jonah and i would have took them if we could but we just couldntweve nothing but jonahs wages and we have eight children and not a bit of spare room i go over to see aunt sally as often as i can and take her some little thing but i dunnos she wouldnt rather not see anybody than see them in the poorhouse  lovell weighed his hat in his hands and frowned over it reflectively  who owns the house now  peter townley he held the mortgage and all the old furniture was sold too and that most killed aunt sally but do you know what shes fretting over most of all she and uncle tom will have been married fifty years in a fortnights time and aunt sally thinks its awful to have to spend their golden wedding anniversary in the poorhouse she talks about it all the time youre not going lovellfor lovell had risenyou must stop with us since your old home is closed up well scare you up a shakedown to sleep on and youre welcome as welcome i havent forgot the time you caught mary ellen just as she was tumbling into the well  thank you ill stay to tea said lovell sitting down again but i guess ill make my headquarters up at the station hotel as long as i stay round here its kind of more central  got on pretty well out west hey queried jonah  pretty well for a fellow who had nothing but his two hands to depend on when he went out said lovell cautiously ive only been a labouring man of course but ive saved up enough to start a little store when i go back thats why i came east for a trip nowbefore id be tied down to business i was hankering to see aunt sally and uncle tom once more ill never forget how kind and good they was to me there i was when dad died a little sinner of eleven just heading for destruction they give me a home and all the schooling i ever had and all the love i ever got it was aunt sallys teachings made as much a man of me as i am i never forgot em and ive tried to live up to em  after tea lovell said he thought hed stroll up the road and pay peter townley a call jonah stetson and his wife looked at each other when he had gone  got something in his eye nodded jonah him and peter werent never much of friends  maybe aunt sallys bread is coming back to her after all said his wife people used to be hard on lovell but i always liked him and im real glad hes turned out so well  lovell came back to the stetsons the next evening in the interval he had seen aunt sally and uncle tom the meeting had been both glad and sad lovell had also seen other people  ive bought uncle toms old house from peter townley he said quietly and i want you folks to help me out with my plans uncle tom and aunt sally aint going to spend their golden wedding in the poorhouseno sir theyll spend it in their own home with their old friends about them but theyre not to know anything about it till the very night do you spose any of the old furniture could be got back  i believe every stick of it could said mrs stetson excitedly most of it was bought by folks living handy and i dont believe one of them would refuse to sell it back uncle toms old chair is here to begin withaunt sally give me that herself she said she couldnt bear to have it sold mrs isaac appleby at the station bought the set of pinksprigged china and james parker bought the grandfathers clock and the whatnot is at the stanton grays  for the next fortnight lovell and mrs stetson did so much travelling round together that jonah said genially he might as well be a bachelor as far as meals and buttons went they visited every house where a bit of aunt sallys belongings could be found very successful they were too and at the end of their jaunting the interior of the little house behind the apple trees looked very much as it had looked when aunt sally and uncle tom lived there  meanwhile mrs stetson had been revolving a design in her mind and one afternoon she did some canvassing on her own account the next time she saw lovell she said  we aint going to let you do it all the women folks around here are going to furnish the refreshments for the golden wedding and the girls are going to decorate the house with golden rod  the evening of the wedding anniversary came everybody in blair was in the plot including the matron of the poorhouse that night aunt sally watched the sunset over the hills through bitter tears  i never thought id be celebrating my golden wedding in the poorhouse she sobbed uncle tom put his twisted hand on her shaking old shoulder but before he could utter any words of comfort lovell stevens stood before them  just get your bonnet on aunt sally he cried jovially and both of you come along with me ive got a buggy here for you  and you might as well say goodbye to this place for youre not coming back to it any more  lovell oh what do you mean said aunt sally tremulously  ill explain what i mean as we drive along hurry upthe folks are waiting  when they reached the little old house it was all aglow with light aunt sally gave a cry as she entered it all her old household goods were back in their places there were some new ones too for lovell had supplied all that was lacking the house was full of their old friends and neighbours mrs stetson welcomed them home again  oh tom whispered aunt sally tears of happiness streaming down her old face oh tom isnt god good  they had a right royal celebration and a supper such as the blair housewives could produce there were speeches and songs and tales lovell kept himself in the background and helped mrs stetson cut cake in the pantry all the evening but when the guests had gone he went to aunt sally and uncle tom who were sitting by the fire  heres a little golden wedding present for you he said awkwardly putting a purse into aunt sallys hand i reckon theres enough there to keep you from ever having to go to the poorhouse again and if not therell be more where that comes from when its done  there were twentyfive bright twentydollar gold pieces in the purse  we cant take it lovell protested aunt sally you cant afford it  dont you worry about that laughed lovell out west men dont think much of a little wad like that i owe you far more than can be paid in cash aunt sally you must take iti want to know theres a little home here for me and two kind hearts in it no matter where i roam  god bless you lovell said uncle tom huskily you dont know what youve done for sally and me  that night when lovell went to the little bedroom off the parlourfor aunt sally rejoicing in the fact that she was again mistress of a spare room would not hear of his going to the station hotelhe gazed at his reflection in the giltframed mirror soberly  youve just got enough left to pay your passage back west old fellow he said and then its begin all over again just where you begun before but aunt sallys face was worth it allyes sir and youve got your two hands still and an old couples prayers and blessings not such a bad capital lovell not such a bad capital     a redeeming sacrifice   the dance at byron lyalls was in full swing toff leclerc the best fiddler in three counties was enthroned on the kitchen table and from the glossy brown violin which his grandfather brought from grand pré was conjuring music which made even stiff old aunt phemy want to show her steps around the kitchen sat a row of young men and women and the open sittingroom doorway was crowded with the faces of nondancing guests who wanted to watch the sets  an eighthand reel had just been danced and the girls giddy from the much swinging of the final figure had been led back to their seats mattie lyall came out with a dipper of water and sprinkled the floor from which a fine dust was rising toffs violin purred under his hands as he waited for the next set to form the dancers were slow about it there was not the rush for the floor that there had been earlier in the evening for the supper table was now spread in the diningroom and most of the guests were hungry  fill up dere boys shouted the fiddler impatiently bring out your gals for de nex set  after a moment paul king led out joan shelley from the shadowy corner where they had been sitting they had already danced several sets together joan had not danced with anybody else that evening as they stood together under the light from the lamp on the shelf above them many curious and disapproving eyes watched them connor mitchell who had been standing in the open outer doorway with the moonlight behind him turned abruptly on his heel and went out  paul king leaned his head against the wall and watched the watchers with a smiling defiant face as they waited for the set to form he was a handsome fellow with the easy winning ways that women love his hair curled in bronze masses about his head his dark eyes were long and drowsy and laughing there was a swarthy bloom on his round cheeks and his lips were as red and beguiling as a girls a bad egg was paul king with a bad past and a bad future he was shiftless and drunken ugly tales were told of him not a man in lyalls house that night but grudged him the privilege of standing up with joan shelley  joan was a slight blossomlike girl in white looking much like the pale sweetscented house rose she wore in her dark hair her face was colourless and young very pure and softly curved she had wonderfully sweet dark blue eyes generally dropped down with notably long black lashes there were many showier girls in the groups around her but none half so lovely she made all the rosycheeked beauties seem coarse and overblown  she left in pauls clasp the hand by which he had led her out on the floor now and then he shifted his gaze from the faces before him to hers when he did she always looked up and they exchanged glances as if they had been utterly alone three other couples gradually took the floor and the reel began joan drifted through the figures with the grace of a windblown leaf paul danced with rollicking abandon seldom taking his eyes from joans face when the last mad whirl was over joans brother came up and told her in an angry tone to go into the next room and dance no more since she would dance with only one man joan looked at paul that look meant that she would do as he and none other told her paul nodded easilyhe did not want any fuss just thenand the girl went obediently into the room as she turned from him paul coolly reached out his hand and took the rose from her hair then with a triumphant glance around the room he went out  the autumn night was very clear and chill with a faint moaning wind blowing up from the northwest over the sea that lay shimmering before the door out beyond the cove the boats were nodding and curtsying on the swell and over the shore fields the great red star of the lighthouse flared out against the silvery sky paul with a whistle sauntered down the sandy lane thinking of joan how mightily he loved herhe paul king who had made a mock of so many women and had never loved before ah and she loved him she had never said so in words but eyes and tones had said itshe joan shelley the pick and pride of the harbour girls whom so many men had wooed winning their trouble for their pains he had won her she was his and his only for the asking his heart was seething with pride and triumph and passion as he strode down to the shore and flung himself on the cold sand in the black shadow of michael browns beached boat  byron lyall a grizzled elderly man half farmer half fisherman and maxwell holmes the prospect schoolteacher came up to the boat presently paul lay softly and listened to what they were saying he was not troubled by any sense of dishonour honour was something paul king could not lose since it was something he had never possessed they were talking of him and joan  what a shame that a girl like joan shelley should throw herself away on a man like that holmes said  byron lyall removed the pipe he was smoking and spat reflectively at his shadow  darned shame he agreed that girls life will be ruined if she marries him plum ruined and marry him she will hes bewitched herdarned if i can understand it a dozen better men have wanted herconnor mitchell for one and hes a honest steady fellow with a good home to offer her if king had left her alone shed have taken connor she used to like him well enough but thats all over shes infatuated with king the worthless scamp shell marry him and be sorry for it to her last day hes bad clear through and always will be why look you teacher most men pull up a bit when theyre courting a girl no matter how wild theyve been and will be again paul hasnt it hasnt made any difference he was dead drunk night afore last at the harbour head and he hasnt done a stroke of work for a month and yet joan shelleyll take him  what are her people thinking of to let her go with him asked holmes  she hasnt any but her brother hes against paul of course but it wont matter the girls fancys caught and shell go her own gait to ruin ruin i tell ye if she marries that handsome neerdowell shell be a wretched woman all her days and none to pity her  the two moved away then and paul lay motionless face downward on the sand his lips pressed against joans sweet crushed rose he felt no anger over byron lyalls unsparing condemnation he knew it was true every word of it he was a worthless scamp and always would be he knew that perfectly well it was in his blood none of his race had ever been respectable and he was worse than them all he had no intention of trying to reform because he could not and because he did not even want to he was not fit to touch joans hand yet he had meant to marry her  but to spoil her life would it do that yes it surely would and if he were out of the way taking his baleful charm out of her life connor mitchell might and doubtless would win her yet and give her all he could not  the man suddenly felt his eyes wet with tears he had never shed a tear in his daredevil life before but they came hot and stinging now something he had never known or thought of before entered into his passion and purified it he loved joan did he love her well enough to stand aside and let another take the sweetness and grace that was now his own did he love her well enough to save her from the povertystricken shamed life she must lead with him did he love her better than himself  i aint fit to think of her he groaned i never did a decent thing in my life as they say but how can i give her upgod how can i  he lay still a long time after that until the moonlight crept around the boat and drove away the shadow then he got up and went slowly down to the waters edge with joans rose all wet with his unaccustomed tears in his hands slowly and reverently he plucked off the petals and scattered them on the ripples where they drifted lightly off like fairy shallops on moonshine when the last one had fluttered from his fingers he went back to the house and hunted up captain alec matheson who was smoking his pipe in a corner of the verandah and watching the young folks dancing through the open door the two men talked together for some time  when the dance broke up and the guests straggled homeward paul sought joan rob shelley had his own girl to see home and relinquished the guardianship of his sister with a scowl paul strode out of the kitchen and down the steps at the side of joan smiling with his usual daredeviltry he whistled noisily all the way up the lane  great little dance he said my last in prospect for a spell i guess  why asked joan wonderingly  oh im going to take a run down to south america in mathesons schooner lord knows when ill come back this old place has got too deadly dull to suit me im going to look for something livelier  joans lips turned ashen under the fringes of her white fascinator she trembled violently and put one of her small brown hands up to her throat youyou are not coming back she said faintly  not likely im pretty well tired of prospect and i havent got anything to hold me here thingsll be livelier down south  joan said nothing more they walked along the sprucefringed roads where the moonbeams laughed down through the thick softly swaying boughs paul whistled one rollicking tune after another the girl bit her lips and clenched her hands he cared nothing for herhe had been making a mock of her as of others hurt pride and wounded love fought each other in her soul pride conquered she would not let him or anyone see that she cared she would not care  at her gate paul held out his hand  well goodbye joan im sailing tomorrow so i wont see you againnot for years likely you will be some sober old married woman when i come back to prospect if i ever do  goodbye said joan steadily she gave him her cold hand and looked calmly into his face without quailing she had loved him with all her heart but now a fatal scorn of him was already mingling with her love he was what they said he was a scamp without principle or honour  paul whistled himself out of the shelley lane and over the hill then he flung himself down under the spruces crushed his face into the spicy frosted ferns and had his black hour alone  but when captain alecs schooner sailed out of the harbour the next day paul king was on board of her the wildest and most hilarious of a wild and hilarious crew prospect people nodded their satisfaction  good riddance they said paul king is black to the core he never did a decent thing in his life     a soul that was not at home   there was a very fine sunset on the night paul and miss trevor first met and she had lingered on the headland beyond noels cove to delight in it the west was splendid in daffodil and rose away to the north there was a mackerel sky of little fiery golden clouds and across the water straight from miss trevors feet ran a sparkling path of light to the sun whose rim had just touched the throbbing edge of the purple sea off to the left were softly swelling violet hills and beyond the sandshore where little waves were crisping and silvering there was a harbour where scores of slender masts were nodding against the gracious horizon  miss trevor sighed with sheer happiness in all the wonderful fleeting elusive loveliness of sky and sea then she turned to look back at noels cove dim and shadowy in the gloom of the tall headlands and she saw paul  it did not occur to her that he could be a shore boyshe knew the shore type too well she thought his coming mysterious for she was sure he had not come along the sand and the tide was too high for him to have come past the other headland yet there he was sitting on a red sandstone boulder with his bare bronzed shapely little legs crossed in front of him and his hands clasped around his knee he was not looking at miss trevor but at the sunsetor rather it seemed as if he were looking through the sunset to still grander and more radiant splendours beyond of which the things seen were only the pale reflections not worthy of attention from those who had the gift of further sight  miss trevor looked him over carefully with eyes that had seen a good many people in many parts of the world for more years than she found it altogether pleasant to acknowledge and she concluded that he was quite the handsomest lad she had ever seen he had a lithe supple body with sloping shoulders and a brown satin throat his hair was thick and wavy of a fine reddish chestnut his brows were very straight and much darker than his hair and his eyes were large and grey and meditative the modelling of chin and jaw was perfect and his mouth was delicious being full without pouting the crimson lips just softly touching and curving into finely finished little corners that narrowly escaped being dimpled  his attire was a blue cotton shirt and a pair of scanty corduroy knickerbockers but he wore it with such an unconscious air of purple and fine linen that miss trevor was tricked into believing him much better dressed than he really was  presently he smiled dreamily and the smile completed her subjugation it was not merely an affair of lip and eye as are most smiles it seemed an illumination of his whole body as if some lamp had suddenly burst into flame inside of him irradiating him from his chestnut crown to the tips of his unspoiled toes best of all it was involuntary born of no external effort or motive but simply the outflashing of some wild delicious thought that was as untrammelled and freakish as the wind of the sea  miss trevor made up her mind that she must find out all about him and she stepped out from the shadows of the rocks into the vivid eerie light that was glowing all along the shore the boy turned his head and looked at her first with surprise then with inquiry then with admiration miss trevor in a white dress with a lace scarf on her dark stately head was well worth admiring she smiled at him and paul smiled back it was not quite up to his first smile having more of the effect of being put on from the outside but at least it conveyed the subtly flattering impression that it had been put on solely for her and they were as good friends from that moment as if they had known each other for a hundred years miss trevor had enough discrimination to realize this and know that she need not waste time in becoming acquainted  i want to know your name and where you live and what you were looking at beyond the sunset she said  my name is paul hubert i live over there and i cant tell just what i saw in the sunset but when i go home im going to write it all in my foolscap book  in her surprise over the second clause of his answer miss trevor forgot at first to appreciate the last over there according to his gesture was up at the head of noels cove where there was a little grey house perched on the rocks and looking like a large seashell cast up by the tide the house had a stovepipe coming out of its roof in lieu of a chimney and two of its window panes were replaced by shingles could this boy who looked as young princes shouldand seldom dolive there then he was a shore boy after all  who lives there with you she asked you seeplaintivelyi must ask questions about you i know we like each other and that is all that really matters but there are some tiresome items which it would be convenient to know for example have you a fathera mother are there any more of you how long have you been yourself  paul did not reply immediately he clasped his hands behind him and looked at her affectionately  i like the way you talk he said i never knew anybody did talk like that except folks in books and my rock people  your rock people  im eleven years old i havent any father or mother theyre dead i live over there with stephen kane stephen is splendid he plays the violin and takes me fishing in his boat when i get bigger hes going shares with me i love him and i love my rock people too  what do you mean by your rock people asked miss trevor enjoying herself hugely this was the only child she had ever met who talked as she wanted children to talk and who understood her remarks without having to have them translated  nora is one of them said paul the best one of them i love her better than all the others because she came first she lives around that point and she has black eyes and black hair and she knows all about the mermaids and water kelpies you ought to hear the stories she can tell then there are the twin sailors they dont live anywherethey sail all the time but they often come ashore to talk to me they are a pair of jolly tars and they have seen everything in the worldand more than whats in the world if you only knew it do you know what happened to the youngest twin sailor once he was sailing and he sailed right into a moonglade a moonglade is the track the full moon makes on the water when it is rising from the sea you know well the youngest twin sailor sailed along the moonglade till he came right up to the moon and there was a little golden door in the moon and he opened it and sailed right through he had some wonderful adventures inside the moonive got them all written down in my foolscap book then there is the golden lady of the cave one day i found a big cave down the shore and i went in and in and inand after a while i found the golden lady she has golden hair right down to her feet and her dress is all glittering and glistening like gold that is alive and she has a golden harp and she plays all day long on ityou might hear the music if youd listen carefully but probbly youd think it was only the wind among the rocks ive never told nora about the golden lady because i think it would hurt her feelings it even hurts her feelings when i talk too long with the twin sailors and i hate to hurt noras feelings because i do love her best of all my rock people  paul how much of this is true gasped miss trevor  why none of it said paul opening his eyes widely and reproachfully i thought you would know that if id sposed you wouldnt id have warned you there wasnt any of it true i thought you were one of the kind that would know  i am oh i am said miss trevor eagerly i really would have known if i had stopped to think well its getting late now i must go back although i dont want to but im coming to see you again will you be here tomorrow afternoon  paul nodded  yes i promised to meet the youngest twin sailor down at the striped rocks tomorrow afternoon but the day after will do just as well that is the beauty of the rock people you know you can always depend on them to be there just when you want them the youngest twin sailor wont mindhes very goodtempered if it was the oldest twin i dare say hed be cross i have my suspicions about that oldest twin sometimes i blieve hed be a pirate if he dared you dont know how fierce he can look at times theres really something very mysterious about him  on her way back to the hotel miss trevor remembered the foolscap book  i must get him to show it to me she mused smiling why the boy is a born geniusand to think he should be a shore boy i cant understand it and here i am loving him already well a woman has to love somethingand you dont have to know people for years before you can love them  paul was waiting on the noels cove rocks for miss trevor the next afternoon he was not alone a tall man with a lined strongfeatured face and a grey beard was with him the man was clad in a rough suit and looked what he was a longshore fisherman but he had deepset kindly eyes and miss trevor liked his face he moved off to one side when she came and stood there for a little apparently gazing out to sea while paul and miss trevor talked then he walked away up the cove and disappeared in his little grey house  stephen came down to see if you were a suitable person for me to talk to said paul gravely  i hope he thinks i am said miss trevor amused  oh he does he wouldnt have gone away and left us alone if he didnt stephen is very particular who he lets me sociate with why even the rock people nowi had to promise id never let the twin sailors swear before hed allow me to be friends with them sometimes i know by the look of the oldest twin that hes just dying to swear but i never let him because i promised stephen id do anything for stephen hes awful good to me stephens bringing me up you know and hes bound to do it well were just perfectly happy here only i wish id more books to read we go fishing and when we come home at night i help stephen clean the fish and then we sit outside the door and he plays the violin for me we sit there for hours sometimes we never talk muchstephen isnt much of a hand for talkingbut we just sit and think theres not many men like stephen i can tell you  miss trevor did not get a glimpse of the foolscap book that day nor for many days after paul blushed all over his beautiful face whenever she mentioned it  oh i couldnt show you that he said uncomfortably why ive never even showed it to stephenor nora let me tell you something else instead something that happened to me once long ago youll find it more interesting than the foolscap book only you must remember it isnt true you wont forget that will you  ill try to remember miss trevor agreed  well i was sitting here one evening just like i was last night and the sun was setting and an enchanted boat came sailing over the sea and i got into her the boat was all pearly like the inside of the mussel shells and her sail was like moonshine well i sailed right across to the sunset think of thative been in the sunset and what do you suppose it is the sunset is a land all flowers like a great garden and the clouds are beds of flowers we sailed into a great big harbour a thousand times bigger than the harbour over there at your hotel and i stepped out of the boat on a normous meadow all roses i stayed there for ever so long it seemed almost a year but the youngest twin sailor says i was only away a few hours or so you see in sunset land the time is ever so much longer than it is here but i was glad to come back too im always glad to come back to the cove and stephen now you know this never really happened  miss trevor would not give up the foolscap book so easily but for a long time paul refused to show it to her she came to the cove every day and every day paul seemed more delightful to her he was so quaint so clever so spontaneous yet there was nothing premature or unnatural about him he was wholly boy fond of fun and frolic not too good for little spurts of quick temper now and again though as he was careful to explain to miss trevor he never showed them to a lady  i get real mad with the twin sailors sometimes and even with stephen for all hes so good to me but i couldnt be mad with you or nora or the golden lady it would never do  every day he had some new story to tell of a wonderful adventure on rock or sea always taking the precaution of assuring her beforehand that it wasnt true the boys fancy was like a prism separating every ray that fell upon it into rainbows he was passionately fond of the shore and water the only world for him beyond noels cove was the world of his imagination he had no companions except stephen and the rock people  and now you he told miss trevor i love you too but i know youll be going away before long so i dont let myself love you as muchquiteas stephen and the rock people  but you could couldnt you pleaded miss trevor if you and i were to go on being together every day you could love me just as well as you love them couldnt you  paul considered in a charming way he had  of course i could love you better than the twin sailors and the golden lady he announced finally and i think perhaps i could love you as much as i love stephen but not as much as noraoh no i wouldnt love you quite as much as nora she was first you see shes always been there i feel sure i couldnt ever love anybody as much as nora  one day when stephen was out to the mackerel grounds paul took miss trevor into the little grey house and showed her his treasures they climbed the ladder in one corner to the loft where paul slept the window of it small and squarepaned looked seaward and the moan of the sea and the pipe of the wind sounded there night and day paul had many rare shells and seaweeds curious flotsam and jetsam of shore storms and he had a small shelf full of books  theyre splendid he said enthusiastically stephen brought me them all every time stephen goes to town to ship his mackerel he brings me home a new book  were you ever in town yourself asked miss trevor  oh yes twice stephen took me it was a wonderful place i tell you when i next met the twin sailors it was me did the talking then i had to tell them about all i saw and all that had happened and nora was ever so interested too the golden lady wasnt thoughshe didnt hardly listen golden people are like that  would you like said miss trevor watching him closely to live always in a town and have all the books you wanted and play with real girls and boysand visit those strange lands your twin sailors tell you of  paul looked startled  idontknow he said doubtfully i dont think id like it very well if stephen and nora werent there too  but the new thought remained in his mind it came back to him at intervals seeming less new and startling every time  and why not miss trevor asked herself the boy should have a chance i shall never have a son of my ownhe shall be to me in the place of one  the day came when paul at last showed her the foolscap book he brought it to her as she sat on the rocks of the headland  im going to run around and talk to nora while you read it he said im afraid ive been neglecting her latelyand i think she feels it  miss trevor took the foolscap book it was made of several sheets of paper sewed together and encased in an oilcloth cover it was nearly filled with writing in a round childish hand and it was very neat although the orthography was rather wild and the punctuation capricious miss trevor read it through in no very long time it was a curious medley of quaint thoughts and fancies conversations with the twin sailors filled many of the pages accounts of pauls adventures occupied others sometimes it seemed impossible that a child of eleven should have written them then would come an expression so boyish and naive that miss trevor laughed delightedly over it when she finished the book and closed it she found stephen kane at her elbow he removed his pipe and nodded at the foolscap book  what do you think of it he said  i think it is wonderful paul is a very clever child  ive often thought so said stephen laconically he thrust his hands into his pockets and gazed moodily out to sea miss trevor had never before had an opportunity to talk to him in pauls absence and she determined to make the most of it  i want to know something about paul she said all about him is he any relation to you  no i expected to marry his mother once though said stephen unemotionally his hand in his pocket was clutching his pipe fiercely but miss trevor could not know that she was a shore girl and very pretty well she fell in love with a young fellow that came teaching up t the harbour school and he with her they got married and she went away with him he was a good enough sort of chap i know that now though once i wasnt disposed to think much good of him but twas a mistake all the same rachel couldnt live away from the shore she fretted and pined and broke her heart for it away there in his world finally her husband died and she came backbut it was too late for her she only lived a monthand there was paul a baby of two i took him there was nobody else rachel had no relatives nor her husband either ive done what i could for himnot that its been much perhaps  i am sure you have done a great deal for him said miss trevor rather patronizingly but i think he should have more than you can give him now he should be sent to school  stephen nodded  maybe he never went to school the harbour school was too far away i taught him to read and write and bought him all the books i could afford but i cant do any more for him  but i can said miss trevor and i want to will you give paul to me mr kane i love him dearly and he shall have every advantage im richi can do a great deal for him  stephen continued to gaze out to sea with an expressionless face finally he said ive been expecting to hear you say something of the sort i dont know if you took paul away hed grow to be a cleverer man and a richer man maybe but would he be any betteror happier hes his mothers sonhe loves the sea and its ways theres nothing of his father in him except his hankering after books but i wont choose for himhe can go if he likeshe can go if he likes  in the end paul liked since stephen refused to influence him by so much as a word paul thought stephen didnt seem to care much whether he went or stayed and he was dazzled by miss trevors charm and the lure of books and knowledge she held out to him  ill go i guess he said with a long sigh  miss trevor clasped him close to her and kissed him maternally paul kissed her cheek shyly in return he thought it very wonderful that he was to live with her always he felt happy and excitedso happy and excited that the parting when it came slipped over him lightly miss trevor even thought he took it too easily and had a vague wish that he had shown more sorrow stephen said farewell to the boy he loved better than life with no visible emotion  goodbye paul be a good boy and learn all you can he hesitated a moment and then said slowly if you dont like it come back  did you bid goodbye to your rock people miss trevor asked him with a smile as they drove away  no icouldntiididnt even tell them i was going away nora would break her heart id rather not talk of them anymore if you please maybe i wont want them when ive plenty of books and lots of other boys and girlsreal onesto play with  they drove the ten miles to the town where they were to take the train the next day paul enjoyed the drive and the sights of the busy streets at its end he was all excitement and animation after they had had tea at the house of the friend where miss trevor meant to spend the night they went for a walk in the park paul was tired and very quiet when they came back he was put away to sleep in a bedroom whose splendours frightened him and left alone  at first paul lay very still on his luxurious perfumed pillows it was the first night he had ever spent away from the little seawardlooking loft where he could touch the rafters with his hands he thought of it now and a lump came into his throat and a strange new bitter longing came into his heart he missed the sea plashing on the rocks below himhe could not sleep without that old lullaby he turned his face into the pillow and the longing and loneliness grew worse and hurt him until he moaned oh he wanted to be back home surely he had not left ithe could never have meant to leave it out there the stars would be shining over the harbour stephen would be sitting at the door all alone with his violin but he would not be playing itall at once paul knew he would not be playing it he would be sitting there with his head bowed and the loneliness in his heart calling to the loneliness in pauls heart over all the miles between them oh he could never have really meant to leave stephen  and nora nora would be down on the rocks waiting for himfor him paul who would never come to her more he could see her elfin little face peering around the point watching for him wistfully  paul sat up in bed choking with tears oh what were books and strange countrieswhat was even miss trevor the friend of a monthto the call of the sea and stephens kind deep eyes and his dear rock people he could not stay away from themnevernever  he slipped out of bed very softly and dressed in the dark then he lighted the lamp timidly and opened the little brown chest stephen had given him it held his books and his treasures but he took out only a pencil a bit of paper and the foolscap book with a hand shaking in his eagerness he wrote      dear miss trever      im going back home dont be fritened about me because i know     the way ive got to go something is calling me dont be     cross i love you but i cant stay im leaving my foolscap     book for you you can keep it always but i must go back to     stephen and nora                                                   paul  he put the note on the foolscap book and laid them on the table then he blew out the light took his cap and went softly out the house was very still holding his breath he tiptoed downstairs and opened the front door before it ran the street which went he knew straight out to the country road that led home paul closed the door and stole down the steps his heart beating painfully but when he reached the sidewalk he broke into a frantic run under the limes it was late and no one was out on that quiet street he ran until his breath gave out then walked miserably until he recovered it and then ran again he dared not stop running until he was out of that horrible town which seemed like a prison closing around him where the houses shut out the stars and the wind could only creep in a narrow space like a fettered cringing thing instead of sweeping grandly over great salt wastes of sea  at last the houses grew few and scattered and finally he left them behind he drew a long breath this was betterrather smothering yet of course with nothing but hills and fields and dark woods all about him but at least his own sky was above him looking just the same as it looked out home at noels cove he recognized the stars as friends how often stephen had pointed them out to him as they sat at night by the door of the little house  he was not at all frightened now he knew the way home and the kind night was before him every step was bringing him nearer to stephen and nora and the twin sailors he whistled as he walked sturdily along  the dawn was just breaking when he reached noels cove the eastern sky was all pale rose and silver and the sea was mottled over with dear grey ripples in the west over the harbour the sky was a very fine ethereal blue and the wind blew from there salt and bracing paul was tired but he ran lightly down the shelving rocks to the cove stephen was getting ready to launch his boat when he saw paul he started and a strange vivid exultant expression flashed across his face  paul felt a sudden chillthe upspringing fountain of his gladness was checked in midleap he had known no doubt on the way homeall that long weary walk he had known no doubtbut now  stephen he cried ive come back i had to stephen are you gladare you glad  stephens face was as emotionless as ever the burst of feeling which had frightened paul by its unaccustomedness had passed like a fleeting outbreak of sunshine between dull clouds  i reckon i am he said yes i reckon i am i kind ofhopedyou would come back youd better go in and get some breakfast  pauls eyes were as radiant as the deepening dawn he knew stephen was glad and he knew there was nothing more to be said about it they were back just where they were before miss trevor cameback in their perfect unmarred sufficient comradeship  i must just run around and see nora first said paul     abel and his great adventure   come out of doors mastercome out of doors i cant talk or think right with walls around menever could lets go out to the garden these were almost the first words i ever heard abel armstrong say he was a member of the board of school trustees in stillwater and i had not met him before this late may evening when i had gone down to confer with him upon some small matter of business for i was the new schoolmaster in stillwater having taken the school for the summer term  it was a rather lonely country districta fact of which i was glad for life had been going somewhat awry with me and my heart was sore and rebellious over many things that have nothing to do with this narration stillwater offered time and opportunity for healing and counsel yet looking back i doubt if i should have found either had it not been for abel and his beloved garden  abel armstrong he was always called old abel though he was barely sixty lived in a quaint gray house close by the harbour shore i heard a good deal about him before i saw him he was called queer but stillwater folks seemed to be very fond of him he and his sister tamzine lived together she so my garrulous landlady informed me had not been sound of mind at times for many years but she was all right now only odd and quiet abel had gone to college for a year when he was young but had given it up when tamzine went crazy there was no one else to look after her abel had settled down to it with apparent content at least he had never complained  always took things easy abel did said mrs campbell never seemed to worry over disappointments and trials as most folks do seems to me that as long as abel armstrong can stride up and down in that garden of his reciting poetry and speeches or talking to that yaller cat of his as if it was a human he doesnt care much how the world wags on he never had much gitupandgit his father was a hustler but the family didnt take after him they all favoured the mothers peoplesorter shiftless and dreamy taint the way to git on in this world  no good and worthy mrs campbell it was not the way to get on in your world but there are other worlds where getting on is estimated by different standards and abel armstrong lived in one of thesea world far beyond the ken of the thrifty stillwater farmers and fishers something of this i had sensed even before i saw him and that night in his garden under a sky of smoky red blossoming into stars above the harbour i found a friend whose personality and philosophy were to calm and harmonize and enrich my whole existence this sketch is my grateful tribute to one of the rarest and finest souls god ever clothed with clay  he was a tall man somewhat ungainly of figure and homely of face but his large deep eyes of velvety nutbrown were very beautiful and marvellously bright and clear for a man of his age he wore a little pointed wellcaredfor beard innocent of gray but his hair was grizzled and altogether he had the appearance of a man who had passed through many sorrows which had marked his body as well as his soul looking at him i doubted mrs campbells conclusion that he had not minded giving up college this man had given up much and felt it deeply but he had outlived the pain and the blessing of sacrifice had come to him his voice was very melodious and beautiful and the brown hand he held out to me was peculiarly long and shapely and flexible  we went out to the garden in the scented moist air of a maritime spring evening behind the garden was a cloudy pine wood the house closed it in on the left while in front and on the right a row of tall lombardy poplars stood out in stately purple silhouette against the sunset sky  always liked lombardies said abel waving a long arm at them they are the trees of princesses when i was a boy they were fashionable anyone who had any pretensions to gentility had a row of lombardies at the foot of his lawn or up his lane or at any rate one on either side of his front door theyre out of fashion now folks complain they die at the top and get raggedlooking so they doso they do if you dont risk your neck every spring climbing up a light ladder to trim them out as i do my neck isnt worth much to anyone which i suppose is why ive never broken it and my lombardies never look outatelbows my mother was especially fond of them she liked their dignity and their standoffishness they dont hobnob with every tom dick and harry if its pines for company master its lombardies for society  we stepped from the front doorstone into the garden there was another entrancea sagging gate flanked by two branching white lilacs from it a little dappled path led to a huge appletree in the centre a great swelling cone of rosy blossom with a mossy circular seat around its trunk but abels favourite seat so he told me was lower down the slope under a little trellis overhung with the delicate emerald of young hopvines he led me to it and pointed proudly to the fine view of the harbour visible from it the early sunset glow of rose and flame had faded out of the sky the water was silvery and mirrorlike dim sails drifted along by the darkening shore a bell was ringing in a small catholic chapel across the harbour mellowly and dreamily sweet the chime floated through the dusk blent with the moan of the sea the great revolving light at the channel trembled and flashed against the opal sky and far out beyond the golden sanddunes of the bar was the crinkled gray ribbon of a passing steamers smoke  there isnt that view worth looking at said old abel with a loving proprietary pride you dont have to pay anything for it either all that sea and sky freewithout money and without price lets sit down here in the hopvine arbour master therell be a moonrise presently im never tired of finding out what a moonrise sheen can be like over that sea theres a surprise in it every time now master youre getting your mouth in the proper shape to talk businessbut dont you do it nobody should talk business when hes expecting a moonrise not that i like talking business at any time  unfortunately it has to be talked of sometimes mr armstrong i said  yes it seems to be a necessary evil master he acknowledged but i know what business youve come upon and we can settle it in five minutes after the moons well up ill just agree to everything you and the other two trustees want lord knows why they ever put me on the school board maybe its because im so ornamental they wanted one goodlooking man i reckon  his low chuckle so full of mirth and so free from malice was infectious i laughed also as i sat down in the hopvine arbour  now you neednt talk if you dont want to he said and i wont well just sit here sociable like and if we think of anything worth while to say well say it otherwise not if you can sit in silence with a person for half an hour and feel comfortable you and that person can be friends if you cant friends youll never be and you neednt waste time in trying  abel and i passed successfully the test of silence that evening in the hopvine arbour i was strangely content to sit and thinksomething i had not cared to do lately a peace long unknown to my stormy soul seemed hovering near it the garden was steeped in it old abels personality radiated it i looked about me and wondered whence came the charm of that tangled unworldly spot  nice and far from the marketplace isnt it asked abel suddenly as if he had heard my unasked question no buying and selling and getting gain here nothing was ever sold out of this garden tamzine has her vegetable plot over yonder but what we dont eat we give away geordie marr down the harbour has a big garden like this and he sells heaps of flowers and fruit and vegetables to the hotel folks he thinks im an awful fool because i wont do the same well he gets money out of his garden and i get happiness out of mine thats the difference sposing i could make more moneywhat then id only be taking it from people that needed it more theres enough for tamzine and me as for geordie marr there isnt a more unhappy creature on gods earthhes always stewing in a broth of trouble poor man o course he brews up most of it for himself but i reckon that doesnt make it any easier to bear ever sit in a hopvine arbour before master  i was to grow used to abels abrupt change of subject i answered that i never had  great place for dreaming said abel complacently being young no doubt you dream aplenty  i answered hotly and bitterly that i had done with dreams  no you havent said abel meditatively you may think you have what then first thing you know youll be dreaming againthank the lord for it i aint going to ask you whats soured you on dreaming just now after awhile youll begin again especially if you come to this garden as much as i hope you will its chockful of dreamsany kind of dreams you take your choice now i favour dreams of adventures if youll believe it im sixtyone and i never do anything rasher than go out codfishing on a fine day but i still lust after adventures then i dream im an awful fellowbloodthirsty  i burst out laughing perhaps laughter was somewhat rare in that old garden tamzine who was weeding at the far end lifted her head in a startled fashion and walked past us into the house she did not look at us or speak to us she was reputed to be abnormally shy she was very stout and wore a dress of bright redandwhite striped material her face was round and blank but her reddish hair was abundant and beautiful a huge orangecoloured cat was at her heels as she passed us he bounded over to the arbour and sprang up on abels knee he was a gorgeous brute with vivid green eyes and immense white double paws  captain kidd mr woodley he introduced us as seriously as if the cat had been a human being neither captain kidd nor i responded very enthusiastically  you dont like cats i reckon master said abel stroking the captains velvet back i dont blame you i was never fond of them myself until i found the captain i saved his life and when youve saved a creatures life youre bound to love it its next thing to giving it life there are some terrible thoughtless people in the world master some of those city folks who have summer homes down the harbour are so thoughtless that theyre cruel its the worst kind of cruelty i thinkthe thoughtless kind you cant cope with it they keep cats there in the summer and feed them and pet them and doll them up with ribbons and collars and then in the fall they go off and leave them to starve or freeze it makes my blood boil master  one day last winter i found a poor old mother cat dead on the shore lying against the skin and bone bodies of her three little kittens she had died trying to shelter them she had her poor stiff claws around them master i cried then i swore then i carried those poor little kittens home and fed hem up and found good homes for them i know the woman who left the cat when she comes back this summer im going to go down and tell her my opinion of her itll be rank meddling but lord how i love meddling in a good cause  was captain kidd one of the forsaken i asked  yes i found him one bitter cold day in winter caught in the branches of a tree by his darnfool ribbon collar he was almost starving lord if you could have seen his eyes he was nothing but a kitten and hed got his living somehow since hed been left till he got hung up when i loosed him he gave my hand a pitiful swipe with his little red tongue he wasnt the prosperous freebooter you behold now he was meek as moses that was nine years ago his life has been long in the land for a cat hes a good old pal the captain is  i should have expected you to have a dog i said  abel shook his head  i had a dog once i cared so much for him that when he died i couldnt bear the thought of ever getting another in his place he was a friendyou understand the captains only a pal im fond of the captainall the fonder because of the spice of deviltry there is in all cats but i loved my dog there isnt any devil in a good dog thats why theyre more lovable than catsbut im darned if theyre as interesting  i laughed as i rose regretfully  must you go master and we havent talked any business after all i reckon its that stove matter youve come about its like those two fool trustees to start up a stove sputter in spring its a wonder they didnt leave it till dogdays and begin then  they merely wished me to ask you if you approved of putting in a new stove  tell them to put in a new stoveany kind of a new stoveand be hanged to them rejoined abel as for you master youre welcome to this garden any time if youre tired or lonely or too ambitious or angry come here and sit awhile master do you think any man could keep mad if he sat and looked into the heart of a pansy for ten minutes when you feel like talking ill talk and when you feel like thinking ill let you im a great hand to leave folks alone  i think ill come often i said perhaps too often  not likely masternot likelynot after weve watched a moonrise contentedly together its as good a test of compatibility as any i know youre young and im old but our souls are about the same age i reckon and well find lots to say to each other are you going straight home from here  yes  then im going to bother you to stop for a moment at mary bascoms and give her a bouquet of my white lilacs she loves em and im not going to wait till shes dead to send her flowers  shes very ill just now isnt she  shes got the bascom consumption that means she may die in a month like her brother or linger on for twenty years like her father but long or short white lilac in spring is sweet and im sending her a fresh bunch every day while it lasts its a rare night master i envy you your walk home in the moonlight along that shore  better come part of the way with me i suggested  no abel glanced at the house tamzine never likes to be alone o nights so i take my moonlight walks in the garden the moons a great friend of mine master ive loved her ever since i can remember when i was a little lad of eight i fell asleep in the garden one evening and wasnt missed i woke up alone in the night and i was most scared to death master lord what shadows and queer noises there were i darsnt move i just sat there quaking poor small mite then all at once i saw the moon looking down at me through the pine boughs just like an old friend i was comforted right off got up and walked to the house as brave as a lion looking at her goodnight master tell mary the lilacsll last another week yet  from that night abel and i were cronies we walked and talked and kept silence and fished cod together stillwater people thought it very strange that i should prefer his society to that of the young fellows of my own age mrs campbell was quite worried over it and opined that there had always been something queer about me birds of a feather  i loved that old garden by the harbour shore even abel himself i think could hardly have felt a deeper affection for it when its gate closed behind me it shut out the world and my corroding memories and discontents in its peace my soul emptied itself of the bitterness which had been filling and spoiling it and grew normal and healthy again aided thereto by abels wise words he never preached but he radiated courage and endurance and a frank acceptance of the hard things of life as well as a cordial welcome of its pleasant things he was the sanest soul i ever met he neither minimized ill nor exaggerated good but he held that we should never be controlled by either pain should not depress us unduly nor pleasure lure us into forgetfulness and sloth all unknowingly he made me realize that i had been a bit of a coward and a shirker i began to understand that my personal woes were not the most important things in the universe even to myself in short abel taught me to laugh again and when a man can laugh wholesomely things are not going too badly with him  that old garden was always such a cheery place even when the east wind sang in minor and the waves on the gray shore were sad hints of sunshine seemed to be lurking all about it perhaps this was because there were so many yellow flowers in it tamzine liked yellow flowers captain kidd too always paraded it in panoply of gold he was so large and effulgent that one hardly missed the sun considering his presence i wondered that the garden was always so full of singing birds but the captain never meddled with them probably he understood that his master would not have tolerated it for a moment so there was always a song or a chirp somewhere overhead flew the gulls and the cranes the wind in the pines always made a glad salutation abel and i paced the walks in high converse on matters beyond the ken of cat or king  i liked to ponder on all problems though i can never solve them abel used to say my father held that we should never talk of things we couldnt understand but lord master if we didnt the subjects for conversation would be mighty few i reckon the gods laugh many a time to hear us but what matter so long as we remember that were only men and dont take to fancying ourselves gods really knowing good and evil i reckon our discussions wont do us or anyone much harm so well have another whack at the origin of evil this evening master  tamzine forgot to be shy with me at last and gave me a broad smile of welcome every time i came but she rarely spoke to me she spent all her spare time weeding the garden which she loved as well as abel did she was addicted to bright colours and always wore wrappers of very gorgeous print she worshipped abel and his word was a law unto her  i am very thankful tamzine is so well said abel one evening as we watched the sunset the day had begun sombrely in gray cloud and mist but it ended in a pomp of scarlet and gold there was a time when she wasnt masteryouve heard but for years now she has been quite able to look after herself and so if i fare forth on the last great adventure some of these days tamzine will not be left helpless  she is ten years older than you it is likely she will go before you i said  abel shook his head and stroked his smart beard i always suspected that beard of being abels last surviving vanity it was always so carefully groomed while i had no evidence that he ever combed his grizzled mop of hair  no tamzine will outlive me shes got the armstrong heart i have the marwood heartmy mother was a marwood we dont live to be old and we go quick and easy im glad of it i dont think im a coward master but the thought of a lingering death gives me a queer sick feeling of horror there im not going to say any more about it i just mentioned it so that some day when you hear that old abel armstrong has been found dead you wont feel sorry youll remember i wanted it that way not that im tired of life either its very pleasant what with my garden and captain kidd and the harbour out there but its a trifle monotonous at times and death will be something of a change master im real curious about it  i hate the thought of death i said gloomily  oh youre young the young always do death grows friendlier as we grow older not that one of us really wants to die though master tennyson spoke truth when he said that theres old mrs warner at the channel head shes had heaps of trouble all her life poor soul and shes lost almost everyone she cared about shes always saying that shell be glad when her time comes and she doesnt want to live any longer in this vale of tears but when she takes a sick spell lord what a fuss she makes master doctors from town and a trained nurse and enough medicine to kill a dog life may be a vale of tears all right master but there are some folks who enjoy weeping i reckon  summer passed through the garden with her procession of roses and lilies and hollyhocks and golden glow the golden glow was particularly fine that year there was a great bank of it at the lower end of the garden like a huge billow of sunshine tamzine revelled in it but abel liked more subtlytinted flowers there was a certain dark winehued hollyhock which was a favourite with him he would sit for hours looking steadfastly into one of its shallow satin cups i found him so one afternoon in the hopvine arbour  this colour always has a soothing effect on me he explained yellow excites me too muchmakes me restlessmakes me want to sail beyond the bourne of sunset i looked at that surge of golden glow down there today till i got all worked up and thought my life had been an awful failure i found a dead butterfly and had a little funeralburied it in the fern corner and i thought i hadnt been any more use in the world than that poor little butterfly oh i was woeful master then i got me this hollyhock and sat down here to look at it alone when a mans alone master hes most with godor with the devil the devil rampaged around me all the time i was looking at that golden glow but god spoke to me through the hollyhock and it seemed to me that a man whos as happy as i am and has got such a garden has made a real success of living  i hope ill be able to make as much of a success i said sincerely  i want you to make a different kind of success though master said abel shaking his head i want you to do thingsthe things id have tried to do if id had the chance its in you to do themif you set your teeth and go ahead  i believe i can set my teeth and go ahead now thanks to you mr armstrong i said i was heading straight for failure when i came here last spring but youve changed my course  given you a sort of compass to steer by havent i queried abel with a smile i aint too modest to take some credit for it i saw i could do you some good but my garden has done more than i did if youll believe it its wonderful what a garden can do for a man when he lets it have its way come sit down here and bask master the sunshine may be gone tomorrow lets just sit and think  we sat and thought for a long while presently abel said abruptly  you dont see the folks i see in this garden master you dont see anybody but me and old tamzine and captain kidd i see all who used to be here long ago it was a lively place then there were plenty of us and we were as gay a set of youngsters as youd find anywhere we tossed laughter backwards and forwards here like a ball and now old tamzine and older abel are all that are left  he was silent a moment looking at the phantoms of memory that paced invisibly to me the dappled walks and peeped merrily through the swinging boughs then he went on  of all the folks i see here there are two that are more vivid and real than all the rest master one is my sister alice she died thirty years ago she was very beautiful youd hardly believe that to look at tamzine and me would you but it is true we always called her queen aliceshe was so stately and handsome she had brown eyes and red gold hair just the colour of that nasturtium there she was fathers favourite the night she was born they didnt think my mother would live father walked this garden all night and just under that old appletree he knelt at sunrise and thanked god when they came to tell him that all was well  alice was always a creature of joy this old garden rang with her laughter in those years she seldom walkedshe ran or danced she only lived twenty years but nineteen of them were so happy ive never pitied her over much she had everything that makes life worth livinglaughter and love and at the last sorrow james milburn was her lover its thirtyone years since his ship sailed out of that harbour and alice waved him goodbye from this garden he never came back his ship was never heard of again  when alice gave up hope that it would be she died of a broken heart they say theres no such thing but nothing else ailed alice she stood at yonder gate day after day and watched the harbour and when at last she gave up hope life went with it i remember the day she had watched until sunset then she turned away from the gate all the unrest and despair had gone out of her eyes there was a terrible peace in themthe peace of the dead he will never come back now abel she said to me  in less than a week she was dead the others mourned her but i didnt master she had sounded the deeps of living and there was nothing else to linger through the years for my grief had spent itself earlier when i walked this garden in agony because i could not help her but often on these long warm summer afternoons i seem to hear alices laughter all over this garden though shes been dead so long  he lapsed into a reverie which i did not disturb and it was not until another day that i learned of the other memory that he cherished he reverted to it suddenly as we sat again in the hopvine arbour looking at the glimmering radiance of the september sea  master how many of us are sitting here  two in the flesh how many in the spirit i know not i answered humouring his mood  there is onethe other of the two i spoke of the day i told you about alice its harder for me to speak of this one  dont speak of it if it hurts you i said  but i want to its a whim of mine do you know why i told you of alice and why im going to tell you of mercedes its because i want someone to remember them and think of them sometimes after im gone i cant bear that their names should be utterly forgotten by all living souls  my older brother alec was a sailor and on his last voyage to the west indies he married and brought home a spanish girl my father and mother didnt like the match mercedes was a foreigner and a catholic and differed from us in every way but i never blamed alec after i saw her it wasnt that she was so very pretty she was slight and dark and ivorycoloured but she was very graceful and there was a charm about her mastera mighty and potent charm the women couldnt understand it they wondered at alecs infatuation for her i never did ii loved her too master before i had known her a day nobody ever knew it mercedes never dreamed of it but its lasted me all my life i never wanted to think of any other woman she spoiled a man for any other kind of womanthat little pale darkeyed spanish girl to love her was like drinking some rare sparkling wine youd never again have any taste for a commoner draught  i think she was very happy the year she spent here our thrifty womenfolk in stillwater jeered at her because she wasnt what they called capable they said she couldnt do anything but she could do one thing wellshe could love she worshipped alec i used to hate him for it oh my heart has been very full of black thoughts in its time master but neither alec nor mercedes ever knew and im thankful now that they were so happy alec made this arbour for mercedesat least he made the trellis and she planted the vines  she used to sit here most of the time in summer i suppose thats why i like to sit here her eyes would be dreamy and faraway until alec would flash his welcome how that used to torture me but now i like to remember it and her pretty soft foreign voice and little white hands she died after she had lived here a year they buried her and her baby in the graveyard of that little chapel over the harbour where the bell rings every evening she used to like sitting here and listening to it alec lived a long while after but he never married again hes gone now and nobody remembers mercedes but me  abel lapsed into a reveriea tryst with the past which i would not disturb i thought he did not notice my departure but as i opened the gate he stood up and waved his hand  three days later i went again to the old garden by the harbour shore there was a red light on a distant sail in the far west a sunset city was built around a great deep harbour of twilight palaces were there and bannered towers of crimson and gold the air was full of music there was one music of the wind and another of the waves and still another of the distant bell from the chapel near which mercedes slept the garden was full of ripe odours and warm colours the lombardies around it were tall and sombre like the priestly forms of some mystic band abel was sitting in the hopvine arbour beside him captain kidd slept i thought abel was asleep too his head leaned against the trellis and his eyes were shut  but when i reached the arbour i saw that he was not asleep there was a strange wise little smile on his lips as if he had attained to the ultimate wisdom and were laughing in no unkindly fashion at our old blind suppositions and perplexities  abel had gone on his great adventure      akin to love   david hartley had dropped in to pay a neighbourly call on josephine elliott it was well along in the afternoon and outside in the clear crispness of a canadian winter the long blue shadows from the tall firs behind the house were falling over the snow  it was a frosty day and all the windows of every room where there was no fire were covered with silver palms but the big bright kitchen was warm and cosy and somehow seemed to david more tempting than ever before and that is saying a good deal he had an uneasy feeling that he had stayed long enough and ought to go josephine was knitting at a long gray sock with doubly aggressive energy and that was a sign that she was talked out as long as josephine had plenty to say her plump white fingers where her mothers wedding ring was lost in dimples moved slowly among her needles when conversation flagged she fell to her work as furiously as if a husband and half a dozen sons were waiting for its completion david often wondered in his secret soul what josephine did with all the interminable gray socks she knitted sometimes he concluded that she put them in the home missionary barrels again that she sold them to her hired man at any rate they were very warm and comfortable looking and david sighed as he thought of the deplorable state his own socks were generally in  when david sighed josephine took alarm she was afraid david was going to have one of his attacks of foolishness she must head him off someway so she rolled up the gray sock stabbed the big pudgy ball with her needles and said she guessed shed get the tea  david got up  now youre not going before tea said josephine hospitably ill have it all ready in no time  i ought to go home i spose said david with the air and tone of a man dallying with a great temptation zillahll be waiting tea for me and theres the stock to tend to  i guess zillah wont wait long said josephine she did not intend it at all but there was a certain scornful ring in her voice you must stay ive a fancy for company to tea  david sat down again he looked so pleased that josephine went down on her knees behind the stove ostensibly to get a stick of firewood but really to hide her smile  i suppose hes tickled to death to think of getting a good square meal after the starvation rations zillah puts him on she thought  but josephine misjudged david just as much as he misjudged her she had really asked him to stay to tea out of pity but david thought it was because she was lonesome and he hailed that as an encouraging sign and he was not thinking about getting a good meal either although his dinner had been such a one as only zillah hartley could get up as he leaned back in his cushioned chair and watched josephine bustling about the kitchen he was glorying in the fact that he could spend another hour with her and sit opposite to her at the table while she poured his tea for him and passed him the biscuits just as ifjust as if  here josephine looked straight at him with such intent and stern brown eyes that david felt she must have read his thoughts and he colored guiltily but josephine did not even notice that he was blushing she had only paused to wonder whether she would bring out cherry or strawberry preserve and having decided on the cherry took her piercing gaze from david without having seen him at all but he allowed his thoughts no more vagaries  josephine set the table with her mothers wedding china she used it because it was the anniversary of her mothers wedding day but david thought it was out of compliment to him and as he knew quite well that josephine prized that china beyond all her other earthly possessions he stroked his smoothshaven dimpled chin with the air of a man to whom is offered a very subtly sweet homage  josephine whisked in and out of the pantry and up and down cellar and with every whisk a new dainty was added to the table josephine as everybody in meadowby admitted was past mistress in the noble art of cookery once upon a time rash matrons and ambitious young wives had aspired to rival her but they had long ago realised the vanity of such efforts and dropped comfortably back to second place  josephine felt an artists pride in her table when she set the teapot on its stand and invited david to sit in there were pink slices of cold tongue and crisp green pickles and spiced gooseberry the recipe for which josephine had invented herself and which had taken first prize at the provincial exhibition for six successive years there was a lemon pie which was a symphony in gold and silver biscuits as light and white as snow and moist plummy cubes of fruit cake there was the rubytinted cherry preserve a mound of amber jelly and to crown all steaming cups of tea in flavour and fragrance unequalled  and josephine too sitting at the head of the table with her smooth glossy crimps of black hair and cheeks as rosy clear as they had been twenty years ago when she had been a slender slip of girlhood and bashful young david hartley had looked at her over his hymnbook in prayermeeting and tramped all the way home a few feet behind her because he was too shy to go boldly up and ask if he might see her home  all taken together what wonder if david lost his head over that teatable and determined to ask josephine the same old question once more it was eighteen years since he had asked it for the first time and two years since the last he would try his luck again josephine was certainly more gracious than he remembered her to ever have been before  when the meal was over josephine cleared the table and washed the dishes when she had taken a dry towel and sat down by the window to polish her china david understood that his opportunity had come he moved over and sat down beside her on the sofa by the window  outside the sun was setting in a magnificent arch of light and colour over the snowclad hills and deep blue st lawrence gulf david grasped at the sunset as an introductory factor  isnt that fine josephine he said admiringly it makes me think of that piece of poetry that used to be in the old fifth reader when we went to school dye mind how the teacher used to drill us up in it on friday afternoons it begun      slow sinks more lovely ere his race is run     along moreas hills the setting sun  then david declaimed the whole passage in a singsong tone accompanied by a few crude gestures recalled from longago schoolboy elocution josephine knew what was coming every time david proposed to her he had begun by reciting poetry she twirled her towel around the last plate resignedly if it had to come the sooner it was over the better josephine knew by experience that there was no heading david off despite his shyness when he had once got along as far as the poetry  but its going to be for the last time she said determinedly im going to settle this question so decidedly tonight that therell never be a repetition  when david had finished his quotation he laid his hand on josephines plump arm  josephine he said huskily i spose you couldntcould you nowmake up your mind to have me i wish you would josephinei wish you would dont you think you could josephine  josephine folded up her towel crossed her hands on it and looked her wooer squarely in the eyes  david hartley she said deliberately what makes you go on asking me to marry you every once in a while when ive told you times out of mind that i cant and wont  because i cant help hoping that youll change your mind through time david replied meekly  well you just listen to me i will not marry you that is in the first place and in the second this is to be final it has to be you are never to ask me this again under any circumstances if you do i will not answer youi will not let on i hear you at all but and josephine spoke very slowly and impressively i will never speak to you againnever we are good friends now and i like you real well and like to have you drop in for a neighbourly chat as often as you wish to but therell be an end short and sudden to that if you dont mind what i say  oh josephine aint that rather hard protested david feebly it seemed terrible to be cut off from all hope with such finality as this  i mean every word of it returned josephine calmly youd better go home now david i always feel as if id like to be alone for a spell after a disagreeable experience  david obeyed sadly and put on his cap and overcoat josephine kindly warned him not to slip and break his legs on the porch because the floor was as icy as anything and she even lighted a candle and held it up at the kitchen door to guide him safely out david as he trudged sorrowfully homeward across the fields carried with him the mental picture of a plump sonsy woman in a trim dress of plumcoloured homespun and ruffled bluecheck apron haloed by candlelight it was not a very romantic vision perhaps but to david it was more beautiful than anything else in the world  when david was gone josephine shut the door with a little shiver she blew out the candle for it was not yet dark enough to justify artificial light to her thrifty mind she thought the big empty house in which she was the only living thing was very lonely it was so still except for the slow tick of the grandfathers clock and the soft purr and crackle of the wood in the stove josephine sat down by the window  i wish some of the sentners would run down she said aloud if david hadnt been so ridiculous id have got him to stay the evening he can be good company when he likeshes real wellread and intelligent and he must have dismal times at home there with nobody but zillah  she looked across the yard to the little house at the other side of it where her frenchcanadian hired man lived and watched the purple spiral of smoke from its chimney curling up against the crocus sky would she run over and see mrs leon poirier and her little blackeyed brownskinned baby no they never knew what to say to each other  if twasnt so cold id go up and see ida she said as it is i guess id better fall back on my knitting for i saw jimmy sentners toes sticking through his socks the other day how setback poor david did look to be sure but i think ive settled that marrying notion of his once for all and im glad of it  she said the same thing next day to mrs tom sentner who had come down to help her pick her geese they were at work in the kitchen with a big tubful of feathers between them and on the table a row of dead birds which leon had killed and brought in josephine was enveloped in a shapeless print wrapper and had an apron tied tightly around her head to keep the down out of her beautiful hair of which she was rather proud  what do you think ida she said with a hearty laugh at the recollection david hartley was here to tea last night and asked me to marry him again theres a persistent man for you i cant brag of ever having had many beaux but ive certainly had my fair share of proposals  mrs tom did not laugh her thin little face with its faded prettiness looked as if she never laughed  why wont you marry him she said fretfully  why should i retorted josephine tell me that ida sentner  because it is high time you were married said mrs tom decisively i dont believe in women living single and i dont see what better you can do than take david hartley  josephine looked at her sister with the interested expression of a person who is trying to understand some mental attitude in another which is a standing puzzle to her idas evident wish to see her married always amused josephine ida had married very young and for fifteen years her life had been one of drudgery and illhealth tom sentner was a lazy shiftless fellow he neglected his family and was drunk half his time meadowby people said that he beat his wife when on the spree but josephine did not believe that because she did not think that ida could keep from telling her if it were so ida sentner was not given to bearing her trials in silence  had it not been for josephines assistance tom sentners family would have stood an excellent chance of starvation josephine practically kept them and her generosity never failed or stinted she fed and clothed her nephews and nieces and all the gray socks whose destination puzzled david so much went to the sentners  as for josephine herself she had a good farm a comfortable house a plump bank account and was an independent unworried woman and yet in the face of all this mrs tom sentner could bewail the fact that josephine had no husband to look out for her josephine shrugged her shoulders and gave up the conundrum merely saying ironically in reply to her sisters remark  and go to live with zillah hartley  you know very well you wouldnt have to do that ever since john hartleys wife at the creek died hes been wanting zillah to go and keep house for him and if david got married zillahd go quick catch her staying there if you were mistress and david has such a beautiful house its ten times finer than yours though i dont deny yours is comfortable and his farm is the best in meadowby and joins yours think what a beautiful property theyd make together youre all right now josephine but what will you do when you get old and have nobody to take care of you i declare the thought worries me at night till i cant sleep  i should have thought you had enough worries of your own to keep you awake at nights without taking over any of mine said josephine drily as for old age its a good ways off for me yet when your jack gets old enough to have some sense he can come here and live with me but im not going to marry david hartley you can depend on that ida my dear i wish you could have heard him rhyming off that poetry last night it doesnt seem to matter much what piece he recitesfirst thing that comes into his head i reckon i remember one time he went clean through that hymn beginning hark from the tombs a doleful sound and two years ago it was to mary in heaven as lackadaisical as you please i never had such a time to keep from laughing but i managed it for i wouldnt hurt his feelings for the world no i havent any intention of marrying anybody but if i had it wouldnt be dear old sentimental easygoing david  mrs tom thumped a plucked goose down on the bench with an expression which said that she for one wasnt going to waste any more words on an idiot easygoing indeed did josephine consider that a drawback mrs tom sighed if josephine she thought had put up with tom sentners tempers for fifteen years she would know how to appreciate a goodnatured man at his real value  the cold snap which had set in on the day of davids call lasted and deepened for a week on saturday evening when mrs tom came down for a jug of cream the mercury of the little thermometer thumping against josephines porch was below zero the gulf was no longer blue but white with ice everything outdoors was crackling and snapping inside josephine had kept roaring fires all through the house but the only place really warm was the kitchen  wrap your head up well ida she said anxiously when mrs tom rose to go youve got a bad cold  theres a cold going said mrs tom everyone has it david hartley was up at our place today barking terriblea real churchyard cough as i told him he never takes any care of himself he said zillah had a bad cold too wont she be cranky while it lasts  josephine sat up late that night to keep fires on she finally went to bed in the little room opposite the big hall stove and she slept at once and dreamed that the thumps of the thermometer flapping in the wind against the wall outside grew louder and more insistent until they woke her up some one was pounding on the porch door  josephine sprang out of bed and hurried on her wrapper and felt shoes she had no doubt that some of the sentners were sick they had a habit of getting sick about that time of night she hurried out and opened the door expecting to see hulking tom sentner or perhaps ida herself bigeyed and hysterical  but david hartley stood there panting for breath the clear moonlight showed that he had no overcoat on and he was coughing hard josephine before she spoke a word clutched him by the arm and pulled him in out of the wind  for pitys sake david hartley what is the matter  zillahs awful sick he gasped i came here because twas nearest oh wont you come over josephine ive got to go for the doctor and i cant leave her alone shes suffering dreadful i know you and her aint on good terms but youll come wont you  of course i will said josephine sharply im not a barbarian i hope to refuse to go to the help of a sick person if twas my worst enemy ill go in and get ready and you go straight to the hall stove and warm yourself theres a good fire in it yet what on earth do you mean starting out on a bitter night like this without an overcoat or even mittens and you with a cold like that  i never thought of them i was so frightened said david apologetically i just lit up a fire in the kitchen stove as quicks i could and run it rattled me to hear zillah moaning sos you could hear her all over the house  you need someone to look after you as bad as zillah does said josephine severely  in a very few minutes she was ready with a basket packed full of homely remedies for like as not therell be no putting ones hand on anything there she muttered she insisted on wrapping her big plaid shawl around davids head and neck and made him put on a pair of mittens she had knitted for jack sentner then she locked the door and they started across the gleaming crusted field it was so slippery that josephine had to cling to davids arm to keep her feet in the rapture of supporting her david almost forgot everything else  in a few minutes they had passed under the bare glistening boughs of the poplars on davids lawn and for the first time josephine crossed the threshold of david hartleys house  years ago in her girlhood when the hartleys lived in the old house and there were half a dozen girls at home josephine had frequently visited there all the hartley girls liked her except zillah she and zillah never got on together when the other girls had married and gone josephine gave up visiting there she had never been inside the new house and she and zillah had not spoken to each other for years  zillah was a sick womantoo sick to be anything but civil to josephine david started at once for the doctor at the creek and josephine saw that he was well wrapped up before she let him go then she mixed up a mustard plaster for zillah and sat down by the bedside to wait  when mrs tom sentner came down the next day she found josephine busy making flaxseed poultices with her lips set in a line that betokened she had made up her mind to some disagreeable course of duty  zillah has got pneumonia bad she said in reply to mrs toms inquiries the doctor is here and mary bell from the creek shell wait on zillah but therell have to be another woman here to see to the work i reckon ill stay i suppose its my duty and i dont see who else could be got you can send mamie and jack down to stay at my house until i can go back ill run over every day and keep an eye on things  at the end of a week zillah was out of danger saturday afternoon josephine went over home to see how mamie and jack were getting on she found mrs tom there and the latter promptly despatched jack and mamie to the postoffice that she might have an opportunity to hear josephines news  ive had an awful week of it ida said josephine solemnly as she sat down by the stove and put her feet up on the glowing hearth  i suppose zillah is pretty cranky to wait on said mrs tom sympathetically  oh it isnt zillah mary bell looks after her no its the house i never lived in such a place of dust and disorder in my born days im sorrier for david hartley than i ever was for anyone before  i suppose hes used to it said mrs tom with a shrug  i dont see how anyone could ever get used to it groaned josephine and david used to be so particular when he was a boy the minute i went there the other night i took in that kitchen with a look i dont believe the paint has even been washed since the house was built i honestly dont and i wouldnt like to be called upon to swear when the floor was scrubbed either the corners were just full of rolls of dustyou could have shovelled it out i swept it out next day and i thought id be choked as for the pantrywell the less said about that the better and its the same all through the house you could write your name on everything i couldnt so much as clean up zillah was so sick there couldnt be a bit of noise made i did manage to sweep and dust and i cleaned out the pantry and of course i saw that the meals were nice and well cooked you should have seen davids face he looked as if he couldnt get used to having things clean and tasty i darned his sockshe hadnt a whole pair to his nameand ive done everything i could to give him a little comfort not that i could do much if zillah heard me moving round shed send mary bell out to ask what the matter was when i wanted to go upstairs id have to take off my shoes and tiptoe up on my stocking feet sos she wouldnt know it and ill have to stay there another fortnight yet zillah wont be able to sit up till then i dont really know if i can stand it without falling to and scrubbing the house from garret to cellar in spite of her  mrs tom sentner did not say much to josephine to herself she said complacently  shes sorry for david well ive always heard that pity was akin to love well see what comes of this  josephine did manage to live through that fortnight one morning she remarked to david at the breakfast table  well i think that mary bell will be able to attend to the work after today david i guess ill go home tonight  davids face clouded over  well i spose we oughtnt to keep you any longer josephine im sure its been awful good of you to stay this long i dont know what wed have done without you  youre welcome said josephine shortly  dont go for to walk home said david the snow is too deep ill drive you over when you want to go  ill not go before the evening said josephine slowly  david went out to his work gloomily for three weeks he had been living in comfort his wants were carefully attended to his meals were well cooked and served and everything was bright and clean and more than all josephine had been there with her cheerful smile and companionable ways well it was all ended now  josephine sat at the breakfast table long after david had gone out she scowled at the sugarbowl and shook her head savagely at the teapot  ill have to do it she said at last  im so sorry for him that i cant do anything else  she got up and went to the window looking across the snowy field to her own home nestled between the grove of firs and the orchard  its awful snug and comfortable she said regretfully and ive always felt set on being free and independent but its no use id never have a minutes peace of mind again thinking of david living here in dirt and disorder and him so particular and tidy by nature no its my duty plain and clear to come here and make things pleasant for himthe pointing of providence as you might say the worst of it is ill have to tell him so myself hell never dare to mention the subject again after what i said to him that night he proposed last i wish i hadnt been so dreadful emphatic now ive got to say it myself if it is ever said but ill not begin by quoting poetry thats one thing sure  josephine threw back her head crowned with its shining braids of jetblack hair and laughed heartily she bustled back to the stove and poked up the fire  ill have a bit of corned beef and cabbage for dinner she said and ill make david that pudding hes so fond of after all its kind of nice to have someone to plan and think for it always did seem like a waste of energy to fuss over cooking things when there was nobody but myself to eat them  josephine sang over her work all day and david went about his with the face of a man who is going to the gallows without benefit of clergy when he came in to supper at sunset his expression was so woebegone that josephine had to dodge into the pantry to keep from laughing outright she relieved her feelings by pounding the dresser with the potato masher and then went primly out and took her place at the table  the meal was not a success from a social point of view josephine was nervous and david glum mary bell gobbled down her food with her usual haste and then went away to carry zillah hers then david said reluctantly  if you want to go home now josephine ill hitch up red rob and drive you over  josephine began to plait the tablecloth she wished again that she had not been so emphatic on the occasion of his last proposal without replying to davids suggestion she said crossly josephine always spoke crossly when she was especially in earnest  i want to tell you what i think about zillah shes getting better but shes had a terrible shaking up and its my opinion that she wont be good for much all winter she wont be able to do any hard work thats certain if you want my advice i tell you fair and square that i think shed better go off for a visit as soon as shes fit she thinks so herself clementine wants her to go and stay a spell with her in town twould be just the thing for her  she can go if she wants to of course said david dully i can get along by myself for a spell  theres no need of your getting along by yourself said josephine more crossly than ever illill come here and keep house for you if you like  david looked at her uncomprehendingly  wouldnt people kind of gossip he asked hesitatingly not but what  i dont see what theyd have to gossip about broke in josephine if we weremarried  david sprang to his feet with such haste that he almost upset the table  josephine do you mean that he exclaimed  of course i mean it she said in a perfectly savage tone now for pitys sake dont say another word about it just now i cant discuss it for a spell go out to your work i want to be alone for awhile  for the first and last time david disobeyed her instead of going out he strode around the table caught josephine masterfully in his arms and kissed her and josephine after a seconds hesitation kissed him in return     aunt philippa and the men   i knew quite well why father sent me to prince edward island to visit aunt philippa that summer he told me he was sending me there to learn some sense and my stepmother of whom i was very fond told me she was sure the sea air would do me a world of good i did not want to learn sense or be done a world of good i wanted to stay in montreal and go on being foolishand make up my quarrel with mark fenwick father and mother did not know anything about this quarrel they thought i was still on good terms with himand that is why they sent me to prince edward island  i was very miserable i did not want to go to aunt philippas it was not because i feared it would be dullfor without mark montreal was just as much of a howling wilderness as any other place but it was so horribly far away when the time came for mark to want to make upas come i knew it wouldhow could he do it if i were seven hundred miles away  nevertheless i went to prince edward island in all my eighteen years i had never once disobeyed father he is a very hard man to disobey i knew i should have to make a beginning some time if i wanted to marry mark so i saved all my little courage up for that and didnt waste any of it opposing the visit to aunt philippa  i couldnt understand fathers point of view of course he hated old john fenwick who had once sued him for libel and won the case father had written an indiscreet editorial in the excitement of a redhot political contestand was made to understand that there are some things you cant say of another man even at election time but then he need not have hated mark because of that mark was not even born when it happened  old john fenwick was not much better pleased about mark and me than father was though he didnt go to the length of forbidding it he just acted grumpily and disagreeably things were unpleasant enough all round without a quarrel between mark and me yet quarrel we didand over next to nothing too you understand and now i had to set out for prince edward island without even seeing him for he was away in toronto on business                                       when my train reached copely the next afternoon aunt philippa was waiting for me there was nobody else in sight but i would have known her had there been a thousand nobody but aunt philippa could have that determined mouth those piercing grey eyes and that pronounced unmistakable goodwin nose and certainly nobody but aunt philippa would have come to meet me arrayed in a wrapper of chocolate print with huge yellow roses scattered over it and a striped blueandwhite apron  she welcomed me kindly but absentmindedly her thoughts evidently being concentrated on the problem of getting my trunk home i had only the one and in montreal it had seemed to be of moderate size but on the platform of copely station sized up by aunt philippas merciless eye it certainly looked huge  i thought we could atook it along tied on the back of the buggy she said disapprovingly but i guess well have to leave it and ill send the hired boy over for it tonight you can get along without it till then i spose  there was a fine irony in her tone i hastened to assure her meekly that i could and that it did not matter if my trunk could not be taken up till next day  oh jerry can come for it tonight as well as not said aunt philippa as we climbed into her buggy id a good notion to send him to meet you for he isnt doing much today and i wanted to go to mrs roderick macallisters funeral but my head was aching me so bad i thought i wouldnt enjoy the funeral if i did go my head is better now so i kind of wish i had gone she was a hundred and four years old and id always promised myself that id go to her funeral  aunt philippas tone was melancholy she did not recover her good spirits until we were out on the pretty grassy elmshaded country road garlanded with its ribbon of buttercups then she suddenly turned around and looked me over scrutinizingly  youre not as goodlooking as i expected from your picture but them photographs always flatter thats the reason i never had any took youre rather thin and brown but youve good eyes and you look clever your father writ me you hadnt much sense though he wants me to teach you some but its a thankless business people would rather be fools  aunt philippa struck her steed smartly with the whip and controlled his resultant friskiness with admirable skill  well you know its pleasanter i said wickedly just think what a doleful world it would be if everybody were sensible  aunt philippa looked at me out of the corner of her eye and disdained any skirmish of flippant epigram  so you want to get married she said youd better wait till youre grown up  how old must a person be before she is grown up i asked gravely  humph that depends some are grown up when theyre born and others aint grown up when theyre eighty that same mrs roderick i was speaking of never grew up she was as foolish when she was a hundred as when she was ten  perhaps thats why she lived so long i suggested all thought of seeking sympathy in aunt philippa had vanished i resolved i would not even mention marks name  mebbe twas admitted aunt philippa with a grim smile id rather live fifty sensible years than a hundred foolish ones  much to my relief she made no further reference to my affairs as we rounded a curve in the road where two great overarching elms met a buggy wheeled by us occupied by a young man in clerical costume he had a pleasant boyish face and he touched his hat courteously aunt philippa nodded very frostily and gave her horse a quite undeserved cut  theres a man you dont want to have much to do with she said portentously hes a methodist minister  why auntie the methodists are a very nice denomination i protested my stepmother is a methodist you know  no i didnt know but id believe anything of a stepmother ive no use for methodists or their ministers this fellow just came last spring and its my opinion he smokes and he thinks every girl who looks at him falls in love with himas if a methodist minister was any prize dont you take much notice of him ursula  ill not be likely to have the chance i said with an amused smile  oh youll see enough of him he boards at mrs john callmans just across the road from us and hes always out sunning himself on her verandah never studies of course last sunday they say he preached on the iron that floated if hed confine himself to the bible and leave sensational subjects alone it would be better for him and his poor congregation and so i told mrs john callman to her face i should think she would have had enough of his sex by this time she married john callman against her fathers will and he had delirious trembles for years thats the men for you  theyre not all like that aunt philippa i protested  most of em are see that house over there mrs jane harrison lives there her husband took tantrums every few days or so and wouldnt get out of bed she had to do all the barn work till hed got over his spell thats men for you when he died people writ her letters of condolence but i just sot down and writ her one of congratulation theres the presbyterian manse in the hollow mr bentwells our minister hes a good man and hed be a rather nice one if he didnt think it was his duty to be a little miserable all the time he wont let his wife wear a fashionable hat and his daughter cant fix her hair the way she wants to even being a minister cant prevent a man from being a crank heres ebenezer milgrave coming you take a good look at him he used to be insane for years he believed he was dead and used to rage at his wife because she wouldnt bury him id adone it  aunt philippa looked so determinedly grim that i could almost see her with a spade in her hand i laughed aloud at the picture summoned up  yes its funny but i guess his poor wife didnt find it very humorsome hes been pretty sane for some years now but you never can tell when hell break out again hes got a brother albert milgrave whos been married twice they say he was courting his second wife while his first was dying let that be as it may he used his first wifes wedding ring to marry the second thats the men for you  dont you know any good husbands aunt philippa i asked desperately  oh yes lots of emover there said aunt philippa sardonically waving her whip in the direction of a little country graveyard on a distant hill  yes but livingwalking about in the flesh  precious few now and again youll come across a man whose wife wont put up with any nonsense and he has to be respectable but the most of em are poor bargainspoor bargains  and are all the wives saints i persisted  laws no but theyre too good for the men retorted aunt philippa as she turned in at her own gate her house was close to the road and was painted such a vivid green that the landscape looked faded by contrast across the gable end of it was the legend philippas farm emblazoned in huge black letters two feet long all its surroundings were very neat on the kitchen doorstep a patchwork cat was making a grave toilet the groundwork of the cat was white and its spots were black yellow grey and brown  theres joseph said aunt philippa i call him that because his coat is of many colours but i aint no lover of cats theyre too much like the men to suit me  cats have always been supposed to be peculiarly feminine i said descending  twas a man that supposed it then retorted aunt philippa beckoning to her hired boy here jerry put prince away jerrys a good sort of boy she confided to me as we went into the house i had jim spencer last summer and the only good thing about him was his appetite i put up with him till harvest was in and then one day my patience give out he upsot a churnful of cream in the back yardand was just as cool as a cowcumber over itlaughed and said it was good for the land i told him i wasnt in the habit of fertilizing my back yard with cream but thats the men for you come in ill have tea ready in no time i sot the table before i left theres lemon pie mrs john cantwell sent it over i never make lemon pie myself ten years ago i took the prize for lemon pies at the county fair and ive never made any since for fear id lose my reputation for them                                       the first month of my stay passed not unpleasantly the summer weather was delightful and the sea air was certainly splendid aunt philippas little farm ran right down to the shore and i spent much of my time there there were also several families of cousins to be visited in the farmhouses that dotted the pretty seawardsloping valley and they came back to see me at philippas farm i picked spruce gum and berries and ferns and aunt philippa taught me to make butter it was all very idyllicor would have been if mark had written but mark did not write i supposed he must be very angry because i had run off to prince edward island without so much as a note of goodbye but i had been so sure he would understand  aunt philippa never made any further reference to the reason father had sent me to her but she allowed no day to pass without holding up to me some horrible example of matrimonial infelicity the number of unhappy wives who walked or drove past philippas farm every afternoon as we sat on the verandah was truly pitiable  we always sat on the verandah in the afternoon when we were not visiting or being visited i made a pretence of fancy work and aunt philippa spun diligently on a little oldfashioned spinningwheel that had been her grandmothers she always sat before the wood stand which held her flowers and the gorgeous blots of geranium blossom and big green leaves furnished a pretty background she always wore her shapeless but clean print wrappers and her irongrey hair was always combed neatly down over her ears joseph sat between us sleeping or purring she spun so expertly that she could keep a close watch on the road as well and i got the biography of every individual who went by as for the poor young methodist minister who liked to read or walk on the verandah of our neighbours house aunt philippa never had a good word for him i had met him once or twice socially and had liked him i wanted to ask him to call but dared notaunt philippa had vowed he should never enter her house  if i was dead and he came to my funeral id rise up and order him out she said  i thought he made a very nice prayer at mrs seamans funeral the other day i said  oh ive no doubt he can pray i never heard anyone make more beautiful prayers than old simon kennedy down at the harbour who was always drunk or hoping to beand the drunker he was the better he prayed it aint no matter how well a man prays if his preaching isnt right that methodist man preaches a lot of things that aint true and whats worse they aint sound doctrine at least thats what ive heard i never was in a methodist church thank goodness  dont you think methodists go to heaven as well as presbyterians aunt philippa i asked gravely  that aint for us to decide said aunt philippa solemnly its in higher hands than ours but i aint going to associate with them on earth whatever i may have to do in heaven the folks round here mostly dont make much difference and go to the methodist church quite often but i say if you are a presbyterian be a presbyterian of course if you aint it dont matter much what you do as for that minister man he has a granduncle who was sent to the penitentiary for embezzlement i found out that much  and evidently aunt philippa had taken an unholy joy in finding it out  i dare say some of our own ancestors deserved to go to the penitentiary even if they never did i remarked who is that woman driving past aunt philippa she must have been very pretty once  she wasand that was all the good it did her favour is deceitful and beauty is vain ursula she was sarah pyatt and she married fred proctor he was one of your wicked fascinating men after she married him he give up being fascinating but he kept on being wicked thats the men for you her sister flora werent much luckier her man was that domineering she couldnt call her soul her own finally he couldnt get his own way over something and he just suicided by jumping into the well a good riddancebut of course the well was spoiled flora could never abide the thought of using it again poor thing thats men for you  and theres that old enoch allan on his way to the station hes ninety if hes a day you cant kill some folks with a meat axe his wife died twenty years ago hed been married when he was twenty so theyd lived together for fifty years she was a faithful hardworking creature and kept him out of the poorhouse for he was a shiftless soul not lazy exactly but just too fond of sitting but he werent grateful she had a kind of bitter tongue and they did use to fight scandalous o course it was all his fault well she died and old enoch and my father drove together to the graveyard old enoch was awful quiet all the way there and back but just afore they got home he says solemnly to father you maynt believe it henry but this is the happiest day of my life thats men for you his brother scotty allan was the meanest man ever lived in these parts when his wife died she was buried with a little gold brooch in her collar unbeknownst to him when he found it out he went one night to the graveyard and opened up the grave and the casket to get that brooch  oh aunt philippa that is a horrible story i cried recoiling with a shiver over the gruesomeness of it  course it is but what would you expect of a man retorted aunt philippa  somehow her stories began to affect me in spite of myself there were times when i felt very dreary perhaps aunt philippa was right perhaps men possessed neither truth nor constancy certainly mark had forgotten me i was ashamed of myself because this hurt me so much but i could not help it i grew pale and listless aunt philippa sometimes peered at me sharply but she held her peace i was grateful for this                                       but one day a letter did come from mark i dared not read it until i was safely in my own room then i opened it with trembling fingers  the letter was a little stiff evidently mark was feeling sore enough over things he made no reference to our quarrel or to my sojourn in prince edward island he wrote that his firm was sending him to south africa to take charge of their interests there he would leave in three weeks time and could not return for five years if i still cared anything for him would i meet him in halifax marry him and go to south africa with him if i would not he would understand that i had ceased to love him and that all was over between us  that boiled down was the gist of marks letter when i had read it i cast myself on the bed and wept out all the tears i had refused to let myself shed during my weeks of exile  for i could not do what mark askedi could not i couldnt run away to be married in that desolate unbefriended fashion it would be a disgrace i would feel ashamed of it all my life and be unhappy over it i thought that mark was rather unreasonable he knew what my feelings about runaway marriages were and was it absolutely necessary for him to go to south africa of course his father was behind it somewhere but surely he could have got out of it if he had really tried  well if he went to south africa he must go alone but my heart would break  i cried the whole afternoon cowering among my pillows i never wanted to go out of that room again i never wanted to see anybody again i hated the thought of facing aunt philippa with her cold eyes and her miserable stories that seemed to strip life of all beauty and love of all reality i could hear her scornful thats the men for you if she heard what was in marks letter  what is the matter ursula  aunt philippa was standing by my bed i was too abject to resent her coming in without knocking  nothing i said spiritlessly  if youve been crying for three mortal hours over nothing you want a good spanking and youll get it observed aunt philippa placidly sitting down on my trunk get right up off that bed this minute and tell me what the trouble is im bound to know for im in your fathers place at present  there then i flung her marks letter there wasnt anything in it that it was sacrilege to let another person see that was one reason why i had been crying  aunt philippa read it over twice then she folded it up deliberately and put it back in the envelope  what are you going to do she asked in a matteroffact tone  im not going to run away to be married i answered sullenly  well no i wouldnt advise you to said aunt philippa reflectively its a kind of lowdown thing to do though theres been a terrible lot of romantic nonsense talked and writ about eloping it may be a painful necessity sometimes but it aint in this case you write to your young man and tell him to come here and be married respectable under my roof same as a goodwin ought to  i sat up and stared at aunt philippa i was so amazed that it is useless to try to express my amazement  auntphilippa i gasped i thoughti thought  you thought i was a hard old customer and so i am said aunt philippa but i dont take my opinions from your father nor anybody else it didnt prejudice me any against your young man that your father didnt like him i knew your father of old i have some other friends in montreal and i writ to them and asked them what he was like from what they said i judged he was decent enough as men go youre too young to be married but if you let him go off to south africa hell slip through your fingers for sure and i spose youre like some of the rest of usnobodyll do you but the one so tell him to come here and be married  i dont see how i can i gasped i cant get ready to be married in three weeks i cant  i should think you have enough clothes in that trunk to do you for a spell said aunt philippa sarcastically youve more than my mother ever had in all her life well get you a wedding dress of some kind you can get it made in charlottetown if country dressmakers arent good enough for you and ill bake you a wedding cake thatll taste as good as anything you could get in montreal even if it wont look so stylish  what will father say i questioned  lots o things conceded aunt philippa grimly but i dont see as it matters when neither you nor mell be there to have our feelings hurt ill write a few things to your father he hasnt got much sense he ought to be thankful to get a decent young man for his soninlaw in a world where most every man is a wolf in sheeps clothing but thats the men for you  and that was aunt philippa for you for the next three weeks she was a blissfully excited busy woman i was allowed to choose the material and fashion of my wedding suit and hat myself but almost everything else was settled by aunt philippa i didnt mind it was a relief to be rid of all responsibility i did protest when she declared her intention of having a big wedding and asking all the cousins and semicousins on the island but aunt philippa swept my objections lightly aside  im bound to have one good wedding in this house she said not likely ill ever have another chance  she found time amid all the baking and concocting to warn me frequently not to take it too much to heart if mark failed to come after all  i know a man who jilted a girl on her wedding day thats the men for you its best to be prepared  but mark did come getting there the evening before our wedding day and then a severe blow fell on aunt philippa word came from the manse that mr bentwell had been suddenly summoned to nova scotia to his mothers deathbed he had started that night  thats the men for you said aunt philippa bitterly never can depend on one of them not even on a minister whats to be done now  get another minister said mark easily  wherell you get him demanded aunt philippa the minister at cliftonville is away on his vacation and mercer is vacant and that leaves none nearer than town it wont do to depend on a town minister being able to come no theres no help for it youll have to have that methodist man  aunt philippas tone was tragic plainly she thought the ceremony would scarcely be legal if that methodist man married us but neither mark nor i cared we were too happy to be disturbed by any such trifles  the young methodist minister married us the next day in the presence of many beaming guests aunt philippa splendid in black silk and pointlace collar neither of which lost a whit of dignity or lustre by being made ten years before was composure itself while the ceremony was going on but no sooner had the minister pronounced us man and wife than she spoke up  now thats over i want someone to go right out and put out the fire on the kitchen roof its been on fire for the last ten minutes  minister and bridegroom headed the emergency brigade and aunt philippa pumped the water for them in a short time the fire was out all was safe and we were receiving our deferred congratulations  now young man said aunt philippa solemnly as she shook hands with mark dont you ever try to get out of this even if a methodist minister did marry you  she insisted on driving us to the train and said goodbye to us as we stood on the car steps she had caught more of the shower of rice than i had and as the day was hot and sunny she had tied over her head atop of that festal silk dress a huge homemade untrimmed straw hat but she did not look ridiculous there was a certain dignity about aunt philippa in any costume and under any circumstance  aunt philippa i said tell me this why have you helped me to be married  the train began to move  i refused once to run away myself and ive repented it ever since then as the train gathered speed and the distance between us widened she shouted after us but i spose if i had run away id have repented of that too     bessies doll   tommy puffer sauntering up the street stopped to look at miss octavias geraniums tommy never could help stopping to look at miss octavias flowers much as he hated miss octavia today they were certainly worth looking at miss octavia had set them all out on her verandahrows upon rows of them overflowing down the steps in waves of blossom and colour miss octavias geraniums were famous in arundel and she was very proud of them but it was her garden which was really the delight of her heart miss octavia always had the prettiest garden in arundel especially as far as annuals were concerned just now it was like faiththe substance of things hoped for the poppies and nasturtiums and balsams and morning glories and sweet peas had been sown in the brown beds on the lawn but they had not yet begun to come up  tommy was still feasting his eyes on the geraniums when miss octavia herself came around the corner of the house her face darkened the minute she saw tommy most peoples did tommy had the reputation of being a very bad mischievous boy he was certainly very poor and ragged and miss octavia disapproved of poverty and rags on principle nobody she argued not even a boy of twelve need be poor and ragged if he is willing to work  here you get away out of this she said sharply im not going to have you hanging over my palings  i aint hurting your old palings retorted tommy sullenly i was jist alooking at the flowers  yes and picking out the next one to throw a stone at said miss octavia sarcastically it was you who threw that stone and broke my big scarlet geranium clear off the other day  it wasnti never chucked a stone at your flowers said tommy  dont tell me any falsehoods tommy puffer it was you didnt i catch you firing stones at my cat a dozen times  i might have fired em at an old cat but i wouldnt tech a flower avowed tommy boldlybrazenly miss octavia thought  you clear out of this or ill make you she said warningly  tommy had had his ears boxed by miss octavia more than once he had no desire to have the performance repeated so he stuck his tongue out at miss octavia and then marched up the street with his hands in his pockets whistling jauntily  hes the most impudent brat i ever saw in my life muttered miss octavia wrathfully there was a standing feud between her and all the arundel small boys but tommy was her special object of dislike  tommys heart was full of wrath and bitterness as he marched away he hated miss octavia he wished something would happen to every one of her flowers he knew it was ned williams who had thrown that stone and he hoped ned would throw some more and smash all the flowers so tommy raged along the street until he came to mr blacklocks store and in the window of it he saw something that put miss octavia and her disagreeable remarks quite out of his towcoloured head  this was nothing more or less than a doll now tommy was not a judge of dolls and did not take much interest in them but he felt quite sure that this was a very fine one it was so big it was beautifully dressed in blue silk with a ruffled blue silk hat it had lovely long golden hair and big brown eyes and pink cheeks and it stood right up in the showcase and held out its hands winningly  gee aint it a beauty said tommy admiringly it looks sif it was alive and its as big as a baby i must go an bring bessie to see it  tommy at once hurried away to the shabby little street where what he called home was tommys home was a very homelesslooking sort of place it was the smallest dingiest most slatternly house on a street noted for its dingy and slatternly houses it was occupied by a slatternly mother and a drunken father as well as by tommy and neither the father nor the mother took much notice of tommy except to scold or nag him so it is hardly to be wondered at if tommy was the sort of boy who was frowned upon by respectable citizens  but one little white blossom of pure affection bloomed in the arid desert of tommys existence for all that in the preceding fall a new family had come to arundel and moved into the tiny house next to the puffers it was a small dingy house just like the others but before long a great change took place in it the new family were thrifty industrious folks although they were very poor the little house was whitewashed the paling neatly mended the bit of a yard cleaned of all its rubbish muslin curtains appeared in the windows and rows of cans with blossoming plants adorned the sills  there were just three people in the knox familya thin little mother who went out scrubbing and took in washing a boy of ten who sold newspapers and ran errandsand bessie  bessie was eight years old and walked with a crutch but she was a smart little lassie and kept the house wonderfully neat and tidy while her mother was away the very first time she had seen tommy she had smiled at him sweetly and said good morning from that moment tommy was her devoted slave nobody had ever spoken like that to him before nobody had ever smiled so at him tommy would have given his useless little life for bessie and thenceforth the time he was not devising mischief he spent in bringing little pleasures into her life it was tommys delight to bring that smile to her pale little face and a look of pleasure into her big patient blue eyes the other boys on the street tried to tease bessie at first and shouted cripple after her when she limped out but they soon stopped it tommy thrashed them all one after another for it and bessie was left in peace she would have had a very lonely life if it had not been for tommy for she could not play with the other children but tommy was as good as a dozen playmates and bessie thought him the best boy in the world tommy whatever he might be with others was very careful to be good when he was with bessie he never said a rude word in her hearing and he treated her as if she were a little princess miss octavia would have been amazed beyond measure if she had seen how tender and thoughtful and kind and chivalrous that neglected urchin of a tommy could be when he tried  tommy found bessie sitting by the kitchen window looking dreamily out of it for just a moment tommy thought uneasily that bessie was looking very pale and thin this spring  bessie come for a walk up to mr blacklocks store he said eagerly there is something there i want to show you  what is it bessie wanted to know but tommy only winked mysteriously  ah i aint going to tell you but its something awful pretty just you wait  bessie reached for her crutch and the two went up to the store tommy carefully suiting his steps to bessies slow ones just before they reached the store he made her shut her eyes and led her to the window  nowlook he commanded dramatically  bessie looked and tommy was rewarded she flushed pinkly with delight and clasped her hands in ecstasy  oh tommy isnt she perfectly beautiful she breathed oh shes the very loveliest dolly i ever saw oh tommy  i thought youd like her said tommy exultantly dont you wish you had a doll like that of your very own bessie  bessie looked almost rebuking as if tommy had asked her if she wouldnt like a golden crown or a queens palace  of course i could never have a dolly like that she said she must cost an awful lot but its enough just to look at her tommy will you bring me up here every day just to look at her  course said tommy  bessie talked about the bluesilk doll all the way home and dreamed of her every night im going to call her roselle geraldine she said after that she went up to see roselle geraldine every day gazing at her for long moments in silent rapture tommy almost grew jealous of her he thought bessie liked the doll better than she did him  but it dont matter a bit if she does he thought loyally crushing down the jealousy if she likes to like it better than me its all right  sometimes though tommy felt uneasy it was plain to be seen that bessie had set her heart on that doll and what would she do when the doll was sold as would probably happen soon tommy thought bessie would feel awful sad and he would be responsible for it  what tommy feared came to pass one afternoon when they went up to mr blacklocks store the doll was not in the window  oh cried bessie bursting into tears shes goneroselle geraldine is gone  perhaps she isnt sold said tommy comfortingly maybe they only took her out of the window cause the blue silk would fade ill go in and ask  a minute later tommy came out looking sober  yes shes sold bessie he said mr blacklock sold her to a lady yesterday dont cry bessiemaybe theyll put another in the window fore long  it wont be mine sobbed bessie it wont be roselle geraldine it wont have a blue silk hat and such cunning brown eyes  bessie cried quietly all the way home and tommy could not comfort her he wished he had never shown her the doll in the window  from that day bessie drooped and tommy watched her in agony she grew paler and thinner she was too tired to go out walking and too tired to do the little household tasks she had delighted in she never spoke about roselle geraldine but tommy knew she was fretting about her mrs knox could not think what ailed the child  she dont take a bit of interest in nothing she complained to mrs puffer she dont eat enough for a bird the doctor he says there aint nothing the matter with her as he can find out but shes just pining away  tommy heard this and a queer big lump came up in his throat he had a horrible fear that he tommy puffer was going to cry to prevent it he began to whistle loudly but the whistle was a failure very unlike the real tommywhistle bessie was sickand it was all his fault tommy believed if he had never taken her to see that hateful bluesilk doll she would never have got so fond of it as to be breaking her heart because it was sold  if i was only rich said tommy miserably id buy her a cartload of dolls all dressed in blue silk and all with brown eyes but i cant do nothing  by this time tommy had reached the paling in front of miss octavias lawn and from force of habit he stopped to look over it but there was not much to see this time only the little green rows and circles in the brown wellweeded beds and the long curves of dahlia plants which miss octavia had set out a few days before all the geraniums were carried in and the blinds were down tommy knew miss octavia was away he had seen her depart on the train that morning and heard her tell a friend that she was going down to chelton to visit her brothers folks and wouldnt be back until the next day  tommy was still leaning moodily against the paling when mrs jenkins and mrs reid came by and they too paused to look at the garden  dear me how cold it is shivered mrs reid theres going to be a hard frost tonight octavias flowers will be nipped as sure as anything its a wonder shed stay away from them overnight when her hearts so set on them  her brothers wife is sick said mrs jenkins we havent had any frost this spring and i suppose octavia never thought of such a thing shell feel awful bad if her flowers get frosted especially them dahlias octavia sets such store by her dahlias  mrs jenkins and mrs reid moved away leaving tommy by the paling it was coldthere was going to be a hard frostand miss octavias plants and flowers would certainly be spoiled tommy thought he ought to be glad but he wasnt he was sorrynot for miss octavia but for her flowers tommy had a queer passionate love for flowers in his twisted little soul it was a shame that they should be nippedthat all the glory of crimson and purple and gold hidden away in those little green rows and circles should never have a chance to blossom out royally tommy could never have put this thought into words but it was there in his heart he wished he could save the flowers and couldnt he newspapers spread over the beds and tied around the dahlias would save them tommy knew he had seen miss octavia doing it other springs and he knew there was a big box of newspapers in a little shed in her backyard ned williams had told him there was and that the shed was never locked  tommy hurried home as quickly as he could and got a ball of twine out of his few treasures then he went back to miss octavias garden  the next forenoon miss octavia got off the train at the arundel station with a very grim face there had been an unusually severe frost for the time of year all along the road miss octavia had seen gardens frosted and spoiled she knew what she should see when she got to her ownthe dahlia stalks drooping and black and limp the nasturtiums and balsams and poppies and pansies all withered and ruined  but she didnt instead she saw every dahlia carefully tied up in a newspaper and over all the beds newspapers spread out and held neatly in place with pebbles miss octavia flew into her garden with a radiant face everything was safenothing was spoiled  but who could have done it miss octavia was puzzled on one side of her lived mrs kennedy who had just moved in and being a total stranger would not be likely to think of miss octavias flowers on the other lived miss matheson who was a shutin and spent all her time on the sofa but to miss matheson miss octavia went  rachel do you know who covered my plants up last night  miss matheson nodded yes it was tommy puffer i saw him working away there with papers and twine i thought youd told him to do it  for the lands sake ejaculated miss octavia tommy puffer well wonders will never cease  miss octavia went back to her house feeling rather ashamed of herself when she remembered how she had always treated tommy puffer  but there must be some good in the child or he wouldnt have done this she said to herself ive been real mean but ill make it up to him  miss octavia did not see tommy that day but when he passed the next morning she ran to the door and called him  tommy tommy puffer come in here  tommy came reluctantly he didnt like miss octavia any better than he had and he didnt know what she wanted of him but miss octavia soon informed him without loss of words  tommy miss matheson tells me that it was you who saved my flowers from the frost the other night im very much obliged to you indeed whatever made you think of doing it  i hated to see the flowers spoiled muttered tommy who was feeling more uncomfortable than he had ever felt in his life  well it was real thoughtful of you im sorry ive been so hard on you tommy and i believe now you didnt break my scarlet geranium is there anything i can do for youanything youd like to have if its in reason ill get it for you just to pay my debt  tommy stared at miss octavia with a sudden hopeful inspiration oh miss octavia he cried eagerly will you buy a doll and give it to me  well for the lands sake ejaculated miss octavia unable to believe her ears a doll what on earth do you want of a doll  its for bessie said tommy eagerly you see its this way  then tommy told miss octavia the whole story miss octavia listened silently sometimes nodding her head when he had finished she went out of the room and soon returned bringing with her the very identical doll that had been in mr blacklocks window  i guess this is the doll she said i bought it to give to a small niece of mine but i can get another for her you may take this to bessie  it would be of no use to try to describe bessies joy when tommy rushed in and put roselle geraldine in her arms with a breathless account of the wonderful story but from that moment bessie began to pick up again and soon she was better than she had ever been and the happiest little lassie in arundel  when a week had passed miss octavia again called tommy in tommy went more willingly this time he had begun to like miss octavia  that lady looked him over sharply and somewhat dubiously he was certainly very ragged and unkempt but miss octavia saw what she had never noticed beforethat tommys eyes were bright and frank that tommys chin was a good chin and that tommys smile had something very pleasant about it  youre fond of flowers arent you tommy she asked  you bet was tommys inelegant but heartfelt answer  well said miss octavia slowly i have a brother down at chelton who is a florist he wants a boy of your age to do handy jobs and run errands about his establishment and he wants one who is fond of flowers and would like to learn the business he asked me to recommend him one and i promised to look out for a suitable boy would you like the place tommy and will you promise to be a very good boy and learn to be respectable if i ask my brother to give you a trial and a chance to make something of yourself  oh miss octavia gasped tommy he wondered if he were simply having a beautiful dream  but it was no dream and it was all arranged later on no one rejoiced more heartily in tommys success than bessie  but ill miss you dreadfully tommy she said wistfully  oh ill be home every saturday night and well have sunday together except when ive got to go to sunday school cause miss octavia says i must said tommy comfortingly and the rest of the time youll have roselle geraldine  yes i know said bessie giving the bluesilk doll a fond kiss and shes just lovely but she aint as nice as you tommy for all  then was tommys cup of happiness full     charlottes ladies   just as soon as dinner was over at the asylum charlotte sped away to the gap in the fencethe northwest corner gap there was a gap in the southeast corner toothe asylum fence was in a rather poor conditionbut the southeast gap was interesting only after tea and it was never at any time quite as interesting as the northwest gap  charlotte ran as fast as her legs could carry her for she did not want any of the other orphans to see her as a rule charlotte liked the company of the other orphans and was a favourite with them but somehow she did not want them to know about the gaps she was sure they would not understand  charlotte had discovered the gaps only a week before they had not been there in the autumn but the snowdrifts had lain heavily against the fence all winter and one spring day when charlotte was creeping through the shrubbery in the northwest corner in search of the little yellow daffodils that always grew there in spring she found a delightful space where a board had fallen off whence she could look out on a bit of woodsy road with a little footpath winding along by the fence under the widespreading boughs of the asylum trees charlotte felt a wild impulse to slip out and run fast and far down that lovely sunny tempting fenceless road but that would have been wrong for it was against the asylum rules and charlotte though she hated most of the asylum rules with all her heart never disobeyed or broke them so she subdued the vagrant longing with a sigh and sat down among the daffodils to peer wistfully out of the gap and feast her eyes on this glimpse of a world where there were no brick walls and prim walks and nevervarying rules  then as charlotte watched the pretty lady with the blue eyes came along the footpath charlotte had never seen her before and hadnt the slightest idea in the world who she was but that was what she called her as soon as she saw her the lady was so pretty with lovely blue eyes that were very sad although somehow as you looked at them you felt that they ought to be laughing merry eyes instead at least charlotte thought so and wished at once that she knew how to make them laugh besides the lady had lovely golden hair and the most beautiful pink cheeks and charlotte who had mousecoloured hair and any number of freckles had an unbounded admiration for golden locks and roseleaf complexions the lady was dressed in black which charlotte didnt like principally because the matron of the asylum wore black and charlotte didntexactlylike the matron  when the pretty lady with the blue eyes had gone by charlotte drew a long breath  if i could pick out a mother id pick out one that looked just like her she said  nice things sometimes happen close together even in an orphan asylum and that very evening charlotte discovered the southeast gap and found herself peering into the most beautiful garden you could imagine a garden where daffodils and tulips grew in great ribbonlike beds and there were hedges of white and purple lilacs and winding paths under blossoming trees it was such a garden as charlotte had pictured in happy dreams and never expected to see in real life and yet here it had been all the time divided from her only by a high board fence  i wouldnt have sposed there could be such a lovely place so near an orphan asylum mused charlotte its the very loveliest place i ever saw oh i do wish i could go and walk in it well i do declare if there isnt a lady in it too  sure enough there was a lady helping an unruly young vine to run in the way it should go over a little arbour charlotte instantly named her the tall lady with the black eyes she was not nearly so young or so pretty as the lady with the blue eyes but she looked very kind and jolly  id like her for an aunt reflected charlotte not for a motheroh no not for a mother but for an aunt i know shed make a splendid aunt and oh just look at her cat  charlotte looked at the cat with all her might and main she loved cats but cats were not allowed in an orphan asylum although charlotte sometimes wondered if there were no orphan kittens in the world which would be appropriate for such an institution  the tall ladys cat was so big and furry with a splendid tail and elegant stripes a very handsome cat charlotte called him mentally seeing the capitals as plainly as if they had been printed out charlottes fingers tingled to stroke his glossy coat but she folded them sternly together  you know you cant she said to herself reproachfully so what is the use of wanting to charlotte turner you ought to be thankful just to see the garden and the very handsome cat  charlotte watched the tall lady and the cat until they went away into a fine big house further up the garden then she sighed and went back through the cherry trees to the asylum playground where the other orphans were playing games but somehow games had lost their flavour compared with those fascinating gaps  it did not take charlotte long to discover that the pretty lady always walked past the northwest gap about one oclock every day and never at any other timeat least at no other time when charlotte was free to watch her and that the tall lady was almost always in her garden at five in the afternoon accompanied by the very handsome cat pruning and trimming some of her flowers charlotte never missed being at the gaps at the proper times if she could possibly manage it and her heart was full of dreams about her two ladies but the other orphans thought all the fun had gone out of her and the matron noticed her absentmindedness and dosed her with sulphur and molasses for it charlotte took the dose meekly as she took everything else it was all part and parcel with being an orphan in an asylum  but if the pretty lady with the blue eyes was my mother she wouldnt make me swallow such dreadful stuff sighed charlotte i dont believe even the tall lady with the black eyes wouldthough perhaps she might aunts not being quite as good as mothers  do you know said maggie brunt coming up to charlotte at this moment that lizzie parker is going to be adopted a lady is going to adopt her  oh cried charlotte breathlessly an adoption was always a wonderful event in the asylum as well as a somewhat rare one oh how splendid  yes isnt it said maggie enviously she picked out lizzie because she was pretty and had curls i dont think it is fair  charlotte sighed nobody will ever want to adopt me because ive mousy hair and freckles she said but somebody may want you some day maggie you have such lovely black hair  but it isnt curly said maggie forlornly and the matron wont let me put it up in curl papers at night i just wish i was lizzie  charlotte shook her head i dont id love to be adopted but i wouldnt really like to be anybody but myself even if i am homely its better to be yourself with mousy hair and freckles than somebody else who is ever so beautiful but i do envy lizzie though the matron says it is wicked to envy anyone  envy of the fortunate lizzie did not long possess charlottes mind however for that very day a wonderful thing happened at noon hour by the northwest gap charlotte had always been very careful not to let the pretty lady see her but today after the pretty lady had gone past charlotte leaned out of the gap to watch her as far as she could and just at that very moment the pretty lady looked back and there peering at her from the asylum fence was a little scrap of a girl with mousecoloured hair and big freckles and the sweetest brightest most winsome little face the pretty lady had ever seen the pretty lady smiled right down at charlotte and for just a moment her eyes looked as charlotte had always known they ought to look charlotte was feeling rather frightened down in her heart but she smiled bravely back  are you thinking of running away said the pretty lady and oh what a sweet voice she hadsweet and tender just like a mothers voice ought to be  no said charlotte shaking her head gravely i should like to run away but it would be of no use because there is no place to run to  why would you like to run away asked the pretty lady still smiling dont you like living here  charlotte opened her big eyes very widely why its an orphan asylum she exclaimed nobody could like living in an orphan asylum but of course orphans should be very thankful to have any place to live in and i am thankful id be thankfuller still if the matron wouldnt make me take sulphur and molasses if you had a little girl would you make her take sulphur and molasses  i didnt when i had a little girl said the pretty lady wistfully and her eyes were sad again  oh did you really have a little girl once asked charlotte softly  yes and she died said the pretty lady in a trembling voice  oh i am sorry said charlotte more softly still did shedid she have lovely golden hair and pink cheeks like yours  no the pretty lady smiled again though it was a very sad smile no she had mousecoloured hair and freckles  oh and werent you sorry  no i was glad of it because it made her look like her father ive always loved little girls with mousecoloured hair and freckles ever since well i must hurry along im late now and schools have a dreadful habit of going in sharp on time if you should happen to be here tomorrow im going to stop and ask your name  of course charlotte was at the gap the next day and they had a lovely talk in a week they were the best of friends charlotte soon found out that she could make the pretty ladys eyes look as they ought to for a little while at least and she spent all her spare time and lay awake at nights devising speeches to make the pretty lady laugh  then another wonderful thing happened one evening when charlotte went to the southeast gap the tall lady with the black eyes was not in the gardenat least charlotte thought she wasnt but the very handsome cat was sitting gravely under a syringa bush and looking quite proud of himself for being a cat  you very handsome cat said charlotte wont you come here and let me stroke you  the very handsome cat did come just as if he understood english and he purred with delight when charlotte took him in her arms and buried her face in his fur thencharlotte thought she would really sink into the ground for the tall lady herself came around a lilac bush and stood before the gap  please maam stammered charlotte in an agony of embarrassment i wasnt meaning to do any harm to your very handsome cat i just wanted to pat him ii am very fond of cats and they are not allowed in orphan asylums  ive always thought asylums werent run on proper principles said the tall lady briskly bless your heart child dont look so scared youre welcome to pat the cat all you like come in and ill give you some flowers  thank you but i am not allowed to go off the grounds said charlotte firmly and i think id rather not have any flowers because the matron might want to know where i got them and then she would have this gap closed up i live in mortal dread for fear it will be closed anyhow its very uncomfortableliving in mortal dread  the tall lady laughed a very jolly laugh yes i should think it would be she agreed i havent had that experience  then they had a jolly talk and every evening after that charlotte went to the gap and stroked the very handsome cat and chatted to the tall lady  do you live all alone in that big house she asked wonderingly one day  all alone said the tall lady  did you always live alone  no i had a sister living with me once but i dont want to talk about her youll oblige me charlotte by not talking about her  i wont then agreed charlotte i can understand why people dont like to have their sisters talked about sometimes lily mitchell has a big sister who was sent to jail for stealing of course lily doesnt like to talk about her  the tall lady laughed a little bitterly my sister didnt steal she married a man i detested thats all  did he drink asked charlotte gravely the matrons husband drank and that was why she left him and took to running an orphan asylum i think id rather put up with a drunken husband than live in an orphan asylum  my sisters husband didnt drink said the tall lady grimly he was beneath her that was all i told her id never forgive her and i never shall hes dead nowhe died a year after she married himand shes working for her living i dare say she doesnt find it very pleasant she wasnt brought up to that here charlotte is a turnover for you i made it on purpose for you eat it and tell me if you dont think im a good cook im dying for a compliment i never get any now that ive got old its a dismal thing to get old and have nobody to love you except a cat charlotte  i think it is just as bad to be young and have nobody to love you not even a cat sighed charlotte enjoying the turnover nevertheless  i dare say it is agreed the tall lady looking as if she had been struck by a new and rather startling idea                                       i like the tall lady with the black eyes ever so much thought charlotte that night as she lay in bed but i love the pretty lady i have more fun with the tall lady and the very handsome cat but i always feel nicer with the pretty lady oh im so glad her little girl had mousecoloured hair  then the most wonderful thing of all happened one day a week later the pretty lady said would you like to come and live with me charlotte  charlotte looked at her are you in earnest she asked in a whisper  indeed i am i want you for my little girl and if youd like to come you shall im poor charlotte really im dreadfully poor but i can make my salary stretch far enough for two and well love each other enough to cover the thin spots will you come  well i should just think i will said charlotte emphatically oh i wish i was sure im not dreaming i do love you so much and it will be so delightful to be your little girl  very well sweetheart ill come tomorrow afternoonit is saturday so ill have the whole blessed day offand see the matron about it oh well have lovely times together dearest i only wish id discovered you long ago  charlotte may have eaten and studied and played and kept rules the rest of that day and part of the next but if so she has no recollection of it she went about like a girl in a dream and the matron concluded that something more than sulphur and molasses was needed and decided to speak to the doctor about her but she never did because a lady came that afternoon and told her she wanted to adopt charlotte  charlotte obeyed the summons to the matrons room in a tingle of excitement but when she went in she saw only the matron and the tall lady with the black eyes before charlotte could look around for the pretty lady the matron said charlotte this lady miss herbert wishes to adopt you it is a splendid thing for you and you ought to be a very thankful little girl  charlottes head fairly whirled she clasped her hands and the tears brimmed up in her eyes  oh i like the tall lady she gasped but i love the pretty lady and i promised her id be her little girl i cant break my promise  what on earth is the child talking about said the mystified matron  and just then the maid showed in the pretty lady charlotte flew to her and flung her arms about her  oh tell them i am your little girl she begged tell them i promised you first i dont want to hurt the tall ladys feelings because i truly do like her so very much but i want to be your little girl  the pretty lady had given one glance at the tall lady and flushed red the tall lady on the contrary had grown very pale the matron felt uncomfortable everybody knew that miss herbert and mrs bond hadnt spoken to each other for years even if they were sisters and alone in the world except for each other  mrs bond turned to the matron i have come to ask permission to adopt this little girl she said  oh im very sorry stammered the matron but miss herbert has just asked for her and i have consented  charlotte gave a great gulp of disappointment but the pretty lady suddenly wheeled around to face the tall lady with quivering lips and tearful eyes  dont take her from me alma she pleaded humbly sheshe is so like my own baby and im so lonely any other child will suit you as well  not at all said the tall lady brusquely not at all anna no other child will suit me at all and may i ask what you intend to keep her on i know your salary is barely enough for yourself  that is my concern said the pretty lady a little proudly  humph the tall lady shrugged her shoulders just as independent as ever anna i see well child what do you say which of us will you come with remember i have the cat on my side and anna cant make half as good turnovers as i can remember all this charlotte  oh ii like you so much stammered charlotte and i wish i could live with you both but since i cant i must go with the pretty lady because i promised and because i loved her first  and best queried the tall lady  and best admitted charlotte bound to be truthful even at the risk of hurting the tall ladys feelings but i do like you toonext best and you really dont need me as much as she does for you have your very handsome cat and she hasnt anything  a cat no longer satisfies the aching void in my soul said the tall lady stubbornly nothing will satisfy it but a little girl with mousecoloured hair and freckles no anna ive got to have charlotte but i think that with her usual astuteness she has already solved the problem for us by saying shed like to live with us both why cant she you just come back home and well let bygones be bygones we both have something to forgive but i was an obstinate old fool and ive known it for years though i never confessed it to anybody but the cat  the pretty lady softened trembled smiled she went right up to the tall lady and put her arms about her neck  oh ive wanted so much to be friends with you again she sobbed but i thought you would never relentandandive been so lonely  there there whispered the tall lady dont cry under the matrons eye wait till we get home i may have some crying to do myself then charlotte go and get your hat and come right over with us we can sign the necessary papers later on but we must have you right off the cat is waiting for you on the back porch and there is a turnover cooling on the pantry window that is just your size  i am so happy remarked charlotte that i feel like crying myself     christmas at red butte   of course santa claus will come said jimmy martin confidently jimmy was ten and at ten it is easy to be confident why hes got to come because it is christmas eve and he always has come you know that twins  yes the twins knew it and cheered by jimmys superior wisdom their doubts passed away there had been one terrible moment when theodora had sighed and told them they mustnt be too much disappointed if santa claus did not come this year because the crops had been poor and he mightnt have had enough presents to go around  that doesnt make any difference to santa claus scoffed jimmy you know as well as i do theodora prentice that santa claus is rich whether the crops fail or not they failed three years ago before father died but santa claus came all the same probbly you dont remember it twins cause you were too little but i do of course hell come so dont you worry a mite and hell bring my skates and your dolls he knows were expecting them theodora cause we wrote him a letter last week and threw it up the chimney and therell be candy and nuts of course and mothers gone to town to buy a turkey i tell you were going to have a ripping christmas  well dont use such slangy words about it jimmyboy sighed theodora she couldnt bear to dampen their hopes any further and perhaps aunt elizabeth might manage it if the colt sold well but theodora had her painful doubts and she sighed again as she looked out of the window far down the trail that wound across the prairie redlighted by the declining sun of the short wintry afternoon  do people always sigh like that when they get to be sixteen asked jimmy curiously you didnt sigh like that when you were only fifteen theodora i wish you wouldnt it makes me feel funnyand its not a nice kind of funniness either  its a bad habit ive got into lately said theodora trying to laugh old folks are dull sometimes you know jimmyboy  sixteen is awful old isnt it said jimmy reflectively ill tell you what im going to do when im sixteen theodora im going to pay off the mortgage and buy mother a silk dress and a piano for the twins wont that be elegant ill be able to do that cause im a man of course if i was only a girl i couldnt  i hope youll be a good kind brave man and a real help to your mother said theodora softly sitting down before the cosy fire and lifting the fat little twins into her lap  oh ill be good to her never you fear assured jimmy squatting comfortably down on the little fur rug before the stovethe skin of the coyote his father had killed four years ago i believe in being good to your mother when youve only got the one now tell us a story theodoraa real jolly story you know with lots of fighting in it only please dont kill anybody i like to hear about fighting but i like to have all the people come out alive  theodora laughed and began a story about the riel rebellion of 85a story which had the double merit of being true and exciting at the same time it was quite dark when she finished and the twins were nodding but jimmys eyes were wide open and sparkling  that was great he said drawing a long breath tell us another  no its bedtime for you all said theodora firmly one story at a time is my rule you know  but i want to sit up till mother comes home objected jimmy  you cant she may be very late for she would have to wait to see mr porter besides you dont know what time santa claus might comeif he comes at all if he were to drive along and see you children up instead of being sound asleep in bed he might go right on and never call at all  this argument was too much for jimmy  all right well go but we have to hang up our stockings first twins get yours  the twins toddled off in great excitement and brought back their sunday stockings which jimmy proceeded to hang along the edge of the mantel shelf this done they all trooped obediently off to bed theodora gave another sigh and seated herself at the window where she could watch the moonlit prairie for mrs martins homecoming and knit at the same time  i am afraid that you will think from all the sighing theodora was doing that she was a very melancholy and despondent young lady you couldnt think anything more unlike the real theodora she was the jolliest bravest girl of sixteen in all saskatchewan as her shining brown eyes and rosy dimpled cheeks would have told you and her sighs were not on her own account but simply for fear the children were going to be disappointed she knew that they would be almost heartbroken if santa claus did not come and that this would hurt the patient hardworking little mother more than all else  five years before this theodora had come to live with uncle george and aunt elizabeth in the little log house at red butte her own mother had just died and theodora had only her big brother donald left and donald had klondike fever the martins were poor but they had gladly made room for their little niece and theodora had lived there ever since her aunts righthand girl and the beloved playmate of the children they had been very happy until uncle georges death two years before this christmas eve but since then there had been hard times in the little log house and though mrs martin and theodora did their best it was a woefully hard task to make both ends meet especially this year when their crops had been poor theodora and her aunt had made every sacrifice possible for the childrens sake and at least jimmy and the twins had not felt the pinch very severely yet  at seven mrs martins bells jingled at the door and theodora flew out go right in and get warm auntie she said briskly ill take ned away and unharness him  its a bitterly cold night said mrs martin wearily there was a note of discouragement in her voice that struck dismay to theodoras heart  im afraid it means no christmas for the children tomorrow she thought sadly as she led ned away to the stable when she returned to the kitchen mrs martin was sitting by the fire her face in her chilled hand sobbing convulsively  auntieoh auntie dont exclaimed theodora impulsively it was such a rare thing to see her plucky resolute little aunt in tears youre cold and tiredill have a nice cup of tea for you in a trice  no it isnt that said mrs martin brokenly it was seeing those stockings hanging there theodora i couldnt get a thing for the childrennot a single thing mr porter would only give forty dollars for the colt and when all the bills were paid there was barely enough left for such necessaries as we must have i suppose i ought to feel thankful i could get those but the thought of the childrens disappointment tomorrow is more than i can bear it would have been better to have told them long ago but i kept building on getting more for the colt well its weak and foolish to give way like this wed better both take a cup of tea and go to bed it will save fuel  when theodora went up to her little room her face was very thoughtful she took a small box from her table and carried it to the window in it was a very pretty little gold locket hung on a narrow blue ribbon theodora held it tenderly in her fingers and looked out over the moonlit prairie with a very sober face could she give up her dear locketthe locket donald had given her just before he started for the klondike she had never thought she could do such a thing it was almost the only thing she had to remind her of donaldhandsome merry impulsive warmhearted donald who had gone away four years ago with a smile on his bonny face and splendid hope in his heart  heres a locket for you gift o god he had said gailyhe had such a dear loving habit of calling her by the beautiful meaning of her name a lump came into theodoras throat as she remembered it i couldnt afford a chain too but when i come back ill bring you a rope of klondike nuggets for it  then he had gone away for two years letters had come from him regularly then he wrote that he had joined a prospecting party to a remote wilderness after that was silence deepening into anguish of suspense that finally ended in hopelessness a rumour came that donald prentice was dead none had returned from the expedition he had joined theodora had long ago given up all hope of ever seeing donald again hence her locket was doubly dear to her  but aunt elizabeth had always been so good and loving and kind to her could she not make the sacrifice for her sake yes she could and would theodora flung up her head with a gesture that meant decision she took out of the locket the bits of hairher mothers and donaldswhich it contained perhaps a tear or two fell as she did so and then hastily donned her warmest cap and wraps it was only three miles to spencer she could easily walk it in an hour and as it was christmas eve the shops would be open late she muse walk for ned could not be taken out again and the mares foot was sore besides aunt elizabeth must not know until it was done  as stealthily as if she were bound on some nefarious errand theodora slipped downstairs and out of the house the next minute she was hurrying along the trail in the moonlight the great dazzling prairie was around her the mystery and splendour of the northern night all about her it was very calm and cold but theodora walked so briskly that she kept warm the trail from red butte to spencer was a lonely one mr lurgans house halfway to town was the only dwelling on it  when theodora reached spencer she made her way at once to the only jewellery store the little town contained mr benson its owner had been a friend of her uncles and theodora felt sure that he would buy her locket nevertheless her heart beat quickly and her breath came and went uncomfortably fast as she went in suppose he wouldnt buy it then there would be no christmas for the children at red butte  good evening miss theodora said mr benson briskly what can i do for you  im afraid im not a very welcome sort of customer mr benson said theodora with an uncertain smile i want to sell not buy could youwill you buy this locket  mr benson pursed up his lips took up the locket and examined it well i dont often buy secondhand stuff he said after some reflection but i dont mind obliging you miss theodora ill give you four dollars for this trinket  theodora knew the locket had cost a great deal more than that but four dollars would get what she wanted and she dared not ask for more in a few minutes the locket was in mr bensons possession and theodora with four crisp new bills in her purse was hurrying to the toy store half an hour later she was on her way back to red butte with as many parcels as she could carryjimmys skates two lovely dolls for the twins packages of nuts and candy and a nice plump turkey theodora beguiled her lonely tramp by picturing the childrens joy in the morning  about a quarter of a mile past mr lurgans house the trail curved suddenly about a bluff of poplars as theodora rounded the turn she halted in amazement almost at her feet the body of a man was lying across the road he was clad in a big fur coat and had a fur cap pulled well down over his forehead and ears almost all of him that could be seen was a full bushy beard theodora had no idea who he was or where he had come from but she realized that he was unconscious and that he would speedily freeze to death if help were not brought the footprints of a horse galloping across the prairie suggested a fall and a runaway but theodora did not waste time in speculation she ran back at full speed to mr lurgans and roused the household in a few minutes mr lurgan and his son had hitched a horse to a woodsleigh and hurried down the trail to the unfortunate man  theodora knowing that her assistance was not needed and that she ought to get home as quickly as possible went on her way as soon as she had seen the stranger in safe keeping when she reached the little log house she crept in cautiously put the childrens gifts in their stockings placed the turkey on the table where aunt elizabeth would see it the first thing in the morning and then slipped off to bed a very weary but very happy girl  the joy that reigned in the little log house the next day more than repaid theodora for her sacrifice  whoopee didnt i tell you that santa claus would come all right shouted the delighted jimmy oh what splendid skates  the twins hugged their dolls in silent rapture but aunt elizabeths face was the best of all  then the dinner had to be prepared and everybody had a hand in that just as theodora after a grave peep into the oven had announced that the turkey was done a sleigh dashed around the house theodora flew to answer the knock at the door and there stood mr lurgan and a big bewhiskered furcoated fellow whom theodora recognized as the stranger she had found on the trail butwas he a stranger there was something oddly familiar in those merry brown eyes theodora felt herself growing dizzy  donald she gasped oh donald  and then she was in the big fellows arms laughing and crying at the same time  donald it was indeed and then followed half an hour during which everybody talked at once and the turkey would have been burned to a crisp had it not been for the presence of mind of mr lurgan who being the least excited of them all took it out of the oven and set it on the back of the stove  to think that it was you last night and that i never dreamed it exclaimed theodora oh donald if i hadnt gone to town  id have frozen to death im afraid said donald soberly i got into spencer on the last train last night i felt that i must come right outi couldnt wait till morning but there wasnt a team to be got for love or moneyit was christmas eve and all the livery rigs were out so i came on horseback just by that bluff something frightened my horse and he shied violently i was half asleep and thinking of my little sister and i went off like a shot i suppose i struck my head against a tree anyway i knew nothing more until i came to in mr lurgans kitchen i wasnt much hurtfeel none the worse of it except for a sore head and shoulder but oh gift o god how you have grown i cant realize that you are the little sister i left four years ago i suppose you have been thinking i was dead  yes and oh donald where have you been  well i went way up north with a prospecting party we had a tough time the first year i can tell you and some of us never came back we werent in a country where post offices were lying round loose either you see then at last just as we were about giving up in despair we struck it rich ive brought a snug little pile home with me and things are going to look up in this log house gift o god therell be no more worrying for you dear people over mortgages  im so gladfor aunties sake said theodora with shining eyes but oh donald its best of all just to have you back im so perfectly happy that i dont know what to do or say  well i think you might have dinner said jimmy in an injured tone the turkeys getting stone cold and im most starving i just cant stand it another minute  so with a laugh they all sat down to the table and ate the merriest christmas dinner the little log house had ever known     how we went to the wedding   if it were to clear up i wouldnt know how to behave it would seem so unnatural said kate do you by any chance remember what the sun looks like phil  does the sun ever shine in saskatchewan anyhow i asked with assumed sarcasm just to make kates big bonny black eyes flash  they did flash but kate laughed immediately after as she sat down on a chair in front of me and cradled her long thin spirited dark face in her palms  we have more sunny weather in saskatchewan than in all the rest of canada put together in an average year she said clicking her strong white teeth and snapping her eyes at me but i cant blame you for feeling sceptical about it phil if i went to a new country and it rained every dayall dayall nightafter i got there for three whole weeks id think things not lawful to be uttered about the climate too so little cousin i forgive you remember that into each life some rain must fall some days must be dark and dreary oh if youd only come to visit me last fall we had such a beeyewtiful september last year we were drowned in sunshine this fall were drowned in water old settlers tell of a similar visitation in 72 though they claim even that wasnt quite as bad as this  i was sitting rather disconsolately by an upper window of uncle kenneth morrisons log house at arrow creek below was what in dry weatherso at least i was toldwas merely a pretty grassy little valley but which was now a considerable creek of muddy yellow water rising daily beyond was a cheerless prospect of sodden prairie and dripping bluff  it would be a golden mellow land with purple hazes over the bluffs in a normal fall assured kate even now if the sun were just to shine out for a day and a good chinook blow youd see a surprising change i feel like chanting continually that old rhyme i learned in the first primer      rain rain go away     come again some other day     some other day next summer     phil and katie want to play  philippa dear girl dont look so dismal its bound to clear up sometime  i wish the sometime would come soon then i said rather grumpily  you know it hasnt really rained for three days protested kate its been damp and horrid and threatening but it hasnt rained i defy you to say that it has actually rained  when its so wet underfoot that you cant stir out without rubber boots it might as well be wet overhead too i said still grumpily  i believe youre homesick girl said kate anxiously  no im not i answered laughing and feeling ashamed of my ungraciousness nobody could be homesick with such a jolly good fellow as you around kate its only that this weather is getting on my nerves a bit im fit for treasons stratagems and spoils if your chinook doesnt come soon kitty ill do something quite desperate  i feel that way myself admitted kate real reckless phil anyhow lets put on our despised rubber boots and sally out for a wade  heres jim nash coming on horseback down the trail i said lets wait and see if hes got the mail  we hurried down kate humming somewhere the sun is shining solely i believe because she knew it aggravated me at any other time i should probably have thrown a pillow at her but just now i was too eager to see if jim nash had brought any mail  i had come from ontario the first of september to visit uncle kenneth morrisons family i had been looking forward to the trip for several years my cousin kate and i had always corresponded since they had gone west ten years before and kate who revelled in the western life had sung the praises of her adopted land rapturously and constantly it was quite a joke on her that when i did finally come to visit her i should have struck the wettest autumn ever recorded in the history of the west a wet september in saskatchewan is no joke however the country was almost flooded out the trails soon became nearly impassable all our plans for drives and picnics and interneighbour visitingat that time a neighbour meant a man who lived at least six miles awayhad to be given up yet i was not lonesome and i enjoyed my visit in spite of everything kate was a host in herself she was twentyeight years oldeight years my seniorbut the difference in our ages had never been any barrier to our friendship she was a jolly companionable philosophical soul with a jest for every situation and a merry solution for every perplexity the only fault i had to find with her was her tendency to make parodies kates parodies were perfectly awful and always got on my nerves  she was dreadfully ashamed of the way the saskatchewan weather was behaving after all her boasting she was thin at the best of times but now she grew positively scraggy with the worry of it i am afraid i took an unholy delight in teasing her and abused the western weather even more than was necessary  jim nashthe lank youth who was hired to look after the place during uncle kenneths absence on a prolonged threshing expeditionhad brought some mail kates share was a letter postmarked bothwell a rising little town about one hundred and twenty miles from arrow creek kate had several friends there and one of our plans had been to visit bothwell and spend a week with them we had meant to drive of course since there was no other way of getting there and equally of course the plan had been abandoned because of the wet weather  mother exclaimed kate mary taylor is going to be married in a fortnights time she wants phil and me to go up to bothwell for the wedding  what a pity you cant go remarked aunt jennie placidly aunt jennie was always a placid little soul with a most enviable knack of taking everything easy nothing ever worried her greatly and when she had decided that a thing was inevitable it did not worry her at all  but i am going cried kate i will goi must go i positively cannot let mary taylormy own beloved mollygo and perpetrate matrimony without my being on hand to see it yes im goingand if phil has a spark of the old blair pioneer spirit in her shell go too  of course ill go if you go i said  aunt jennie did not think we were in earnest so she merely laughed at first and said how do you propose to go flyor swim  well drive as usual said kate calmly id feel more at home in that way of locomotion well borrow jim nashs fathers democrat and take the ponies well put on old clothes raincoats rubber caps and boots and well start tomorrow in an ordinary time we could easily do it in six days or less but this fall well probably need ten or twelve  you dont really mean to go kate said aunt jennie beginning to perceive that kate did mean it  i do said kate in a convincing tone  aunt jennie felt a little worriedas much as she could feel worried over anythingand she tried her best to dissuade kate although she plainly did not have much hope of doing so having had enough experience with her determined daughter to realize that when kate said she was going to do a thing she did it it was rather funny to listen to the ensuing dialogue  kate you cant do it its a crazy idea the road is one hundred and twenty miles long  ive driven it twice mother  yes but not in such a wet year the trail is impassable in places  oh there are always plenty of dry spots to be found if you only look hard for them  but you dont know where to look for them and goodness knows what youll get into while you are looking  well call at the mp barracks and get an indian to guide us indians always know the dry spots  the stage driver has decided not to make another trip till the october frosts set in  but he always has such a heavy load it will be quite different with us you must remember well travel lightjust our provisions and a valise containing our wedding garments  what will you do if you get mired twenty miles from a human being  but we wont im a good driver and i havent nervesbut i have nerve besides you forget that well have an indian guide with us  there was a company of hudson bay freighters ambushed and killed along that very trail by blackfoot indians in 1839 said aunt jennie dolefully  fifty years ago their ghosts must have ceased to haunt it by this time said kate flippantly  well youll get wet through and catch your deaths of cold protested aunt jennie  no fear of it well be cased in rubber and well borrow a good tight tent from the mps besides im sure its not going to rain much more i know the signs  at least wait for a day or two until youre sure that it has cleared up implored aunt jennie  which being interpreted means wait for a day or two because then your father may be home and hell squelch your mad expedition said kate with a sly glance at me no no my mother your wiles are in vain well hit the trail tomorrow at sunrise so just be good darling and help us pack up some provisions ill send jim for his fathers democrat  aunt jennie resigned herself to the inevitable and betook herself to the pantry with the air of a woman who washes her hands of the consequences i flew upstairs to pack some finery i was wild with delight over the proposed outing i did not realize what it actually meant and i had perfect confidence in kate who was an expert driver an experienced camper out and an excellent manager if i could have seen what was ahead of us i would certainly not have been quite so jubilant and reckless but i would have gone all the same i would not miss the laughterprovoking memories of that trip out of my life for anything i have always been glad i went                                       we left at sunrise the next morning there was a sunrise that morning for a wonder the sun came up in a pinkysaffron sky and promised us a fine day aunt jennie bade us goodbye and estimable woman that she was did not trouble us with advice or forebodings  mr nash had sent over his democrat a light wagon with springs and kates shaganappies tom and jerrynative ponies the toughest horse flesh to be found in the worldwere hitched to it kate and i were properly accoutred for our trip and lookedbut i try to forget how we looked the memory is not flattering  we drove off in the gayest of spirits our difficulties began at the start for we had to drive a mile before we could find a place to ford the creek beyond that however we had a passable trail for three miles to the little outpost of the mounted police where five or six men were stationed on detachment duty  sergeant baker is a friend of mine said kate hell be only too glad to lend me all we require  the sergeant was a friend of kates but he looked at her as if he thought she was crazy when she told him where we were going  youd better take a canoe instead of a team he said sarcastically ive a good notion to arrest you both as horse thieves and prevent you from going on such a mad expedition  you know nothing short of arrest would stop me said kate nodding at him with laughing eyes and you really wont go to such an extreme i know so please be nice even if it comes hard and lend us some things ive come aborrying  i wont lend you a thing declared the sergeant i wont aid and abet you in any such freak as this go home now like a good girl  im not going home said kate im not a good girlim a wicked old maid and im going to bothwell if you wont lend us a tent well go withoutand sleep in the openand our deaths will lie forever at your door ill come back and haunt you if you dont lend me a tent ill camp on your very threshold and you wont be able to go out of your door without falling over my spook  ive more fear of being accountable for your death if i do let you go said sergeant baker dubiously however i see that nothing but physical force will prevent you what do you want  i want said kate a cavalry tent a sheetiron camp stove and a good indian guideold peter crow for choice hes such a respectablelooking old fellow and his wife often works for us  the sergeant gave us the tent and stove and sent a man down to the reserve for peter crow moreover he vindicated his title of friend by making us take a dozen prairie chickens and a large hambesides any quantity of advice we didnt want the advice but we hugely welcomed the ham presently our guide appearedquite a spruce old indian as indians go i had never been able to shake off my childhood conviction that an indian was a fearsome creature hopelessly addicted to scalping knives and tomahawks and i secretly felt quite horrified at the idea of two defenceless females starting out on a lonely prairie trail with an indian for guide even old peter crows meek appearance did not quite reassure me but i kept my qualms to myself for i knew kate would only laugh at me  it was ten when we finally got away from the mp outpost sergeant baker bade us goodbye in a tone which seemed to intimate that he never expected to see either of us again what with his dismal predictions and my secret horror of indians i was beginning to feel anything but jubilant over our expedition kate however was as blithe and buoyant as usual she knew no fear being one of those enviable folk who can because they think they can one hundred and twenty miles of halfflooded prairie trailcamping out at night in the solitude of the great lone landrainmuskegsindian guidesnothing had any terror for my dauntless cousin  for the next three hours however we got on beautifully the trail was fair though somewhat greasy the sun shone though with a somewhat watery gleam through the mists and peter crow coiled up on the folded tent behind the seat slept soundly and snored mellifluously that snore reassured me greatly i had never thought of indians as snoring surely one who did couldnt be dreaded greatly  we stopped at one oclock and had a cold lunch sitting in our wagon while peter crow wakened up and watered the ponies we did not get on so well in the afternoon the trail descended into lowlying ground where travelling was very difficult i had to admit old peter crow was quite invaluable he knew as kate had foretold all the dry spotsthat is to say spots less wet than others but even so we had to make so many detours that by sunset we were little more than six miles distant from our noon halting place  wed better set camp now before it gets any darker said kate theres a capital spot over there by that bluff of dead poplar the ground seems pretty dry too peter cut us a set of tent poles and kindle a fire  want my dollar first said old peter stolidly  we had agreed to pay him a dollar a day for the trip but none of the money was to be paid until we got to bothwell kate told him this but all the reply she got was a stolid want dollar no make fire without dollar  we were getting cold and it was getting dark so finally kate under the law of necessity paid him his dollar then he carried out our orders at his own sweet leisure in course of time he got a fire lighted and while we cooked supper he set up the tent and prepared our beds by cutting piles of brush and covering them with rugs  kate and i had a hilarious time cooking that supper it was my first experience of camping out and as i had become pretty well convinced that peter crow was not the typical indian of old romance i enjoyed it all hugely but we were both very tired and as soon as we had finished eating we betook ourselves to our tent and found our brush beds much more comfortable than i had expected old peter coiled up on his blanket outside by the fire and the great silence of a windless prairie enwrapped us in a few minutes we were sound asleep and never wakened until seven oclock                                       when we arose and lifted the flap of the tent we saw a peculiar sight the little elevation on which we had pitched our camp seemed to be an island in a vast sea of white mist dotted here and there with other islands on every hand to the far horizon stretched that strange phantasmal ocean and a hazy sun looked over the shifting billows i had never seen a western mist before and i thought it extremely beautiful but kate to whom it was no novelty was more cumbered with breakfast cares  im ravenous she said as she bustled about among our stores camping out always does give one such an appetite arent you hungry phil  comfortably so i admitted but where are our ponies and where is peter crow  probably the ponies have strayed away looking for pea vines they love and adore pea vines said kate stirring up the fire from under its blanket of grey ashes and peter crow has gone to look for them good old fellow when you do get a conscientious indian there is no better guide in the world but they are rare now philippagirl just pry out the sergeants ham and shave a few slices off it for our breakfast some savoury fried ham always goes well on the prairie  i went for the ham but could not find it a thorough search among our effects revealed it not  kate i cant find the ham i called out it must have fallen out somewhere on the trail  kate ceased wrestling with the fire and came to help in the search for the missing delicacy  it couldnt have fallen out she said incredulously that is impossible the tent was fastened securely over everything nothing could have jolted out  well then where is the ham i said  that question was unanswerable as kate discovered after another thorough search the ham was gonethat much was certain  i believe peter crow has levanted with the ham i said decidedly  i dont believe peter crow could be so dishonest said kate rather shortly his wife has worked for us for years and shes as honest as the sunlight  honesty isnt catching i remarked but i said nothing more just then for kates black eyes were snapping  anyway we cant have ham for breakfast she said twitching out the frying pan rather viciously well have to put up with canned chickenif the cans havent disappeared too  they hadnt and we soon produced a very tolerable breakfast but neither of us had much appetite  do you suppose peter crow has taken the horses as well as the ham i asked  no gloomily responded kate who had evidently been compelled by the logic of hard facts to believe in peters guilt he would hardly dare to do that because he couldnt dispose of them without being found out theyve probably strayed away on their own account when peter decamped as soon as this mist lifts ill have a look for them they cant have gone far  we were spared this trouble however for when we were washing up the dishes the ponies returned of their own accord kate caught them and harnessed them  are we going on i asked mildly  of course were going on said kate her good humour entirely restored do you suppose im going to be turned from my purpose by the defection of a miserable old indian oh wait till he comes round in the winter begging  will he come i asked  will he yes my dear he willwith a smooth plausible story to account for his desertion and a bland denial of ever having seen our ham i shall know how to deal with him then the old scamp  when you do get a conscientious indian theres no better guide in the world but they are rare i remarked with a faraway look  kate laughed  dont rub it in phil come help me to break camp well have to work harder and hustle for ourselves thats all  but is it safe to go on without a guide i inquired dubiously i hadnt felt very safe with peter crow but i felt still more unsafe without him  safe of course its safeperfectly safe i know the trail and well just have to drive around the wet places it would have been easier with peter and wed have had less work to do but well get along well enough without him i dont think id have bothered with him at all only i wanted to set mothers mind at rest shell never know he isnt with us till the trip is over so that is all right were going to have a glorious day but oh for our lost ham the ham that was never eaten theres a subject for a poem phil you write one when we get back to civilization methinks i can sniff the savoury odour of that lost ham on all the prairie breezes      of all sad words of tongue or pen     the saddest are theseit might have been  i quoted beginning to wash the dishes      saw ye my wee ham saw ye my ain ham         saw ye my pork ham down on yon lea     crossed it the prairie last night in the darkness         borne by an old and unprincipled cree  sang kate loosening the tent ropes altogether we got a great deal more fun out of that ham than if we had eaten it  as kate had predicted the day was glorious the mists rolled away and the sun shone brightly we drove all day without stopping save for dinnerwhen the lost ham figured largely in our conversationof course we said so many witty things about itat least we thought them wittythat we laughed continuously through the whole meal which we ate with prodigious appetite  but with all our driving we were not getting on very fast the country was exceedingly swampy and we had to make innumerable detours  the longest way round is the shortest way to bothwell said kate when we drove five miles out of our way to avoid a muskeg by evening we had driven fully twentyfive miles but we were only ten miles nearer bothwell than when we had broken camp in the morning  well have to camp soon sighed kate i believe around this bluff will be a good place oh phil im tireddead tired my very thoughts are tired i cant even think anything funny about the ham and yet weve got to set up the tent ourselves and attend to the horses and well have to scrape some of the mud off this beautiful vehicle  we can leave that till the morning i suggested  no it will be too hard and dry then here we areand here are two tepees of indians also  there they were right around the bluff the inmates were standing in a group before them looking at us as composedly as if we were not at all an unusual sight  im going to stay here anyhow said kate doggedly  oh dont i said in alarm theyre such a villainouslooking lotso dirtyand theyve got so little clothing on i wouldnt sleep a wink near them look at that awful old squaw with only one eye theyd steal everything weve got left kate remember the hamoh pray remember the fate of our beautiful ham  i shall never forget that ham said kate wearily but phil we cant drive far enough to be out of their reach if they really want to steal our provisions but i dont believe they will i believe they have plenty of foodindians in tepees mostly have the men hunt you know their looks are probably the worst of them anyhow you cant judge indians by appearances peter crow looked respectableand he was a whited sepulchre now these indians look as bad as indians can lookso they may turn out to be angels in disguise  very much disguised certainly i acquiesced satirically they seem to me to belong to the class of a neighbour of ours down east her family is always in rags because she says a hole is an accident a patch is a disgrace set camp here if you like kate but ill not sleep a wink with such neighbours  i cheerfully ate my words later on never were appearances more deceptive than in the case of those stoneys there is an old saying that many a kind heart beats behind a ragged coat the indians had no coats for their hearts to beat behindnothing but shirtssome of them hadnt even shirts but the shirts were certainly ragged enough and their hearts were kind  those indians were gentlemen they came forward and unhitched our horses fed and watered them they pitched our tent and built us a fire and cut brush for our beds kate and i had simply nothing to do except sit on our rugs and tell them what we wanted done they would have cooked our supper for us if we had allowed it but tired as we were we drew the line at that their hearts were pure gold but their hands no kate and i dragged ourselves up and cooked our own suppers and while we ate it those indians fell to and cleaned all the mud off our democrat for us to crown allit is almost unbelievable but it is true i solemnly avowthey wouldnt take a cent of payment for it all urge them as we might and did  well said kate as we curled up on our brush beds that night there certainly is a special providence for unprotected females id forgive peter crow for deserting us for the sake of those indians if he hadnt stolen our lovely ham into the bargain that was altogether unpardonable  in the morning the indians broke camp for us and harnessed our shaganappies we drove off waving our hands to them the delightful creatures we never saw any of them again i fear their kind is scarce but as long as i live i shall remember those stoneys with gratitude  we got on fairly well that third day and made about fifteen miles before dinner time we ate three of the sergeants prairie chickens for dinner and enjoyed them  but only think how delicious the ham would have been said kate  our real troubles began that afternoon we had not been driving long when the trail swooped down suddenly into a broad depressiona swamp so full of mudholes that there didnt seem to be anything but mudholes we pulled through six of thembut in the seventh we stuck hard and fast pull as our ponies could and did they could not pull us out  what are we to do i said becoming horribly frightened all at once it seemed to me that our predicament was a dreadful one  keep cool said kate she calmly took off her shoes and stockings tucked up her skirt and waded to the horses heads  cant i do anything i implored  yes take the whip and spare it not said kate ill encourage them here with sundry tugs and inspiriting words you urge them behind with a good lambasting  accordingly we encouraged and urged tugged and lambasted with a right good will but all to no effect our ponies did their best but they could not pull the democrat out of that slough  oh what i began and then i stopped i resolved that i would not ask that question again in that tone in that scrape i would be cheerful and courageous like katesplendid kate  i shall have to unhitch them tie one of them to that stump and ride off on the other for help said kate  where to i asked  till i find it grinned kate who seemed to think the whole disaster a capital joke i may have to go clean back to the tepeesand further for that matter i dont believe there were any tepees those indians were too good to be truethey were phantoms of delightsuch stuff as dreams are made of but even if they were real they wont be there nowtheyll have folded their tents like the arabs and as silently stolen away but ill find help somewhere  i cant stay here alone you may be gone for hours i cried forgetting all my resolutions of courage and cheerfulness in an access of panic  then ride the other pony and come with me suggested kate  i cant ride bareback i moaned  then youll have to stay here said kate decidedly theres nothing to hurt you phil sit in the wagon and keep dry eat something if you get hungry i may not be very long  i realized that there was nothing else to do and rather ashamed of my panic i resigned myself to the inevitable and saw kate off with a smile of encouragement then i waited i was tired and frightenedhorribly frightened i sat there and imagined scores of gruesome possibilities it was no use telling myself to be brave i couldnt be brave i never was in such a blue funk before or since suppose kate got lostsuppose she couldnt find me againsuppose something happened to hersuppose she couldnt get helpsuppose it came on night and i there all alonesuppose indiansnot gentlemanly stoneys or even peter crows but genuine oldfashioned indiansshould come alongsuppose it began to pour rain  it did begin to rain the only one of my suppositions which came true i hoisted an umbrella and sat there grimly in that horseless wagon in the mudhole                                       many a time since have i laughed over the memory of the appearance i must have presented sitting in that mudhole but there was nothing in the least funny about it at the time the worst feature of it all was the uncertainty i could have waited patiently enough and conquered my fears if i had known that kate would find help and return within a reasonable timeat least before dark but everything was doubtful i was not composed of the stuff out of which heroines are fashioned and i devoutly wished we had never left arrow creek  shoutscallslaughterkates dear voice in an encouraging cry from the hill behind me  halloo honey hold the fort a few minutes longer here we are bless her hasnt she been a brick to stay here all alone like thisand a tenderfoot at that  i could have cried with joy but i saw that there were men with katetwo menwhite menand i laughed instead i had not been bravei had been an arrant little coward but i vowed that nobody not even kate should suspect it later on kate told me how she had fared in her search for assistance  when i left you phil i felt much more anxious than i wanted to let you see i had no idea where to go i knew there were no houses along our trail and i might have to go clean back to the tepeesfifteen miles bareback i didnt dare try any other trail for i knew nothing of them and wasnt sure that there were even tepees on them but when i had gone about six miles i saw a welcome sightnothing less than a spiral of blue homelylooking smoke curling up from the prairie far off to my right i decided to turn off and investigate i rode two miles and finally i came to a little log shack there was a beeyewtiful big horse in a corral close by my heart jumped with joy but suppose the inmates of the shack were halfbreeds you cant realize how relieved i felt when the door opened and two white men came out in a few minutes everything was explained they knew who i was and what i wanted and i knew that they were mr lonsdale and mr hopkins owners of a big ranch over by deer run they were shacking out to put up some hay and mrs hopkins was keeping house for them she wanted me to stop and have a cup of tea right off but i thought of you phil and declined as soon as they heard of our predicament those lovely men got their two biggest horses and came right with me  it was not long before our democrat was on solid ground once more and then our rescuers insisted that we go back to the shack with them for the night accordingly we drove back to the shack attended by our two gallant deliverers on white horses mrs hopkins was waiting for us a trim darkhaired little lady in a very pretty gown which she had donned in our honour kate and i felt like perfect tramps beside her in our muddy old raiment with our hair dressed by dead reckoningfor we had not included a mirror in our baggage there was a mirror in the shack howeversmall but goodand we quickly made ourselves tidy at least and kate even went to the length of curling her bangsbangs were in style then and kate had long thick onesusing the stem of a broken pipe of mr hopkinss for a curler i was so tired that my vanity was completely crushed outfor the time beingand i simply pinned my bangs back later on when i discovered that mr lonsdale was really the younger son of an english earl i wished i had curled them but it was too late then  he didnt look in the least like a scion of aristocracy he wore a cowboy rig and had a scrubby beard of a weeks growth but he was very jolly and played the violin beautifully after teaand a lovely tea it was although as kate remarked to me later there was no hamwe had an impromptu concert mr lonsdale played the violin mrs hopkins who sang was a graduate of a musical conservatory mr hopkins gave a comic recitation and did a cree wardance kate gave a spirited account of our adventures since leaving home and mother and i describedwith trimmingshow i felt sitting alone in the democrat in a mudhole in a pouring rain on a vast prairie  mrs hopkins kate and i slept in the one bed the shack boasted screened off from public view by a calico curtain mr lonsdale reposed in his accustomed bunk by the stove but poor mr hopkins had to sleep on the floor he must have been glad kate and i stayed only one night                                       the fourth morning found us blithely hitting the trail in renewed confidence and spirits we parted from our kind friends in the shack with mutual regret mr hopkins gave us a haunch of jumping deer and mrs hopkins gave us a box of homemade cookies mr lonsdale at first thought he couldnt give us anything for he said all he had with him was his pipe and his fiddle but later on he said he felt so badly to see us go without any token of his good will that he felt constrained to ask us to accept a piece of rope that he had tied his outfit together with  the fourth day we got on so nicely that it was quite monotonous the sun shone the chinook blew our ponies trotted over the trail gallantly kate and i sang told stories and laughed immoderately over everything even a poor joke seems to have a subtle flavour on the prairie for the first time i began to think saskatchewan beautiful with those farreaching parklike meadows dotted with the whitestemmed poplars the distant bluffs bannered with the airiest of purple hazes and the little blue lakes that sparkled and shimmered in the sunlight on every hand  the only thing approaching an adventure that day happened in the afternoon when we reached a creek which had to be crossed  we must investigate said kate decidedly it would never do to risk getting mired here for this country is unsettled and we must be twenty miles from another human being  kate again removed her shoes and stockings and puddled about that creek until she found a safe fording place i am afraid i must admit that i laughed most heartlessly at the spectacle she presented while so employed  oh for a camera kate i said between spasms  kate grinned i dont care what i look like she said but i feel wretchedly unpleasant this water is simply swarming with wigglers  goodness what are they i exclaimed  oh theyre tiny little things like leeches responded kate i believe they develop into mosquitoes later on bad cess to them what mr nash would call my pedal extremities are simply being devoured by the brutes ugh i believe the bottom of this creek is all soft mud we may have to driveno as im a living wigglerhaunted human being heres firm bottom hurrah phil were all right  in a few minutes we were past the creek and bowling merrily on our way we had a beautiful camping ground that nighta fairylike little slope of white poplars with a blue lake at its foot when the sun went down a milkwhite mist hung over the prairie with a young moon kissing it we boiled some slices of our jumping deer and ate them in the open around a cheery campfire then we sought our humble couches where we slept the sleep of just people who had been driving over the prairie all day once in the night i wakened it was very dark the unearthly stillness of a great prairie was all around me in that vast silence kates soft breathing at my side seemed an intrusion of sound where no sound should be  philippa blair can you believe its yourself i said mentally here you are lying on a brush bed on a western prairie in the middle of the night at least twenty miles from any human being except another frail creature of your own sex yet youre not even frightened you are very comfy and composed and youre going right to sleep again  and right to sleep again i went                                       our fifth day began ominously we had made an early start and had driven about six miles when the calamity occurred kate turned a corner too sharply to avoid a big boulder there was a heartbreaking sound  the tongue of the wagon is broken cried kate in dismay all too surely it was we looked at each other blankly  what can we do i said  im sure i dont know said kate helplessly when kate felt helpless i thought things must be desperate indeed we got out and investigated the damage  its not a clean break said kate its a long slanting break if we had a piece of rope i believe i could fix it  mr lonsdales piece of rope i cried  the very thing said kate brightening up  the rope was found and we set to work with the aid of some willow withes and that providential rope we contrived to splice the tongue together in some shape  although the trail was good we made only twelve miles the rest of the day so slowly did we have to drive besides we were continually expecting that tongue to give way again and the strain was bad for our nerves when we came at sunset to the junction of the black river trail with ours kate resolutely turned the shaganappies down it  well go and spend the night with the brewsters she said they live only ten miles down this trail i went to school in regina with hannah brewster and though i havent seen her for ten years i know shell be glad to see us shes a lovely person and her husband is a very nice man i visited them once after they were married  we soon arrived at the brewster place it was a trim whitewashed little log house in a grove of poplars but all the blinds were down and we discovered the door was locked evidently the brewsters were not at home  never mind said kate cheerfully well light a fire outside and cook our supper and then well spend the night in the barn a bed of prairie hay will be just the thing  but the barn was locked too it was now dark and our plight was rather desperate  im going to get into the house if i have to break a window said kate resolutely hannah would want us to do that shed never get over it if she heard we came to her house and couldnt get in  fortunately we did not have to go to the length of breaking into hannahs house the kitchen window went up quite easily we turned the shaganappies loose to forage for themselves grass and water being abundant then we climbed in at the window lighted our lantern and found ourselves in a very snug little kitchen opening off it on one side was a trim nicely furnished parlour and on the other a wellstocked pantry  well light the fire in the stove in a jiffy and have a real good supper said kate exultantly heres cold roast beefand preserves and cookies and cheese and butter  before long we had supper ready and we did full justice to the absent hannahs excellent cheer after all it was quite nice to sit down once more to a wellappointed table and eat in civilized fashion  then we washed up all the dishes and made everything snug and tidy i shall never be sufficiently thankful that we did so  kate piloted me upstairs to the spare room  this is fixed up much nicer than it was when i was here before she said looking around of course hannah and ted were just starting out then and they had to be economical they must have prospered to be able to afford such furniture as this well turn in phil wont it be rather jolly to sleep between sheets once more  we slept long and soundly until halfpast eight the next morning and dear knows if we would have wakened then of our own accord but i heard somebody saying in a very harsh gruff voice here you two wake up i want to know what this means  we two did wake up promptly and effectually i never wakened up so thoroughly in my life before standing in our room were three people one of them a man he was a big greyhaired man with a bushy black beard and an angry scowl beside him was a womana tall thin angular personage with red hair and an indescribable bonnet she looked even crosser and more amazed than the man if that were possible in the background was another womana tiny old lady who must have been at least eighty she was in spite of her tininess a very strikinglooking personage she was dressed all in black and had snowwhite hair a deadwhite face and snapping vivid coalblack eyes she looked as amazed as the other two but she didnt look cross  i knew something must be wrongfearfully wrongbut i didnt know what even in my confusion i found time to think that if that disagreeablelooking redhaired woman was hannah brewster kate must have had a queer taste in school friends then the man said more gruffly than ever come now who are you and what business have you here  kate raised herself on one elbow she looked very wild i heard the old blackandwhite lady in the background chuckle to herself  isnt this theodore brewsters place gasped kate  no said the big woman speaking for the first time this place belongs to us we bought it from the brewsters in the spring they moved over to black river forks our name is chapman  poor kate fell back on the pillow quite overcome ii beg your pardon she said ii thought the brewsters lived here mrs brewster is a friend of mine my cousin and i are on our way to bothwell and we called here to spend the night with hannah when we found everyone away we just came in and made ourselves at home  a likely story said the red woman  we werent born yesterday said the man  madam blackandwhite didnt say anything but when the other two had made their pretty speeches she doubled up in a silent convulsion of mirth shaking her head from side to side and beating the air with her hands  if they had been nice to us kate would probably have gone on feeling confused and ashamed but when they were so disagreeable she quickly regained her selfpossession she sat up again and said in her haughtiest voice i do not know when you were born or where but it must have been somewhere where very peculiar manners were taught if you will have the decency to leave our roomthis roomuntil we can get up and dress we will not transgress upon your hospitality kate put a most satirical emphasis on that word any longer and we shall pay you amply for the food we have eaten and the nights lodging we have taken  the blackandwhite apparition went through the motion of clapping her hands but not a sound did she make whether he was cowed by kates tone or appeased by the prospect of payment i know not but mr chapman spoke more civilly well thats fair if you pay up its all right  they shall do no such thing as pay you said madam blackandwhite in a surprisingly clear resolute authoritative voice if you havent any shame for yourself robert chapman youve got a motherinlaw who can be ashamed for you no strangers shall be charged for food or lodging in any house where mrs matilda pitman lives remember that ive come down in the world but i havent forgot all decency for all that i knew you was a skinflint when amelia married you and youve made her as bad as yourself but im boss here yet here you robert chapman take yourself out of here and let those girls get dressed and you amelia go downstairs and cook a breakfast for them  i never in all my life saw anything like the abject meekness with which those two big people obeyed that mite they went and stood not upon the order of their going as the door closed behind them mrs matilda pitman laughed silently and rocked from side to side in her merriment  aint it funny she said i mostly lets them run the length of their tether but sometimes i has to pull them up and then i does it with a jerk now you can take your time about dressing my dears and ill go down and keep them in order the mean scalawags  when we descended the stairs we found a smokinghot breakfast on the table mr chapman was nowhere to be seen and mrs chapman was cutting bread with a sulky air mrs matilda pitman was sitting in an armchair knitting she still wore her bonnet and her triumphant expression set right in dears and make a good breakfast she said  we are not hungry said kate almost pleadingly i dont think we can eat anything and its time we were on the trail please excuse us and let us go on  mrs matilda pitman shook a knitting needle playfully at kate sit down and take your breakfast she commanded mrs matilda pitman commands you everybody obeys mrs matilda pitmaneven robert and amelia you must obey her too  we did obey her we sat down and such was the influence of her mesmeric eyes we ate a tolerable breakfast the obedient amelia never spoke mrs matilda pitman did not speak either but she knitted furiously and chuckled when we had finished mrs matilda pitman rolled up her knitting now you can go if you want to she said but you dont have to go you can stay here as long as you like and ill make them cook your meals for you  i never saw kate so thoroughly cowed  thank you she said faintly you are very kind but we must go  well then said mrs matilda pitman throwing open the door your team is ready for you i made robert catch your ponies and harness them and i made him fix that broken tongue properly i enjoy making robert do things its almost the only sport i have left im eighty and most things have lost their flavour except bossing robert  our democrat and ponies were outside the door but robert was nowhere to be seen in fact we never saw him again  i do wish said kate plucking up what little spirit she had left that you would let usahuhkate quailed before mrs matilda pitmans eyerecompense you for our entertainment  mrs matilda pitman said beforeand meant itthat she doesnt take pay for entertaining strangers nor let other people where she lives do it much as their meanness would like to do it  we got away the sulky amelia had vanished and there was nobody to see us off except mrs matilda pitman  dont forget to call the next time you come this way she said cheerfully waving her knitting at us i hope youll get safe to bothwell if i was ten years younger i vow id pack a grip and go along with you i like your spunk most of the girls nowadays is such timid skeery critters when i was a girl i wasnt afraid of nothing or nobody  we said and did nothing until we had driven out of sight and earshot then kate laid down the reins and laughed until the tears came  oh phil phil will you ever forget this adventure she gasped  i shall never forget mrs matilda pitman i said emphatically  we had no further adventures that day robert chapman had fixed the tongue so wellprobably under mrs matilda pitmans watchful eyesthat we could drive as fast as we liked and we made good progress but when we pitched camp that night kate scanned the sky with an anxious expression i dont like the look of it she said im afraid were going to have a bad day tomorrow                                       we had when we awakened in the morning rain was pouring down this in itself might not have prevented us from travelling but the state of the trail did it had been raining the greater part of the night and the trail was little more than a ditch of slimy greasy sticky mud  if we could have stayed in the tent the whole time it would not have been quite so bad but we had to go out twice to take the ponies to the nearest pond and water them moreover we had to collect pea vines for them which was not an agreeable occupation in a pouring rain the day was very cold too but fortunately there was plenty of dead poplar right by our camp we kept a good fire on in the camp stove and were quite dry and comfortable as long as we stayed inside even when we had to go out we did not get very wet as we were well protected but it was a long dreary day finally when the dark came down and supper was over kate grew quite desperate lets have a game of checkers she suggested  where is your checkerboard i asked  oh ill soon furnish that said kate  she cut out a square of brown paper in which a biscuit box had been wrapped and marked squares off on it with a pencil then she produced some red and white highbush cranberries for men a cranberry split in two was a king  we played nine games of checkers by the light of our smoky lantern our enjoyment of the game was heightened by the fact that it had ceased raining nevertheless when morning came the trail was so drenched that it was impossible to travel on it  we must wait till noon said kate  that trail wont be dry enough to travel on for a week i said disconsolately  my dear the chinook is blowing up said kate you dont know how quickly a trail dries in a chinook its like magic  i did not believe a chinook or anything else could dry up that trail by noon sufficiently for us to travel on but it did as kate said it seemed like magic by one oclock we were on our way again the chinook blowing merrily against our faces it was a wind that blew straight from the heart of the wilderness and had in it all the potent lure of the wild the yellow prairie laughed and glistened in the sun  we made twentyfive miles that afternoon and as we were again fortunate enough to find a bluff of dead poplar near which to camp we built a royal campfire which sent its flaming light far and wide over the dark prairie  we were in jubilant spirits if the next day were fine and nothing dreadful happened to us we would reach bothwell before night  but our ill luck was not yet at an end the next morning was beautiful the sun shone warm and bright the chinook blew balmily and alluringly the trail stretched before us dry and level but we sat moodily before our tent not even having sufficient heart to play checkers tom had gone lameso lame that there was no use in thinking of trying to travel with him kate could not tell what was the matter  there is no injury that i can see she said he must have sprained his foot somehow  wait we did with all the patience we could command but the day was long and wearisome and at night toms foot did not seem a bit better  we went to bed gloomily but joy came with the morning toms foot was so much improved that kate decided we could go on though we would have to drive slowly  theres no chance of making bothwell today she said but at least we shall be getting a little nearer to it  i dont believe there is such a place as bothwell or any other town i said pessimistically theres nothing in the world but prairie and well go on driving over it forever like a couple of female wandering jews it seems years since we left arrow creek  well weve had lots of fun out of it all you know said kate mrs matilda pitman alone was worth it she will be an amusing memory all our lives are you sorry you came  no im not i concluded after honest soulsearching reflection no im glad kate but i think we were crazy to attempt it as sergeant baker said think of all the mighthavebeens  nothing else will happen said kate i feel in my bones that our troubles are over  kates bones proved true prophets nevertheless that day was a weary one there was no scenery we had got into a barren lakeless treeless district where the world was one monotonous expanse of greybrown prairie we just crawled along kate had her hands full driving those ponies jerry was in capital fettle and couldnt understand why he mightnt tear ahead at full speed he was so much disgusted over being compelled to walk that he was very fractious poor tom limped patiently along but by night his lameness had quite disappeared and although we were still a good twentyfive miles from bothwell we could see it quite distinctly far ahead on the level prairie  tis a sight for sore eyes isnt it said kate as we pitched camp  there is little more to be told next day at noon we rattled through the main and only street of bothwell curious sights are frequent in prairie towns so we did not attract much attention when we drew up before mr taylors house mary taylor flew out and embraced kate publicly  you darling i knew youd get here if anyone could they telegraphed us you were on the way youre a bricktwo bricks  no im not a brick at all miss taylor i confessed frankly ive been an arrant coward and a doubting thomas and a wet blanket all through the expedition but kate is a brick and a genius and an allround jolly good fellow  mary said kate in a tragic whisper haveyouanyhaminthehouse     jessamine   when the vegetableman knocked jessamine went to the door wearily she felt quite well acquainted with him he had been coming all the spring and his cheery greeting always left a pleasant afterglow behind him but it was not the vegetableman after allat least not the right one this one was considerably younger he was tall and sunburned with a ruddy smiling face and keen pleasant blue eyes and he had a spray of honeysuckle pinned on his coat  want any garden stuff this morning  jessamine shook her head we always get ours from mr bell this is his day to come  well i guess you wont see mr bell for a spell he fell off a loft out at his place yesterday and broke his leg im his nephew and im going to fill his place till he gets round again  oh im so sorryfor mr bell i mean have you any green peas  yes heaps of them ill bring them in anything else  not today said jessamine with a wistful glance at the honeysuckle  mr bell junior saw it in an instant the honeysuckle was unpinned and handed to her if you like posies youre welcome to this i guess youre fond of flowers he added as he noted the flash of delight that passed over her pale face  yes indeed they put me so in mind of homeof the country oh how sweet this is  youre countrybred then been in the city long  since last fall i was born and brought up in the country i wish i was back i cant get over being homesick this honeysuckle seems to bring it right back we had honeysuckles around our porch at home  you dont like the city then  oh no i sometimes feel as if i should smother here i shall never feel at home i am afraid  where did you live before you came here  up at middleton it was an oldfashioned place but prettyour house was covered with vines and there were trees all about it and great green fields beyond but i dont know what makes me tell you this i forgot i was talking to a stranger  pretty little woman soliloquized andrew bell as he drove away she doesnt look happy though i suppose shes married some city chap and has to live in town i guess it dont agree with her her eyes had a real hungry look in them over that honeysuckle she seemed near about crying when she talked of the country  jessamine felt more like crying than ever when she went back to her work her head ached and she was very tired the tiny kitchen was hot and stifling how she longed for the great roomy kitchen in her old home with its spotless floors and floods of sunshine streaming in through the maples outside there was room to live and breathe there and from the door one looked out over green windrippled meadows under a glorious arch of pure blue sky away to the purple hills in the distance                                       jessamine stacy had always lived in the country when her sister died and the old home had to go jessamine could only accept the shelter offered by her brother john stacy who did business in the city  of her stylish sisterinlaw jessamine was absolutely in awe at first mrs john was by no means pleased at the necessity of taking a country sister into her family circle but one day when the servant girl took a tantrum and left mrs john found it very convenient to have in the house a person who could step into elizas place as promptly and efficiently as jessamine could  indeed she found it so convenient that eliza never had a successor jessamine found herself in the position of maidofallwork and kitchen drudge for board and clothes  she never complained but she grew thinner and paler as the winter went by she had worked as hard on the farm but it was the close confinement and weary routine that told on her mrs john was exacting and querulous john was absorbed in his business worries and had no time to waste on his sister now when the summer had come her homesickness was almost unbearable  the next day mr bell came he handed her a big bunch of sweetbrier roses  here you are he said heartily i took the liberty to bring you these today seeing youre so fond of posies the country roads are pink with them now why dont you get your husband to bring you out for a drive some day youd be as welcome as a lark at my farm  i will when he comes along but i havent seen him yet  mr bell gave a prolonged whistle excuse me i thought you were mrs somethingorother for sure arent you mistress here  oh no my brothers wife is the mistress here im only jessamine  she laughed again she was holding the roses against her face and her eyes sparkled over them roguishly the vegetableman looked at her admiringly  youre a country rose yourself miss and you ought to be blooming out in the fields instead of wilting in here  i wish i was thank you so much for the roses mr  mr   bellandrew bell thats my name i live out at pine pastures were all bells out therecant throw a stone without hitting one glad you like the roses  after that the vegetableman brought jessamine a bouquet every trip now it was a big bunch of fielddaisies or golden buttercups now a green glory of spicy ferns now a cluster of oldfashioned garden flowers  they keep life in me jessamine told him  they were great friends by this time true she knew little about him but she felt instinctively that he was manly and kindhearted  one day when he came jessamine met him almost gleefully no nothing today there is no dinner to cook  you dont say where are the folks  gone on an excursion they wont be back until tonight  they wont well ill tell you what to do you get ready and when im through my rounds well go for a drive up the country  oh mr bell but wont it be too much bother for you  well i reckon not you want an excursion as well as other folks and you shall have it  oh thank you so much yes ill be ready you dont know how much it means to me  poor little creature said mr bell as he drove away its downright cruelty thats what it is to keep her penned up like that you might as well coop up a lark in a henhouse and expect it to thrive and sing id like to give that brother of hers a piece of my mind  when he lifted her up to the high seat of his express wagon that afternoon he said now i want you to do something just shut your eyes and dont open them again until i tell you to  jessamine laughed and obeyed finally she heard him say look  jessamine opened her eyes with a little cry they were on a remote country road cool and dim and quiet in the very heart of the beech woods long banners of light fell athwart the grey boles along the roadsides grew sheets of feathery ferns above the sky was gloriously blue the air was sweet with the wild woodsy smell of the forest  jessamine lifted and clasped her hands in rapture oh how lovely  do you know where were going said mr bell delightedly out to my farm at pine pastures my aunt keeps house for me and shell be real glad to see you youre just going to have a real good time this afternoon  they had a delightful drive to begin with and presently mr bell turned into a wide lane  this is cloverside farm im proud of it ill admit there isnt a finer place in the county what do you think of it  oh it is lovelyit is like home look at those great fields id like to go and lie down in that clover  mr bell lifted her from the wagon and marched her up a flowery garden path you shall do it and everything else you want to here aunt this is the young lady i spoke of make her at home while i tend to the horses  miss bell was a pleasantfaced woman with silver hair and kind blue eyes she took jessamines hand in a friendly fashion  come in dear youre welcome as a june rose  when mr bell returned he found jessamine standing on the porch with her hands full of honeysuckle and her cheeks pink with excitement  i declare youve got roses already he exclaimed if theyd only stay now and not bleach out again whats first now  oh i dont know there are so many things i want to do those flowers in the garden are calling meand i want to go down to that hollow and pick buttercupsand i want to stay right here and look at things  mr bell laughed come with me to the pasture and see my jersey calves theyre something worth seeing come aunt this way miss stacy  he led the way down the lane the two women following together jessamine thought she must be in a pleasant dream the whole afternoon was a feast of delight to her starved heart when sunset came she sat down tired out but radiant on the porch steps her hat had slipped back and her hair was curling around her face her dark eyes were aglow the roses still bloomed in her cheeks  mr bell looked at her admiringly if a man could see that pretty sight every night he thought and great scott why cant he whats to prevent id like to know  when the moon rose mr bell brought his team around and they drove back through the clear night past the wonderful stillness of the great beech woods and the wide fields the farmer looked sideways at his companion  the little thing wants to be petted and looked after he thought shes just pining away for home and love and why cant she have it shes dying by inches in that hole back in town  jessamine quite unsuspecting the farmers meditations was living over again in fancy the joys of the afternoon the ramble in the pasture the drink of water from the spring under the hillside pines the bountiful oldfashioned country supper in the vineshaded diningroom the cup of new milk in the dairy at sunset and all the glory of skies and meadows and trees how could she go back to her cage again   the next week mr bell senior resumed his visits and the young farmer came no more to the side door of no 49 jessamine missed him greatly mr bell senior never brought her clover or honeysuckle  but one day his nephew suddenly reappeared jessamine opened the door for him and her face lighted up but mr bell saw that she had been crying  did you think i had forgotten you he asked not a bit of it harvest was on and i couldnt get clear before ive come to ask you when you intend to take another drive to cloverside farm what have you been up to you look as if youd been working too hard  iihavent felt very well im glad you came today mr bell perhaps i shall not see you again and i wanted to say goodbye and thank you for all your kindness  goodbye why where are you going  my brother went west a week ago faltered jessamine she could not bring herself to tell the cleareyed farmer that john stacy had failed and had been obliged to start for the west without saying goodbye to his creditors his wife and iare going toonext week  oh jessamine exclaimed mr bell in despair dont goyou mustnt i want you at cloverside farm i came today on purpose to ask you i love you and ill make you happy if youll marry me what do you say jessamine  jessamine by way of answer sat down on the nearest chair and began to cry  oh dont said the wooer in distress i didnt want to make you feel bad if you dont like the idea i wont mention it again  oh it isnt thatbut ii thought nobody cared what became of me you are so kindim afraid id only be a bother to you  ill risk that you shall have a happy home little girl will you come to it  yeees it was very indistinct and faltering but mr bell heard it and considered it a most eloquent answer  mrs john fumed and sulked and chose to consider herself hoodwinked and injured but mr bell was a resolute man and a few days later he came for the last time to no 49 and took his bride away with him  as they drove through the beech woods he put his arm tenderly around the shy smiling little woman beside him and said youll never be sorry for this my dear  and she never was     miss sallys letter   miss sally peered sharply at willard stanley first through her goldrimmed glasses and then over them willard continued to look very innocent joyce got up abruptly and went out of the room  so you have bought that queer little house with the absurd name said miss sally  you surely dont call eden an absurd name protested willard  i dofor a house particularly such a house as that eden there are no edens on earth and what are you going to do with it  live in it  alone  miss sally looked at him suspiciously  no the truth is miss sally i am hoping to be married in the fall and i want to fix up eden for my bride  oh miss sally drew a long breath partly it seemed of relief and partly of triumph and looked at joyce who had returned with an expression that said i told you so but joyce whose eyes were cast down did not see it  and went on willard calmly i want you to help me fix it up miss sally i dont know much about such things and you know everything you will be able to tell me just what to do to make eden habitable  miss sally looked as pleased as she ever allowed herself to look over anything a man suggested it was the delight of her heart to plan and decorate and contrive her own house was a model of comfort and good taste and miss sally was quite ready for new worlds to conquer instantly eden assumed importance in her eyes she might be sorry for the misguided bride who was rashly going to trust her lifes keeping to a man but she would see at least that the poor thing should have a decent place to begin her martyrdom in  ill be pleased to help you all i can she said graciously  miss sally could speak very graciously when she chose even to men you would not have thought she hated them but she did in all sincerity too also she had brought her niece up to hate and distrust them or she had tried to do so but at times miss sally was troubled with an uncomfortable suspicion that joyce did not hate and distrust men quite as thoroughly as she ought the suspicion had recurred several times this summer since willard stanley had come to take charge of the biological station at the harbour miss sally did not distrust willard on his own account she merely distrusted him on principle and on joyces account nevertheless she was rather nice to him miss sally dear trim dainty miss sally with her snowwhite curls and her big girlish black eyes couldnt help being nice even to a man  willard had come a great deal to miss sallys if it were joyce he were after miss sally blocked his schemes with much enjoyment he never saw joyce alonethat miss sally knew of at leastand he did not make much apparent headway but now all danger was removed miss sally thought he was going to be married to somebody else and joyce was safe  thank you said willard ill come up tomorrow afternoon and you and i will take a prowl about eden and see what must be done im ever so much obliged miss sally  i wonder who he is going to marry said miss sally careless of grammar after he had gone poor poor girl  i dont see why you should pity her said joyce not looking up from her embroidery there was just the merest tremor in her voice miss sally looked at her sharply  i pity any woman who is foolish enough to marry she said solemnly no man is to be trusted joyceno man they are all ready to break a trusting womans heart for the sport of it never you allow any man the chance to break yours joyce i shall never consent to your marrying anybody so mind you dont take any such notion into your head there oughtnt to be any danger for i have instilled correct ideas on this subject into you from childhood but girls are such fools i know because i was one myself once  of course i would never marry without your consent aunt sally said joyce smiling faintly but affectionately at her aunt joyce loved miss sally with her whole heart everybody did who knew her there never was a more lovable creature than this pretty little old maid who hated the men so bitterly  thats a good girl said miss sally approvingly i own that i have been a little afraid that this willard stanley was coming here to see you but my mind is set at rest on that point now and i shall help him fix up his doll house with a clear conscience eden indeed  miss sally sniffed and tripped out of the room to hunt up a furniture catalogue joyce sighed and let her embroidery slip to the floor  oh im afraid willards plan wont succeed she murmured im afraid aunt sally will never consent to our marriage and i cant and wont marry him unless she does for she would never forgive me and i couldnt bear that i wonder what makes her so bitter against men she is so sweet and loving it seems simply unnatural that she should have such a feeling so deeply rooted in her oh what will she say when she finds outdear little aunt sally i couldnt bear to have her angry with me  the next day willard came up from the harbour and took miss sally down to see eden eden was a tiny cornery gabled grey house just across the road and down a long twisted windy lane skirting the edge of a beech wood nobody had lived in it for four years and it had a neglected outatelbow appearance  its rather a box of a place isnt it said willard slowly im afraid she will think so but it is all i can afford just now i dream of giving her a palace some day of course but well have to begin humbly do you think anything can be made of it  miss sally was busily engaged in sizing up the possibilities of the place  it is pretty small she said meditatively and the yard is small tooand there are far too many trees and shrubs all messed up together they must be thinned outand that paling taken down i think a good deal can be done with it as for the housewell let us see the inside  willard unlocked the door and showed miss sally over the place miss sally poked and pried and sniffed and wrinkled her forehead and finally stood on the stairs and delivered her ultimatum  this house can be done up very nicely paint and paper will work wonders but i wouldnt paint it outside leave it that pretty silver weathergrey and plant vines to run over it oh well see what we can do of course it is smalla kitchen a dining room a living room and two bedrooms you wont want anything stuffy you can do the painting yourself and ill help you hang the paper how much money can you spend on it  willard named the sum it was not a large one  but i think it will do mused miss sally well make it do theres such satisfaction getting as much as you possibly can out of a dollar and twice as much as anybody else would get i enjoy that sort of thing this will be a game and well play it with a right good will but i do wish you would give the place a sensible name  i think eden is the most appropriate name in the world laughed willard it will be eden for me when she comes  i suppose you tell her all that and she believes it said miss sally sarcastically youll both find out that there is a good deal more prose than poetry in life  but well find it out together said willard tenderly wont that be worth something miss sally prose rightly written and read is sometimes as beautiful as poetry  miss sally deigned no reply she carefully gathered up her grey silken skirts from the dusty floor and walked out get christina bowes to come up tomorrow and scrub this place out she said practically we can go to town and select paint and paper i should like the dining room done in pale green and the living room in creamy tones ranging from white to almost golden brown but perhaps my taste wont be hers  oh yes it will said willard with assurance i am quite certain she will like everything you like i can never thank you enough for helping me if you hadnt consented i should have had to put it into the hands of some outsider whom i couldnt have helped at all and i wanted to help i wanted to have a finger in everything because it is for her you see miss sally it will be such a delight to fix up this little house knowing that she is coming to live in it  i wonder if you really mean it said miss sally bitterly oh i dare say you think you do but do you perhaps you do perhaps you are the exception that proves the rule  this was a great admission for miss sally to make  for the next two months miss sally was happy even willard himself was not more keenly interested in eden and its development miss sally did wonders with his money she was an expert at bargain hunting and her taste was excellent a score of times she mercilessly nipped willards suggestions in the bud lace curtains for the living roomnever they would be horribly out of place in such a house you dont want curtains at alljust a frill is all that quaint window needs with a shelf above it for a few bits of pottery i picked up a love of a brass platter in town yesterdaygot it for next to nothing from that old jew who would really rather give you a thing than suffer you to escape without taking something oh i know how to manage them  you certainly do laughed willard it amazes me to see how far you can stretch a dollar  willard did the painting under miss sallys watchful eye and they hung the paper together together they made trips to town or junketed over the country in search of furniture and dishes of which miss sally had heard day by day the little house blossomed into a home and day by day miss sallys interest in it grew she began to have a personal affection for its quaint rooms and their adornments moreover in spite of herself she felt a growing interest in willards bride he never told her the name of the girl he hoped to bring to eden and miss sally never asked it but he talked of her a great deal in a shy reverent tender way  he certainly seems to be very much in love with her miss sally told joyce one evening when she returned from eden i would believe in him if it were possible for me to believe in a man anyway she will have a dear little home ive almost come to love that eden house why dont you come down and see it joyce  oh ill come some dayi hope said joyce lightly i think id rather not see it until it is finished  willard is a nice boy said miss sally suddenly i dont think i ever did him justice before the finer qualities of his character come out in these simple homely little doings and tasks he is certainly very thoughtful and kind oh i suppose hell make a good husband as husbands go but he doesnt know the first thing about managing if his wife isnt a good manager i dont know what theyll do and perhaps she wont like the way weve done up eden willard says she will of course because he thinks her perfection but she may have dreadful taste and want the lace curtains and that nightmare of a pink rug willard admired and i dare say shed rather have a new flaunting set of china with rosebuds on it than that dear old dull blue i picked up for a mere song down at the aldenbury auction i stood in the rain for two mortal hours to make sure of it and it was really worth all that willard has spent on the dining room put together it will break my heart if she sets to work altering eden its simply perfect as it isthough i suppose i shouldnt say it                                       in another week eden was finished miss sally stood in the tiny hall and looked about her  well it is done she said with a sigh im sorry i have enjoyed fixing it up tremendously and now i feel that my occupation is gone i hope you are satisfied willard  satisfied is too mild a word miss sally i am delighted i knew you could accomplish wonders but i never hoped for this eden is a dreamthe dearest quaintest sweetest little home that ever waited for a bride when i bring her hereoh miss sally do you know what that thought means to me  miss sally looked curiously at the young man his face was flushed and his voice trembled a little there was a faraway shining look in his eyes as if he saw a vision  i hope you and she will be happy said miss sally slowly when will she be coming willard  the flush went out of willards face leaving it pale and determined  that is for herand youto say he answered steadily  me exclaimed miss sally what have i to do with it  a great dealfor unless you consent she will never come here at all  willard stanley said miss sally with ominous calm who is the girl you mean to marry  the girl i hope to marry is joyce miss sally waitdont say anything till you hear me out he came close to her and caught her hands in a boyish grip joyce and i have loved each other ever since we met but we despaired of winning your consent and joyce will not marry me without it i thought if i could get you to help me fix up my little home that you might get so interested in itand so well acquainted with methat you would trust me with joyce please do miss sally i love her so truly and i know i can make her happy if you dont eden shall never have a mistress ill shut it up just as it is and leave it sacred to the dead hope of a bride that will never come to it  oh you wouldnt protested miss sally it would be a shamesuch a dear little houseand after all the trouble ive taken but you have tricked meoh you men couldnt be straightforward in anything  wasnt it a fair device for a desperate lover miss sally interrupted willard oh you mustnt hold spite because of it dear and you will give me joyce wont you because if you dont i really will shut up eden forever  miss sally looked wistfully around her through the open door on her left she saw the little living room with its quaint comfortable furniture its dainty pictures and adornments through the front door she saw the trim velvetswarded little lawn upstairs were two white rooms that only wanted a womans living presence to make them jewels and the kitchen on which she had expended so much thought and ingenuitythe kitchen furnished to the last detail even to the kindling in the range and the match willard had laid ready to light it it gave miss sally a pang to think of that altar fire never being lighted it was really the thought of the kitchen that finished miss sally  youve tricked me she said again reproachfully youve tricked me into loving this house so much that i cannot bear the thought of it never living youll have to have joyce i suppose and i believe im glad that it isnt a stranger who is to be the mistress of eden joyce wont hanker after pink rugs and lace curtains and her taste in china is the same as mine in one way its a great relief to my mind but its a fearful riska fearful risk to think that you may make my dear child miserable  you know you dont think that i will miss sally im not really such a bad fellow now am i  you are a manand i have no confidence whatever in men declared miss sally wiping some very real tears from her eyes with a very unreal sort of handkerchiefone of the cobwebby affairs of lace her daintiness demanded  miss sally why have you such a rooted distrust of men demanded willard curiously somehow it seems so foreign to your character  i suppose you think i am a perfect crank said miss sally sighing well ill tell you why i dont trust men i have a very good reason for it a man broke my heart and embittered my life ive never spoken about it to a living soul but if you want to hear about it you shall  miss sally sat down on the second step of the stairs and tucked her wet handkerchief away she clasped her slender white hands over her knee in spite of her silvery hair and the little lines on her face she looked girlish and youthful there was a pink flush on her cheeks and her big black eyes sparkled with the anger her memories aroused in her  i was a young girl of twenty when i met him she said and i was just as foolish as all young girls arefoolish and romantic and sentimental he was very handsome and i thought himbut there i wont go into that it vexes me to recall my folly but i loved himyes i did with all my heartwith all there was of me to love he made me love him he deliberately set himself to win my love for a whole summer he flirted with me i didnt know he was flirtingi thought him in earnest oh i was such a little fooland so happy thenhe went away went away suddenly without even a word of goodbye but he had been summoned home by his fathers serious illness and i thought he would writei waitedi hoped i never heard from himnever saw him again he had tired of his plaything and flung it aside that is all concluded miss sally passionately i never trusted any man again when my sister died and gave me her baby i determined to bring the dear child up safely training her to avoid the danger i had fallen into well ive failed but perhaps it will be all rightperhaps there are some men who are true though stephen merritt was false  stephenwho demanded willard abruptly miss sally coloured  i didnt mean to tell you his name she said getting up it was a slip of the tongue never mindforget it and him he was not worthy of remembranceand yet i do remember him i cant forget himand i hate him all the more for itfor having entered so deeply into my life that i could not cast him out when i knew him unworthy it is humiliating therelet us lock up eden and go home i suppose you are dying to see joyce and tell her your precious plot has succeeded  willard did not appear to be at all impatient he had relapsed into a brown study during which he let miss sally lock up the house then he walked silently home with her miss sally was silent too perhaps she was repenting her confidenceor perhaps she was thinking of her false lover there was a pathetic droop to her lips and her black eyes were sad and dreamy  miss sally said willard at last as they neared her house had stephen merritt any sisters  miss sally threw him a puzzled glance  he had onejean merrittwhom i disliked and who disliked me she said crisply i dont want to talk of hershe was the only woman i ever hated i never met any of the other members of his familyhis home was in a distant part of the state  willard stayed with joyce so brief a time that miss sally viewed his departure with suspicion this was not very loverlike conduct  i dare say hes like all the restwhen his aim is attained the prize loses its value reflected miss sally pessimistically poor joycepoor child but therethere isnt a single inharmonious thing in his housethat is one comfort im so thankful i didnt let willard buy those brocade chairs he wanted they would have given joyce the nightmare  meanwhile willard rushed down to the biological station and from there drove furiously to the station to catch the evening express he did not return until three days later when he appeared at miss sallys dusty and triumphant  joyce is out said miss sally  im glad of it said willard recklessly its you i want to see miss sally i have something to show you ive been all the way home to get it  from his pocketbook willard drew something folded and creased and yellow that looked like a letter he opened it carefully and holding it in his fingers looked over it at miss sally  my grandmothers maiden name was jean merritt he said deliberately and stephen merritt was my greatuncle i never saw himhe died when i was a childbut ive heard my father speak of him often  miss sally turned very pale she passed her cobwebby handkerchief across her lips and her hand trembled willard went on  my uncle never married he and his sister jean lived together until her late marriage i was not very fond of my grandmother she was a selfish domineering womanvery unlike the grandmother of tradition when she died everything she possessed came to me as my father her only child was then dead in looking over a box of old papers i found a letteran old love letter i read it with some interest wondering whose it could be and how it came among grandmothers private letters it was signed stephen so that i guessed my greatuncle had been the writer but i had no idea who the sally was to whom it was written until the other day then i knew it was youand i went home to bring you your letterthe letter you should have received long ago why you did not receive it i cannot explain i fear that my grandmother must have been to blame for thatshe must have intercepted and kept the letter in order to part her brother and you in so far as i can i wish to repair the wrong she has done you i know it can never be repairedbut at least i think this letter will take the bitterness out of the memory of your lover  he dropped the letter in miss sallys lap and went away  pale miss sally picked it up and read it it was from stephen merritt to dearest sally and contained a frank manly avowal of love would she be his wife if she would let her write and tell him so but if she did not and could not love him let her silence reveal the bitter fact he would wish to spare her the pain of putting her refusal into words and if she did not write he would understand that she was not for him  when willard and joyce came back into the twilight room they found miss sally still sitting by the table her head leaning pensively on her hand she had been cryingthe cobwebby handkerchief lay beside her wrecked and ruined foreverbut she looked very happy  i wonder if you know what you have done for me she said to willard but noyou cant knowyou cant realize it fully it means everything to me you have taken away my humiliation and restored to me my pride of womanhood he really loved mehe was not falsehe was what i believed him to be nothing else matters to me at all now oh i am very happybut it would never have been if i had not consented to give you joyce  she rose and took their hands in hers joining them  god bless you dears she said softly i believe you will be happy and that your love for each other will always be true and faithful and tender willard i give you my dear child in perfect trust and confidence  with her yellowed love letter clasped to her heart and a raptured shining in her eyes miss sally went out of the room     my lady jane   the boat got into broughton half an hour after the train had gone we had been delayed by some small accident to the machinery hence that lost halfhour which meant a nights sojourn for me in broughton i am ashamed of the things i thought and said when i think that fate might have taken me at my word and raised up a special train or some such miracle by which i might have got away from broughton that night i experience a cold chill out of gratitude i have never sworn over missing connections since  at the time however i felt thoroughly exasperated i was in a hurry to get on important business engagements would be unhinged by the delay i was a stranger in broughton it looked like a stupid stuffy little town i went to a hotel in an atrocious humor after i had fumed until i wanted a change it occurred to me that i might as well hunt up clark oliver by way of passing the time i had never been overly fond of clark oliver although he was my cousin he was a bit of a cad and stupider than anyone belonging to our family had a right to be moreover he was in politics and i detest politics but i rather wanted to see if he looked as much like me as he used to i hadnt seen him for three years and i hoped that the time might have differentiated us to a saving degree it was over a year since i had last been blown up by some unknown excited individual on the ground that i was that scoundrel oliverpolitically speaking i thought that was a good omen  i went to clarks office found he had left and followed him to his rooms the minute i saw him i experienced the same nasty feeling of lost or bewildered individuality which always overcame me in his presence he was so absurdly like me i felt as if i were looking into a mirror where my reflection persisted in doing things i didnt do thereby producing a most uncanny sensation  clark pretended he was glad to see me he really couldnt have been because his great idea hadnt struck him then and we had always disliked each other  hello elliott he said shaking me by the hand with a twist he had learned in election campaigns whereby something like heartiness was simulated glad to see you old fellow gad youre as like me as ever where did you drop from  i explained my predicament and we talked amiably and harmlessly for awhile about family gossip i abhor family gossip but it is a shade better than politics and those two subjects are the only ones on which clark can converse at all i described mary alices wedding and florences new young man and tomandkates twins clark tried to be interested but i saw he had something on what serves him for a mind after awhile it came out he looked at his watch with a frown  im in a bit of a puzzle he said the mark kennedys are giving a dinner tonight you dont know them of course theyre the big people of broughton kennedy runs the politics of the place and mrs k makes or mars people socially its my first invitation there and its necessary i should accept itnecessary every way mrs k would never forgive me if i disappointed her at the last moment not that i personally am of much accountyetto her but it would leave a vacant place mrs k would never notice me again and as she bosses kennedy i cant afford to offend her besides theres a girl wholl be there ive met her once i want to meet her again shes a beauty and no mistake toplofty as they make em though however i think ive made an impression on her it was at the harveys dance last week she was the handsomest woman there and she never took her eyes off me ive given mrs kennedy a pretty broad hint that i want to take her in to dinner if i dont go ill miss all round  well what is there to prevent you from going i asked squiffily i never could endure the way clark talked about girls and hinted at his conquests  just this herbert bronson came to town this afternoon and is leaving on the 1030 train tonight hes sent me word to meet him at his hotel this evening and talk over a mining deal ive been trying to pull off i simply must go its my one chance to corral bronson if i lose him itll be all up and ill be thousands out of pocket  well you are in rather a predicament i agreed with the philosophical acceptance of the situation that marks the outsider i wasnt hampered by the multiplicity of my business and social engagements that evening so i could afford to pity clark it is always rather nice to be able to pity a person you dislike  i should say so i cant make up my mind what to do hang it ill have to see bronson theres no question about that a man ought to keep an understood substitute on hand to send to dinners when he cant go by jove elliott  clarks great idea had arrived he bounced up eagerly  elliott will you go to the kennedys in my place theyll never know the difference do nowtheres a good fellow  nonsense i said  it isnt nonsense the resemblance between us was foreordained for this hour ill lend you my dress suititll fit youyour figure is as much like mine as your face youve nothing to do with yourself this evening i offer you a good dinner and an agreeable partner come now to oblige me you know you owe me a good turn for that mulhenen business  the mulhenen business clinched the matter until he mentioned it i had no notion whatever of masquerading as clark oliver at the kennedys dinner but as clark so delicately put it he had done me a good turn in that affair and the obligation had rankled ever since it is beastly to be indebted for a favor to a man you detest now was my chance to pay it off and i took it without more ado  but i said doubtfully i dont know the kennedysnor any of the social stunts that are doing in broughton i wont dare to talk about anything and ill seem so stupid even if i dont actually make some irremediable blunder that the kennedys will be disgusted with you it will probably do your prospects more harm than your absence would  not at all keep your mouth shut when you can and talk generalities when you cant and youll pass if you take that girl in shes a stranger in broughton and wont suspect your ignorance of whats going on nobody will suspect you nobody here knows i have a cousin so like me our own mothers havent always been able to tell us apart our very voices are alike come now get into my dinner togs you havent much time and mrs k doesnt like late comers  there seemed to be a number of things that mrs kennedy did not like i thought my chance of pleasing that critical lady extremely small especially when i had to live up to clark olivers personality however i dressed as expeditiously as possible the novelty of the adventure rather pleased me i always liked doing unusual things anything was better than lounging away the evening at my hotel it couldnt do any harm i owed clark oliver a good turn and i would save mrs kennedy the annoyance of a vacant chair  there was no disputing the fact that i looked most disgustingly like clark when i got into his clothes i actually felt a grudge against them for their excellent fit  youll do said clark remember youre a conservative tonight and dont let your rank liberal views crop out or youll queer me for all time with the great and only mark he doesnt talk politics at his dinners though so youre not likely to have trouble on that score mrs kennedy has a weakness for beer mugs her collection is considered very fine scandal whispers that miss harvey has a budding interest in settlement work  miss who i said sharply  harvey christian name unknown thats the girl i mentioned youll probably take her in be nice to her even if you have to make an effort shes the one ive picked out as your future cousin you know so i dont want you to spoil her good opinion of me in any way  the name had given me a jump once in another world i had known a jane harvey but clarks miss harvey couldnt be jane a month before i had read a newspaper item to the effect that jane was on the pacific coast moreover jane when i knew her had certainly no manifest vocation for settlement work i didnt think two years could have worked such a transformation two years was it only two years it seemed more like two centuries  i went to the kennedys in a pleasantly excited frame of mind and a cab i just missed being late by a hairbreadth the house was a big one and everybody pertaining to it was big except the host mark kennedy was a little thin man with a bald head he didnt look like a political power but that was all the more reason for his being one in a world where things are not what they seem  mrs kennedy greeted me cordially and told me significantly that she had granted my request this meant as my card had already informed me that i was to take miss harvey out of course there would be no introduction since clark oliver was already acquainted with the lady i was wondering how i was to locate her when i got a shock that made me dizzy jane was over in a corner looking at me  there was no time to collect my wits the guests were moving out to the diningroom i took my nerve in my hand crossed the room bowed and the next moment was walking through the hall with janes hand on my arm the hall was a good long one i blessed the architect who had planned it it gave me time to sort out my ideas  jane here jane going out to dinner with me believing me to be clark oliver janebut it was incredible the whole thing was a dreamor i had gone crazy  i looked at her sideways when we had got into our places at the table she was more beautiful than ever that tall brownhaired disdainful jane the settlement work story i was inclined to dismiss as a myth settlement work in a beautiful woman generally means crowsfeet or a broken heart jane according to my sight and belief possessed neither  once upon a time i had been engaged to jane i had been idiotically in love with her in those days and still more idiotically believed that she loved me the trouble was that although i had been cured of the latter phase of my idiocy the former had become chronic i had never been able to get over loving jane all through those two years i had hugged the fond hope that sometime i might stumble across her in a mild mood and make matters up there was no such thing as seeking her out or writing to her since she had icily forbidden me to do so and jane had a most detestable habitin a womanof meaning what she said but the deity i had invoked was the god of chanceand this was how he had answered my prayers i was eating my dinner beside jane who supposed me to be clark oliver  what should i do confess the truth and plead my cause while she had to sit beside me that would never do someone might overhear us and in any case it would be no passport to janes favor that i was a guest in the house under false pretences she would be certain to disapprove strongly it was a maddening situation  jane who was calmly eating soupshe was the only woman i had ever seen who could eat soup and look like a goddess at the same timeglanced around and caught me studying her profile i thought she blushed slightly and i raged inwardly to think that blush was meant for clark oliverclark oliver who had told me he thought jane was smitten on him jane on him  do you know mr oliver said jane slowly that you are startlingly like aa person i used to know when i first saw you the other night i took you for him  a person you used to know oh jane that was the most unkindest cut of all  my cousin elliott cameron i suppose i answered as indifferently as i could we resemble each other very closely you were acquainted with cameron miss harvey  slightly said jane  a fine fellow i said unblushingly  ah said jane  my favorite relative i went on brazenly hes a thoroughly good sortrather dull now to what he used to be though he had an unfortunate love affair two years ago and has never got over it  indeed said jane coldly crumbling a bit of bread between her fingers her face was expressionless and her voice ditto but i had heard her criticize nervous people who did things like that at table  i fear poor elliotts life has been completely spoiled i said with a sigh its a shame  did he confide the affair to you asked jane a little scornfully  well after a fashion he said enough for me to guess the rest he never told me the ladys name she was very beautiful i understand and very heartless oh she used him very badly  did he tell you that too asked jane  not he he wont listen to a word against her but a chap can draw his own conclusions you know  what went wrong between them asked jane she smiled at a lady across the table as if she were merely asking questions to make conversation but she went on crumbling bread  simply a very stiff quarrel i believe elliott never went into details the lady was flirting with somebody else i fancy  people have such different ideas about flirting said jane languidly what one would call mere simple friendliness another construes into flirting possibly your friendor is it your cousinis one of those men who become insanely jealous over every trifle and attempt to exert authority before they have any to exert a woman of spirit would hardly fail to resent that  of course elliott was jealous i admitted but then you know miss harvey that jealousy is said to be the measure of a mans love if he went beyond his rights i am sure he is bitterly sorry for it  does he really care about her still asked jane eating most industriously although somehow the contents of her plate did hot grow noticeably less as for me i didnt pretend to eat i simply pecked  he loves her with all his heart i answered fervently there never has been and never will be any other woman for elliott cameron  why doesnt he go and tell her so inquired jane as if she felt rather bored over the whole subject  he doesnt dare to she forbade him ever to cross her path again told him she hated him and always would hate him as long as she lived  she must have been an unpleasantly emphatic young woman commented jane  id like to hear anyone say so to elliott i responded he considers her perfection im sorry for elliott his life is wrecked  do you know said jane slowly as if poking about in the recesses of her memory for something half forgotten i believe i know thethe girl in question  really i said  yes she is a friend of mine sheshe never told me his name but putting two and two together i believe it must have been your cousin but sheshe thinks she was the one to blame  does she it was my turn to ask questions now but my heart thumped so that i could hardly speak  yes she says she was too hasty and unreasonable she didnt mean to flirt at alland she never cared for anyone buthim but his jealousy irritated her i suppose she said things to him she didnt really mean sheshe never supposed he was going to take her at her word  do you think she cares for him still considering what was at stake i think i asked the question very well  i think she must said jane languidly she has never looked at any other man she devotes most of her time to charitable work but i feel sure she isnt really happy  so the settlement story was true oh jane  what would you advise my cousin to do i asked do you think he should go boldly to her would she listen to himforgive him  she might said jane  have i your permission to tell elliott cameron this i demanded  jane selected and ate an olive with maddening deliberation  i suppose you mayif you are really convinced that he wants to hear it she said at last as if barely recollecting that i had asked the question two minutes previously  ill tell him as soon as i go home i said  i had the satisfaction of startling jane at last she turned her head and looked at me i got a good square satisfying gaze into her big blackishblue eyes  yes i said compelling myself to look away he came in on the boat this afternoon too late for his train has to stay over till tomorrow night i left him in my rooms when i came away doubtless tomorrow will see him speeding recklessly to his dear divinity i wonder if he knows where she is at present  if he doesnt said jane with the air of dismissing the subject once and forever from her mind i can give him the information you may tell him im staying with the duncan moores and shall be leaving day after tomorrow by the way have you seen mrs kennedys collection of steins it is a remarkably fine one  clark oliver couldnt come to our weddingor wouldnt jane has never met him since but she cannot understand why i have such an aversion to him especially when he has such a good opinion of me she says she thought him charming and one of the most interesting conversationalists she ever went out to dinner with     robert turners revenge   when robert turner came to the green ferny triangle where the station road forked to the right and left under the birches he hesitated as to which direction he would take the left led out to the old turner homestead where he had spent his boyhood and where his cousin still lived the right led down to the cove shore where the jameson property was situated since he had stopped off at chiswick for the purpose of looking this property over before foreclosing the mortgage on it he concluded that he might as well take the cove road he could go around by the shore afterwardhe had not forgotten the way even in forty yearsand so on up through the old spruce wood in alec martins fieldif the spruces were there still and the field still alec martinsto his cousins place he would just about have time to make the round before the early country supper hour then a brief visit with tomtom had always been a good sort of a fellow although woefully dull and slowgoingand the evening express for montreal he swung with a businesslike stride into the cove road  as he went on however the stride insensibly slackened into an unaccustomed saunter how well he remembered that old road although it was forty years since he had last traversed it a setlipped boy of fifteen cast on the world by the indifference of an uncle the years had made surprisingly little difference in it or in the surrounding scenery true the hills and fields and lanes seemed lower and smaller and narrower than he remembered them there were some new houses along the road and the belt of woods along the back of the farms had become thinner in most places but that was all he had no difficulty in picking out the old familiar spots there was the big cherry orchard on the milligan place which had been so famous in his boyhood it was snowwhite with blossoms as if the trees were possessed of eternal youth they had been in blossom the last time he had seen them well time had not stood still with him as it had with luke milligans cherry orchard he reflected grimly his springtime had long gone by  the few people he met on the road looked at him curiously for strangers were not commonplace in chiswick he recognized some of the older among them but none of them knew him he had been an awkward longlimbed lad with fresh boyish colour and crisp black curls when he had left chiswick he returned to it a somewhat portly figure of a man with closecropped grizzled hair and a face that looked as if it might be carved out of granite so immobile and unyielding it wasthe face of a man who never faltered or wavered who stuck at nothing that might advance his plans and purposes a face known and dreaded in the business world where he reigned master it was a cold hard selfish face but the face of the boy of forty years ago had been neither cold nor hard nor selfish  presently the homesteads and orchard lands grew fewer and then ceased altogether the fields were long and lowlying sloping down to the misty blue rim of sea a turn of the road brought him in sudden sight of the cove and there below him was the old jameson homestead built almost within wavelap of the pebbly shore and shut away into a lonely grey world of its own by the sea and sands and those long slopes of tenantless fields  he paused at the sagging gate that opened into the long deeprutted lane and folding his arms on it looked earnestly and scrutinizingly over the buildings they were grey and faded lacking the prosperous appearance that had characterized them once there was an air of failure about the whole place as if the very land had become disheartened and discouraged  long ago neil jameson senior had been a welltodo man the big cove farm had been one of the best in chiswick then as for neil jameson junior robert turners face always grew something grimmer when he recalled himthe one person boy and man whom he had really hated in the world they had been enemies from childhood and once in a bout of wrestling at the chiswick school neil had thrown him by an unfair trick and taunted him continually thereafter on his defeat robert had made a compact with himself that some day he would pay neil jameson back he had not forgotten ithe never forgot such thingsbut he had never seen or heard of neil jameson after leaving chiswick he might have been dead for anything robert turner knew then when john kesley failed and his effects turned over to his creditors of whom robert turner was the chief a mortgage on the cove farm at chiswick owned by neil jameson had been found among his assets inquiry revealed the fact that neil jameson was dead and that the farm was run by his widow turner felt a pang of disappointment what satisfaction was there in wreaking revenge on a dead man but at least his wife and children should suffer that debt of his to jameson for an illwon victory and many a sneer must be paid in full if not to him why then to his heirs  his lawyers reported that mrs jameson was two years behind with her interest turner instructed them to foreclose the mortgage promptly then he took it into his head to revisit chiswick and have a good look at the cove farm and other places he knew so well he had a notion that it might be a decent place to spend a summer month or two in his wife went to seaside and mountain resorts but he liked something quieter there was good fishing at the cove and in chiswick pond as he remembered if he liked the farm as well as his memory promised him he would do he would bid it in himself it would make neil jameson turn in his grave if the penniless lad he had jeered at came into the possession of his old ancestral property that had been owned by a jameson for over one hundred years there was a flavour in such a revenge that pleased robert turner he smiled one of his occasional grim smiles over it when robert turner smiled weather prophets of the business sky foretold squalls  presently he opened the gate and went through halfway down the lane forked one branch going over to the house the other slanting across the field to the cove turner took the latter and soon found himself on the grey shore where the waves were tumbling in creamy foam just as he remembered them long ago nothing about the old cove had changed he walked around a knobby headland weatherworn with the wind and spray of years which cut him off from sight of the jameson house and sat down on a rock he thought himself alone and was annoyed to find a boy sitting on the opposite ledge with a book on his knee  the lad lifted his eyes and looked turner over with a clear direct gaze he was about twelve years old tall for his age slight with a delicate clearcut facea face that was oddly familiar to turner although he was sure he had never seen it before the boy had oval cheeks finely tinted with colour big shy blue eyes quilled about with long black lashes and silverygolden hair lying over his head in soft ringlets like a girls what girls something far back in robert turners dreamlike boyhood seemed to call to him like a note of a forgotten melody sweet yet stirring like a pain the more he looked at the boy the stronger the impression of a resemblance grew in every feature but the mouth that was alien to his recollection of the face yet there was something about it when taken by itself that seemed oddly familiar alsoyes and unpleasantly familiar although the mouth was a good onefinely cut and possessing more firmness than was found in all the other features put together  its a good place for reading sonny isnt it he inquired more genially than he had spoken to a child for years in fact having no children of his own he so seldom spoke to a child that his voice and manner when he did so were generally awkward and rusty  the boy nodded a quick little nod somehow turner had expected that nod and the glimmer of a smile that accompanied it  what book are you reading he asked  the boy held it out it was an old robinson crusoe that classic of boyhood  its splendid he said billy martin lent it to me and i have to finish it today because ned josephs is to have it next and hes in a hurry for it  its a good while since i read robinson crusoe said turner reflectively but when i did it was on this very shore a little further along below the miller place there was a martin and a josephs in the partnership then toothe fathers i dare say of billy and ned what is your name my boy  paul jameson sir  the name was a shock to turner this boy a jamesonneil jamesons son why yes he had neils mouth strange he had nothing else in common with the blackbrowed blackhaired jamesons what business had a jameson with those blue eyes and silverygolden curls it was flagrant forgery on natures part to fashion such things and label them jameson by a mouth  hated neil jamesons son robert turners face grew so grey and hard that the boy involuntarily glanced upward to see if a cloud had crossed the sun  your father was neil jameson i suppose turner said abruptly  paul nodded yes but he is dead he has been dead for eight years i dont remember him  have you any brothers or sisters  i have a little sister a year younger than i am the other four are dead they died long ago im the only boy mother had oh i do so wish i was bigger and older if i was i could do something to save the placeim sure i could it is breaking mothers heart to have to leave it  so she has to leave it has she said turner grimly with the old hatred stirring in his heart  yes there is a mortgage on it and were to be sold out very soonso the lawyers told us mother has tried so hard to make the farm pay but she couldnt i could if i was biggeri know i could if they would only wait a few years but there is no use hoping for that mother cries all the time about it she has lived at the cove farm for over thirty years and she says she cant live away from it now elsiethats my sisterand i do all we can to cheer her up but we cant do much oh if i was only a man  the lad shut his lips togetherhow much his mouth was like his fathersand looked out seaward with troubled blue eyes turner smiled another grim smile oh neil jameson your old score was being paid now  yet something embittered the sweetness of revenge that boys facehe could not hate it as he had accustomed himself to hate the memory of neil jameson and all connected with him  what was your mothers name before she married your father he demanded abruptly  lisbeth miller answered the boy still frowning seaward over his secret thoughts  turner started again lisbeth miller he might have known it what woman in all the world save lisbeth miller could have given her son those eyes and curls so lisbeth had married neil jamesonlittle lisbeth miller his schoolboy sweetheart he had forgotten heror thought he had certainly he had not thought of her for years but the memory of her came back now with a rush  little lisbethpretty little lisbethmerry little lisbeth how clearly he remembered her the old miller place had adjoined his uncles farm lisbeth and he had played together from babyhood how he had worshipped her when they were six years old they had solemnly promised to marry each other when they grew up and lisbeth had let him kiss her as earnest of their compact made under a bloomwhite apple tree in the miller orchard yet she would always blush furiously and deny it ever afterwards it made her angry to be reminded of it  he saw himself going to school carrying her books for her the envied of all the boys he remembered how he had fought tony josephs because tony had the presumption to bring her spice apples he had thrashed him too so soundly that from that time forth none of the schoolboys presumed to rival him in lisbeths affectionsroguish little lisbeth who grew prettier and saucier every year  he recalled the keen competition of the old days when to be head of the class seemed the highest honour within mortal reach and was striven after with might and main he had seldom attained to it because he would never go up past lisbeth if she missed a word he robert missed it too no matter how well he knew it it was sweet to be thought a dunce for her dear sake it was all the reward he asked to see her holding her place at the head of the class her cheeks flushed pink and her eyes starry with her pride of position and how sweetly she would lecture him on the way home from school about learning his spellings better and wind up her sermon with the frank avowal uttered with deliciously downcast lids that she liked him better than any of the other boys after all even if he couldnt spell as well as they could nothing of success that he had won since had ever thrilled him as that admission of little lisbeths  she had been such a sympathetic little sweetheart too never weary of listening to his dreams and ambitions his plans for the future she had always assured him that she knew he would succeed well he had succeededand now one of the uses he was going to make of his success was to turn lisbeth and her children out of their home by way of squaring matters with a dead man  lisbeth had been away from home on a long visit to an aunt when he had left chiswick she was growing up and the childish intimacy was fading perhaps under other circumstances it might have ripened into fruit but he had gone away and forgotten her the world had claimed him he had lost all active remembrance of lisbeth and before this late return to chiswick he had not even known if she were living and she was neil jamesons widow  he was silent for a long time while the waves purred about the base of the big red sandstone rock and the boy returned to his crusoe finally robert turner roused himself from his reverie  i used to know your mother long ago when she was a little girl he said i wonder if she remembers me ask her when you go home if she remembers bobby turner  wont you come up to the house and see her sir asked paul politely mother is always glad to see her old friends  no i havent time today robert turner was not going to tell neil jamesons son that he did not care to look for the little lisbeth of long ago in neil jamesons widow the name spoiled her for him just as the jameson mouth spoiled her son for him but you may tell her something else the mortgage will not be foreclosed i was the power behind the lawyers but i did not know that the present owner of the cove farm was my little playmate lisbeth miller you and she shall have all the time you want tell her bobby turner does this in return for what she gave him under the big sweeting apple tree on her sixth birthday i think she will remember and understand as for you paul be a good boy and good to your mother i hope youll succeed in your ambition of making the farm pay when you are old enough to take it in hand at any rate youll not be disturbed in your possession of it  oh sir oh sir stammered paul in an agony of embarrassed gratitude and delight oh it seems too good to be true do you really mean that were not to be sold out oh wont you come and tell mother yourself shell be so happyso grateful do come and let her thank you  not today i havent time give her my message thats all there run the sooner she gets the news the better  turner watched the boy as he bounded away until the headland hid him from sight  there goes my revengeand a fine bit of property eminently suited for a summer residenceall for a bit of old rusty sentiment he said with a shrug i didnt suppose i was capable of such a mood but thenlittle lisbeth there never was a sweeter girl im glad i didnt go with the boy to see her shes an old woman nowand neil jamesons widow i prefer to keep my old memories of her undisturbedlittle lisbeth of the silverygolden curls and the roguish blue eyes little lisbeth of the old time im glad to be able to have done you the small service of securing your home to you it is my thanks to you for the friendship and affection you gave my lonely boyhoodmy tribute to the memory of my first sweetheart  he walked away with a smile whose amusement presently softened to an expression that would have amazed his business cronies later on he hummed the air of an old love song as he climbed the steep spruce road to toms     the fillmore elderberries   i expected as much said timothy robinson his tone brought the blood into ellis duncans face the lad opened his lips quickly as if for an angry retort but as quickly closed them again with a set firmness oddly like timothy robinsons own  when i heard that lazy worthless father of yours was dead i expected you and your mother would be looking to me for help timothy robinson went on harshly but youre mistaken if you think ill give it youve no claim on me even if your father was my halfbrotherno claim at all and im not noted for charity  timothy robinson smiled grimly it was very true that he was far from being noted for charity his neighbours called him close and near some even went so far as to call him a miserly skinflint but this was not true it was however undeniable that timothy robinson kept a tight clutch on his pursestrings and although he sometimes gave liberally enough to any cause which really appealed to him such causes were few and far between  i am not asking for charity uncle timothy said ellis quietly he passed over the slur at his father in silence deeply as he felt it for alas he knew that it was only too true i expect to support my mother by hard and honest work and i am not asking you for work on the ground of our relationship i heard you wanted a hired man and i have come to you as i should have gone to any other man about whom i had heard it to ask you to hire me  yes i do want a man said uncle timothy drily a mannot a halfgrown boy of fourteen not worth his salt i want somebody able and willing to work  again ellis flushed deeply and again he controlled himself i am willing to work uncle timothy and i think you would find me able also if you would try me id work for less than a mans wages at first of course  you wont work for any sort of wages from me interrupted timothy robinson decidedly i tell you plainly that i wont hire you youre the wrong mans son for that your father was lazy and incompetent and worst of all untrustworthy i did try to help him once and all i got was loss and ingratitude i want none of his kind around my place i dont believe in you so you may as well take yourself off ellis ive no more time to waste  ellis took himself off his ears tingling as he walked homeward his thoughts were very bitter all uncle timothy had said about his father was true and ellis realized what a count it was against him in his efforts to obtain employment nobody wanted to be bothered with old sam duncans son though nobody had been so brutally outspoken as his uncle timothy  sam duncan and timothy robinson had been halfbrothers sam the older had been the son of mrs robinsons former marriage never were two lads more dissimilar sam was a lazy shiftless fellow deserving all the hard things that came to be said of him he would not work and nobody could depend on him but he was a handsome lad with rather taking ways in his youth and at first people had liked him better than the close blunt industrious timothy their mother had died in their childhood but mr robinson had been fond of sam and the boy had a good home when he was twentytwo and timothy eighteen mr robinson had died very suddenly leaving no will everything he possessed went to timothy sam immediately left he said he would not stay there to be bossed by timothy  he rented a little house in the village married a girl far too good for him and started in to support himself and his wife by days work he had lounged borrowed and shirked through life once timothy robinson perhaps moved by pity for sams wife and baby had hired him for a year at better wages than most hired men received in dalrymple sam idled through a month of it then got offended and left in the middle of haying timothy robinson washed his hands of him after that  when ellis was fourteen sam duncan died after a lingering illness of a year during this time the family were kept by the charity of pitying neighbours for ellis could not be spared from attendance on his father to make any attempt at earning money mrs duncan was a fragile little woman worn out with her hard life and not strong enough to wait on her husband alone  when sam duncan was dead and buried ellis straightened his shoulders and took counsel with himself he must earn a livelihood for his mother and himself and he must begin at once he was tall and strong for his age and had a fairly good education his mother having determinedly kept him at school when he had pleaded to be allowed to go to work he had always been a quiet fellow and nobody in dalrymple knew much about him but they knew all about his father and nobody would hire ellis unless he were willing to work for a pittance that would barely clothe him  ellis had not gone to his uncle timothy until he had lost all hope of getting a place elsewhere now this hope too had gone it was nearly the end of june and everybody who wanted help had secured it look where he would ellis could see no prospect of employment  if i could only get a chance he thought miserably i know i am not idle or lazyi know i can workif i could get a chance to prove it  he was sitting on the fence of the fillmore elderberry pasture as he said it having taken a short cut across the fields this pasture was rather noted in dalrymple originally a mellow and fertile field it had been almost ruined by a persistent luxuriant growth of elderberry bushes old thomas fillmore had at first tried to conquer them by mowing them down in the dark of the moon but the elderberries did not seem to mind either moon or mowing and flourished alike in all the quarters for the past two years old thomas had given up the contest and the elderberries had it all their own sweet way  thomas fillmore a bent old man with a shrewd nutcracker face came through the bushes while ellis was sitting on the fence  howdy ellis seen anything of my spotted calves ive been looking for em for over an hour  no i havent seen any calvesbut a good many might be in this pasture without being visible to the naked eye said ellis with a smile  old thomas shook his head ruefully them elders have been too many for me he said did you ever see a worselooking place youd hardly believe that twenty years ago there wasnt a better piece of land in dalrymple than this lot would ye such grass as grew here  the soil must be as good as ever if anything had a chance to grow on it said ellis couldnt those elders be rooted out  itd be a backbreaking job but i reckon it could be done if anyone had the muscle and patience and time to tackle it i havent the first at my age and my hired man hasnt the last and nobody would do it for what i could afford to pay  what will you give me if i undertake to clean the elders out of this field for you mr fillmore asked ellis quietly  old thomas looked at him with a surprised face which gradually reverted to its original shrewdness when he saw that ellis was in earnest you must be hard up for a job he said  i am was elliss laconic answer  well lemme see old thomas calculated carefully he never paid a cent more for anything than he could help and was noted for hard bargaining ill give ye sixteen dollars if you clean out the whole field he said at length  ellis looked at the pasture he knew something about cleaning out elderberry brush and he also knew that sixteen dollars would be very poor pay for it most of the elders were higher than a mans head with big roots thicker than his wrist running deep into the ground  its worth more mr fillmore he said  not to me responded old thomas drily ive plenty more land and im an old fellow without any sons i aint going to pay out money for the benefit of some stranger wholl come after me you can take it or leave it at sixteen dollars  ellis shrugged his shoulders he had no prospect of anything else and sixteen dollars were better than nothing very well ill take it he said  well now look here said old thomas shrewdly ill expect you to do the work thoroughly young man them roots aint to be cut off remember theyll have to be dug out and ill expect you to finish the job if you undertake it too and not drop it halfway through if you get a chance for a better one  ill finish with your elderberries before i leave them promised ellis                                       ellis went to work the next day his first move was to chop down all the brush and cart it into heaps for burning this took two days and was comparatively easy work the third day ellis tackled the roots by the end of the forenoon he had discovered just what cleaning out an elderberry pasture meant but he set his teeth and resolutely persevered during the afternoon timothy robinson whose farm adjoined the fillmore place wandered by and halted with a look of astonishment at the sight of ellis busily engaged in digging and tearing out huge tough stubborn elder roots the boy did not see his uncle but worked away with a vim and vigour that were not lost on the latter  he never got that muscle from sam reflected timothy sam would have fainted at the mere thought of stumping elders perhaps ive been mistaken in the boy well well well see if he holds out  ellis did hold out the elderberries tried to hold out too but they were no match for the lads perseverance it was a hard piece of work however and ellis never forgot it week after week he toiled in the hot summer sun digging cutting and dragging out roots the job seemed endless and his progress each day was discouragingly slow he had expected to get through in a month but he soon found it would take two frequently timothy robinson wandered by and looked at the increasing pile of roots and the slowly extending stretch of cleared land but he never spoke to ellis and made no comment on the matter to anybody  one evening when the field was about half done ellis went home more than usually tired it had been a very hot day every bone and muscle in him ached he wondered dismally if he would ever get to the end of that wretched elderberry field when he reached home jacob green from westdale was there jacob lost no time in announcing his errand  my hired boys broke his leg and i must fill his place right off somebody referred me to you guess ill try you twelve dollars a month board and lodging what say  for a moment elliss face flushed with delight twelve dollars a month and permanent employment then he remembered his promise to mr fillmore for a moment he struggled with the temptation then he mastered it perhaps the discipline of his many encounters with those elderberry roots helped him to do so  im sorry mr green he said reluctantly id like to go but i cant i promised mr fillmore that id finish cleaning up his elderberry pasture when id once begun it and i shant be through for a month yet  well id see myself turning down a good offer for old tom fillmore said jacob green  it isnt for mr fillmoreits for myself said ellis steadily i promised and i must keep my word  jacob drove away grumblingly on the road he met timothy robinson and stopped to relate his grievances                                       it must be admitted that there were times during the next month when ellis was tempted to repent having refused jacob greens offer but at the end of the month the work was done and the fillmore elderberry pasture was an elderberry pasture no longer all that remained of the elders root and branch was piled into a huge heap ready for burning  and ill come up and set fire to it when its dry enough ellis told mr fillmore i claim the satisfaction of that  youve done the job thoroughly said old thomas theres your sixteen dollars and every cent of it was earned if ever money was ill say that much for you there aint a lazy bone in your body if you ever want a recommendation just you come to me  as ellis passed timothy robinsons place on the way home that worthy himself appeared strolling down his lane ah ellis he said speaking to his nephew for the first time since their interview two months before so youve finished with your job  yes sir  got your sixteen dollars i suppose it was worth four times that old tom cheated you you were foolish not to have gone to green when you had the chance  id promised mr fillmore to finish with his pasture sir  humph well what are you going to do now  i dont know harvest will be on next week i may get in somewhere as an extra hand for a spell  ellis said his uncle abruptly after a moments silence im going to discharge my man hes no earthly good will you take his place ill give you fifteen dollars a month and found  ellis stared at timothy robinson i thought you told me that you had no place for my fathers son he said slowly  ive changed my mind ive seen how you went at that elderberry job great snakes there couldnt be a better test for anybody than rooting out them things i know you can work when jacob green told me why youd refused his offer i knew you could be depended on you come to me and ill do well by you ive no kith or kin of my own except you and look here ellis im tired of hired housekeepers will your mother come up and live with us and look after things a bit ive a good girl and she wont have to work hard but there must be somebody at the head of a household she must have a good headpiecefor you have inherited good qualities from someone and goodness knows it wasnt from your father  uncle timothy said ellis respectfully but firmly ill accept your offer gratefully and i am sure mother will too but there is one thing i must say perhaps my father deserves all you say of himbut he is deadand if i come to you it must be with the understanding that nothing more is ever to be said against him  timothy robinson smileda queer twisted smile that yet had a hint of affection and comprehension in it very well he said ill never cast his shortcomings up to you again come to meand if i find you always as industrious and reliable as youve proved yourself to be negotiating them elders ill most likely forget that you aint my own son some of these days     the finished story   she always sat in a corner of the west veranda at the hotel knitting something white and fluffy or pink and fluffy or pale blue and fluffyalways fluffy at least and always dainty shawls and scarfs and hoods the things were i believe when she finished one she gave it to some girl and began another every girl at harbour light that summer wore some distracting thing that had been fashioned by miss sylvias slim tireless white fingers  she was old with that beautiful serene old age which is as beautiful in its way as youth her girlhood and womanhood must have been very lovely to have ripened into such a beauty of sixty years it was a surprise to everyone who heard her called miss sylvia she looked so like a woman who ought to have stalwart grown sons and dimpled little grandchildren  for the first two days after the arrival at the hotel she sat in her corner alone there was always a circle of young people around her old folks and middleaged people would have liked to join it but miss sylvia while she was gracious to all let it be distinctly understood that her sympathies were with youth she sat among the boys and girls young men and maidens like a fine white queen her dress was always the same and somewhat oldfashioned but nothing else would have suited her half so well she wore a lace cap on her snowy hair and a heliotrope shawl over her black silk shoulders she knitted continually and talked a good deal but listened more we sat around her at all hours of the day and told her everything  when you were first introduced to her you called her miss stanleymain her endurance of that was limited to twentyfour hours then she begged you to call her miss sylvia and as miss sylvia you spoke and thought of her forevermore  miss sylvia liked us all but i was her favourite she told us so frankly and let it be understood that when i was talking to her and her heliotrope shawl was allowed to slip under one arm it was a sign that we were not to be interrupted i was as vain of her favour as any lovelorn suitor whose lady had honoured him not knowing as i came to know later the reason for it  although miss sylvia had an unlimited capacity for receiving confidences she never gave any we were all sure that there must be some romance in her life but our efforts to discover it were unsuccessful miss sylvia parried tentative questions so skilfully that we knew she had something to defend but one evening when i had known her a month as time is reckoned and long years as affection and understanding are computed she told me her storyat least what there was to tell of it the last chapter was missing  we were sitting together on the veranda at sunset most of the hotel people had gone for a harbour sail a few forlorn mortals prowled about the grounds and eyed our corner wistfully but by the sign of the heliotrope shawl knew it was not for them  i was reading one of my stories to miss sylvia in my own excuse i must allege that she tempted me to do it i did not go around with manuscripts under my arm inflicting them on defenceless females but miss sylvia had discovered that i was a magazine scribbler and moreover that i had shut myself up in my room that very morning and perpetrated a short story nothing would do but that i read it to her  it was a rather sad little story the hero loved the heroine and she loved him there was no reason why he should not love her but there was a reason why he could not marry her when he found that he loved her he knew that he must go away but might he not at least tell her his love might he not at least find out for his consolation if she cared for him there was a struggle he won and went away without a word believing it to be the more manly course when i began to read miss sylvia was knitting a pale green something this time of the tender hue of young leaves in may but after a little her knitting slipped unheeded to her lap and her hands folded idly above it it was the most subtle compliment i had ever received  when i turned the last page of the manuscript and looked up miss sylvias soft brown eyes were full of tears she lifted her hands clasped them together and said in an agitated voice  oh no no dont let him go away without telling herjust telling her dont let him do it  but you see miss sylvia i explained flattered beyond measure that my characters had seemed so real to her that would spoil the story it would have no reason for existence then its motif is simply his mastery over self he believes it to be the nobler course  no no it wasntif he loved her he should have told her think of her shame and humiliationshe loved him and he went without a word and she could never know he cared for her oh you must change ityou must indeed i cannot bear to think of her suffering what i have suffered  miss sylvia broke down and sobbed to appease her i promised that i would remodel the story although i knew that the doing so would leave it absolutely pointless  oh im so glad said miss sylvia her eyes shining through her tears you see i know it would make her happieri know it im going to tell you my poor little story to convince you but youyou must not tell it to any of the others  i am sorry you think the admonition necessary i said reproachfully  oh i do not indeed i do not she hastened to assure me i know i can trust you but its such a poor little story you mustnt laugh at itit is all the romance i had years agoforty years agowhen i was a young girl of twenty ilearned to care very much for somebody i met him at a summer resort like this i was there with my aunt and he was there with his mother who was delicate we saw a great deal of each other for a little while he wasoh he was like no other man i had ever seen you remind me of him somehow that is partly why i like you so much i noticed the resemblance the first time i saw you i dont know in just what it consistsin your expression and the way you carry your head i think he was not stronghe coughed a good deal then one day he went awaysuddenly i had thought he cared for me but he never said sojust went away oh the shame of it after a time i heard that he had been ordered to california for his health and he died out there the next spring my heart broke then i never cared for anybody againi couldnt i have always loved him but it would have been so much easier to bear if i had only known that he loved meoh it would have made all the difference in the world and the sting of it has been there all these years i cant even permit myself the joy of dwelling on his memory because of the thought that perhaps he did not care  he must have cared i said warmly he couldnt have helped it miss sylvia  miss sylvia shook her head with a sad smile  i cannot be sure sometimes i think he did but then the doubt creeps back again i would give almost anything to know that he didto know that i have not lavished all the love of my life on a man who did not want it and i never can know neveri can hope and almost believe but i can never know oh you dont understanda man couldnt fully understand what my pain has been over it you see now why i want you to change the story i am sorry for that poor girl but if you only let her know that he really loves her she will not mind all the rest so very much she will be able to bear the pain of even lifelong separation if she only knows  miss sylvia picked up her knitting and went away as for me i thought savagely of the dead man she loved and called him a cad or at best a fool  next day miss sylvia was her serene smiling self once more and she did not again make any reference to what she had told me a fortnight later she returned home and i went my way back to the world during the following winter i wrote several letters to miss sylvia and received replies from her her letters were very like herself when i sent her the thirdrate magazine containing my storynothing but a thirdrate magazine would take it in its rewritten formshe wrote to say that she was so glad that i had let the poor girl know  early in april i received a letter from an aunt of mine in the country saying that she intended to sell her place and come to the city to live she asked me to go out to sweetwater for a few weeks and assist her in the business of settling up the estate and disposing of such things as she did not wish to take with her  when i arrived at sweetwater i found it moist and chill with the sunny moisture and teasing chill of our canadian springs they are long and fickle and reluctant these springs of ours but oh the unnamable charm of them there was something even in the red buds of the maples at sweetwater and in the long smoking stretches of hillside fields that sent a thrill through my veins finer and subtler than any given by old wine  a week after my arrival when we had got the larger affairs pretty well straightened out aunt mary suggested that i had better overhaul uncle alans room  the things there have never been meddled with since he died she said in particular theres an old trunk full of his letters and his papers it was brought home from california after his death ive never examined them i dont suppose there is anything of any importance among them but im not going to carry all that old rubbish to town so i wish you would look over them and see if there is anything that should be kept the rest may be burned  i felt no particular interest in the task my uncle alan blair was a mere name to me he was my mothers eldest brother and had died years before i was born i had heard that he had been very clever and that great things had been expected of him but i anticipated no pleasure from exploring musty old letters and papers of forty neglected years  i went up to uncle alans room at dusk that night we had been having a day of warm spring rain but it had cleared away and the bare maple boughs outside the window were strung with glistening drops the room looked to the north and was always dim by reason of the closegrowing sweetwater pines a gap had been cut through them to the northwest and in it i had a glimpse of the sea uncle alan had loved and above it a wondrous sunset sky fleeced over with little clouds pale and pink and golden and green that suddenly reminded me of miss sylvia and her fluffy knitting it was with the thought of her in my mind that i lighted a lamp and began the task of grubbing into uncle alans trunkful of papers most of these were bundles of yellowed letters of no present interest from his family and college friends there were several college theses and essays and a lot of loose miscellania pertaining to boyish school days i went through the collection rapidly until at the bottom of the trunk i came to a small book bound in darkgreen leather it proved to be a sort of journal and i began to glance over it with a languid interest  it had been begun in the spring after he had graduated from college although suspected only by himself the disease which was to end his life had already fastened upon him the entries were those of a doomed man who feeling the curse fall on him like a frost blighting all the fair hopes and promises of life seeks some help and consolation in the outward selfcommuning of a journal there was nothing morbid nothing unmanly in the record as i read i found myself liking uncle alan wishing that he might have lived and been my friend  his mother had not been well that summer and the doctor ordered her to the seashore alan accompanied her here occurred a hiatus in the journal no leaves had been torn out but a quire or so of them had apparently become loosened from the threads that held them in place i found them later on in the trunk but at the time i passed to the next page it began abruptly      this girl is the sweetest thing that god ever made i had not     known a woman could be so fair and sweet her beauty awes me     the purity of her soul shines so clearly through it like an     illuminating lamp i love her with all my power of loving and     i am thankful that it is so it would have been hard to die     without having known love i am glad that it has come to me     even if its price is unspeakable bitterness a man has not     lived for nothing who has known and loved sylvia stanleymain      i must not seek her lovethat is denied me if i were well     and strong i should win it yes i believe i could win it and     nothing in the world would prevent me from trying but as     things are it would be the part of a coward to try yet i     cannot resist the delight of being with her of talking to     her of watching her wonderful face she is in my thoughts day     and night she dwells in my dreams o sylvia i love you my     sweet  a week later there was another entry                                    july seventeenth      i am afraid today i met sylvias eyes in them was a look     which at first stirred my heart to its deeps with tumultuous     delight and then i remembered i must spare her that     suffering at whatever cost to myself i must not let myself     dwell on the dangerous sweetness of the thought that her heart     is turning to me what would be the crowning joy to another     man could be only added sorrow to me  then                                     july eighteenth      this morning i took the train to the city i was determined to     know the worst once for all the time had come when i must my     doctor at home had put me off with vague hopes and perhapses     so i went to a noted physician in the city i told him i     wanted the whole truthi made him tell it stripped of all     softening verbiage it is this i have perhaps eight months or     a year to liveno more      i had expected it although not quite so soon yet the     certainty was none the less bitter but this is no time for     selfpity it is of sylvia i must think now i shall go away     at once before the sweet fancy which is possibly budding in     her virgin heart shall have bloomed into a flower that might     poison some of her fair years                                      july nineteenth      it is over i said goodbye to her today before others for i     dared not trust myself to see her alone she looked hurt and     startled as if someone had struck her but she will soon     forget even if i have not been mistaken in the reading of her     eyes as for me the bitterness of death is already over in     that parting all that now remains is to play the man to the     end  from further entries in the journal i learned that alan blair had returned to sweetwater and later on had been ordered to california the entries during his sojourn there were few and far between in all of them he spoke of sylvia finally after a long silence he had written      i think the end is not far off now i am not sorry for my     suffering has been great of late last night i was easier i     slept and dreamed that i saw sylvia once or twice i thought     that i would arrange to have this book sent to her after my     death but i have decided that it would be unwise it would     only pain her so i shall destroy it when i feel the time has     come      it is sunset in this wonderful summer land at home in     sweetwater it is only early spring as yet with snow lingering     along the edges of the woods the sunsets there will be     creamyyellow and pale red now if i could but see them once     more and  sylvia  there was a little blot where the pen had fallen evidently the end had been nearer than alan blair had thought at least there were no more entries and the little green book had not been destroyed i was glad that it had not been and i felt glad that it was thus put in my power to write the last chapter of miss sylvias story for her  as soon as i could leave sweetwater i went to the city three hundred miles away where miss sylvia lived i found her in her library in her black silk dress and heliotrope shawl knitting up cream wool for all the world as if she had just been transplanted from the veranda corner of harbour light  my dear boy she said  do you know why i have come i asked  i am vain enough to think it was because you wanted to see me she smiled  i did want to see you but i would have waited until summer if it had not been that i wished to bring you the missing chapter of your story dear lady  iidont understand said miss sylvia starting slightly  i had an uncle alan blair who died forty years ago in california i said quietly recently i have had occasion to examine some of his papers i found a journal among them and i have brought it to you because i think that you have the best right to it  i dropped the parcel in her lap she was silent with surprise and bewilderment  and now i added i am going away you wont want to see me or anyone for a while after you have read this book but i will come up to see you tomorrow  when i went the next day miss sylvia herself met me at the door she caught my hand and drew me into the hall her eyes were softly radiant  oh you have made me so happy she said tremulously oh you can never know how happy nothing hurts nownothing ever can hurt because i know he did care  she laid her face down on my shoulder as a girl might have nestled to her lover and i bent and kissed her for uncle alan     the garden of spices   jims tried the door of the blue room yes it was locked he had hoped aunt augusta might have forgotten to lock it but when did aunt augusta forget anything except perhaps that little boys were not born grownupsand that was something she never remembered to be sure she was only a halfaunt whole aunts probably had more convenient memories  jims turned and stood with his back against the door it was better that way he could not imagine things behind him then and the blue room was so big and dim that a dreadful number of things could be imagined in it all the windows were shuttered but one and that one was so darkened by a big pine tree branching right across it that it did not let in much light  jims looked very small and lost and lonely as he shrank back against the doorso small and lonely that one might have thought that even the sternest of halfaunts should have thought twice before shutting him up in that room and telling him he must stay there the whole afternoon instead of going out for a promised ride jims hated being shut up aloneespecially in the blue room its bigness and dimness and silence filled his sensitive little soul with vague horror sometimes he became almost sick with fear in it to do aunt augusta justice she never suspected this if she had she would not have decreed this particular punishment because she knew jims was delicate and must not be subjected to any great physical or mental strain that was why she shut him up instead of whipping him but how was she to know it aunt augusta was one of those people who never know anything unless it is told them in plain language and then hammered into their heads there was no one to tell her but jims and jims would have died the death before he would have told aunt augusta with her cold spectacled eyes and thin smileless mouth that he was desperately frightened when he was shut in the blue room so he was always shut in it for punishment and the punishments came very often for jims was always doing things that aunt augusta considered naughty at first this time jims did not feel quite so frightened as usual because he was very angry as he put it he was very mad at aunt augusta he hadnt meant to spill his pudding over the floor and the tablecloth and his clothes and how such a little bit of puddingaunt augusta was mean with dessertscould ever have spread itself over so much territory jims could not understand but he had made a terrible mess and aunt augusta had been very angry and had said he must be cured of such carelessness she said he must spend the afternoon in the blue room instead of going for a ride with mrs loring in her new car  jims was bitterly disappointed if uncle walter had been home jims would have appealed to himfor when uncle walter could be really wakened up to a realization of his small nephews presence in his home he was very kind and indulgent but it was so hard to waken him up that jims seldom attempted it he liked uncle walter but as far as being acquainted with him went he might as well have been the inhabitant of a star in the milky way jims was just a lonely solitary little creature and sometimes he felt so friendless that his eyes smarted and several sobs had to be swallowed  there were no sobs just now thoughjims was still too angry it wasnt fair it was so seldom he got a car ride uncle walter was always too busy attending to sick children all over the town to take him it was only once in a blue moon mrs loring asked him to go out with her but she always ended up with ice cream or a movie and today jims had had strong hopes that both were on the programme  i hate aunt augusta he said aloud and then the sound of his voice in that huge still room scared him so that he only thought the rest i wont have any funand she wont feed my gobbler either  jims had shrieked feed my gobbler to the old servant as he had been hauled upstairs but he didnt think nancy jane had heard him and nobody not even jims could imagine aunt augusta feeding the gobbler it was always a wonder to him that she ate herself it seemed really too human a thing for her to do  i wish i had spilled that pudding on purpose jims said vindictively and with the saying his anger evaporatedjims never could stay angry longand left him merely a scared little fellow with velvety nutbrown eyes full of fear that should have no place in a childs eyes he looked so small and helpless as he crouched against the door that one might have wondered if even aunt augusta would not have relented had she seen him  how that window at the far end of the room rattled it sounded terribly as if somebodyor somethingwere trying to get in jims looked desperately at the unshuttered window he must get to it once there he could curl up in the window seat his back to the wall and forget the shadows by looking out into the sunshine and loveliness of the garden over the wall jims would have likely have been found dead of fright in that blue room some time had it not been for the garden over the wall  but to get to the window jims must cross the room and pass by the bed jims held that bed in special dread it was the oldest fashioned thing in the oldfashioned oldfurnitured house it was high and rigid and hung with gloomy blue curtains anything might jump out of such a bed  jims gave a gasp and ran madly across the room he reached the window and flung himself upon the seat with a sigh of relief he curled down in the corner outside over the high brick wall was a world where his imagination could roam though his slender little body was pent a prisoner in the blue room  jims had loved that garden from his first sight of it he called it the garden of spices and wove all sorts of yarns in fancyyarns gay and tragicabout it he had only known it for a few weeks before that they had lived in a much smaller house away at the other side of the town then uncle walters unclewho had brought him up just as he was bringing up jimshad died and they had all come to live in uncle walters old home somehow jims had an idea that uncle walter wasnt very glad to come back there but he had to according to greatuncles will jims himself didnt mind much he liked the smaller rooms in their former home better but the garden of spices made up for all  it was such a beautiful spot just inside the wall was a row of aspen poplars that always talked in silvery whispers and shook their dainty heartshaped leaves at him beyond them under scattered pines was a rockery where ferns and wild things grew it was almost as good as a bit of woodsand jims loved the woods though he scarcely ever saw them then past the pines were roses just breaking into june bloomroses in such profusion as jims hadnt known existed with dear little paths twisting about among the bushes it seemed to be a garden where no frost could blight or rough wind blow when rain fell it must fall very gently past the roses one saw a green lawn sprinkled over now with the white ghosts of dandelions and dotted with ornamental trees the trees grew so thickly that they almost hid the house to which the garden pertained it was a large one of greyblack stone with stacks of huge chimneys jims had no idea who lived there he had asked aunt augusta and aunt augusta had frowned and told him it did not matter who lived there and that he must never on any account mention the next house or its occupant to uncle walter jims would never have thought of mentioning them to uncle walter but the prohibition filled him with an unholy and unsubduable curiosity he was devoured by the desire to find out who the folks in that tabooed house were  and he longed to have the freedom of that garden jims loved gardens there had been a garden at the little house but there was none herenothing but an old lawn that had been fine once but was now badly run to seed jims had heard uncle walter say that he was going to have it attended to but nothing had been done yet and meanwhile here was a beautiful garden over the wall which looked as if it should be full of children but no children were ever in itor anybody else apparently and so in spite of its beauty it had a lonely look that hurt jims he wanted his garden of spices to be full of laughter he pictured himself running in it with imaginary playmatesand there was a mother in itor a big sisteror at the least a whole aunt who would let you hug her and would never dream of shutting you up in chilly shadowy horrible blue rooms  it seems to me said jims flattening his nose against the pane that i must get into that garden or bust  aunt augusta would have said icily we do not use such expressions james but aunt augusta was not there to hear  im afraid the very handsome cat isnt coming today sighed jims then he brightened up the very handsome cat was coming across the lawn he was the only living thing barring birds and butterflies that jims ever saw in the garden jims worshipped that cat he was jet black with white paws and dickey and he had as much dignity as ten cats jims fingers tingled to stroke him jims had never been allowed to have even a kitten because aunt augusta had a horror of cats and you cannot stroke gobblers  the very handsome cat came through the rose garden paths on his beautiful paws ambled daintily around the rockery and sat down in a shady spot under a pine tree right where jims could see him through a gap in the little poplars he looked straight up at jims and winked at least jims always believed and declared he did and that wink said or seemed to say plainly  be a sport come down here and play with me a fig for your aunt augusta  a wild daring absurd idea flashed into jims brain could he he could he would he knew it would be easy he had thought it all out many times although until now he had never dreamed of really doing it to unhook the window and swing it open to step out on the pine bough and from it to another that hung over the wall and dropped nearly to the ground to spring from it to the velvet sward under the poplarswhy it was all the work of a minute with a careful repressed whoop jims ran towards the very handsome cat  the cat rose and retreated in deliberate haste jims ran after him the cat dodged through the rose paths and eluded jims eager hands just keeping tantalizingly out of reach jims had forgotten everything except that he must catch the cat he was full of a fearful joy with an elfin delight running through it he had escaped from the blue room and its ghosts he was in his garden of spices he had got the better of mean old aunt augusta but he must catch the cat  the cat ran over the lawn and jims pursued it through the green gloom of the thickly clustering trees beyond them came a pool of sunshine in which the old stone house basked like a huge grey cat itself more garden was before it and beyond it wonderful with blossom under a huge spreading beech tree in the centre of it was a little tea table sitting by the table reading was a lady in a black dress  the cat having lured jims to where he wanted him sat down and began to lick his paws he was quite willing to be caught now but jims had no longer any idea of catching him he stood very still looking at the lady she did not see him then and jims could only see her profile which he thought very beautiful she had wonderful ropes of blueblack hair wound around her head she looked so sweet that jims heart beat then she lifted her head and turned her face and saw him jims felt something of a shock she was not pretty after all one side of her face was marked by a dreadful red scar it quite spoilt her good looks which jims thought a great pity but nothing could spoil the sweetness of her face or the loveliness of her peculiar soft greyblue eyes jims couldnt remember his mother and had no idea what she looked like but the thought came into his head that he would have liked her to have eyes like that after the first moment jims did not mind the scar at all  but perhaps that first moment had revealed itself in his face for a look of pain came into the ladys eyes and almost involuntarily it seemed she put her hand up to hide the scar then she pulled it away again and sat looking at jims half defiantly half piteously jims thought she must be angry because he had chased her cat  i beg your pardon he said gravely i didnt mean to hurt your cat i just wanted to play with him he is such a very handsome cat  but where did you come from said the lady it is so long since i saw a child in this garden she added as if to herself her voice was as sweet as her face jims thought he was mistaken in thinking her angry and plucked up heart of grace shyness was no fault of jims  i came from the house over the wall he said my name is james brander churchill aunt augusta shut me up in the blue room because i spilled my pudding at dinner i hate to be shut up and i was to have had a ride this afternoonand ice creamand maybe a movie so i was mad and when your very handsome cat came and looked at me i just got out and climbed down  he looked straight at her and smiled jims had a very dear little smile it seemed a pity there was no mother alive to revel in it the lady smiled back  i think you did right she said  you wouldnt shut a little boy up if you had one would you said jims  nono dear heart i wouldnt said the lady she said it as if something hurt her horribly she smiled again gallantly  will you come here and sit down she added pulling a chair out from the table  thank you id rather sit here said jims plumping down on the grass at her feet then maybe your cat will come to me  the cat came over promptly and rubbed his head against jims knee jims stroked him delightedly how lovely his soft fur felt and his round velvety head  i like cats explained jims and i have nothing but a gobbler this is such a very handsome cat what is his name please  black prince he loves me said the lady he always comes to my bed in the morning and wakes me by patting my face with his paw he doesnt mind my being ugly  she spoke with a bitterness jims couldnt understand  but you are not ugly he said  oh i am uglyi am ugly she cried just look at meright at me doesnt it hurt you to look at me  jims looked at her gravely and dispassionately  no it doesnt he said not a bit he added after some further exploration of his consciousness  suddenly the lady laughed beautifully a faint rosy flush came into her unscarred cheek  james i believe you mean it  of course i mean it and if you dont mind please call me jims nobody calls me james but aunt augusta she isnt my whole aunt she is just uncle walters halfsister he is my whole uncle  what does he call you asked the lady she looked away as she asked it  oh jims when he thinks about me he doesnt often think about me he has too many sick children to think about sick children are all uncle walter cares about hes the greatest childrens doctor in the dominion mr burroughs says but he is a womanhater  how do you know that  oh i heard mr burroughs say it mr burroughs is my tutor you know i study with him from nine till one im not allowed to go to the public school id like to but uncle walter thinks im not strong enough yet im going next year though when im ten i have holidays now mr burroughs always goes away the first of june  how came he to tell you your uncle was a womanhater persisted the lady  oh he didnt tell me he was talking to a friend of his he thought i was reading my book so i wasbut i heard it all it was more interesting than my book uncle walter was engaged to a lady long long ago when he was a young man she was devilishly pretty  oh jims  mr burroughs said so im only quoting said jims easily and uncle walter just worshipped her and all at once she just jilted him without a word of explanation mr burroughs said so that is why he hates women it isnt any wonder is it  i suppose not said the lady with a sigh jims are you hungry  yes i am you see the pudding was spilled but how did you know  oh boys always used to be hungry when i knew them long ago i thought they hadnt changed i shall tell martha to bring out something to eat and well have it here under this tree you sit hereill sit there jims its so long since i talked to a little boy that im not sure that i know how  you know how all right jims assured her but what am i to call you please  my name is miss garland said the lady a little hesitatingly but she saw the name meant nothing to jims i would like you to call me miss avery avery is my first name and i never hear it nowadays now for a jamboree i cant offer you a movieand im afraid there isnt any ice cream either i could have had some if id known you were coming but i think martha will be able to find something good  a very old woman who looked at jims with great amazement came out to set the table jims thought she must be as old as methusaleh but he did not mind her he ran races with black prince while tea was being prepared and rolled the delighted cat over and over in the grass and he discovered a fragrant herbgarden in a far corner and was delighted now it was truly a garden of spices  oh it is so beautiful here he told miss avery who sat and looked at his revels with a hungry expression in her lovely eyes i wish i could come often  why cant you said miss avery  the two looked at each other with sly intelligence  i could come whenever aunt augusta shuts me up in the blue room said jims  yes said miss avery then she laughed and held out her arms jims flew into them he put his arms about her neck and kissed her scarred face  oh i wish you were my aunt he said  miss avery suddenly pushed him away jims was horribly afraid he had offended her but she took his hand  well just be chums jims she said thats really better than being relations after all come and have tea  over that glorious teatable they became lifelong friends they had always known each other and always would the black prince sat between them and was fed titbits there was such a lot of good things on the table and nobody to say you have had enough james james ate until he thought he had enough aunt augusta would have thought he was doomed could she have seen him  i suppose i must go back said jims with a sigh it will be our supper time in half an hour and aunt augusta will come to take me out  but youll come again  yes the first time she shuts me up and if she doesnt shut me up pretty soon ill be so bad shell have to shut me up  ill always set a place for you at the teatable after this jims and when youre not here ill pretend you are and when you cant come here write me a letter and bring it when you do come  goodbye said jims he took her hand and kissed it he had read of a young knight doing that and had always thought he would like to try it if he ever got a chance but who could dream of kissing aunt augustas hands  you dear funny thing said miss avery have you thought of how you are to get back can you reach that pine bough from the ground  maybe i can jump said jims dubiously  im afraid not ill give you a stool and you can stand on it just leave it there for future use goodbye jims jims two hours ago i didnt know there was such a person in the world as youand now i love youi love you  jims heart filled with a great warm gush of gladness he had always wanted to be loved and no living creature he felt sure loved him except his gobblerand a gobblers love is not very satisfying though it is better than nothing he was blissfully happy as he carried his stool across the lawn he climbed his pine and went in at the window and curled up on the seat in a maze of delight the blue room was more shadowy than ever but that did not matter over in the garden of spices was friendship and laughter and romance galore the whole world was transformed for jims  from that time jims lived a shamelessly double life whenever he was shut in the blue room he escaped to the garden of spicesand he was shut in very often for mr burroughs being away he got into a good deal of what aunt augusta called mischief besides it is a sad truth that jims didnt try very hard to be good now he thought it paid better to be bad and be shut up to be sure there was always a fly in the ointment he was haunted by a vague fear that aunt augusta might relent and come to the blue room before supper time to let him out  and then the fat would be in the fire said jims  but he had a glorious summer and throve so well on his new diet of love and companionship that one day uncle walter with fewer sick children to think about than usual looked at him curiously and said  augusta that boy seems to be growing much stronger he has a good color and his eyes are getting to look more like a boys eyes should well make a man of you yet jims  he may be getting stronger but hes getting naughtier too said aunt augusta grimly i am sorry to say walter that he behaves very badly  we were all young once said uncle walter indulgently  were you asked jims in blank amazement  uncle walter laughed  do you think me an antediluvian jims  i dont know what that is but your hair is gray and your eyes are tired said jims uncompromisingly  uncle walter laughed again tossed jims a quarter and went out  your uncle is only fortyfive and in his prime said aunt augusta dourly  jims deliberately ran across the room to the window and under pretence of looking out knocked down a flower pot so he was exiled to the blue room and got into his beloved garden of spices where miss averys beautiful eyes looked love into his and the black prince was a jolly playmate and old martha petted and spoiled him to her hearts content  jims never asked questions but he was a wideawake chap and taking one thing with another he found out a good deal about the occupants of the old stone house miss avery never went anywhere and no one ever went there she lived all alone with two old servants man and maid except these two and jims nobody had ever seen her for twenty years jims didnt know why but he thought it must be because of the scar on her face  he never referred to it but one day miss avery told him what caused it  i dropped a lamp and my dress caught fire and burned my face jims it made me hideous i was beautiful before thatvery beautiful everybody said so come in and i will show you my picture  she took him into her big parlor and showed him the picture hanging on the wall between the two high windows it was of a young girl in white she certainly was very lovely with her roseleaf skin and laughing eyes jims looked at the pictured face gravely with his hands in his pockets and his head on one side then he looked at miss avery  you were prettier thenyes he said judicially but i like your face ever so much better now  oh jims you cant she protested  yes i do persisted jims you look kinder andnicer now  it was the nearest jims could get to expressing what he felt as he looked at the picture the young girl was beautiful but her face was a little hard there was pride and vanity and something of the insolence of great beauty in it there was nothing of that in miss averys face nownothing but sweetness and tenderness and a motherly yearning to which every fibre of jims small being responded how they loved each other those two and how they understood each other to love is easy and therefore common but to understandhow rare that is and oh such good times as they had they made taffy jims had always longed to make taffy but aunt augustas immaculate kitchen and saucepans might not be so desecrated they read fairy tales together mr burroughs had disapproved of fairy tales they blew soapbubbles out on the lawn and let them float away over the garden and the orchard like fairy balloons they had glorious afternoon teas under the beech tree they made ice cream themselves jims even slid down the bannisters when he wanted to and he could try out a slang word or two occasionally without anybody dying of horror miss avery did not seem to mind it a bit  at first miss avery always wore dark sombre dresses but one day jims found her in a pretty gown of pale primrose silk it was very old and oldfashioned but jims did not know that he capered round her in delight  you like me better in this she asked wistfully  i like you just as well no matter what you wear said jims but that dress is awfully pretty  would you like me to wear bright colors jims  you bet i would said jims emphatically  after that she always wore thempink and primrose and blue and white and she let jims wreathe flowers in her splendid hair he had quite a knack of it she never wore any jewelry except always a little gold ring with a design of two clasped hands  a friend gave that to me long ago when we were boy and girl together at school she told jims once i never take it off night or day when i die it is to be buried with me  you mustnt die till i do said jims in dismay  oh jims if we could only live together nothing else would matter she said hungrily jimsjimsi see so little of you reallyand some day soon youll be going to schooland ill lose you  ive got to think of some way to prevent it cried jims i wont have it i wonti wont  but his heart sank notwithstanding  one day jims slipped from the blue room down the pine and across the lawn with a tearstained face  aunt augusta is going to kill my gobbler he sobbed in miss averys arms she says she isnt going to bother with him any longerand hes getting oldand hes to be killed and that gobbler is the only friend i have in the world except you oh i cant stand it miss avery  next day aunt augusta told him the gobbler had been sold and taken away and jims flew into a passion of tears and protest about it and was promptly incarcerated in the blue room a few minutes later a sobbing boy plunged through the treesand stopped abruptly miss avery was reading under the beech and the black prince was snoozing on her kneeand a big magnificent bronze turkey was parading about on the lawn twisting his huge fan of a tail this way and that  my gobbler cried jims  yes martha went to your uncles house and bought him oh she didnt betray you she told nancy jane she wanted a gobbler and having seen one over there thought perhaps she could get him see heres your pet jims and here he shall live till he dies of old age and i have something else for youedward and martha went across the river yesterday to the murray kennels and got it for you  not a dog exclaimed jims  yesa dear little bull pup he shall be your very own jims and i only stipulate that you reconcile the black prince to him  it was something of a task but jims succeeded then followed a month of perfect happiness at least three afternoons a week they contrived to be together it was all too good to be true jims felt something would happen soon to spoil it just suppose aunt augusta grew tenderhearted and ceased to punish or suppose she suddenly discovered that he was growing too big to be shut up jims began to stint himself in eating lest he grew too fast and then aunt augusta worried about his loss of appetite and suggested to uncle walter that he should be sent to the country till the hot weather was over jims didnt want to go to the country now because his heart was elsewhere he must eat again if he grew like a weed it was all very harassing  uncle walter looked at him keenly  it seems to me youre looking pretty fit jims do you want to go to the country  no please  are you happy jims  sometimes  a boy should be happy all the time jims  if i had a mother and someone to play with i would be  i have tried to be a mother to you jims said aunt augusta in an offended tone then she addressed uncle walter a younger woman would probably understand him better and i feel that the care of this big place is too much for me i would prefer to go to my own old home if you had married long ago as you should walter james would have had a mother and some cousins to play with i have always been of this opinion  uncle walter frowned and got up  just because one woman played you false is no good reason for spoiling your life went on aunt augusta severely i have kept silence all these years but now i am going to speakand speak plainly you should marry walter you are young enough yet and you owe it to your name  listen augusta said uncle walter sternly i loved a woman once i believed she loved me she sent me back my ring one day and with it a message saying she had ceased to care for me and bidding me never to try to look upon her face again well i have obeyed her that is all  there was something strange about all that walter the life she has since led proves that so you should not let it embitter you against all women  i havent its nonsense to say im a womanhater augusta but that experience has robbed me of the power to care for another woman  well this isnt a proper conversation for a child to hear said aunt augusta recollecting herself jims go out  jims would have given one of his ears to stay and listen with the other but he went obediently  and then the very next day the dreaded something happened  it was the first of august and very very hot jims was late coming to dinner and aunt augusta reproved him and jims deliberately and with malice aforethought told her he thought she was a nasty old woman he had never been saucy to aunt augusta before but it was three days since he had seen miss avery and the black prince and nip and he was desperate aunt augusta crimsoned with anger and doomed jims to an afternoon in the blue room for impertinence  and i shall tell your uncle when he comes home she added  that rankled for jims didnt want uncle walter to think him impertinent but he forgot all his worries as he scampered through the garden of spices to the beech tree and there jims stopped as if he had been shot prone on the grass under the beech tree white and cold and still lay his miss averydead stone dead  at least jims drought she was dead he flew into the house like a mad thing shrieking for martha nobody answered jims recollected with a rush of sickening dread that miss avery had told him martha and edward were going away that day to visit a sister he rushed blindly across the lawn again through the little side gate he had never passed before and down the street home uncle walter was just opening the door of his car  uncle waltercomecome sobbed jims clutching frantically at his hand miss averys deaddeadoh come quick  who is dead  miss averymiss avery garland shes lying on the grass over there in her garden and i love her soand ill die toooh uncle walter come  uncle walter looked as if he wanted to ask some questions but he said nothing with a strange face he hurried after jims miss avery was still lying there as uncle walter bent over her he saw the broad red scar and started back with an exclamation  she is dead gasped jims  no said uncle walter bending down againno she has only fainted jimsovercome by the heat i suppose i want help go and call somebody  theres no one home here today said jims in a spasm of joy so great that it shook him like a leaf  then go home and telephone over to mr lorings tell them i want the nurse who is there to come here for a few minutes  jims did his errand uncle walter and the nurse carried miss avery into the house and then jims went back to the blue room he was so unhappy he didnt care where he went he wished something would jump at him out of the bed and put an end to him everything was discovered now and he would never see miss avery again jims lay very still on the window seat he did not even cry he had come to one of the griefs that lie too deep for tears  i think i must have been put under a curse at birth thought poor jims                                       over at the stone house miss avery was lying on the couch in her room the nurse had gone away and dr walter was sitting looking at her he leaned forward and pulled away the hand with which she was hiding the scar on her face he looked first at the little gold ring on the hand and then at the scar  dont she said piteously  averywhy did you do itwhy did you do it  oh you knowyou must know now walter  avery did you break my heart and spoil my lifeand your ownsimply because your face was scarred  i couldnt bear to have you see me hideous she moaned you had been so proud of my beauty iithought you couldnt love me any morei couldnt bear the thought of looking in your eyes and seeing aversion there  walter grant leaned forward  look in my eyes avery do you see any aversion  avery forced herself to look what she saw covered her face with a hot blush  did you think my love such a poor and superficial thing avery he said sternly that it must vanish because a blemish came on your fairness do you think that would change me was your own love for me so slight  nono she sobbed i have loved you every moment of my life walter oh dont look at me so sternly  if you had even told me he said you said i was never to try to look on your face againand they told me you had gone away you sent me back my ring  i kept the old one she interrupted holding out her hand the first one you ever gave medo you remember walter when we were boy and girl  you robbed me of all that made life worth while avery do you wonder that ive been a bitter man  i was wrongi was wrong she sobbed i should have believed in you but dont you think ive paid too forgive me walterits too late to atonebut forgive me  is it too late he asked gravely  she pointed to the scar  could you endure seeing this opposite to you every day at your table she asked bitterly  yesif i could see your sweet eyes and your beloved smile with it avery he answered passionately oh avery it was you i lovednot your outward favor oh how foolish you werefoolish and morbid you always put too high a value on beauty avery if i had dreamed of the true state of the caseif i had known you were here all these yearswhy i heard a rumor long ago that you had married averybut if i had known i would have come to you and made you besensible  she gave a little laugh at his lame conclusion that was so like the old walter then her eyes filled with tears as he took her in his arms                                       the door of the blue room opened jims did not look up it was aunt augusta of courseand she had heard the whole story  jims boy  jims lifted his miserable eyes it was uncle walterbut a different uncle walteran uncle walter with laughing eyes and a strange radiance of youth about him  poor lonely little fellow said uncle walter unexpectedly jims would you like miss avery to come hereand live with us alwaysand be your real aunt  great snakes said jims transformed in a second is there any chance of that  there is a certainty thanks to you said uncle walter you can go over to see her for a little while dont talk her to deathshes weak yetand attend to that menagerie of yours over thereshes worrying because the bull dog and gobbler werent fedand jims  but jims had swung down through the pine and was tearing across the garden of spices     the girl and the photograph   when i heard that peter austin was in vancouver i hunted him up i had met peter ten years before when i had gone east to visit my fathers people and had spent a few weeks with an uncle in croyden the austins lived across the street from uncle tom and peter and i had struck up a friendship although he was a hobbledehoy of awkward sixteen and i at twentytwo was older and wiser and more dignified than ive ever been since or ever expect to be again peter was a jolly little round freckled chap he was all right when no girls were around when they were he retired within himself like a misanthropic oyster and was about as interesting this was the one point upon which we always disagreed peter couldnt endure girls i was devoted to them by the wholesale the croyden girls were pretty and vivacious i had a score of flirtations during my brief sojourn among them  but when i went away the face i carried in my memory was not that of any girl with whom i had walked and driven and played the game of hearts  it was ten years ago but i had never been quite able to forget that girls face yet i had seen it but once and then only for a moment i had gone for a solitary ramble in the woods over the river and in a lonely little valley dim with pines where i thought myself alone i had come suddenly upon her standing ankledeep in fern on the bank of a brook the late evening sunshine falling yellowly on her uncovered dark hair she was very youngno more than sixteen yet the face and eyes were already those of a woman such a face beautiful yes but i thought of that afterward when i was alone with that face before my eyes i thought only of its purity and sweetness of the lovely soul and rich mind looking out of the great greyishblue eyes which in the dimness of the pine shadows looked almost black there was something in the face of that childwoman i had never seen before and was destined never to see again in any other face careless boy though i was it stirred me to the deeps i felt that she must have been waiting forever in that pine valley for me and that in finding her i had found all of good that life could offer me  i would have spoken to her but before i could shape my greeting into words that should not seem rude or presumptuous she had turned and gone stepping lightly across the brook and vanishing in the maple copse beyond for no more than ten seconds had i gazed into her face and the soul of her the real woman behind the fair outwardness had looked back into my eyes but i had never been able to forget it  when i returned home i questioned my cousins diplomatically as to who she might be i felt strangely reluctant to do soit seemed in some way sacrilege yet only by so doing could i hope to discover her they could tell me nothing nor did i meet her again during the remainder of my stay in croyden although i never went anywhere without looking for her and haunted the pine valley daily in the hope of seeing her again my disappointment was so bitter that i laughed at myself  i thought i was a fool to feel thus about a girl i had met for a moment in a chance ramblea mere child at that with her hair still hanging in its long glossy schoolgirl braid but when i remembered her eyes my wisdom forgave me  well that was ten years ago in those ten years the memory had i must confess grown dimmer in our busy western life a man had not much time for sentimental recollections yet i had never been able to care for another woman i wanted to i wanted to marry and settle down i had come to the time of life when a man wearies of drifting and begins to hanker for a calm anchorage in some snug haven of his own but somehow i shirked the matter it seemed rather easier to let things slide  at this stage peter came west he was something in a bank and was as round and jolly as ever but he had evidently changed his attitude towards girls for his rooms were full of their photos they were stuck around everywhere and they were all pretty either peter had excellent taste or the croyden photographers knew how to flatter but there was one on the mantel which attracted my attention especially if the photo were to be trusted the girl was quite the prettiest i had ever seen  peter what pretty girls picture is this on your mantel i called out to peter who was in his bedroom donning evening dress for some function  thats my cousin marian lindsay he answered she is rather nicelooking isnt she lives in croyden nowused to live up the river at chiselhurst didnt you ever chance across her when you were in croyden  no i said if i had i wouldnt have forgotten her face  well shed be only a kid then of course shes twentysix now marian is a mighty nice girl but shes bound to be an old maid shes got notionsideals she calls em all the croyden fellows have been in love with her at one time or another but they might as well have made up to a statue marian really hasnt a spark of feeling or sentiment in her her looks are the best part of her although shes confoundedly clever  peter spoke rather squiffily i suspected that he had been one of the smitten swains himself i looked at the photo for a few minutes longer admiring it more every minute and when i heard peter coming out i did an unjustifiable thingi took that photo and put it in my pocket  i expected peter would make a fuss when he missed it but that very night the house in which he lived was burned to the ground peter escaped with the most important of his goods and chattels but all the counterfeit presentments of his dear divinities went up in smoke if he ever thought particularly of marian lindsays photograph he must have supposed that it shared the fate of the others  as for me i propped my illgotten treasure up on my mantel and worshipped it for a fortnight at the end of that time i went boldly to peter and told him i wanted him to introduce me by letter to his dear cousin and ask her to agree to a friendly correspondence with me  oddly enough i did not do this without some reluctance in spite of the fact that i was as much in love with marian lindsay as it was possible to be through the medium of a picture i thought of the girl i had seen in the pine wood and felt an inward shrinking from a step that might divide me from her forever but i rated myself for this nonsense it was in the highest degree unlikely that i should ever meet the girl of the pines again if she were still living she was probably some other mans wife i would think no more about it  peter whistled when he heard what i had to say  of course ill do it old man he said obligingly but i warn you i dont think it will be much use marian isnt the sort of girl to open up a correspondence in such a fashion however ill do the best i can for you  do tell her im a respectable fellow with no violent bad habits and all that im in earnest peter i want to make that girls acquaintance and this seems the only way at present i cant get off just now for a trip east explain all this and use your cousinly influence in my behalf if you possess any  peter grinned  its not the most graceful job in the world you are putting on me curtis he said i dont mind owning up now that i was pretty far gone on marian myself two years ago its all over now but it was bad while it lasted perhaps marian will consider your request more favourably if i put it in the light of a favour to myself she must feel that she owes me something for wrecking my life  peter grinned again and looked at the one photo he had contrived to rescue from the fire it was a pretty snubnosed little girl she would never have consoled me for the loss of marian lindsay but every man to his taste  in due time peter sought me out to give me his cousins answer  congratulations curtis youve outcaesared caesar youve conquered without even going and seeing marian agrees to a friendly correspondence with you i am amazed i admiteven though i did paint you up as a sort of sir galahad and lancelot combined im not used to seeing proud marian do stunts like that and it rather takes my breath  i wrote to marian lindsay after one farewell dream of the girl under the pines when marians letters began to come regularly i forgot the other one altogether  such letterssuch witty sparkling clever womanly delightful letters they completed the conquest her picture had begun before we had corresponded six months i was besottedly in love with this woman whom i had never seen finally i wrote and told her so and i asked her to be my wife  a fortnight later her answer came she said frankly that she believed she had learned to care for me during our correspondence but that she thought we should meet in person before coming to any definite understanding could i not arrange to visit croyden in the summer until then we would better continue on our present footing  i agreed to this but i considered myself practically engaged with the personal meeting merely to be regarded as a sop to the cerberus of conventionality i permitted myself to use a decidedly loverlike tone in my letters henceforth and i hailed it as a favourable omen that i was not rebuked for this although marians own letters still retained their pleasant simple friendliness  peter had at first tormented me mercilessly about the affair but when he saw i did not like his chaff he stopped it peter was always a good fellow he realized that i regarded the matter seriously and he saw me off when i left for the east with a grin tempered by honest sympathy and understanding  good luck to you he said if you win marian lindsay youll win a pearl among women i havent been able to grasp her taking to you in this fashion though its so unlike marian but since she undoubtedly has you are a lucky man  i arrived in croyden at dusk and went to uncle toms there i found them busy with preparations for a party to be given that night in honour of a girl friend who was visiting my cousin edna i was secretly annoyed for i wanted to hasten at once to marian but i couldnt decently get away and on second thoughts i was consoled by the reflection that she would probably come to the party i knew she belonged to the same social set as uncle toms girls i should however have preferred our meeting to have been under different circumstances  from my stand behind the palms in a corner i eagerly scanned the guests as they arrived suddenly my heart gave a bound marian lindsay had just come in  i recognized her at once from her photograph it had not flattered her in the least indeed it had not done her justice for her exquisite colouring of hair and complexion were quite lost in it she was moreover gowned with a taste and smartness eminently admirable in the future mrs eric curtis i felt a thrill of proprietary pride as i stepped out from behind the palms she was talking to aunt grace but her eyes fell on me i expected a little start of recognition for i had sent her an excellent photograph of myself but her gaze was one of blankest unconsciousness  i felt something like disappointment at her nonrecognition but i consoled myself by the reflection that people often fail to recognize other people whom they have seen only in photographs no matter how good the likeness may be i waylaid edna who was passing at that time and said edna i want you to introduce me to the girl who is talking to your mother  edna laughed  so you have succumbed at first sight to our croyden beauty of course ill introduce you but i warn you beforehand that she is the most incorrigible flirt in croyden or out of it so take care  it jarred on me to hear marian called a flirt it seemed so out of keeping with her letters and the womanly delicacy and fineness revealed in them but i reflected that women sometimes find it hard to forgive another woman who absorbs more than her share of lovers and generally take their revenge by dubbing her a flirt whether she deserves the name or not  we had crossed the room during this reflection marian turned and stood before us smiling at edna but evincing no recognition whatever of myself it is a piquant experience to find yourself awaiting an introduction to a girl to whom you are virtually engaged  dorothy dear said edna this is my cousin mr curtis from vancouver eric this is miss armstrong  i suppose i bowed habit carries us mechanically through many impossible situations i dont know what i looked like or what i said if i said anything i dont suppose i betrayed my dire confusion for edna went off unconcernedly without another glance at me  dorothy armstrong gracious powerswhowherewhy if this girl was dorothy armstrong who was marian lindsay to whom was i engaged there was some awful mistake somewhere for it could not be possible that there were two girls in croyden who looked exactly like the photograph reposing in my valise at that very moment i stammered like a schoolboy  iohiyour face seems familiar to me miss armstrong iithink i must have seen your photograph somewhere  probably in peter austins collection smiled miss armstrong he had one of mine before he was burned out how is he  peter oh hes well i replied vaguely i was thinking a hundred words to the second but my thoughts arrived nowhere i was staring at miss armstrong like a man bewitched she must have thought me a veritable booby oh by the waycan you tell medo you know a miss lindsay in croyden  miss armstrong looked surprised and a little bored evidently she was not used to having newly introduced young men inquiring about another girl  marian lindsay oh yes  is she here tonight i said  no marian is not going to parties just now owing to the recent death of her aunt who lived with them  does sheohdoes she look like you at all i inquired idiotically  amusement glimmered but over miss armstrongs boredom she probably concluded that i was some harmless lunatic  like me not at all there couldnt be two people more dissimilar marian is quite dark i am fair and our features are altogether unlike why good evening jack yes i believe i did promise you this dance  she bowed to me and skimmed away with jack i saw aunt grace bearing down upon me and fled incontinently in my own room i flung myself on a chair and tried to think the matter out where did the mistake come in how had it happened i shut my eyes and conjured up the vision of peters room that day i remembered vaguely that when i had picked up dorothy armstrongs picture i had noticed another photograph that had fallen face downward beside it that must have been marian lindsays and peter had thought i meant it  and now what a position i was in i was conscious of bitter disappointment i had fallen in love with dorothy armstrongs photograph as far as external semblance goes it was she whom i loved i was practically engaged to another womana woman who in spite of our correspondence seemed to me now in the shock of this discovery a stranger it was useless to tell myself that it was the mind and soul revealed in those letters that i loved and that that mind and soul were marian lindsays it was useless to remember that peter had said she was pretty exteriorly she was a stranger to me hers was not the face which had risen before me for nearly a year as the face of the woman i loved was ever unlucky wretch in such a predicament before  well there was only one thing to do i must stand by my word marian lindsay was the woman i had asked to marry me whose answer i must shortly go to receive if that answer were yes i must accept the situation and banish all thought of dorothy armstrongs pretty face  next evening at sunset i went to glenwood the lindsay place doubtless an eager lover might have gone earlier but an eager lover i certainly was not probably marian was expecting me and had given orders concerning me for the maid who came to the door conveyed me to a little room behind the stairsa room which as i felt as soon as i entered it was a womans pet domain in its books and pictures and flowers it spoke eloquently of dainty femininity somehow it suited the letters i did not feel quite so much the stranger as i had felt nevertheless when i heard a light footfall on the stairs my heart beat painfully i stood up and turned to the door but i could not look up the footsteps came nearer i knew that a white hand swept aside the portière at the entrance i knew that she had entered the room and was standing before me  with an effort i raised my eyes and looked at her she stood tall and gracious in a ruby splendour of sunset falling through the window beside her the light quivered like living radiance over a dark proud head a white throat and a face before whose perfect loveliness the memory of dorothy armstrongs laughing prettiness faded like a star in the sunrise nevermore in the fullness of the day to be remembered yet it was not of her beauty i thought as i stood spellbound before her i seemed to see a dim little valley full of whispering pines and a girl standing under their shadows looking at me with the same great greyishblue eyes which gazed upon me now from marian lindsays facethe same face matured into gracious womanhood that i had seen ten years ago and lovedaye lovedever since i took an unsteady step forward  marian i said                                       when i got home that night i burned dorothy armstrongs photograph the next day i went to my cousin tom who owns the fashionable studio of croyden and binding him over to secrecy sought one of marians latest photographs from him it is the only secret i have ever kept from my wife  before we were married marian told me something  i always remembered you as you looked that day under the pines she said i was only a child but i think i loved you then and ever afterwards when i dreamed my girls dream of love your face rose up before me i had the advantage of you that i knew your namei had heard of you when peter wrote about you i knew who you were that was why i agreed to correspond with you i was afraid it was a forwardan unwomanly thing to do but it seemed my chance for happiness and i took it i am glad i did  i did not answer in words but lovers will know how i did answer     the gossip of valley view   it was the first of april and julius barrett aged fourteen perched on his fathers gatepost watched ruefully the low descending sun and counted that day lost he had not succeeded in fooling a single person although he had tried repeatedly one and all old and young of his intended victims had been too wary for julius hence julius was disgusted and ready for anything in the way of a stratagem or a spoil  the barrett gatepost topped the highest hill in valley view julius could see the entire settlement from young thomas everetts farm a mile to the west to adelia williamss weathergrey little house on a moonrise slope to the east he was gazing moodily down the muddy road when dan chester homeward bound from the post office came riding sloppily along on his grey mare and pulled up by the barrett gate to hand a paper to julius  dan was a young man who took life and himself very seriously he seldom smiled never joked and had a washingtonian reputation for veracity dan had never told a conscious falsehood in his life he never even exaggerated  julius beholding dans solemn face was seized with a perfectly irresistible desire to fool him at the same moment his eye caught the dazzling reflection of the setting sun on the windows of adelia williamss house and he had an inspiration little short of diabolical have you heard the news dan he asked  no what is it asked dan  i dunnos i ought to tell it said julius reflectively its kind of a family affair but then adelia didnt say not to and anyway itll be all over the place soon so ill tell you dan if youll promise never to tell who told you adelia williams and young thomas everett are going to be married  julius delivered himself of this tremendous lie with a transparently earnest countenance yet dan credulous as he was could not believe it all at once  git out he said  its true pon my word protested julius adelia was up last night and told ma all about it mas her cousin you know the wedding is to be in june and adelia asked ma to help her get her quilts and things ready  julius reeled all this off so glibly that dan finally believed the story despite the fact that the people thus coupled together in prospective matrimony were the very last people in valley view who could have been expected to marry each other young thomas was a confirmed bachelor of fifty and adelia williams was forty they were not supposed to be even well acquainted as the everetts and the williamses had never been very friendly although no open feud existed between them  nevertheless in view of juliuss circumstantial statements the amazing news must be true and dan was instantly agog to carry it further julius watched dan and the grey mare out of sight fairly writhing with ecstasy oh but dan had been easy the story would be all over valley view in twentyfour hours julius laughed until he came near to falling off the gatepost  at this point julius and danny drop out of our story and young thomas enters  it was two days later when young thomas heard that he was to be married to adelia williams in june eben clark the blacksmith told him when he went to the forge to get his horse shod young thomas laughed his big jolly laugh valley view gossip had been marrying him off for the last thirty years although never before to adelia williams  its news to me he said tolerantly  eben grinned broadly ah you cant bluff it off like that tom he said the news came too straight this time well i was glad to hear it although i was mighty surprised i never thought of you and adelia but shes a fine little woman and will make you a capital wife  young thomas grunted and drove away he had a good deal of business to do that day involving calls at various placesthe store for molasses the mill for flour jim bentleys for seed grain the doctors for toothache drops for his housekeeper the post office for mailand at each and every place he was joked about his approaching marriage in the end it rather annoyed young thomas he drove home at last in what was for him something of a temper how on earth had that fool story started with such detailed circumstantiality of rugs and quilts too adelia williams must be going to marry somebody and the valley view gossips unable to locate the man had guessed young thomas  when he reached home tired mudbespattered and hungry his housekeeper who was also his hired mans wife asked him if it was true that he was going to be married young thomas taking in at a glance the illprepared halfcold supper on the table felt more annoyed than ever and said it wasnt with a strong expressionnot quite an oathfor young thomas never swore unless swearing be as much a matter of intonation as of words  mrs dunn sighed patted her swelled face and said she was sorry she had hoped it was true for her man had decided to go west they were to go in a months time young thomas sat down to his supper with the prospect of having to look up another housekeeper and hired man before planting to destroy his appetite  next day three people who came to see young thomas on business congratulated him on his approaching marriage young thomas who had recovered his usual good humour merely laughed there was no use in being too earnest in denial he thought he knew that his unusual fit of petulance with his housekeeper had only convinced her that the story was true it would die away in time as other similar stories had died he thought valley view gossip was imaginative  young thomas looked rather serious however when the minister and his wife called that evening and referred to the report young thomas gravely said that it was unfounded the minister looked graver still and said he was sorryhe had hoped it was true his wife glanced significantly about young thomass big untidy sittingroom where there were cobwebs on the ceiling and fluff in the corners and dust on the mopboard and said nothing but looked volumes  dang it all said young thomas as they drove away theyll marry me yet in spite of myself  the gossip made him think about adelia williams he had never thought about her before he was barely acquainted with her now he remembered that she was a plump jollylooking little woman noted for being a good housekeeper then young thomas groaned remembering that he must start out looking for a housekeeper soon and housekeepers were not easily found as young thomas had discovered several times since his mothers death ten years before  next sunday in church young thomas looked at adelia williams he caught adelia looking at him adelia blushed and looked guiltily away  dang it all reflected young thomas forgetting that he was in church i suppose she has heard that fool story too id like to know the person who started it man or woman id punch their head  nevertheless young thomas went on looking at adelia by fits and starts although he did not again catch adelia looking at him he noticed that she had round rosy cheeks and twinkling brown eyes she did not look like an old maid and young thomas wondered that she had been allowed to become one sarah barnett now to whom report had married him a year ago looked like a dried sour apple                                       for the next four weeks the story haunted young thomas like a spectre down it would not everywhere he went he was joked about it it gathered fresh detail every week adelia was getting her clothes ready she was to be married in sealbrown cashmere vinnie lawrence at valley centre was making it for her she had got a new hat with a long ostrich plume some said white some said grey  young thomas kept wondering who the man could be for he was convinced that adelia was going to marry somebody more than that once he caught himself wondering enviously adelia was a nicelooking woman and he had not so far heard of any probable housekeeper  dang it all said young thomas to himself in desperation i wouldnt care if it was true  his married sister from carlisle heard the story and came over to investigate young thomas denied it shortly and his sister scolded she had devoutly hoped it was true she said and it would have been a great weight off her mind  this house is in a disgraceful condition thomas she said severely it would break mothers heart if she could rise out of her grave to see it and adelia williams is a perfect housekeeper  you didnt use to think so much of the williams crowd said young thomas drily  oh some of them dont amount to much admitted maria but adelia is all right  catching sight of an odd look on young thomass face she added hastily thomas everett i believe its true after all now is it for mercys sake dont be so sly you might tell me your own and only sister if it is  oh shut up was young thomass unfeeling reply to his own and only sister  young thomas told himself that night that valley view gossip would drive him into an asylum yet if it didnt let up he also wondered if adelia was as much persecuted as himself no doubt she was he never could catch her eye in church now but he would have been surprised had he realized how many times he tried to  the climax came the third week in may when young thomas who had been keeping house for himself for three weeks received a letter and an express box from his cousin charles everett out in manitoba charles and he had been chums in their boyhood they corresponded occasionally still although it was twenty years since charles had gone west  the letter was to congratulate young thomas on his approaching marriage charles had heard of it through some valley view correspondents of his wife he was much pleased he had always liked adelia he saidhad been an old beau of hers in fact thomas might give her a kiss for him if he liked he forwarded a wedding present by express and hoped they would be very happy etc  the present was an elaborate hatrack of polished buffalo horns mounted on red plush with an inset mirror young thomas set it up on the kitchen table and scowled moodily at his reflection in the mirror if wedding presents were beginning to come it was high time something was done the matter was past being a joke this affair of the present would certainly get outthings always got out in valley view dang it alland he would never hear the last of it  ill marry said young thomas decisively if adelia williams wont have me ill marry the first woman who will if its sarah barnett herself  young thomas shaved and put on his sunday suit as soon as it was safely dark he hied him away to adelia williams he felt very doubtful about his reception but the remembrance of the twinkle in adelias brown eyes comforted him she looked like a woman who had a sense of humour she might not take him but she would not feel offended or insulted because he asked her  dang it all though i hope she will take me said young thomas im in for getting married now and no mistake and i cant get adelia out of my head ive been thinking of her steady ever since that confounded gossip began  when he knocked at adelias door he discovered that his face was wet with perspiration adelia opened the door and started when she saw him then she turned very red and stiffly asked him in young thomas went in and sat down wondering if all men felt so horribly uncomfortable when they went courting  adelia stooped low over the woodbox to put a stick of wood in the stove for the may evening was chilly her shoulders were shaking the shaking grew worse suddenly adelia laughed hysterically and sitting down on the woodbox continued to laugh young thomas eyed her with a friendly grin  oh do excuse me gasped poor adelia wiping tears from her eyes this isdreadfuli didnt mean to laughi dont know why im laughingbuticant help it  she laughed helplessly again young thomas laughed too his embarrassment vanished in the mellowness of that laughter presently adelia composed herself and removed from the woodbox to a chair but there was still a suspicious twitching about the corners of her mouth  i suppose said young thomas determined to have it over with before the ice could form again i suppose adelia youve heard the story thats been going about you and me of late  adelia nodded ive been persecuted to the verge of insanity with it she said every soul ive seen has tormented me about it and people have written me about it ive denied it till i was black in the face but nobody believed me i cant find out how it started i hope you believe mr everett that it couldnt possibly have arisen from anything i said ive felt dreadfully worried for fear you might think it did i heard that my cousin lucilla barrett said i told her but lucilla vowed to me that she never said such a thing or even dreamed of it ive felt dreadful bad over the whole affair i even gave up the idea of making a quilt after a lovely new pattern ive got because they made such a talk about my brown dress  ive been kind of supposing that you must be going to marry somebody and folks just guessed it was me said young thomashe said it anxiously  no im not going to be married to anybody said adelia with a laugh taking up her knitting  im glad of that said young thomas gravely i mean he hastened to add seeing the look of astonishment on adelias face that im glad there isnt any other man becausebecause i want you myself adelia  adelia laid down her knitting and blushed crimson but she looked at young thomas squarely and reproachfully  you neednt think you are bound to say that because of the gossip mr everett she said quietly  oh i dont said young thomas earnestly but the truth is the story set me to thinking about you and from that i got to wishing it was truehonest i didi couldnt get you out of my head and at last i didnt want to it just seemed to me that you were the very woman for me if youd only take me will you adelia ive got a good farm and house and ill try to make you happy  it was not a very romantic wooing perhaps but adelia was forty and had never been a romantic little body even in the heyday of youth she was a practical woman and young thomas was a fine looking man of his age with abundance of worldly goods besides she liked him and the gossip had made her think a good deal about him of late indeed in a moment of candour she had owned to herself the very last sunday in church that she wouldnt mind if the story were true  illill think of it she said  this was practically an acceptance and young thomas so understood it without loss of time he crossed the kitchen sat down beside adelia and put his arms about her plump waist  heres a kiss charlie sent me to give you he said giving it     the letters   just before the letter was brought to me that evening i was watching the red november sunset from the library window it was a stormy unrestful sunset gleaming angrily through the dark fir boughs that were now and again tossed suddenly and distressfully in a fitful gust of wind below in the garden it was quite dark and i could only see dimly the dead leaves that were whirling and dancing uncannily over the roseless paths the poor dead leavesyet not quite dead there was still enough unquiet life left in them to make them restless and forlorn they hearkened yet to every call of the wind who cared for them no longer but only played freakishly with them and broke their rest i felt sorry for the leaves as i watched them in that dull weird twilight and angryin a petulant fashion that almost made me laughwith the wind that would not leave them in peace why should theyand ibe vexed with these transient breaths of desire for a life that had passed us by  i was in the grip of a bitter loneliness that eveningso bitter and so insistent that i felt i could not face the future at all even with such poor fragments of courage as i had gathered about me after fathers death hoping that they would at least suffice for my endurance if not for my content but now they fell away from me at sight of the emptiness of life  the emptiness ah it was from that i shrank i could have faced pain and anxiety and heartbreak undauntedly but i could not face that terrible yawning barren emptiness i put my hands over my eyes to shut it out but it pressed in upon my consciousness insistently and would not be ignored longer  the moment when a woman realizes that she has nothing to live forneither love nor purpose nor dutyholds for her the bitterness of death she is a brave woman indeed who can look upon such a prospect unquailingly and i was not brave i was weak and timid had not father often laughed mockingly at me because of it  it was three weeks since father had diedmy proud handsome unrelenting old father whom i had loved so intensely and who had never loved me i had always accepted this fact unresentfully and unquestioningly but it had steeped my whole life in its tincture of bitterness father had never forgiven me for two things i had cost my mothers life and i was not a son to perpetuate the old name and carry on the family feud with the frasers  i was a very lonely child with no playmates or companions of any sort and my girlhood was lonelier still the only passion in my life was my love for my father i would have done and suffered anything to win his affection in return but all i ever did win was an amused toleranceand i was grateful for thatalmost content it was much to have something to love and be permitted to love it  if i had been a beautiful and spirited girl i think father might have loved me but i was neither at first i did not think or care about my lack of beauty then one day i was alone in the beech wood i was trying to disentangle my skirt which had caught on some thorny underbrush a young man came around the curve of the path and seeing my predicament bent with murmured apology to help me he had to kneel to do it and i saw a ray of sunshine falling through the beeches above us strike like a lance of light athwart the thick brown hair that pushed out from under his cap before i thought i put out my hand and touched it softly then i blushed crimson with shame over what i had done but he did not knowhe never knew  when he had released my dress he rose and our eyes met for a moment as i timidly thanked him i saw that he was good to look upontall and straight with broad stalwart shoulders and a dark cleancut face he had a firm sensitive mouth and kindly pleasant dark blue eyes i never quite forgot the look in those eyes it made my heart beat strangely but it was only for a moment and the next he had lifted his cap and passed on  as i went homeward i wondered who he might be he must be a stranger i thoughtprobably a visitor in some of our few neighbouring families i wondered too if i should meet him again and found the thought very pleasant  i knew few men and they were all old like father or at least elderly they were the only people who ever came to our house and they either teased me or overlooked me none of them was at all like this young man i had met in the beech wood nor ever could have been i thought  when i reached home i stopped before the big mirror that hung in the hall and did what i had never done before in my lifelooked at myself very scrutinizingly and wondered if i had any beauty i could only sorrowfully conclude that i had noti was so slight and pale and the thick black hair and dark eyes that might have been pretty in another woman seemed only to accentuate the lack of spirit and regularity in my features i was still standing there gazing wistfully at my mirrored face with a strange sinking of spirit when father came through the hall his riding whip in his hand seeing me he laughed  dont waste your time gazing into mirrors isobel he said carelessly that might have been excusable in former ladies of shirley whose beauty might pardon and even adorn vanity but with you it is only absurd the needle and the cookbook are all that you need concern yourself with  i was accustomed to such speeches from him but they had never hurt me so cruelly before at that moment i would have given all the world only to be beautiful  the next sunday i looked across the church and in the fraser pew i saw the young man i had met in the wood he was looking at me with his arms folded over his breast and on his brow a little frown that seemed somehow indicative of pain and surprise i felt a miserable sense of disappointment if he were the frasers guest i could not expect to meet him again father hated the frasers all the shirleys hated them it was an old feud bitter and lasting that had been as much our inheritance for generations as land and money the only thing father had ever taken pains to teach me was detestation of the frasers and all their works i accepted this as i accepted all the other traditions of my race i thought it did not matter much the frasers were not likely to come my way and hatred was a good satisfying passion in the lack of all else i think i rather took a pride in hating them as became my blood  i did not look at the fraser pew again but outside under the elms we met him standing in the dappling light and shadow he looked very handsome and a little sad i could not help glancing back over my shoulder as father and i walked to the gate and i saw him looking after us with that little frown which again made me think something had hurt him i liked better the smile he had worn in the beech wood but i had an odd liking for the frown too and i think i had a foolish longing to go back to him put up my fingers and smooth it away  so alan fraser has come home said my father  alan fraser i repeated with a strange horrible feeling of coldness and chill coming over me like a shadow on a bright day alan fraser the son of old malcolm fraser of glenellyn the son of our enemy he had been living since childhood with his dead mothers people so much i knew and this was he something stung and smarted in my eyes i think the sting and smart might have turned to tears if father had not been looking down at me  yes didnt you see him in his fathers pew but i forgot you are too demure to be looking at the young men in preachingor out of it isobel you are a model young woman odd that the men never like the model young women curse old malcolm fraser what right has he to have a son like that when i have nothing but a puling girl remember isobel that if you ever meet that young man you are not to speak to or look at him or even intimate that you are aware of his existence he is your enemy and the enemy of your race you will show him that you realize this  of course that ended it allthough just what there had been to end would have been hard to say not long afterwards i met alan fraser again when i was out for a canter on my mare he was strolling through the beech wood with a couple of big collies and he stopped short as i drew near i had to do itfather had decreedmy shirley pride demandedthat i should do it i looked him unseeingly in the face struck my mare a blow with my whip and dashed past him i even felt angry i think that a fraser should have the power to make me feel so badly in doing my duty  after that i had forgotten there was nothing to make me remember for i never met alan fraser again the years slipped by one by one so like each other in their colourlessness that i forgot to take account of them i only knew that i grew older and that it did not matter since there was nobody to care one day they brought father in whitelipped and groaning his mare had thrown him and he was never to walk again although he lived for five years those five years had been the happiest of my life for the first time i was necessary to someonethere was something for me to do which nobody else could do so well i was fathers nurse and companion and i found my pleasure in tending him and amusing him soothing his hours of pain and brightening his hours of ease people said i did my duty toward him i had never liked that word duty since the day i had ridden past alan fraser in the beech wood i could not connect it with what i did for father it was my delight because i loved him i did not mind the moods and the irritable outbursts that drove others from him  but now he was dead and i sat in the sullen dusk wishing that i need not go on with life either the loneliness of the big echoing house weighed on my spirit i was solitary without companionship i looked out on the outside world where the only sign of human habitation visible to my eyes was the light twinkling out from the library window of glenellyn on the dark fir hill two miles away by that light i knew alan fraser must have returned from his long sojourn abroad for it only shone when he was at glenellyn he still lived there something of a hermit people said he had never married and he cared nothing for society his companions were books and dogs and horses he was given to scientific researches and wrote much for the reviews he travelled a great deal so much i knew in a vague way i even saw him occasionally in church and never thought the years had changed him much save that his face was sadder and sterner than of old and his hair had become irongrey people said that he had inherited and cherished the old hatred of the shirleysthat he was very bitter against us i believed it he had the face of a good hateror lovera man who could play with no emotion but must take it in all earnestness and intensity  when it was quite dark the housekeeper brought in the lights and handed me a letter which she said a man had just brought up from the village post office i looked at it curiously before i opened it wondering from whom it was it was postmarked from a city several miles away and the firm decided rather peculiar handwriting was strange to me i had no correspondents after fathers death i had received a few perfunctory notes of condolence from distant relatives and family friends they had hurt me cruelly for they seemed to exhale a subtle spirit of congratulation on my being released from a long and unpleasant martyrdom of attendance on an invalid that quite overrode the decorous phrases of conventional sympathy in which they were expressed i hated those letters for their implied injustice i was not thankful for my release i missed father miserably and longed passionately for the very tasks and vigils that had evoked their pity  this letter did not seem like one of those i opened it and took out some stiff blackly written sheets they were undated and turning to the last i saw that they were unsigned with a not unpleasant tingling of interest i sat down by my desk to read the letter began abruptly      you will not know by whom this is written do not seek to     knownow or ever it is only from behind the veil of your     ignorance of my identity that i can ever write to you fully     and freely as i wish to writecan say what i wish to say in     words denied to a formal and conventional expression of     sympathy dear lady let me say to you thus what is in my     heart      i know what your sorrow is and i think i know what your     loneliness must bethe sorrow of a broken tie the loneliness     of a life thrown emptily back on itself i know how you loved     your fatherhow you must have loved him if those eyes and     brow and mouth speak truth for they tell of a nature divinely     rich and deep giving of its wealth and tenderness     ungrudgingly to those who are so happy as to be the objects of     its affection to such a nature bereavement must bring a depth     and an agony of grief unknown to shallower souls      i know what your fathers helplessness and need of you meant     to you i know that now life must seem to you a broken and     embittered thing and knowing this i venture to send this     greeting across the gulf of strangerhood between us telling     you that my understanding sympathy is fully and freely yours     and bidding you take heart for the future which now it may     be looks so heartless and hopeless to you      believe me dear lady it will be neither courage will come     to you with the kind days you will find noble tasks to do     beautiful and gracious duties waiting along your path the     pain and suffering of the world never dies and while it     lives there will be work for such as you to do and in the     doing of it you will find comfort and strength and the highest     joy of living i believe in you i believe you will make of     your life a beautiful and worthy thing i give you godspeed     for the years to come out of my own loneliness i an unknown     friend who has never clasped your hand send this message to     you i understandi have always understoodand i say to you     be of good cheer  to say that this strange letter was a mystery to me seems an inadequate way of stating the matter i was completely bewildered nor could i even guess who the writer might be think and ponder as i might  the letter itself implied that the writer was a stranger the handwriting was evidently that of a man and i knew no man who could or would have sent such a letter to me  the very mystery stung me to interest as for the letter itself it brought me an uplift of hope and inspiration such as i would not have believed possible an hour earlier it rang so truly and sincerely and the mere thought that somewhere i had a friend who cared enough to write it even in such odd fashion was so sweet that i was half ashamed of the difference it made in my outlook sitting there i took courage and made a compact with myself that i would justify the writers faith in methat i would take up my life as something to be worthily lived for all good to the disregard of my own selfish sorrow and shrinking i would seek for something to dofor interests which would bind me to my fellowcreaturesfor tasks which would lessen the pains and perils of humankind an hour before this would not have seemed to me possible now it seemed the right and natural thing to do  a week later another letter came i welcomed it with an eagerness which i feared was almost childish it was a much longer letter than the first and was written in quite a different strain there was no apology for or explanation of the motive for writing it was as if the letter were merely one of a permitted and established correspondence between old friends it began with a witty sparkling review of a new book the writer had just read and passed from this to crisp comments on the great events political scientific artistic of the day the whole letter was pungent interesting delightfulan impersonal essay on a dozen vital topics of life and thought only at the end was a personal note struck  are you interested in these things ran the last paragraph in what is being done and suffered and attained in the great busy world i think you must befor i have seen you and read what is written in your face i believe you care for these things as i dothat your being thrills to the still sad music of humanitythat the songs of the poets i love find an echo in your spirit and the aspirations of all struggling souls a sympathy in your heart believing this i have written freely to you taking a keen pleasure in thus revealing my thoughts and visions to one who will understand for i too am friendless in the sense of one standing alone shut out from the sweet intimate communion of feeling and opinion that may be held with the hearts friends shall you have read this as a friend i wondera candid uncritical understanding friend let me hope it dear lady  i was expecting the third letter when it camebut not until it did come did i realize what my disappointment would have been if it had not after that every week brought me a letter soon those letters were the greatest interest in my life i had given up all attempts to solve the mystery of their coming and was content to enjoy them for themselves alone from week to week i looked forward to them with an eagerness that i would hardly confess even to myself  and such letters as they were growing longer and fuller and freer as time went onsuch wise witty brilliant pungent letters stimulating all my torpid life into tingling zest i had begun to look abroad in my small world for worthy work and found plenty to do my unknown friend evidently kept track of my expanding efforts for he commented and criticized encouraged and advised freely there was a humour in his letters that i liked it leavened them with its sanity and reacted on me most wholesomely counteracting many of the morbid tendencies and influences of my life i found myself striving to live up to the writers ideal of philosophy and ambition as pictured often unconsciously in his letters  they were an intellectual stimulant as well to understand them fully i found it necessary to acquaint myself thoroughly with the literature and art the science and the politics they touched upon after every letter there was something new for me to hunt out and learn and assimilate until my old narrow mental attitude had so broadened and deepened sweeping out into circles of thought i had never known or imagined that i hardly knew myself  they had been coming for a year before i began to reply to them i had often wished to do sothere were so many things i wanted to say and discuss but it seemed foolish to write letters that could not be sent one day a letter came that kindled my imagination and stirred my heart and soul so deeply that they insistently demanded answering expression i sat down at my desk and wrote a full reply to it safe in the belief that the mysterious friend to whom it was written would never see it i wrote with a perfect freedom and a total lack of selfconsciousness that i could never have attained otherwise the writing of that letter gave me a pleasure second only to that which the reading of his brought for the first time i discovered the delight of revealing my thought unhindered by the conventions also i understood better why the writer of those letters had written them doubtless he had enjoyed doing so and was not impelled thereto simply by a purely philanthropic wish to help me  when my letter was finished i sealed it up and locked it away in my desk with a smile at my middleaged folly what i wondered would all my sedate serious friends my associates of mission and hospital committees think if they knew well everybody has or should have a pet nonsense in her life i did not think mine was any sillier than some others i knew and to myself i admitted that it was very sweet i knew if those letters ceased to come all savour would go out of my life  after that i wrote a reply to every letter i received and kept them all locked up together it was delightful i wrote out all my doings and perplexities and hopes and plans and wishesyes and my dreams the secret romance of it all made me look on existence with joyous contented eyes  gradually a change crept over the letters i received without ever affording the slightest clue to the identity of their writer they grew more intimate and personal a subtle caressing note of tenderness breathed from them and thrilled my heart curiously i felt as if i were being drawn into the writers life admitted into the most sacred recesses of his thoughts and feelings yet it was all done so subtly so delicately that i was unconscious of the change until i discovered it in reading over the older letters and comparing them with the later ones  finally a letter camemy first love letter and surely never was a love letter received under stranger circumstances it began abruptly as all the letters had begun plunging into the middle of the writers strain of thought without any preface the first words drove the blood to my heart and then sent it flying hotly all over my face      i love you i must say it at last have you not guessed it     before it has trembled on my pen in every line i have written     to youyet i have never dared to shape it into words before     i know not how i dare now i only know that i must what a     delight to write it out and know that you will read it     tonight the mood is on me to tell it to you recklessly and     lavishly never pausing to stint or weigh words sweetheart i     love youlove youlove youdear true faithful woman soul     i love you with all the heart of a man      ever since i first saw you i have loved you i can never come     to tell you so in spoken words i can only love you from afar     and tell my love under the guise of impersonal friendship it     matters not to you but it matters more than all else in life     to me i am glad that i love you dearglad glad glad  there was much more for it was a long letter when i had read it i buried my burning face in my hands trembling with happiness this strange confession of love meant so much to me my heart leaped forth to meet it with answering love what mattered it that we could never meetthat i could not even guess who my lover was somewhere in the world was a love that was mine alone and mine wholly and mine forever what mattered his name or his station or the mysterious barrier between us spirit leaped to spirit unhindered over the fettering bounds of matter and time i loved and was beloved nothing else mattered  i wrote my answer to his letter i wrote it fearlessly and unstintedly perhaps i could not have written so freely if the letter were to have been read by him as it was i poured out the riches of my love as fully as he had done i kept nothing back and across the gulf between us i vowed a faithful and enduring love in response to his  the next day i went to town on business with my lawyers neither of the members of the firm was in when i called but i was an old client and one of the clerks showed me into the private office to wait as i sat down my eyes fell on a folded letter lying on the table beside me with a shock of surprise i recognized the writing i could not be mistakeni should have recognized it anywhere  the letter was lying by its envelope so folded that only the middle third of the page was visible an irresistible impulse swept over me before i could reflect that i had no business to touch the letter that perhaps it was unfair to my unknown friend to seek to discover his identity when he wished to hide it i had turned the letter over and seen the signature  i laid it down again and stood up dizzy breathless unseeing like a woman in a dream i walked through the outer office and into the street i must have walked on for blocks before i became conscious of my surroundings the name i had seen signed to that letter was alan fraser  no doubt the reader has long ago guessed ithas wondered why i had not the fact remains that i had not out of the whole world alan fraser was the last man whom i should have suspected to be the writer of those lettersalan fraser my hereditary enemy who i had been told cherished the old feud so faithfully and bitterly and hated our very name  and yet i now wondered at my long blindness no one else could have written those lettersno one but him i read them over one by one when i reached home and now that i possessed the key he revealed himself in every line expression thought and he loved me  i thought of the old feud and hatred i thought of my pride and traditions they seemed like the dust and ashes of outworn thingsthings to be smiled at and cast aside i took out all the letters i had writtenall except the last onesealed them up in a parcel and directed it to alan fraser then summoning my groom i bade him ride to glenellyn with it his look of amazement almost made me laugh but after he was gone i felt dizzy and frightened at my own daring  when the autumn darkness came down i went to my room and dressed as the woman dresses who awaits the one man of all the world i hardly knew what i hoped or expected but i was all athrill with a nameless inexplicable happiness i admit i looked very eagerly into the mirror when i was done and i thought that the result was not unpleasing beauty had never been mine but a faint reflection of it came over me in the tremulous flush and excitement of the moment then the maid came up to tell me that alan fraser was in the library  i went down with my cold hands tightly clasped behind me he was standing by the library table a tall broadshouldered man with the light striking upward on his dark sensitive face and irongrey hair when he saw me he came quickly forward  so you knowand you are not angryyour letters told me so much i have loved you since that day in the beech wood isobelisobel  his eyes were kindling into mine he held my hands in a close impetuous clasp his voice was infinitely caressing as he pronounced my name i had never heard it since father diedi had never heard it at all so musically and tenderly uttered my ancestors might have turned in their graves just thenbut it mattered not living love had driven out dead hatred  isobel he went on there was one letter unansweredthe last  i went to my desk took out the last letter i had written and gave it to him in silence while he read it i stood in a shadowy corner and watched him wondering if life could always be as sweet as this when he had finished he turned to me and held out his arms i went to them as a bird to her nest and with his lips against mine the old feud was blotted out forever     the lifebook of uncle jesse   uncle jesse the name calls up the vision of him as i saw him so often in those two enchanted summers at golden gate as i saw him the first time when he stood in the open doorway of the little loweaved cottage on the harbour shore welcoming us to our new domicile with the gentle unconscious courtesy that became him so well a tall ungainly figure somewhat stooped yet suggestive of great strength and endurance a cleanshaven old face deeply lined and bronzed a thick mane of irongrey hair falling quite to his shoulders and a pair of remarkably blue deepset eyes which sometimes twinkled and sometimes dreamed but oftener looked out seaward with a wistful question in them as of one seeking something precious and lost i was to learn one day what it was for which uncle jesse looked  it cannot be denied that uncle jesse was a homely man his spare jaws rugged mouth and square brow were not fashioned on the lines of beauty but though at first sight you thought him plain you never thought anything more about itthe spirit shining through that rugged tenement beautified it so wholly  uncle jesse was quite keenly aware of his lack of outward comeliness and lamented it for he was a passionate worshipper of beauty in everything he told mother once that hed rather like to be made over again and made handsome  folks say im good he remarked whimsically but i sometimes wish the lord had made me only half as good and put the rest of it into looks but i reckon he knew what he was about as a good captain should some of us have to be homely or the purty oneslike miss mary therewouldnt show up so well  i was not in the least pretty but uncle jesse was always telling me i wasand i loved him for it he told the fib so prettily and sincerely that he almost made me believe it for the time being and i really think he believed it himself all women were lovely and of good report in his eyes because of one he had loved the only time i ever saw uncle jesse really angered was when someone in his hearing cast an aspersion on the character of a shore girl the wretched man who did it fairly cringed when uncle jesse turned on him with lightning of eye and thundercloud of brow at that moment i no longer found it hard to reconcile uncle jesses simple kindly personality with the wild adventurous life he had lived  we went to golden gate in the spring mothers health had not been good and her doctor recommended sea air and quiet uncle james when he heard it proposed that we take possession of a small cottage at golden gate to which he had recently fallen heir by the death of an old aunt who had lived in it  i havent been up to see it he said but it is just as aunt elizabeth left it and she was the pink of neatness the key is in the possession of an old sailor living nearbyjesse boyd is the name i think i imagine you can be very comfortable in it it is built right on the harbour shore inside the bar and it is within five minutes walk of the outside shore  uncle jamess offer fitted in very opportunely with our limp family purse and we straightway betook ourselves to golden gate we telegraphed to jesse boyd to have the house opened for us and one crisp spring day when a rollicking wind was scudding over the harbour and the dunes whipping the water into white caps and washing the sandshore with long lines of silvery breakers we alighted at the little station and walked the half mile to our new home leaving our goods and chattels to be carted over in the evening by an obliging station agents boy                                       our first glimpse of aunt elizabeths cottage was a delight to soul and sense it looked so like a big grey seashell stranded on the shore between it and the harbour was only a narrow strip of shingle and behind it was a gnarled and battered fir wood where the winds were in the habit of harping all sorts of weird and haunting music inside it was to prove even yet more quaint and delightful with its low darkbeamed ceilings and square deepset windows by which whether open or shut sea breezes entered at their own sweet will the view from our door was magnificent taking in the big harbour and sweeps of purple hills beyond the entrance of the harbour gave it its namea deep narrow channel between the bar of sand dunes on the one side and a steep high frowning red sandstone cliff on the other we appreciated its significance the first time we saw a splendid golden sunrise flooding it coming out of the wonderful sea and sky beyond and billowing through that narrow passage in waves of light truly it was a golden gate through which one might sail to faerie lands forlorn  as we went along the path to our little house we were agreeably surprised to see a blue spiral of smoke curling up from its big square chimney and the next moment uncle jesse we were calling him uncle jesse half an hour after we met him so it seems scarcely worthwhile to begin with anything else came to the door  welcome ladies he said holding out a big hard but scrupulously clean hand i thought youd be feeling a bit tired and hungry maybe so when i came over to open up i put on a fire and brewed you up a cup of tea i just delight in being neighbourly and taint often i have the chance  we found that uncle jesses cup of tea meant a veritable spread he had aired the little dining room set out the table daintily with aunt elizabeths china and linenknowed jest where to put my hands on emoften and often helped old miss kennedy wash em we were cronies her and me i miss her terribleand adorned it with mayflowers which as we afterwards discovered he had tramped several miles to gather there was good bread and butter store biscuits a dish of tea fit for the gods on high olympus and a platter of the most delicious sea trout done to a turn  thought theyd be tasty after travelling said uncle jesse theyre fresh as trout can be maam two hours ago they was swimming in johnsons pond yander i caught emyes maam its about all im good for now catching trout and cod occasional but twerent always sonot by no manner of means i used to do other things as youd admit if you saw my lifebook  i was so hungry and tired that i did not then rise to the bait of uncle jesses lifebook i simply wanted to begin on those trout mother insisted that uncle jesse sit down and help us eat the repast he had prepared and he assented without undue coaxing  thank ye kindly twill be a real treat i mostly has to eat my meals alone with the reflection of my ugly old phiz in a looking glass opposite for company tisnt often i have the chance to sit down with two such sweet purty ladies  uncle jesses compliments look bald enough on paper but he paid them with such gracious gentle deference of tone and look that the woman who received them felt that she was being offered a queens gift in kingly fashion  he broke bread with us and from that moment we were all friends together and forever after we had eaten all we could we sat at our table for an hour and listened to uncle jesse telling us stories of his life  if i talk too much you must jest check me he said seriously but with a twinkle in his eyes when i do get a chance to talk to anyone im apt to run on terrible  he had been a sailor from the time he was ten years old and some of his adventures had such a marvellous edge that i secretly wondered if uncle jesse were not drawing a rather long bow at our credulous expense but in this as i found later i did him injustice his tales were all literally true and uncle jesse had the gift of the born storyteller whereby unhappy faroff things can be brought vividly before the hearer and made to live again in all their pristine poignancy  mother and i laughed and shivered over uncle jesses tales and once we found ourselves crying uncle jesse surveyed our tears with pleasure shining out through his face like an illuminating lamp  i like to make folks cry that way he remarked its a compliment but i cant do justice to the things ive seen and helped do ive got em all jotted down in my lifebook but i havent got the knack of writing them out properly if i had i could make a great book if i had the knack of hitting on just the right words and stringing everything together proper on paper but i cant its in this poor human critter uncle jesse patted his breast sorrowfully but he cant get it out  when uncle jesse went home that evening mother asked him to come often to see us  i wonder if youd give that invitation if you knew how likely id be to accept it he remarked whimsically  which is another way of saying you wonder if i meant it smiled mother i do most heartily and sincerely  then ill come youll likely be pestered with me at any hour and id be proud to have you drop over to visit me now and then too i live on that point yander neither me nor my house is worth coming to see its only got one room and a loft and a stovepipe sticking out of the roof for a chimney but ive got a few little things lying around that i picked up in the queer corners i used to be poking my nose into mebbe theyd interest you  uncle jesses few little things turned out to be the most interesting collection of curios i had ever seen his one neat little living room was full of thembeautiful hideous or quaint as the case might be and almost all having some weird or exciting story attached  mother and i had a beautiful summer at golden gate we lived the life of two children with uncle jesse as a playmate our housekeeping was of the simplest description and we spent our hours rambling along the shores reading on the rocks or sailing over the harbour in uncle jesses trim little boat every day we loved the simplesouled true manly old sailor more and more he was as refreshing as a sea breeze as interesting as some ancient chronicle we never tired of listening to his stories and his quaint remarks and comments were a continual delight to us uncle jesse was one of those interesting and rare people who in the picturesque phraseology of the shore folks never speak but they say something the milk of human kindness and the wisdom of the serpent were mingled in uncle jesses composition in delightful proportions  one day he was absent all day and returned at nightfall  took a tramp back yander back yander with uncle jesse might mean the station hamlet or the city a hundred miles away or any place betweento carry mr kimball a mess of trout he likes one occasional and its all i can do for a kindness he did me once i stayed all day to talk to him he likes to talk to me though hes an eddicated man because hes one of the folks thats got to talk or theyre miserable and he finds listeners scarce round here the folks fight shy of him because they think hes an infidel he aint that far gone exactlyfew men is i reckonbut hes what you might call a heretic heretics are wicked but theyre mighty interesting its just that theyve got sorter lost looking for god being under the impression that hes hard to findwhich he aint never most of em blunder to him after a while i guess i dont think listening to mr kimballs arguments is likely to do me much harm mind you i believe what i was brought up to believe it saves a vast of troubleand back of it all god is good the trouble with mr kimball is hes a leetle too clever he thinks hes bound to live up to his cleverness and that its smarter to thrash out some new way of getting to heaven than to go by the old track the common ignorant folks is travelling but hell get there sometime all right and then hell laugh at himself                                       nothing ever seemed to put uncle jesse out or depress him in any way  ive kind of contracted a habit of enjoying things he remarked once when mother had commented on his invariable cheerfulness its got so chronic that i believe i even enjoy the disagreeable things its great fun thinking they cant last old rheumatiz i says when it grips me hard youve got to stop aching sometime the worse you are the sooner youll stop perhaps im bound to get the better of you in the long run whether in the body or out of the body  uncle jesse seldom came to our house without bringing us something even if it were only a bunch of sweet grass  i favour the smell of sweet grass he said it always makes me think of my mother  she was fond of it  not that i knows on dunnos she ever saw any sweet grass no its because it has a kind of motherly perfumenot too young you understandsomething kind of seasoned and wholesome and dependablejust like a mother  uncle jesse was a very early riser he seldom missed a sunrise  ive seen all kinds of sunrises come in through that there gate he said dreamily one morning when i myself had made a heroic effort at early rising and joined him on the rocks halfway between his house and ours ive been all over the world and take it all in all ive never seen a finer sight than a summer sunrise out there beyant the gate a man cant pick his time for dying maryjest got to go when the captain gives his sailing orders but if i could id go out when the morning comes in there at the gate ive watched it a many times and thought what a thing it would be to pass out through that great white glory to whatever was waiting beyant on a sea that aint mapped out on any airthly chart i think mary id find lost margaret there  he had already told me the story of lost margaret as he always called her he rarely spoke of her but when he did his love for her trembled in every tonea love that had never grown faint or forgetful uncle jesse was seventy it was fifty years since lost margaret had fallen asleep one day in her fathers dory and driftedas was supposed for nothing was ever known certainly of her fateacross the harbour and out of the gate to perish in the black thunder squall that had come up suddenly that longago afternoon but to uncle jesse those fifty years were but as yesterday when it is past  i walked the shore for months after that he said sadly looking to find her dear sweet little body but the sea never gave her back to me but ill find her sometime i wisht i could tell you just how she looked but i cant ive seen a fine silvery mist hanging over the gate at sunrise that seemed like herand then again ive seen a white birch in the woods back yander that made me think of her she had pale brown hair and a little white face and long slender fingers like yours mary only browner for she was a shore girl sometimes i wake up in the night and hear the sea calling to me in the old way and it seems as if lost margaret called in it and when theres a storm and the waves are sobbing and moaning i hear her lamenting among them and when they laugh on a gay day its her laughlost margarets sweet little laugh the sea took her from me but some day ill find her mary it cant keep us apart forever  i had not been long at golden gate before i saw uncle jesses lifebook as he quaintly called it he needed no coaxing to show it and he proudly gave it to me to read it was an old leatherbound book filled with the record of his voyages and adventures i thought what a veritable treasure trove it would be to a writer every sentence was a nugget in itself the book had no literary merit uncle jesses charm of storytelling failed him when he came to pen and ink he could only jot down roughly the outlines of his famous tales and both spelling and grammar were sadly askew but i felt that if anyone possessing the gift could take that simple record of a brave adventurous life reading between the bald lines the tale of dangers staunchly faced and duties manfully done a wonderful story might be made from it pure comedy and thrilling tragedy were both lying hidden in uncle jesses lifebook waiting for the touch of the magicians hand to waken the laughter and grief and horror of thousands i thought of my cousin robert kennedy who juggled with words in a masterly fashion but complained that he found it hard to create incidents or characters here were both ready to his hand but robert was in japan in the interests of his paper  in the fall when the harbour lay black and sullen under november skies mother and i went back to town parting with uncle jesse regretfully we wanted him to visit us in town during the winter but he shook his head  its too far away mary if lost margaret called me i mightnt hear her there i must be here when my time comes it cant be very far off now  i wrote often to uncle jesse through the winter and sent him books and magazines he enjoyed them but he thoughtand truly enoughthat none of them came up to his lifebook for real interest  if my lifebook could be took and writ by someone that knowed how it would beat them holler he wrote in one of his few letters to me  in the spring we returned joyfully to golden gate it was as golden as ever and the harbour as blue the winds still rollicked as gaily and sweetly and the breakers boomed outside the bar as of yore all was unchanged save uncle jesse he had aged greatly and seemed frail and bent after he had gone home from his first call on us mother cried  uncle jesse will soon be going to seek lost margaret she said  in june robert came i took him promptly over to see uncle jesse who was very much excited when he found that robert was a real writing man  robert wants to hear some of your stories uncle jesse i said tell him the one about the captain who went crazy and imagined he was the flying dutchman  this was uncle jesses best story it was a compound of humour and horror and though i had heard it several times i laughed as heartily and shivered as fearsomely over it as robert did other tales followed uncle jesse told how his vessel had been run down by a steamer how he had been boarded by malay pirates how his ship had caught fire how he had helped a political prisoner escape from a south american republic he never said a boastful word but it was impossible to help seeing what a hero the man had beenbrave true resourceful unselfish skilful he sat there in his poor little room and made those things live again for us by a lift of the eyebrow a twist of the lip a gesture a word he painted some whole scene or character so that we saw it as it was  finally he lent robert his lifebook robert sat up all night reading it and came to the breakfast table in great excitement  mary this is a wonderful book if i could take it and garb it properlywork it up into a systematic whole and string it on the thread of uncle jesses romance of lost margaret it would be the novel of the year do you suppose he would let me do it  let you i think he would be delighted i answered  and he was he was as excited as a schoolboy over it at last his cherished dream was to be realized and his lifebook given to the world  well collaborate said robert you will give the soul and i the body oh well write a famous book between us uncle jesse and well get right to work  uncle jesse was a happy man that summer he looked upon the little back room we gave up to robert for a study as a sacred shrine robert talked everything over with uncle jesse but would not let him see the manuscript you must wait till it is published he said then youll get it all at once in its best shape  robert delved into the treasures of the lifebook and used them freely he dreamed and brooded over lost margaret until she became a vivid reality to him and lived in his pages as the book progressed it took possession of him and he worked at it with feverish eagerness he let me read the manuscript and criticize it and the concluding chapter of the book which the critics later on were pleased to call idyllic was modelled after my suggestions so that i felt as if i had a share in it too  it was autumn when the book was finished robert went back to town but mother and i decided to stay at golden gate all winter we loved the spot and besides i wished to remain for uncle jesses sake he was failing all the time and after robert went and the excitement of the bookmaking was past he failed still more rapidly his tramping expeditions were over and he seldom went out in his boat neither did he talk a great deal he liked to come over and sit silently for hours at our seaward window looking out wistfully toward the gate with his swiftly whitening head leaning on his hand the only keen interest he still had was in roberts book he waited and watched impatiently for its publication  i want to live till i see it he said just that longthen ill be ready to go he said it would be out in the springi must hang on till it comes mary  there were times when i doubted sadly if he would hang on as the winter wore away he grew frailer and frailer but ever he looked forward to the coming of spring and the book his book transformed and glorified  one day in young april the book came at last uncle jesse had gone to the post office faithfully every day for a month expecting it but this day he was too feeble to go and i went for him the book was there it was called simply the lifebook of jesse boyd and on the title page the names of robert kennedy and jesse boyd were printed as collaborators  i shall never forget uncle jesses face as i handed it to him i came away and left him reading it oblivious to all else all night the light burned in his window and i looked out across the sands to it and pictured the delight of the old man poring over the printed pages whereon his own life was portrayed i wondered how he would like the endingthe ending i had suggested i was never to know  after breakfast i went over to uncle jesses house taking some little delicacy mother had cooked for him it was an exquisite morning full of delicate spring tints and sounds the harbour was sparkling and dimpling like a girl the winds were playing hide and seek roguishly among the stunted firs and the silverflashing gulls were soaring over the bar beyond the gate was a shining wonderful sea  when i reached the little house on the point i saw the lamp still burning wanly in the window a quick alarm struck at my heart without waiting to knock i lifted the latch and entered  uncle jesse was lying on the old sofa by the window with the book clasped to his heart his eyes were closed and on his face was a look of the most perfect peace and happinessthe look of one who has long sought and found at last  we could not know at what hour he had died but somehow i think he had his wish and went out when the morning came in through the golden gate out on that shining tide his spirit drifted over the sunrise sea of pearl and silver to the haven where lost margaret waited beyond the storms and calms     the little black doll   everybody in the marshall household was excited on the evening of the concert at the harbour light hoteleverybody even to little joyce who couldnt go to the concert because there wasnt anybody else to stay with denise perhaps denise was the most excited of them alldenise who was slowly dying of consumption in the marshall kitchen chamber because there was no other place in the world for her to die in or anybody to trouble about her mrs roderick marshall thought it very good of herself to do so much for denise to be sure denise was not much bother and little joyce did most of the waiting on her  at the tea table nothing was talked of but the concert for was not madame laurin the great french canadian prima donna at the hotel and was she not going to sing it was the opportunity of a lifetimethe marshalls would not have missed it for anything stately handsome old grandmother marshall was going and uncle roderick and aunt isabella and of course chrissie who was always taken everywhere because she was pretty and graceful and everything that little joyce was not  little joyce would have liked to go to the concert for she was very fond of music and besides she wanted to be able to tell denise all about it but when you are shy and homely and thin and awkward your grandmother never takes you anywhere at least such was little joyces belief  little joyce knew quite well that grandmother marshall did not like her she thought it was because she was so plain and awkwardand in part it was grandmother marshall cared very little for granddaughters who did not do her credit but little joyces mother had married a poor man in the face of her familys disapproval and then both she and her husband had been inconsiderate enough to die and leave a small orphan without a penny to support her grandmother marshall fed and clothed the child but who could make anything of such a shy creature with no gifts or graces whatever grandmother marshall had no intention of trying chrissie the goldenhaired and pinkcheeked was grandmother marshalls pet  little joyce knew this she did not envy chrissie but oh how she wished grandmother marshall would love her a little too nobody loved her but denise and the little black doll and little joyce was beginning to understand that denise would not be in the kitchen chamber very much longer and the little black doll couldnt tell you she loved youalthough she did of course little joyce had no doubt at all on this point  little joyce sighed so deeply over this thought that uncle roderick smiled at her uncle roderick did smile at her sometimes  what is the matter little joyce he asked  i was thinking about my black doll said little joyce timidly  ah your black doll if madame laurin were to see it shed likely want it she makes a hobby of collecting dolls all over the world but i doubt if she has in her collection a doll that served to amuse a little girl four thousand years ago in the court of the pharaohs  i think joyces black doll is very ugly said chrissie my wax doll with the yellow hair is ever so much prettier  my black doll isnt ugly cried little joyce indignantly she could endure to be called ugly herself but she could not bear to have her darling black doll called ugly in her excitement she upset her cup of tea over the tablecloth aunt isabella looked angry and grandmother marshall said sharply joyce leave the table you grow more awkward and careless every day  little joyce on the verge of tears crept away and went up the kitchen stairs to denise to be comforted but denise herself had been crying she lay on her little bed by the low window where the glow of the sunset was coming in her hollow cheeks were scarlet with fever  oh i want so much to hear madame laurin sing she sobbed i feel lak i could die easier if i hear her sing just one leetle song she is frenchwoman too and she sing all de ole french songsde ole songs my mudder sing long go oh i so want to hear madame laurin sing  but you cant dear denise said little joyce very softly stroking denises hot forehead with her cool slender hand little joyce had very pretty hands only nobody had ever noticed them you are not strong enough to go to the concert ill sing for you if you like of course i cant sing very well but ill do my best  you sing lak a sweet bird but you are not madame laurin said denise restlessly it is de great madame i want to hear i haf not long to live oh i know leetle joycei know what de doctor look lakand i want to hear madame laurin sing fore i die i know it is impossiblebut i long for it sojust one leetle song  denise put her thin hands over her face and sobbed again little joyce went and sat down by the window looking out into the white birches her heart ached bitterly dear denise was going to die soonoh very soon little joyce wise and knowing beyond her years saw that and denise wanted to hear madame laurin sing it seemed a foolish thing to think of but little joyce thought hard about it and when she had finished thinking she got her little black doll and took it to bed with her and there she cried herself to sleep  at the breakfast table next morning the marshalls talked about the concert and the wonderful madame laurin little joyce listened in her usual silence her crying the night before had not improved her looks any never thought handsome grandmother marshall had she appeared so sallow and homely really grandmother marshall could not have the patience to look at her she decided that she would not take joyce driving with her and chrissie that afternoon as she had thought of after all  in the forenoon it was discovered that denise was much worse and the doctor was sent for he came and shook his head that being really all he could do under the circumstances when he went away he was waylaid at the back door by a small gypsy with big black serious eyes and long black hair  is denise going to die little joyce asked in the blunt straightforward fashion grandmother marshall found so trying  the doctor looked at her from under his shaggy brows and decided that here was one of the people to whom you might as well tell the truth first as last because they are bound to have it  yes he said  soon  very soon im afraid in a few days at most  thank you said little joyce gravely  she went to her room and did something with the black doll she did not cry but if you could have seen her face you would have wished she would cry  after dinner grandmother marshall and chrissie drove away and uncle roderick and aunt isabella went away too little joyce crept up to the kitchen chamber denise was lying in an uneasy sleep with tear stains on her face then little joyce tiptoed down and sped away to the hotel  she did not know just what she would say or do when she got there but she thought hard all the way to the end of the shore road when she came out to the shore a lady was sitting alone on a big rocka lady with a dark beautiful face and wonderful eyes little joyce stopped before her and looked at her meditatively perhaps it would be well to ask advice of this lady  if you please said little joyce who was never shy with strangers for whose opinion she didnt care at all i want to see madame laurin at the hotel and ask her to do me a very great favour will you tell me the best way to go about seeing her i shall be much obliged to you  what is the favour you want to ask of madame laurin inquired the lady smiling  i want to ask her if she will come and sing for denise before she diesbefore denise dies i mean denise is our french girl and the doctor says she cannot live very long and she wishes with all her heart to hear madame laurin sing it is very bitter you know to be dying and want something very much and not be able to get it  do you think madame laurin will go asked the lady  i dont know i am going to offer her my little black doll if she will not come for that there is nothing else i can do  a flash of interest lighted up the ladys brown eyes she bent forward  is it your doll you have in that box will you let me see it  little joyce nodded mutely she opened the box and took out the black doll the lady gave an exclamation of amazed delight and almost snatched it from little joyce it was a very peculiar little doll indeed carved out of some black polished wood  child where in the world did you get this she cried  father got it out of a grave in egypt said little joyce it was buried with the mummy of a little girl who lived four thousand years ago uncle roderick says she must have loved her doll very much to have had it buried with her mustnt she but she could not have loved it any more than i do  and yet you are going to give it away said the lady looking at her keenly  for denises sake explained little joyce i would do anything for denise because i love her and she loves me when the only person in the world who loves you is going to die there is nothing you would not do for her if you could denise was so good to me before she took sick she used to kiss me and play with me and make little cakes for me and tell me beautiful stories  the lady put the little black doll back in the box then she stood up and held out her hand  come she said i am madame laurin and i shall go and sing for denise  little joyce piloted madame laurin home and into the kitchen and up the back stairs to the kitchen chambera proceeding which would have filled aunt isabella with horror if she had known but madame laurin did not seem to mind and little joyce never thought about it at all it was little joyces awkward unmarshalllike fashion to go to a place by the shortest way there even if it was up the kitchen stairs  madame laurin stood in the bare little room and looked pityingly at the wasted wistful face on the pillow  this is madame laurin and she is going to sing for you denise whispered little joyce  denises face lighted up and she clasped her hands  if you please she said faintly a french song madamede ole french song dey sing long go  then did madame laurin sing never had that kitchen chamber been so filled with glorious melody song after song she sangthe old folklore songs of the habitant the songs perhaps that evangeline listened to in her childhood  little joyce knelt by the bed her eyes on the singer like one entranced denise lay with her face full of joy and rapturesuch joy and rapture little joyce did not regret the sacrifice of her black dollnever could regret it as long as she remembered denises look  tank you madame said denise brokenly when madame ceased dat was so beautifulde angel dey cannot sing more sweet i love music so much madame leetle joyce she sing to me often and oftenshe sing sweet but not lak youoh not lak you  little joyce must sing for me said madame smiling as she sat down by the window i always like to hear fresh childish voices will you little joyce  oh yes little joyce was quite unembarrassed and perfectly willing to do anything she could for this wonderful woman who had brought that look to denises face i will sing as well as i can for you of course i cant sing very well and i dont know anything but hymns i always sing hymns for denise although she is a catholic and the hymns are protestant but her priest told her it was all right because all music was of god denises priest is a very nice man and i like him he thought my little black dollyour little black dollwas splendid ill sing lead kindly light that is denises favourite hymn  then little joyce slipping her hand into denises began to sing at the first note madame laurin who had been gazing out of the window with a rather listless smile turned quickly and looked at little joyce with amazed eyes delight followed amazement and when little joyce had finished the great madame rose impulsively her face and eyes glowing stepped swiftly to little joyce and took the thin dark face between her gemmed hands  child do you know what a wonderful voice you havewhat a marvellous voice it isit isi never heard such a voice in a child of your age mine was nothing to itnothing at all you will be a great singer some dayfar greater than iyes but you must have the training where are your parents i must see them  i have no parents said the bewildered little joyce i belong to grandmother marshall and she is out driving  then i shall wait until your grandmother marshall comes home from her drive said madame laurin decidedly  half an hour later a very much surprised old lady was listening to madame laurins enthusiastic statements  how is it i have never heard you sing if you can sing so well asked grandmother marshall looking at little joyce with something in her eyes that had never been in them beforeas little joyce instantly felt to the core of her sensitive soul but little joyce hung her head it had never occurred to her to sing in grandmother marshalls presence  this child must be trained byandby said madame laurin if you cannot afford it mrs marshall i will see to it such a voice must not be wasted  thank you madame laurin said grandmother marshall with a gracious dignity but i am quite able to give my granddaughter all the necessary advantages for the development of her gift and i thank you very much for telling me of it  madame laurin bent and kissed little joyces brown cheek  little gypsy goodby but come every day to this hotel to see me and next summer i shall be back i like youbecause some day you will be a great singer and because today you are a loving unselfish baby  you have forgotten the little black doll madame said little joyce gravely  madame threw up her hands laughing no no i shall not take your little black doll of the four thousand years keep it for a mascot a great singer always needs a mascot but do not i command you take it out of the box till i am gone for if i were to see it again i might not be able to resist the temptation some day i shall show you my dolls but there is not such a gem among them  when madame laurin had gone grandmother marshall looked at little joyce  come to my room joyce i want to see if we cannot find a more becoming way of arranging your hair it has grown so thick and long i had no idea how thick and long yes we must certainly find a better way than that stiff braid come  little joyce taking grandmother marshalls extended hand felt very happy she realized that this strange stately old lady who never liked little girls unless they were pretty or graceful or clever was beginning to love her at last     the man on the train   when the telegram came from william george grandma sheldon was all alone with cyrus and louise and cyrus and louise aged respectively twelve and eleven were not very much good grandma thought when it came to advising what was to be done grandma was all in a flutter dear oh dear as she said  the telegram said that delia william georges wife was seriously ill down at green village and william george wanted samuel to bring grandma down immediately delia had always thought there was nobody like grandma when it came to nursing sick folks  but samuel and his wife were both awayhad been away for two days and intended to be away for five more they had driven to sinclair twenty miles away to visit with mrs samuels folks for a week  dear oh dear what shall i do said grandma  go right to green village on the evening train said cyrus briskly  dear oh dear and leave you two alone cried grandma  louise and i will do very well until tomorrow said cyrus sturdily we will send word to sinclair by todays mail and father and mother will be home by tomorrow night  but i never was on the cars in my life protested grandma nervously imim so frightened to start alone and you never know what kind of people you may meet on the train  youll be all right grandma ill drive you to the station get you your ticket and put you on the train then youll have nothing to do until the train gets to green village ill send a telegram to uncle william george to meet you  i shall fall and break my neck getting off the train said grandma pessimistically but she was wondering at the same time whether she had better take the black valise or the yellow and whether william george would be likely to have plenty of flaxseed in the house  it was six miles to the station and cyrus drove grandma over in time to catch a train that reached green village at nine oclock  dear oh dear said grandma what if william georges folks aint there to meet me its all very well cyrus to say that they will be there but you dont know and its all very well to say not to be nervous because everything will be all right if you were seventyfive years old and had never set foot on the cars in your life youd be nervous too and you cant be sure that everything will be all right you never know what sort of people youll meet on the train i may get on the wrong train or lose my ticket or get carried past green village or get my pocket picked well no i wont do that for not one cent will i carry with me you shall take back home all the money you dont need to get my ticket then i shall be easier in my mind dear oh dear if it wasnt that delia is so seriously ill i wouldnt go one step  oh youll be all right grandma assured cyrus  he got grandmas ticket for her and grandma tied it up in the corner of her handkerchief then the train came in and grandma clinging closely to cyrus was put on it cyrus found a comfortable seat for her and shook hands cheerily  goodbye grandma dont be frightened heres the weekly argus i got it at the store you may like to look over it  then cyrus was gone and in a minute the station house and platform began to glide away  dear oh dear what has happened to it thought grandma in dismay the next moment she exclaimed aloud why its us thats moving not it  some of the passengers smiled pleasantly at grandma she was the variety of old lady at which people do smile pleasantly a grandma with round pink cheeks soft brown eyes and lovely snowwhite curls is a nice person to look at wherever she is found  after a while grandma to her amazement discovered that she liked riding on the cars it was not at all the disagreeable experience she had expected it to be why she was just as comfortable as if she were in her own rocking chair at home and there was such a lot of people to look at and many of the ladies had such beautiful dresses and hats after all the people you met on a train thought grandma are surprisingly like the people you meet off it if it had not been for wondering how she would get off at green village grandma would have enjoyed herself thoroughly  four or five stations farther on the train halted at a lonelylooking place consisting of the station house and a barn surrounded by scrub woods and blueberry barrens one passenger got on and finding only one vacant seat in the crowded car sat right down beside grandma sheldon  grandma sheldon held her breath while she looked him over was he a pickpocket he didnt appear like one but you can never be sure of the people you meet on the train grandma remembered with a sigh of thankfulness that she had no money  besides he seemed really very respectable and harmless he was quietly dressed in a suit of darkblue serge with a black overcoat he wore his hat well down on his forehead and was clean shaven his hair was very black but his eyes were bluenice eyes grandma thought she always felt great confidence in a man who had bright open blue eyes grandpa sheldon who had died so long ago four years after their marriage had had bright blue eyes  to be sure he had fair hair reflected grandma its real odd to see such black hair with such light blue eyes well hes real nice looking and i dont believe theres a mite of harm in him  the early autumn night had now fallen and grandma could not amuse herself by watching the scenery she bethought herself of the paper cyrus had given her and took it out of her basket it was an old weekly a fortnight back on the first page was a long account of a murder case with scare heads and into this grandma plunged eagerly sweet old grandma sheldon who would not have harmed a fly and hated to see even a mousetrap set simply revelled in the newspaper accounts of murders and the more shocking and coldblooded they were the more eagerly did grandma read of them  this murder story was particularly good from grandmas point of view it was full of thrills a man had been shot down apparently in cold blood and his supposed murderer was still at large and had eluded all the efforts of justice to capture him his name was mark hartwell and he was described as a tall fair man with full auburn beard and curly light hair  what a shocking thing said grandma aloud  her companion looked at her with a kindly amused smile  what is it he asked  why this murder at charlotteville answered grandma forgetting in her excitement that it was not safe to talk to people you meet on the train it just makes my blood run cold to read about it and to think that the man who did it is still around the country somewhereplotting other murders i havent a doubt what is the good of the police  theyre dull fellows agreed the dark man  but i dont envy that man his conscience said grandma solemnlyand somewhat inconsistently in view of her statement about the other murders that were being plotted what must a man feel like who has the blood of a fellow creature on his hands depend upon it his punishment has begun already caught or not  that is true said the dark man quietly  such a goodlooking man too said grandma looking wistfully at the murderers picture it doesnt seem possible that he can have killed anybody but the paper says there isnt a doubt  he is probably guilty said the dark man but nothing is known of his provocation the affair may not have been so coldblooded as the accounts state those newspaper fellows never err on the side of undercolouring  i really think said grandma slowly that i would like to see a murdererjust one whenever i say anything like that adelaideadelaide is samuels wifelooks at me as if she thought there was something wrong about me and perhaps there is but i do all the same when i was a little girl there was a man in our settlement who was suspected of poisoning his wife she died very suddenly i used to look at him with such interest but it wasnt satisfactory because you could never be sure whether he was really guilty or not i never could believe that he was because he was such a nice man in some ways and so good and kind to children i dont believe a man who was bad enough to poison his wife could have any good in him  perhaps not agreed the dark man he had absentmindedly folded up grandmas old copy of the argus and put it in his pocket grandma did not like to ask him for it although she would have liked to see if there were any more murder stories in it besides just at that moment the conductor came around for tickets  grandma looked in the basket for her handkerchief it was not there she looked on the floor and on the seat and under the seat it was not there she stood up and shook herselfstill no handkerchief  dear oh dear exclaimed grandma wildly ive lost my ticketi always knew i wouldi told cyrus i would oh where can it be  the conductor scowled unsympathetically the dark man got up and helped grandma search but no ticket was to be found  youll have to pay the money then and something extra said the conductor gruffly  i canti havent a cent of money wailed grandma i gave it all to cyrus because i was afraid my pocket would be picked oh what shall i do  dont worry ill make it all right said the dark man he took out his pocketbook and handed the conductor a bill that functionary grumblingly made the change and marched onward while grandma pale with excitement and relief sank back into her seat  i cant tell you how much i am obliged to you sir she said tremulously i dont know what i should have done would he have put me off right here in the snow  i hardly think he would have gone to such lengths said the dark man with a smile but hes a cranky disobliging fellow enoughi know him of old and you must not feel overly grateful to me i am glad of the opportunity to help you i had an old grandmother myself once he added with a sigh  you must give me your name and address of course said grandma and my sonsamuel sheldon of midvernewill see that the money is returned to you well this is a lesson to me ill never trust myself on a train again and all i wish is that i was safely off this one this fuss has worked my nerves all up again  dont worry grandma ill see you safely off the train when we get to green village  will you though will you now said grandma eagerly ill be real easy in my mind then she added with a returning smile i feel as if i could trust you for anythingand im a real suspicious person too  they had a long talk after thator rather grandma talked and the dark man listened and smiled she told him all about william george and delia and their baby and about samuel and adelaide and cyrus and louise and the three cats and the parrot he seemed to enjoy her accounts of them too  when they reached green village station he gathered up grandmas parcels and helped her tenderly off the train  anybody here to meet mrs sheldon he asked of the station master  the latter shook his head dont think so havent seen anybody here to meet anybody tonight  dear oh dear said poor grandma this is just what i expected theyve never got cyruss telegram well i might have known it what shall i do  how far is it to your sons asked the dark man  only half a milejust over the hill there but ill never get there alone this dark night  of course not but ill go with you the road is goodwell do finely  but that train wont wait for you gasped grandma half in protest  it doesnt matter the starmont freight passes here in half an hour and ill go on her come along grandma  oh but youre good said grandma some woman is proud to have you for a son  the man did not answer he had not answered any of the personal remarks grandma had made to him in her conversation  they were not long in reaching william george sheldons house for the village road was good and grandma was smart on her feet she was welcomed with eagerness and surprise  to think that there was no one to meet you exclaimed william george but i never dreamed of your coming by train knowing how you were set against it telegram no i got no telegram spose cyrus forgot to send it im most heartily obliged to you sir for looking after my mother so kindly  it was a pleasure said the dark man courteously he had taken off his hat and they saw a curious scar shaped like a large red butterfly high up on his forehead under his hair i am delighted to have been of any assistance to her  he would not wait for supperthe next train would be in and he must not miss it  there are people looking for me he said with his curious smile they will be much disappointed if they do not find me  he had gone and the whistle of the starmont freight had blown before grandma remembered that he had not given her his name and address  dear oh dear how are we ever going to send that money to him she exclaimed and he so nice and goodhearted  grandma worried over this for a week in the intervals of looking after delia one day william george came in with a large city daily in his hands he looked curiously at grandma and then showed her the frontpage picture of a man cleanshaven with an oddly shaped scar high up on his forehead  did you ever see that man mother he asked  of course i did said grandma excitedly why its the man i met on the train who is he what is his name now well know where to send  that is mark hartwell who shot amos gray at charlotteville three weeks ago said william george quietly  grandma looked at him blankly for a moment  it couldnt be she gasped at last that man a murderer ill never believe it  its true enough mother the whole story is here he had shaved his beard and dyed his hair and came near getting clear out of the country they were on his trail the day he came down in the train with you and lost it because of his getting off to bring you here his disguise was so perfect that there was little fear of his being recognized so long as he hid that scar but it was seen in montreal and he was run to earth there he has made a full confession  i dont care cried grandma valiantly ill never believe he was all bada man who would do what he did for a poor old woman like me when he was flying for his life too no no there was good in him even if he did kill that man and im sure he must feel terrible over it  in this view grandma persisted she never would say or listen to a word against mark hartwell and she had only pity for him whom everyone else condemned with her own trembling hands she wrote him a letter to accompany the money samuel sent before hartwell was taken to the penitentiary for life she thanked him again for his kindness to her and assured him that she knew he was sorry for what he had done and that she would pray for him every night of her life mark hartwell had been hard and defiant enough but the prison officials told that he cried like a child over grandma sheldons little letter  theres nobody all bad says grandma when she relates the story i used to believe a murderer must be but i know better now i think of that poor man often and often he was so kind and gentle to mehe must have been a good boy once i write him a letter every christmas and i send him tracts and papers hes my own little charity but ive never been on the cars since and i never will be again you never can tell what will happen to you or what sort of people youll meet if you trust yourself on a train     the romance of jedediah   jedediah was not a name that savoured of romance his last name was crane which is little better and it would be no use to call this story mattie adamss romance because mattie adams is not a romantic name either but names have really nothing to do with romance the most exciting and tragic affair i ever knew was between a man named silas putdammer and a woman named kezia cullenwhich has nothing to do with the present story  jedediah to all outward seeming did not appear to be any more romantic than his name he looked distinctly commonplace as he rode comfortably along the winding country road that was dreaming in the haze and sunshine of a midsummer afternoon he was perched on the seat of a bright red pedlars wagon above and behind a dusty ambling red pony of that peculiar gait and appearance pertaining to the ponies of country pedlarsa certain placid unhasting leanness as of a nag that has encountered troubles of his own and has lived them down by sheer patience and staying power from the bright red wagon proceeded a certain metallic rumbling and clinking as it bowled along and two or three nests of tin pans on its flat ropeencircled top flashed back the light so dazzlingly that jedediah seemed the beaming sun of a little planetary system all his own a new broom sticking up aggressively at each of the four corners gave the wagon a resemblance to a triumphal chariot  jedediah himself had not been in the tinpeddling business long enough to acquire the apologetic outatelbows appearance which distinguishes a tin pedlar from other kinds of pedlars in fact this was his maiden venture in this line hence he still looked plump and selfrespecting he had a round red face under his plug hat twinkling blue eyes and a little pursedup mouth the shape of which was partly due to nature and partly to much whistling jedediahs pudgy body was clothed in a suit of large light checks and he wore a bright pink necktie and an amethyst pin will i still be believed when i assert that in spite of all this jedediah was full of and bubbling over with romance  romance cares not for appearances and apparently delights in contradictions the homely shambling man you pass unnoticed on the street may have tucked away in his past a story more exciting and thrilling than anything you have ever read in fiction so it was in a measure with jedediah poor unknown to fame afflicted with a double chin and bald spot reduced to driving a tinwagon for a living he yet had his romance and he was still romantic  as jedediah rode through amberley he looked about him with interest he knew it well although it was fifteen years since he had seen it he had been born and brought up in amberley he had left it at the age of twentyfive to make his fortune but amberley was amberley still jedediah found it hard to believe that it or himself was fifteen years older  theres the stanton place he said charlie has painted the house yellowit used to be white and bob hollman has cut the trees down behind the blacksmith forge bob never had any poetry in his soulno romance as you might say he was what you might call a plodderyou might call him that get up my nag get up theres the old harkness placeseems to be spruced up considerable folks used to say if ye wanted to see how the world looked the morning after the flood just go into george harknesss barnyard on a rainy day the pond and the old hills aint changed any get up my nag get up theres the adams homestead do i really behold it again  jedediah thought the moment deliciously romantic he revelled in it and to match his exhilarated mood he touched the pony with his whip and went clinking and glittering down the hill under the poplars at a dashing rate he had not intended to offer his wares in amberley that day he meant to break the ice in occidental the village beyond but he could not pass the adams place when he came to the open gate he turned in under the willows and drove down the wide shady lane girt on both sides with a trim white paling smothered in lavish sweetbriar bushes that were gay with bloom jedediahs heart was beating furiously under his checks  what a fool you are jed crane he told himself you used to be a young fool and now youre an old one sad that get up my nag get up its a poor lookout for a man of your years jed dont get excited it aint the least likely that mattie adams is here yet shes married and gone years ago no doubt its probable theres no adamses here at all now but its romantic yes its romantic its splendid get up my nag get up  the adams place itself was not unromantic the house was a large oldfashioned white one with green shutters and a front porch with grecian columns these were thought very elegant in amberley mrs carmody said they gave a house such a classical air in this instance the classical effect was somewhat smothered in honeysuckle which rioted over the whole porch and hung in pale yellow fragrant festoons over the rows of potted scarlet geraniums that flanked the green steps beyond the house a lowboughed orchard covered the slope between it and the main road and behind it there was a revel of colour betokening a flower garden  jedediah climbed down from his lofty seat and walked dubiously to a side door that looked more friendly despite its prim screen than the classical front porch as he drew near he saw a woman sitting behind the screena woman who rose as he approached and opened the door jedediahs heart had been beating a wild tattoo as he crossed the yard it now stopped altogetherat least he declared in later years it did  the woman was mattie adamsmattie adams fifteen years older than when he had seen her last plumper rosier somewhat broaderfaced but still unmistakably mattie adams jedediah felt that the situation was delicious  mattie he said holding out his hand  why jed how are you said mattie as if they had parted the week before it had always taken a great deal to disturb mattie whatever happened she was calm even an old lover and the only one she had ever possessed at that dropping so to speak from the skies after fifteen years disappearance did not ruffle her placidity  i didnt suppose youd know me mattie said jedediah still holding her hand foolishly  i knew you the minute i set eyes on you returned mattie youre some fatter and olderlike myselfbut youre jed still where have you been all these years  pretty near everywhere mattiepretty near everywhere and ye see what its come tohere i be driving a tinwagon for boone brothers business is businessdont you want to buy some new tinware  to himself jed thought it was romantic asking a woman whom he had loved all his life to buy tins on the occasion of their first meeting after fifteen years separation  i dont know but i do want a quart measure said mattie in her sweet unchanged voice but all in good time you must stay and have tea with me jed im all alone nowmother and father have gone unhitch your horse and put him in the third stall in the stable  jed hesitated  i ought to be getting on i spose he said wistfully i haint done much today  you must stay to tea interrupted mattie why jed theres ever so much to tell and ask and we cant stand here in the yard and talk look at selena there she is watching us from the kitchen window shell watch as long as we stand here  jed swung himself around over the little valley below the adams homestead was a steep treeless hill and on its crest was perched a bare farmhouse with windows stuck lavishly all over it at one of them a long pale face was visible  has selena been pasted up at that window ever since the last time we stood here and talked mattie asked jed half resentfully half amusedly it was characteristic of mattie to laugh first at the question and then blush over the memory it revived  most of the time i guess she said shortly but comecome in i never could talk under selenas eyes even if they were four hundred yards away  jed went in and stayed to tea the old adams pantry had not failed nor apparently the adams skill in cooking after tea jed hung around till sunset and drove away with a warm invitation from mattie to call every time his rounds took him through amberley as he went selenas face appeared at the window of the house over the valley  when he had gone mattie went around to the classical porch and sat herself down under the honeysuckle festoons that dangled above her smooth braids of fawncoloured hair she knew selena would be down posthaste presently agog with curiosity to find out who the pedlar was whom mattie had delighted to honour with an invitation to tea mattie preferred to meet selena out of doors it was easier to thrust and parry there meanwhile she wanted to think over things  fifteen years before jedediah crane had been mattie adamss beau jedediah was romantic even then but as he was a slim young fellow at the time with an abundance of fair curly hair and innocent blue eyes his romance was rather an attraction than not at least the then young and pretty mattie had found it so  the adamses looked with no favour on the match they were a thrifty welltodo folk as for the craneswell they were lazy and shiftless for the most part it would be a mésalliance for an adams to marry a crane still it would doubtless have happenedfor mattie though a meeklooking damsel had a mind of her ownhad it not been for selena ford matties older sister  selena people said had married james ford for no other reason than that his house commanded a view of nearly every dooryard in amberley this may or may not have been sheer malice certainly nothing that went on in the adams yard escaped selena  she watched mattie and jed in the moonlight one night she saw jed kiss mattie it was the first time he had ever done soand the last poor fellow for selena swooped down on her parents the next day such a storm did she brew up that mattie was forbidden to speak to jed again selena herself gave jed a piece of her mind jed usually was not afflicted with undue sensitiveness but he had some slumbering pride at the basis of his character and it was very stubborn when roused selena roused it jed vowed he would never creep and crawl at the feet of the adamses and he went west forthwith determined as aforesaid to make his fortune and hurl selenas scorn back in her face  and now he had come home driving a tinwagon mattie smiled to think of it she bore jed no ill will for his failure she felt sorry for him and inclined to think that fate had used him hardlyfate and selena together mattie had never had another beau people thought she was engaged to jed crane until her time for beaus went by mattie did not mind she had never liked anybody so well as jed to be sure she had not thought of him for years it was strange he should come back like thisromantic as he said himself  matties reverie was interrupted by selena angular paleeyed mrs ford was as unlike the plump rosy mattie as a sister could be perhaps her chronic curiosity which would not let her rest was accountable for her excessive leanness  who was that pedlar that was here this afternoon mattie she demanded as soon as she arrived  mattie smiled jed crane she said hes home from the west and driving a tinwagon for the boones  selena gave a little gasp she sat down on the lowest step and untied her bonnet strings  mattie adams and you kept him hanging about the whole afternoon  why not said mattie wickedly she liked to alarm selena jed and i were always beaus you know  mattie adams you dont mean to say youre going to make a fool of yourself over jed crane again a woman of your age  dont get excited selena implored mattie in the old days selena could cow her but that time was past i never saw the like of you for getting stirred up over nothing  im not excited im perfectly calm but i might well be excited over your folly mattie adams the idea of your taking up again with old jed crane  hes fifteen years younger than jim said mattie giving thrust for thrust  when selena had come over mattie had not the slightest idea of resuming her former relationship with the romantic jedediah she had merely shown him kindness for old friendships sake but so well did the unconscious selena work in jeds behalf that when she flounced off home in a pet mattie was resolved that she would take jed back if he wanted to come she wasnt going to put up with selenas everlasting interference she would show her that she was independent  when a week had passed jed came again he sold mattie a stewpan and he would not go in to tea this time but they stood and talked in the yard for the best part of an hour while selena glared at them from her kitchen window their conversation was most innocent and harmless being mainly gossip about what had come and gone during jeds exile but mattie knew that selena thought that she and jed were making love to each other in this shameless public fashion when jed went mattie more for selenas benefit than his broke off some sprays of honeysuckle and pinned them on his coat the fragrance went with jedediah as he drove through amberley and pleasant thoughts were born of it  its romantic he told the pony blessed if it aint romantic not that mattie cares anything about me now i know she dont but its just her kind way she wants to cheer me up and let me know ive a friend still get up my nag get up i aint one to persoom on her kindness neither i know my place but still say what you will its romanticthis sitooation this is it here i be loving the ground she walks on as ive always done and i cant let on that i do because im a poor neerdowell as aint fit to look at her an independent woman with property and shes ashowing kindness to me for old times sake and piercing my heart all the time not knowing why its romance with a vengeance thats what it is get up my nag get up  thereafter jed called at the adams place every week generally he stayed to tea mattie always bought something of him to colour an excuse her kitchen fairly glittered with new tinware she gave selena the overflow by way of heaping coals of fire  after every visit jedediah held stern counsel with himself and decided that he must not call to see mattie againat least not for a long time then he must not stay to tea he would struggle with himself all the way down the poplar hillnot without a comforting sense of the romance of the strugglebut it always ended the same way he turned in under the willows and clinked musically into matties yard at least the rattle of the tinwagon sounded musically to mattie  meanwhile selena watched from her window and raged  amberley people shrugged their shoulders when gossip noised the matter abroad but being goodhumoured in the main they forebore to do more than say that mattie adams was free to make a goose of herself if it pleased her and that jed crane wasnt such a fool as he looked the adams farm was one of the best in amberley and it had not grown any poorer under matties management  if jed walks in there and hangs up his hat hell have done well for himself after all  this was selenas view of it also barring the good nature she was furious at the whole affair and she did her best to make matties life a burden to her with slurs and thrusts but they all misjudged jed he had no intention of walking in and hanging up his hator trying to romantic as he was it never occurred to him that mattie might be as romantic as himself she did not care for him and anyhow he jed had a little too much pride to ask her a rich woman to marry him a poor man who had lost all caste he ever possessed by taking up tinpeddling jed was determined not to persoom and oh how deliciously romantic it all was he hugged himself with sorrowful delight over it  as the summer waned and the long yellow leaves began to fall thickly from the willows in the adams lane jed began to talk of going out west again tinpeddling was not possible in winter and he didnt think he would try it another summer mattie listened with dismay in her heart all summer she had made much of jed by way of tormenting selena but now she realized what he really meant to her the old love had wakened to life in her heart she could not let jed go out of her life again leaving her to the old loneliness if jed went away everything would be flat stale and unprofitable  she knew him to be at heart the kindest most gentle of human beings and the mere fact of his having been unsuccessful even what some of his old neighbours might call stupid did not change her feelings toward him in the least he was jedthat was sufficient for her and she had business capability enough for both when it came to that  mattie began to drop hints but jed would not take them true once or twice he thought that perhaps mattie did care a little for him yet but it would not do for him to take advantage of that  no i just couldnt do that he told the pony i worship the ground that woman treads on but it aint for the likes of me to tell her so not now get up my nag get up this has been a mighty pleasant summer with that visit to look forward to every week but its about over now and you must tramp jed  jed sighed he remembered that it was more romantic than ever but all at once this failed to comfort him romance up to a certain point was food beyond that it palled so to speak jeds romance failed him just when he needed it most  mattie meanwhile was forced to the dismal conclusion that her hints were thrown away jed was plainly determined not to speak mattie felt half angry with him she did not choose to make a martyr of herself to romance and surely the man didnt expect her to ask him to marry her  im sure and certain hes as fond of me as ever he was she mused i suppose hes got some ridiculous notion about being too poor to aspire to me jed always had more pride than a crane could carry well ive done all i canall im going to do if jeds determined to go he must go i spose  mattie would not let herself cry although she felt like it she went out and picked apples instead  mattie might have remained so and jedediahs romance might never have reached a better ending if it had not been for selena who came over just then to help mattie pick the golden russets fate had evidently destined her as jeds best helper all summer she had been fairly goading mattie into love with jedediah and now she was moved to add the last spur  jed cranes going away i hear she said maliciously seems to me youre bound to be jilted again mattie  mattie had no answer ready selena went on undauntedly  youve made a nice fool of yourself all summer i vow throwing yourself at jeds headand he doesnt want you even with all your property  he does want me said mattie calmly her lips were very firm and her cheeks scarlet he is not going away we are to be married about christmas and jed will take charge of the farm for me  matilda adams said selena it was all she was capable of saying  the rest of the golden russets were picked in a dead silence mattie working with an unusually high colour in her cheeks while selenas thin lips were pressed so closely together as to be little else than a hair line  after selena had gone home sulking mattie picked on with a very determined face the die was cast she could not bear selenas slurs and she would not and she had not told a lie either her words were true she would make them true all the adams determinationand that was not a littlewas roused in her  if jed jilts me hell do it to my face clean and clever she said viciously  when jed came again he was very solemn he thought it would be his last visit but mattie felt differently she had dressed herself with unusual care and crimped her hair her cheeks were scarlet and her eyes bright jed thought she looked younger and prettier than ever the thought that this was the last time he would see her for many a long day to come grew more and more unbearable yet he firmly determined he would let no presuming word pass his lips mattie had been so kind to him it was only honourable of him in return not to let her throw herself away on a poor failure like himself  i suppose this is your last round with the wagon she said she had taken him out into the garden to say it the garden was out of view from the ford place propose she must but she drew the line at proposing under selenas eyes  jed nodded dully yes and then i must toddle off and look for something else to do you see i havent much of a gift so to speak for business mattie and it takes me so long to get worked into an understanding of a business or trade that im generally asked to quit before you might say ive really commenced its been a mighty happy summer for me though i cant say ive done much in the selling line except to you mattie what with your kindness and these little visits youve been good enough to let me make every week i feel i may say its been the happiest summer of my life and im never going to forget it but as i said its time for me to be moving on elsewhere and finding something else to do  there is something for you to do right hereif you will do it said mattie faintly for a moment she felt as if she could not go on jed and the garden and the scarf of late asters whirled around her dizzily she held by the sweetpea trellis to steady herself  ii said a terrible thing to selena the other day ii dont know what ill do about it ififyou dont help me out jed  ill do anything i can said jed with hearty sympathy you know that mattie what is the trouble  his kindly voice and the good will and affection beaming in his honest blue eyes gave mattie renewed courage to go on with her selfimposed and most embarrassing task although before she ended her voice shook and dwindled away to such a low whisper that jed had to bend his head close to hers to hear what she was saying  ii saidshe goaded me into saying it jedslighting and slurringjeering at me because you were going away i just got mad jedand i told her you werent goingthat you and ithat we were to bemarried  mattie did you mean that he cried if you did im the happiest man alive i didnt dare persoomi didnt spose you thought anything of me but if you doand if you want meheres all there is of me heart and soul and body forever and ever as ive been all my life  thinking over this speech afterwards jed was dissatisfied with it he thought he might have made it much more eloquent and romantic than it was but it served the purpose very well it was convincingit came straight from his honest stupid heart and mattie knew it she held out her hands and jed gathered her into his arms  it was certainly a most fortunate circumstance that the garden was well out of the range of selenas vision or the sight of her sister and the remaining member of the despised crane family repeating their foolish performance which many years previous had resulted in jeds long banishment might have caused her to commit almost any unheardof act of spite as an outlet for her jealous anger but only the few remaining garden flowers were witness to the lovers indiscretion and they kept their own counsel after the manner of flowers so selenas feelings were mercifully spared this further outrage  that evening jed drove slowly away through the twilight mounted for the last time on the tinwagon he was so happy that he bore no grudge against even selena ford as the pony climbed the poplar hill jed drew a long breath and freed his mind to the surrounding landscape and to his faithful and slowplodding steed that had been one of the main factors in this love affair having patiently carried him to and from the abode of his ladylove throughout the summer just passed jedediah was as brimful of happiness as mortal man could be and his rosy thoughts flowed forth in a kind of triumphant chant which would have driven selena stark distracted had she been within hearing distance what he said too was but a poor expression of what he thought but to the trees and fields and pony he chanted  well this is romance what else would you call it now me poor scared to speakand mattie ups and does it for me bless her yes ive been longing for romance all my life and ive got it at last none of your commonplace courtships for me i always said them was my very words and i guess this has been a little uncommoni guess it has anyhow im uncommon happy i never felt so romantic before get up my nag get up     the tryst of the white lady   i wisht yed git married roger said catherine ames im gitting too old to workseventy last apriland whos going to look after ye when im gone git married bygit married  roger temple winced his aunts harsh disagreeable voice always jarred horribly on his sensitive nerves he was fond of her after a fashion but always that voice made him wonder if there could be anything harder to endure  then he gave a bitter little laugh  whod have me aunt catherine he asked  catherine ames looked at him critically across the supper table she loved him in her way with all her heart but she was not in the least blind to his defects she did not mince matters with herself or with other people roger was a sallow plainfeatured fellow small and insignificant looking and as if this were not bad enough he walked with a slight limp and had one thin shoulder a little higher than the otherjarback temple he had been called in school and the name still clung to him to be sure he had very fine grey eyes but their dreamy brilliance gave his dull face an uncanny look which girls did not like and so made matters rather worse than better of course looks didnt matter so much in the case of a man steve millar was homely enough and all marked up with smallpox to boot yet he had got for wife the prettiest and smartest girl in south bay but steve was rich roger was poor and always would be he worked his stony little farm from which his father and grandfather had wrested a fair living after a fashion but nature had not cut him out for a successful farmer he hadnt the strength for it and his heart wasnt in it hed rather be hanging over a book catherine secretly thought rogers matrimonial chances very poor but it would not do to discourage the by what he needed was spurring on  yell git someone if ye dont fly too high she announced loudly and cheerfully thars always a gal or two here and thar thats glad to marry for a home taint no use for you to be settin your thoughts on anyone young and pretty ye

together when yere reading potrythats as much as you kin expect and the sooner the better im donelast winters rheumatiz has about finished me an we cant afford hired help  roger felt as if his raw quivering soul were being seared he looked at his aunt curiouslyat her broad flat face with the mole on the end of her dumpy nose the bristling hairs on her chin the wrinkled yellow neck the pale protruding eyes the coarse goodhumoured mouth she was so extremely uglyand he had seen her across the table all his life for twentyfive years he had looked at her so must he continue to go on looking at ugliness in the shape of a wife all the rest of his lifehe who worshipped beauty in everything  did my mother look like you aunt catherine he asked abruptly  his aunt staredand snorted her snort was meant to express kindly amusement but it sounded like derision and contempt  yer ma wasnt so humly as me she said cheerfully but she want no beauty either none of the temples was ever better lookin than was necessary we was workers yer pa want bad looking youre humlier than either of em some ways ye take after yer grandmathough she was counted pretty at one time she was yaller and spindlin like you and youve got her eyes what yer so intrested in yer mas looks all at once fer  i was wondering said roger coolly if father ever looked at her across the table and wished she were prettier  catherine giggled her giggle was ugly and disagreeable like everything else about hereverything except a certain odd loving loyal old heart buried deep in her bosom for the sake of which roger endured the giggle and all the rest  dessay he diddessay he did men alays has a hankerin for good looks but yeve got to cut yer coat cording to yer cloth as for yer poor ma she didnt live long enough to git as ugly as me when i come here to keep house for yer pa folks said as it wouldnt be long fore he married me i wouldnt aminded but yer pa never hinted it spose hed had enough of ugly

however ye manage it twont be so hard if yere reasonable dont stay out as late as ye did last night ye coughed all night where was yedown at the shore  no said roger who always answered her questions even when he hated to i was down at aunt isabels grave  till eleven oclock ye aint wise i dunno what hankering ye have after that unchancy place i aint been near it for twenty year i wonder ye aint scairt whatd ye think yed do if ye saw her ghost  catherine looked curiously at roger she was very superstitious and she believed firmly in ghosts and saw no absurdity in her question  i wish i could see it said roger his great eyes flashing he believed in ghosts too at least in isabel temples ghost his uncle had seen it his grandfather had seen it he believed he would see itthe beautiful bewitching mocking luring ghost of lovely isabel temple  dont wish such stuff said catherine nobody aint never the same after theyve seen her  was uncle different roger had come back into the kitchen

                 roger laughed bitterly again and went out it was sunset there was no work to do that night except to milk the cows and his little home boy could do that he felt a glad freedom he put his hand in his pocket to see if his beloved wordsworth was there and then he took his way across the fields under a sky of purple and amber walking quickly despite his limp he wanted to get to some solitary place where he could forget aunt catherine and her abominable suggestions and escape into the world of dreams where he habitually lived and where he found the loveliness he had not found nor could hope to find in his real world  rogers mother had died when he was three and his father when he was eight his little old bedridden grandmother had lived until he was twelve he had loved her passionately she had not been pretty in his remembrancea tiny shrunken wrinkled thingbut she had beautiful grey eyes that never grew old and a soft gentle voicethe only womans voice he had ever heard with pleasure he was very critical as regards womens voices and very sensitive to them nothing hurt him quite so much as an unlovely voicenot even unloveliness of face her death had left him desolate she was the only human being who had ever understood him he could never he thought have got through his tortured school days without her after she died he would not go to school he was not in any sense educated his father and grandfather had been illiterate men and he had inherited their underdeveloped brain cells but he loved poetry and read all he could get of it it overlaid his primitive nature with a curious iridescence of fancy and furnished him with ideals and hungers his environment could never satisfy he loved beauty in everything moonrises hurt him with their loveliness and he could sit for hours gazing at a white narcissusmuch to his aunts exasperation he was solitary by nature he felt horribly alone in a crowded building but never in the woods or in the wild places along the shore it was because of this that his aunt could not get him to go to churchwhich was a horror to her orthodox soul he told her he would like to go to church if it were empty but he could not bear it when it was fullfull of smug ugly people most people he thought were uglythough not so ugly as he wasand ugliness made him sick with repulsion now and then he saw a pretty girl at whom he liked to look but he never saw one that wholly pleased him to him the homely crippled povertystricken roger temple whom they all would have scorned there was always a certain subtle something wanting and the lack of it kept him heartwhole he knew that this probably saved him from much suffering but for all that he regretted it he wanted to love even vainly he wanted to experience this passion of which the poets sang so much without it he felt he lacked the key to a world of wonder he even tried to fall in love he went to church for several sundays and sat where he could see beautiful elsa carey she was lovelyit gave him pleasure to look at her the gold of her hair was so bright and living the pink of her cheek so pure the curve of her neck so flawless the lashes of her eyes so dark and silken but he looked at her as at a picture when he tried to think and dream of her it bored him besides he knew she had a rather nasal voice he used to laugh sarcastically to himself over elsas feelings if she had known how desperately he was trying to fall in love with her and failingelsa the queen of hearts who believed she had only to look to reign he gave up trying at last but he still longed to love he knew he would never marry he could not marry plainness and beauty would have longed to love he knew he would never marry he could not marry plainness and beauty would have none of him but he did not want to miss everything and he had moments when he was very bitter and rebellious because he felt he must miss it forever  he went straight to isabel temples grave in the remote shore field of his farm isabel temple had lived and died eighty years ago she had been very lovely very wilful very fond of playing with the hearts of men she had married william temple the brother of his greatgrandfather and as she stood in her white dress beside her bridegroom at the conclusion of the wedding ceremony a jilted lover crazed by despair had entered the house and shot her dead she had been buried in the shore field where a square space had been dyked off in the centre for a burial lot because the church was then so far away with the passage of years the lot had grown up so thickly with fir and birch and wild cherry that it looked like a compact grove a winding path led through it to its heart where isabel temples grave was thickly overgrown with long silken pale green grass roger hurried along the path and sat down on the big grey boulder by the grave looking about him with a long breath of delight how lovelyand witchingand unearthly it was here little ferns were growing in the hollows and cracks of the big boulder where clay had lodged over isabel temples crooked lichened gravestone hung a young wild cherry in its delicate bloom above it in a little space of sky left by the slender tree tops was a young moon it was too dark here after all to read wordsworth but that did not matter the place with its moist air its tang of fir balsam was like a perfumed room where a man might dream dreams and see visions there was a soft murmur of wind in the boughs over him and the faraway moan of the sea on the bar crept in roger surrendered himself utterly to the charm of the place when he entered that grove he had left behind the realm of daylight and things known and come into the realm of shadow and mystery and enchantment anything might happenanything might be true  eighty long years had come and gone but isabel temple thus cruelly torn from life at the moment when it had promised her most did not even yet rest calmly in her grave such at least was the story and roger believed it it was in his blood to believe it the temples were a superstitious family and there was nothing in rogers upbringing to correct the tendency his was not a sceptical or scientific mind he was ignorant and poetical and credulous he had always accepted unquestioningly the tale that isabel temple had been seen on earth long after the red clay was heaped over her murdered body her bridegroom had seen her when he went to visit her on the eve of his second and unhappy marriage his grandfather had seen her his grandmother who had told him isabels story had told him this too and believed it she had added with a bitterness foreign to his idea of her that her husband had never been the same to her afterwards his uncle had seen herand had lived and died a haunted man it was only to men the lovely restless ghost appeared and her appearance boded no good to him who saw roger knew this but he had a curious longing to see her he had never avoided her grave as others of his tribe did he loved the spot and he believed that some time he would see isabel temple there she came so the story went to one in each generation of the family  he gazed down at her sunken grave a little wind that came stealing along the floor of the grove raised and swayed the long hairlike grass on it giving the curious suggestion of something prisoned under it trying to draw a long breath and float upward  then when he lifted his eyes again he saw her  she was standing behind the gravestone under the cherry tree whose long white branches touched her head standing there with her head drooping a little but looking steadily at him it was just between dusk and dark now but he saw her very plainly she was dressed in white with some filmy scarf over her head and her hair hung in a dark heavy braid over her shoulder her face was small and ivorywhite and her eyes were very large and dark roger looked straight into them and they did something to himdrew something out of him that was never to be his againhis heart his soul he did not know he only knew that lovely isabel temple had now come to him and that he was hers forever  for a few moments that seemed years he looked at herlooked till the lure of her eyes drew him to his feet as a man rises in sleepwalking as he slowly stood up the lowhanging bough of a fir tree pushed his cap down over his face and blinded him when he snatched it off she was gone                                       roger temple did not go home that night till the spring dawn was in the sky catherine was sleepless with anxiety about him when she heard him come up the stairs she opened her door and peeped out roger went along the hall without seeing her his brilliant eyes stared straight before him and there was something in his face that made catherine steal back to her bed with a little shiver of fear he looked like his uncle she did not ask him when they met at breakfast where or how he had spent the night he had been dreading the question and was relieved beyond measure when it was not asked but apart from that he was hardly conscious of her presence he ate and drank mechanically and voicelessly when he had gone out catherine wagged her uncomely grey head ominously  hes bewitched she muttered i know the signs hes seen herdrat her its time she gave up that kind of work well i dunno what to dothar aint anything i can do i reckon hell never marry nowim as sure of that as of any mortal thing hes in love with a ghost  it had not yet occurred to roger that he was in love he thought of nothing but isabel templeher lovely lovely face sweeter than any picture he had ever seen or any ideal he had dreamed her long dark hair her slim form and more than all her compelling eyes he saw them wherever he lookedthey drew himhe would have followed them to the end of the world heedless of all else  he longed for night that he might again steal to the grave in the haunted grove she might come againwho knew he felt no fear nothing but a terrible hunger to see her again but she did not come that nightnor the nextnor the next two weeks went by and he had not seen her perhaps he would never see her againthe thought filled him with anguish not to be borne he knew now that he loved herisabel temple dead for eighty years this was lovethis searing torturing intolerably sweet thingthis possession of body and soul and spirit the poets had sung but weakly of it he could tell them better if he could find words could other men have loved at allcould any man love those blowzy common girls of earth it seemed impossibleabsurd there was only one thing that could be lovedthat white spirit no wonder his uncle had died he roger temple would soon die too that would be well only the dead could woo isabel meanwhile he revelled in his torment and his happinessso madly commingled that he never knew whether he was in heaven or hell it was beautifuland dreadfuland wonderfuland exquisiteoh so exquisite mortal love could never be so exquisite he had never lived beforenow he lived in every fibre of his being  he was glad aunt catherine did not worry him with questions he had feared she would but she never asked any questions now and she was afraid of roger as she had been afraid of his uncle she dared not ask questions it was a thing that must not be tampered with who knew what she might hear if she asked him questions she was very unhappy something dreadful had happened to her poor boyhe had been bewitched by that hussyhe would die as his uncle had died  mebbe its best she muttered hes the last of the temples so mebbe shell rest in her grave when shes killed em all i dunno what shes sich a spite at them forthered be more sense if shed haunt the mortons seein as a morton killed her well im mighty old and tired and worn out it dont seem that its been much use the way ive slaved and fussed to bring that by up and keep things together for himand now the ghosts got him i might as well have let him die when he was a sickly baby  if this had been said to roger he would have retorted that it was worthwhile to have lived long enough to feel what he was feeling now he would not have missed it for a score of other mens lives he had drunk of some immortal wine and was as a god even if she never came again he had seen her once and she had taught him lifes great secret in that one unforgettable exchange of eyes she was hishis in spite of his ugliness and his crooked shoulder no man could ever take her from him  but she did come again one evening when the darkening grove was full of magic in the light of the rising yellow moon shining across the level field roger sat on the big boulder by the grave the evening was very still there was no sound save the echoes of noisy laughter that seemed to come up from the bay shoredrunken fishermen likely as not roger resented the intrusion of such a sound in such a placeit was a sacrilege when he came here to dream of her only the loveliest of muted sounds should be heardthe faintest whisper of trees the halfheard halffelt moan of surf the airiest sigh of wind he never read wordsworth now or any other book he only sat there and thought of her his great eyes alight his pale face flushed with the wonder of his love  she slipped through the dark boughs like a moonbeam and stood by the stone again he saw her quite plainlysaw and drank her in with his eyes he did not feel surprisesomething in him had known she would come again he would not move a muscle lest he lose her as he had lost her before they looked at each otherfor how long he did not know and thena horrible thing happened into that place of wonder and revelation and mystery reeled a hiccoughing laughing creature a drunken sailor from a harbour ship with a leering face and desecrating breath  oh youre here my deari thought id catch you yet he said  he caught hold of her she screamed roger sprang forward and struck him in the face in his fury of sudden rage the strength of ten seemed to animate his slender body and pass into his blow the sailor reeled back and put up his hands he was a cowardand even a brave man might have been daunted by that terrible white face and those blazing eyes he backed down the path  shorryshorry he muttered didnt know she was your girlshorry i butted in shentlemans never butt inshorryshirshorry  he kept repeating his ridiculous shorry until he was out of the grove then he turned and ran stumblingly across the field roger did not follow he went back to isabel temples grave the girl was lying across it he thought she was unconscious he stooped and picked her upshe was light and small but she was warm flesh and blood she clung uncertainly to him for a moment and he felt her breath on his face he did not speakhe was too sick at heart she did not speak either he did not think this strange until afterwards he was incapable of thinking just then he was dazed wretched lost presently he became aware that she was timidly pulling his arm it seemed that she wanted him to go with hershe was evidently frightened of that brutehe must take her to safety and then  she moved on down the little path and he followed out in the moonlit field he saw her clearly with her drooping head her flowing dark hair her great brown eyes she looked like the nymph of a woodbrook a haunter of shadows a creature sprung from the wild but she was mortal maid and hewhat a fool he had been presently he would laugh at himself when this dazed agony should clear away from his brain he followed her down the long field to the bay shore now and then she paused and looked back to see if he were coming but she never spoke when she reached the shore road she turned and went along it until they came to an old grey house fronting the calm grey harbour at its gate she paused roger knew now who she was catherine had told him about her a month ago  she was lilith barr a girl of eighteen who had come to live with her uncle and aunt her father had died some months before she was absolutely deaf as the result of some accident in childhood and she was as his own eyes told him exquisitely lovely in her white haunting style but she was not isabel temple he had tricked himselfhe had lived in a fools paradiseoh he must get away and laugh at himself he left her at her gate disregarding the little hand she put timidly outbut he did not laugh at himself he went back to isabel temples grave and flung himself down on it and cried like a boy he wept his stormy anguished soul out on it and when he rose and went away he believed it was forever he thought he could never never go there again                                       catherine looked at him curiously the next morning he looked wretchedhaggard and holloweyed she knew he had not come in till the summer dawn but he had lost the rapt uncanny look she hated suddenly she no longer felt afraid of him with this she began to ask questions again  what kept ye out so late again last night by she said reproachfully  roger looked at her in her morning ugliness he had not really seen her for weeks now she smote on his tortured senses so long drugged with beauty like a physical blow he suddenly burst into a laughter that frightened her  preserves by have ye gone mad or she added have ye seen isabel temples ghost  no said roger loudly and explosively dont talk any more about that damned ghost nobody ever saw it the whole story is balderdash  he got up and went violently out leaving catherine aghast was it possible roger had sworn what on earth had come over the by but come what had or come what would he no longer looked feythere was that much to be thankful for even an occasional oath was better than that catherine went stiffly about her dishwashing resolving to have liza adams to supper some night  for a week roger lived in agonyan agony of shame and humiliation and selfcontempt then when the edge of his bitter disappointment wore away he made another dreadful discovery he still loved her and longed for her just as keenly as before he wanted madly to see herher flowerlike face her great asking eyes the sleek braided flow of her hair ghost or womanspirit or fleshit mattered not he could not live without her at last his hunger for her drew him to the old grey house on the bay shore he knew he was a foolshe would never look at him he was only feeding the flame that must consume him but go he must and did seeking for his lost paradise  he did not see her when he went in but mrs barr received him kindly and talked about her in a pleasant garrulous fashion which jarred on roger yet he listened greedily lilith her aunt told him had been made deaf by the accidental explosion of a gun when she was eight years old she could not hear a sound but she could talk  a little that isnot much but enough to get along with but she dont like talking somehowdunno why shes shyand we think maybe she dont like to talk much because she cant hear her own voice she dont ever speak except just when she has to but shes been trained to lipreading something wonderfulshe can understand anything thats said when she can see the person thats talking still its a terrible drawback for the poor childshes never had any real girllife and shes dreadful sensitive and retiring we cant get her to go out anywhere only for lonely walks along shore by herself were much obliged for what you did the other night it aint safe for her to wander about alone as she does but it aint often anybody from the harbour gets up this far she was dreadful upset about ithasnt got over her scare yet  when lilith came in her ivorywhite face went scarlet all over at the sight of roger she sat down in a shadowy corner mrs barr got up and went out roger was mute he could find nothing to say he could have talked glibly enough to isabel temples ghost in some unearthly tryst by her grave but he could not find a word to say to this slip of flesh and blood he felt very foolish and absurd and very conscious of his twisted shoulder what a fool he had been to come  then lilith looked up at himand smiled a little shy friendly smile roger suddenly saw her not as the tantalizing unreal mystic thing of the twilit grove but as a little human creature exquisitely pretty in her youngmoon beauty longing for companionship he got up forgetting his ugliness and went across the room to her  will you come for a walk he said eagerly he held out his hand like a child as a child she stood up and took it like two children they went out and down the sunset shore roger was again incredibly happy it was not the same happiness as had been his in that vanished fortnight it was a homelier happiness with its feet on the earth the amazing thing was that he felt she was happy toohappy because she was walking with him jarback temple whom no girl had even thought about a certain secret wellspring of fancy that had seemed dry welled up in him sparklingly again  through the summer weeks the odd courtship went on roger talked to her as he had never talked to anyone he did not find it in the least hard to talk to her though her necessity of watching his face so closely while he talked bothered him occasionally he felt that her intent gaze was reading his soul as well as his lips she never talked much herself what she did say she spoke so low that it was hardly above a whisper but she had a voice as lovely as her facesweet cadenced haunting roger was quite mad about her and he was horribly afraid that he could never get up enough courage to ask her to marry him and he was afraid that if he did she would never consent in spite of her shy eager welcomes he could not believe she could care for himfor him she liked him she was sorry for him but it was unthinkable that she white exquisite lilith could marry him and sit at his table and his hearth he was a fool to dream of it  to the existence of romance and glamour in which he lived no gossip of the countryside penetrated yet much gossip there was and at last it came blundering in on roger to destroy his fairy world a second time he came downstairs one night in the twilight ready to go to lilith his aunt and an old crony were talking in the kitchen the crony was old and catherine supposing roger was out of the house was talking loudly in that horrible voice of hers with still more horrible zest and satisfaction  yes im guessing itll be a match as ye say oh the bys doing well he aint for every market as im bound to admit ef she want deaf she wouldnt look at him no doubt but she has scads of moneythey wont need to do a tap of work unless they likeand shes a good housekeeper too her aunt tells me shes pretty enough to suit himhes as particular as never wasand he want crooked and she want deaf when they was born so its likely their children will be all right im that proud when i think of the match  roger fled out of the house white of face and sick of heart he went not to the bay shore but to isabel temples grave he had never been there since the night when he had rescued lilith but now he rushed to it in his new agony his aunts horrible practicalities had filled him with disgustthey dragged his love in the dust of sordid things and lilith was rich he had never known thatnever suspected it he could never ask her to marry him now he must never see her again for the second time he had lost her and this second losing could not be borne  he sat down on the big boulder by the grave and dropped his poor grey face in his hands moaning in anguish nothing was left him not even dreams he hoped he could soon die  he did not know how long he sat therehe did not know when she came but when he lifted his miserable eyes he saw her sitting just a little way from him on the big stone and looking at him with something in her face that made his heart beat madly he forgot aunt catherines sacrilegehe forgot that he was a presumptuous fool he bent forward and kissed her lips for the first time the wonder of it loosed his bound tongue  lilith he gasped i love you  she put her hand into his and nestled closer to him  i thought you would have told me that long ago she said     uncle richards new years dinner   prissy baker was in oscar millers store new years morning buying matchesfor new years was not kept as a business holiday in quincywhen her uncle richard baker came in he did not look at prissy nor did she wish him a happy new year she would not have dared uncle richard had not been on speaking terms with her or her father his only brother for eight years  he was a big ruddy prosperouslooking manan uncle to be proud of prissy thought wistfully if only he were like other peoples uncles or indeed like what he used to be himself he was the only uncle prissy had and when she had been a little girl they had been great friends but that was before the quarrel in which prissy had had no share to be sure although uncle richard seemed to include her in his rancour  richard baker so he informed mr miller was on his way to navarre with a load of pork  i didnt intend going over until the afternoon he said but joe hemming sent word yesterday he wouldnt be buying pork after twelve today so i have to tote my hogs over at once i dont care about doing business new years morning  should think new years would be pretty much the same as any other day to you said mr miller for richard baker was a bachelor with only old mrs janeway to keep house for him  well i always like a good dinner on new years said richard baker its about the only way i can celebrate mrs janeway wanted to spend the day with her sons family over at oriental so i was laying out to cook my own dinner i got everything ready in the pantry last night fore i got word about the pork i wont get back from navarre before one oclock so i reckon ill have to put up with a cold bite  after her uncle richard had driven away prissy walked thoughtfully home she had planned to spend a nice lazy holiday with the new book her father had given her at christmas and a box of candy she did not even mean to cook a dinner for her father had had to go to town that morning to meet a friend and would be gone the whole day there was nobody else to cook dinner for prissys mother had died when prissy was a baby she was her fathers housekeeper and they had jolly times together  but as she walked home she could not help thinking about uncle richard he would certainly have cold new year cheer enough to chill the whole coming year she felt sorry for him picturing him returning from navarre cold and hungry to find a fireless house and an uncooked dinner in the pantry  suddenly an idea popped into prissys head dared she oh she never could but he would never knowthere would be plenty of timeshe would  prissy hurried home put her matches away took a regretful peep at her unopened book then locked the door and started up the road to uncle richards house half a mile away she meant to go and cook uncle richards dinner for him get it all beautifully ready then slip away before he came home he would never suspect her of it prissy would not have him suspect for the world she thought he would be more likely to throw a dinner of her cooking out of doors than to eat it  eight years before this when prissy had been nine years old richard and irving baker had quarrelled over the division of a piece of property the fault had been mainly on richards side and that very fact made him all the more unrelenting and stubborn he had never spoken to his brother since and he declared he never would prissy and her father felt very badly over it but uncle richard did not seem to feel badly at all to all appearance he had completely forgotten that there were such people in the world as his brother irving and his niece prissy  prissy had no trouble in breaking into uncle richards house for the woodshed door was unfastened she tripped into the hostile kitchen with rosy cheeks and mischief sparkling in her eyes this was an adventurethis was fun she would tell her father all about it when he came home at night and what a laugh they would have  there was still a good fire in the stove and in the pantry prissy found the dinner in its raw statea fine roast of fresh pork potatoes cabbage turnips and the ingredients of a raisin pudding for richard baker was fond of raisin puddings and could make them as well as mrs janeway could if that was anything to boast of  in a short time the kitchen was full of bubbling and hissings and appetizing odours prissy enjoyed herself hugely and the raisin pudding which she rather doubtfully mixed up behaved itself beautifully  uncle richard said hed be home by one said prissy to herself as the clock struck twelve so ill set the table now dish up the dinner and leave it where it will keep warm until he gets here then ill slip away home id like to see his face when he steps in i suppose hell think one of the jenner girls across the street has cooked his dinner  prissy soon had the table set and she was just peppering the turnips when a gruff voice behind her said  well well what does this mean  prissy whirled around as if she had been shot and there stood uncle richard in the woodshed door  poor prissy she could not have looked or felt more guilty if uncle richard had caught her robbing his desk she did not drop the turnips for a wonder but she was too confused to set them down so she stood there holding them her face crimson her heart thumping and a horrible choking in her throat  iicame up to cook your dinner for you uncle richard she stammered i heard you sayin the storethat mrs janeway had gone home and that you had nobody to cook your new years dinner for you so i thought id come and do it but i meant to slip away before you came home  poor prissy felt that she would never get to the end of her explanation would uncle richard be angry would he order her from the house  it was very kind of you said uncle richard drily its a wonder your father let you come  father was not home but i am sure he would not have prevented me if he had been father has no hard feelings against you uncle richard  humph said uncle richard well since youve cooked the dinner you must stop and help me eat it it smells good i must say mrs janeway always burns pork when she roasts it sit down prissy im hungry  they sat down prissy felt quite giddy and breathless and could hardly eat for excitement but uncle richard had evidently brought home a good appetite from navarre and he did full justice to his new years dinner he talked to prissy too quite kindly and politely and when the meal was over he said slowly  im much obliged to you prissy and i dont mind owning to you that im sorry for my share in the quarrel and have wanted for a long time to be friends with your father again but i was too ashamed and proud to make the first advance you can tell him so for me if you like and if hes willing to let bygones be bygones tell him id like him to come up here with you tonight when he gets home and spend the evening with me  oh he will come i know cried prissy joyfully he has felt so badly about not being friendly with you uncle richard im as glad as can be  prissy ran impulsively around the table and kissed uncle richard he looked up at his tall girlish niece with a smile of pleasure  youre a good girl prissy and a kindhearted one too or youd never have come up here to cook a dinner for a crabbed old uncle who deserved to eat cold dinners for his stubbornness it made me cross today when folks wished me a happy new year it seemed like mockery when i hadnt a soul belonging to me to make it happy but it has brought me happiness already and i believe it will be a happy year all the way through  indeed it will laughed prissy im so happy now i could sing i believe it was an inspirationmy idea of coming up here to cook your dinner for you  you must promise to come and cook my new years dinner for me every new year we live near enough together said uncle richard  and prissy promised     white magic   one september afternoon in the year of grace 1840 avery and janet sparhallow were picking apples in their uncle daniel sparhallows big orchard it was an afternoon of mellow sunshine about them beyond the orchard were old harvest fields mellowly bright and serene and beyond the fields the sapphire curve of the st lawrence gulf was visible through the groves of spruce and birch there was a soft whisper of wind in the trees and the pale purple asters that feathered the orchard grass swayed gently towards each other janet sparhallow who loved the outdoor world and its beauty was for the time being at least very happy as her little brown face with its fine satiny skin plainly showed avery sparhallow did not seem so happy she worked rather abstractedly and frowned oftener than she smiled  avery sparhallow was conceded to be a beauty and had no rival in burnley beach she was very pretty with the obvious indisputable prettiness of rich black hair vivid certain colour and laughing brilliant eyes nobody ever called janet a beauty or even thought her pretty she was only seventeenfive years younger than averyand was rather lanky and weedy with a rope of straight darkbrown hair long narrow shining brown eyes and very black lashes and a crooked clever little mouth she had visitations of beauty when excited because then she flushed deeply and colour made all the difference in the world to her but she had never happened to look in the glass when excited so that she had never seen herself beautiful and hardly anybody else had ever seen her so because she was always too shy and awkward and tonguetied in company to feel excited over anything yet very little could bring that transforming flush to her face a wind off the gulf a sudden glimpse of blue upland a flamered poppy a babys laugh a certain footstep as for avery sparhallow she never got excited over anythingnot even her wedding dress which had come from charlottetown that day and was incomparably beyond anything that had ever been seen in burnley beach before for it was made of an applegreen silk sprayed over with tiny rosebuds which had been specially sent for to england where aunt matilda sparhallow had a brother in the silk trade avery sparhallows wedding dress was making far more of a sensation in burnley beach than her wedding itself was making for randall burnley had been dangling after her for three years and everybody knew that there was nobody for a sparhallow to marry except a burnley and nobody for a burnley to marry except a sparhallow  only one silk dressand i want a dozen avery had said scornfully  what would you do with a dozen silk dresses on a farm janet asked wonderingly  ohwhat indeed agreed avery with an impatient laugh  randall will think just as much of you in drugget as in silk said janet meaning to comfort  again avery laughed  that is true randall never notices what a woman has on i like a man who does noticeand tells me about it i like a man who likes me better in silk than in drugget i will wear this rosebud silk when im married and it will be supposed to last me the rest of my life and be worn on all state occasions and in time become an heirloom like aunt matildas hideous blue satin i want a new silk dress every month  janet paid little attention to this kind of raving avery had always been more or less discontented she would be contented enough after she was married nobody could be discontented who was randall burnleys wife janet was sure of that  janet liked picking apples avery did not like it but aunt matilda had decreed that the red apples should be picked that afternoon and aunt matildas word was law at the sparhallow farm even for wilful avery so they worked and talked as they workedof averys wedding which was to be as soon as bruce gordon should arrive from scotland  i wonder what bruce will be like said avery it is eight years since he went home to scotland he was sixteen thenhe will be twentyfour now he went away a boyhe will come back a man  i dont remember much about him said janet i was only nine when he went away he used to tease mei do remember that there was a little resentment in her voice janet had never liked being teased avery laughed  you were so touchy janet touchy people always get teased bruce was very handsomeand as nice as he was handsome those two years he was here were the nicest gayest time i ever had i wish he had stayed in canada but of course he wouldnt do that his father was a rich man and bruce was ambitious oh janet i wish i could live in the old land that would be life  janet had heard all this before and could not understand it she had no hankering for either scotland or england she loved the new land and its wild virgin beauty she yearned to the future never to the past  im tired of burnley beach avery went on passionately shaking apples wildly off a laden bough by way of emphasis i know all the peoplewhat they arewhat they can be its like reading a book for the twentieth time i know where i was born and who ill marryand where ill be buried thats knowing too much all my days will be alike when i marry randall there will never be anything unexpected or surprising about them i tell you janet avery seized another bough and shook it with a vengeance i hate the very thought of it  the thought ofwhat said janet in bewilderment  of marrying randall burnleyor marrying anybody down hereand settling down on a farm for life  then avery sat down on the rung of her ladder and laughed at janets face  you look stunned janet did you really think i wanted to marry randall  janet was stunned and she did think that how could any girl not want to marry randall burnley if she had the chance  dont you love him she asked stupidly  avery bit into a nutsweet apple  no she said frankly oh i dont hate him of course i like him well enough i like him very well but well quarrel all our lives  then what are you marrying him for asked janet  why im getting ontwentytwoall the girls of my age are married already i wont be an old maid and theres nobody but randall nobody good enough for a sparhallow that is you wouldnt want me to marry ned adams or john buchanan would you  no said janet who had her full share of the sparhallow pride  well then of course i must marry randall thats settled and theres no use making faces over the notion im not making faces but im tired of hearing you talk as if you thought i adored him and must be in the seventh heaven because i was going to marry him you romantic child  does randall know you feel like this asked janet in a low tone  no randall is like all menvain and selfsatisfiedand believes im crazy about him its just as well to let him think so until were safely married anyhow randall has some romantic notions too and im not sure that hed marry me if he knew in spite of his three years devotion and i have no intention of being jilted three weeks before my wedding day  avery laughed again and tossed away the core of her apple  janet who had been very pale went crimson and lovely she could not endure hearing randall criticized vain and selfsatisfiedwhen there was never a man less so she was horrified to feel that she almost hated averyavery who did not love randall  what a pity randall didnt take a fancy to you instead of me janet said avery teasingly wouldnt you like to marry him janet wouldnt you now  no cried janet angrily i just like randall ive liked him ever since that day when i was a little thing and he came here and saved me from being shut up all day in that dreadful dark closet because i broke aunt matildas blue cupwhen i hadnt meant to break it he wouldnt let her shut me up he is like thathe understands i want you to marry him because he wants you and it isnt fair that youthat you  nothing is fair in this world child is it fair that i who am so prettyyou know i am pretty janetand who love life and excitement should have to be buried on a pe island farm all my days or else be an old maid because a sparhallow mustnt marry beneath her come janet dont look so woebegone i wouldnt have told you if id thought youd take it so much to heart ill be a good wife to randall never fear and ill keep him up to the notch of prosperity much better than if i thought him a little lower than the angels it doesnt do to think a man perfection janet because he thinks so too and when he finds someone who agrees with him he is inclined to rest on his oars  at any rate you dont care for anyone else said janet hopefully  not i i like randall as well as i like anybody  randall wont be satisfied with that muttered janet but avery did not hear her having picked up her basket of apples and gone janet sat down on the lower rung of the ladder and gave herself up to an unpleasant reverie oh how the world had changed in half an hour she had never been so worried in her life she was so fond of randallshe had always been fond of himwhy he was just like a brother to her she couldnt possibly love a brother more and avery was going to hurt him it would hurt him horribly when he found out she did not love him janet could not bear the thought of randall being hurt it made her fairly savage he must not be hurtavery must love him janet could not understand why she did not  surely everyone must love randall it had never occurred to janet to ask herself as avery had asked if she would like to marry randall randall could never fancy hera little plain brown thing only half grown nobody could think of her beside beautiful rosefaced avery janet accepted this fact unquestioningly she had never been jealous she only felt that she wanted randall to have everything he wantedto be perfectly happy why it would be dreadful if he did not marry averyif he went and married some other girl she would never see him then never have any more delightful talks with him about all the things they both loved so muchwinds and delicate dawns mysterious woods in moonlight and starry midnights silverwhite sails going out of the harbour in the magic of morning and the grey of gulf storms there would be nothing in life it would just be one great unbearable emptiness for she herself would never marry there was nobody for her to marryand she didnt care if she could have randall for a real brother she would not mind a bit being an old maid and there was that beautiful new frame house randall had built for his bride which she janet had helped him build because avery would not condescend to details of pantry and linen closet and cupboards janet and randall had had such fun over the cupboards no stranger must ever come to be mistress of that house randall must marry avery and she must love him could anything be done to make her love him  i believe ill go and see granny thomas said janet desperately  she thought this was a silly idea but it still haunted her and would not be shaken off granny thomas was a very old woman who lived at burnley cove and was reputed to be something of a witch that is people who were not sparhallows or burnleys gave her that name sparhallows or burnleys of course were above believing in such nonsense janet was above believing it but stillthe sailors along shore were careful to keep on the good side of granny thomas lest she brew an unfavourable wind for them and there was much talk of love potions janet knew that people said peggy buchanan would never have got jack mcleod if granny had not given her a love potion jack had never looked at peggy though she was after him for years and then all at once he was quite mad about herand married herand wore her life out with jealousy and peggy the homeliest of all the buchanan girls there must be something in it janet made a sudden desperate resolve she would go to granny and ask her for a love potion to make avery love randall if granny couldnt do any good she couldnt do any harm janet was a little afraid of her and had never been near her house but what wouldnt she do for randall                                       janet never lost much time in carrying out any resolution she made the next afternoon she slipped away to visit granny thomas she put on her longest dress and did her hair up for the first time granny must not think her a child she rowed herself down the long pond to the row of goldenbrown sand dunes that parted it from the gulf it was a wonderful autumn day there were wild growths and colours and scents in sweet procession all around the pond every curve in it revealed some little whim of loveliness on the left bank in a grove of birch was randalls new house waiting to be sanctified by love and joy and birth janet loved to be alone thus with the delightful day she was sorry when she had walked over the stretch of windy weedy sea fields and reached grannys little tumbledown house at the covesorry and a little frightened as well but only a little there was good stuff in janet she lifted the latch boldly and walked in when granny bade granny was curled up on a stool by her fireplace and if ever anybody did look like a witch she did she waved her pipe at another stool and janet sat down gazing a little curiously at granny whom she had never seen at such close quarters before  will i look like that when i am very old she thought beholding grannys wizened marvellously wrinkled face i wonder if anybody will be sorry when you die  staring wasnt thought good manners in my time said granny then as janet blushed crimson under the rebuke she added keep red like that instead o white and you wont need no love ointment  janet felt a little cold thrill how did granny know what she had come for was she a real witch after all for a moment she wished she hadnt come perhaps it was not right to tamper with the powers of darkness peggy buchanan was notoriously unhappy if janet had known how to get herself away she would have gone without asking for anything  then a sound came from the leanto behind the house  ssh i hear the devil grunting like a pig muttered granny looking very impish  but janet smiled a little contemptuously she knew it was a pig and no devil granny thomas was only an old fraud her awe passed away and left her cool sparhallow  can you she said with her own directness make aa person care for another personcarevery much  granny removed her pipe and chuckled  what you want is toad ointment she said  toad ointment janet shuddered that did not sound very nice granny noticed the shudder  nothing like it she said nodding her cronelike old grey head theres other things but noan so sure put a lil bitoh such a lil biton his eyelids and hes yourn for life you need something powerfulyoure noan so prettyonly when youre blushing  janet was blushing again so granny thought she wanted the charm for herself well what did it matter randall was the only one to be considered  is it veryexpensive she faltered she had not much money money was no plentiful thing on a pei farm in 1840  oh noaoh noa granny leered i dont sell it i gives it i like to see young folks happy you dont need much as ive saidjust a lil smootch and youll have your man and send old granny a bite o the wedding cake and fig o baccy for luck and a bid to the firrst christening doant forget that dearie  janet was cold again with anger she hated old granny thomas she would never come near her again  id rather pay you its worth she said coldly  you couldnt dearie what money could be eno for such a treasure but thats the sparhallow pride well go see if the sparhallow pride and the sparhallow money will buy you your lads love  granny looked so angry that janet hastened to appease her  oh please forgive mei meant no offence onlyit must have cost you much trouble to make it  granny chuckled again she was vastly pleased to see a sparhallow suing to hera sparhallow  toads am cheap she said its all in the knowing how and the time o the moon here take this lil pill boxtheres eno in itand put a lil bit on his eyelids when youve getten the chanceand when he looks at you hell love you mind you though that he looks at no other firstits the first one he sees that hell love thats the way it works  thank you janet took the little box she wished she dared to go at once but perhaps this would anger granny granny looked at her with a twinkle in her little incredibly old eyes  be off she said youre in a hurry to goyoure as proud as any of the proud sparhallows but i bear you no grudge i likes proud peoplewhen they have to come to me to get help  janet found herself outside with a relieved heart in her bosom and her little box in her hand for a moment she was tempted to throw it away but norandall would be so unhappy if he found out avery didnt love him she would try the ointment at leastshe would try to forget about the toads and not let herself think how it was madesomething might come of it                                       janet hurried home along the shore where a silvery wave broke in a little lovely silvery curve on the sand she was so happy that her cheeks burned and randall burnley who was sitting on the edge of her flat when she reached the pond looked at her with admiration janet dropped her box into her pocket stealthily when she saw him what with her guilty secret she hardly knew whether she was glad or not when he said he was going to row her up the pond  i saw you go down an hour ago and ive been waiting ever since he said where have you been  ohi justwanted a walkthis lovely day said janet miserably she felt that she was telling an untruth and this hurt her horriblyespecially when it was to randall this was what came of truck with witchesyou were led into falsehood and deception straightaway again janet was tempted to drop grannys pill box into the depths of burnley pondand again she decided not to because she saw randall burnleys deepset bluegrey eyes that could look tender or sorrowful or passionate or whimsical as he willed and thought how they would look when he found avery did not love him  so janet drowned the voice of conscience and was brazenly happyhappy because randall burnley rowed her up the pondhappy because he walked halfway home with her over the autumnal fieldshappy because he talked of the day and the sea and the golden weather as only randall could talk but she thought she was happy because she had in her pocket what might make avery love him  randall went as far as the stile in the birch wood between the burnley and the sparhallow landand he kept her there talking for another halfhourand though he talked only of a book he had read and a new puppy he was training janet listened with her soul in her ears she talked tooquite freely she was never in the least shy or tonguetied or awkward in randalls company there she was always at her best with a delightful feeling of being understood she wondered if he noticed she had her hair done up her eyes shone and her brown face was full of rosy kissable hues when he finally turned away homeward life went flat janet decided she was very tired after her long walk and her trying interview but it did not matter since she had her love potion that was so much nicer a name than toad ointment  that night janet rubbed mutton tallow on her hands she had never done that beforeshe had thought it vain and foolishthough avery did it every night but that afternoon on the pond randall had said something about the beautiful shape of her pretty slender hands he had never paid her a compliment before her hands were brown and a little hardnot soft and white like averys so janet resorted to the mutton tallow if one had a scrap of beauty if only in ones hands one might as well take care of it  having got her ointment the next thing was to make use of it this was not so easybecause in the first place it must not be done when there was any danger of averys seeing some other than randall firstand it must be done without averys knowing it the two problems combined were almost too much for janet she bided her chance like a watchful catbut it did not come two weeks went by and it had not come janet was getting very desperate the wedding day was only a week away the brides cake was made and the turkeys fattened the invitations were sent out janets own bridesmaid dress was ready and still the little pill box in the till of janets blue chest was unopened she had never even opened it lest virtue escape  then her chance came at last unexpectedly one evening at dusk when janet was crossing the little dark upstairs hall aunt matilda called up to her  janet send avery down there is a young man wanting to see her  aunt matilda was laughing a littleas she always did when randall came it was a habit with her hanging over from the early days of randalls courtship janet went on into their room to tell avery and lo avery was lying asleep on her bed tired out from her busy day janet after one glance flew to her chest she took out her pill box and opened it a little fearfully the toad ointment was there dark and unpleasant enough to view janet tiptoed breathlessly to the bed and gingerly scraped the tip of her finger in the ointment  she said so little would be enoughoh i hope im not doing wrong  trembling with excitement she brushed lightly the white lids of averys eyes avery stirred and opened them janet guiltily thrust her pill box behind her  randall is downstairs asking for you avery  avery sat up looking annoyed she had not expected randall that evening and would greatly have preferred a continuance of her nap she went down crossly enough but looking very lovely flushed from sleep janet stood in their room clasping her cold hands nervously over her breast would the charm work oh she must knowshe must know she could not wait after a few moments that seemed like years she crept down the stairs and out into the dusk of the junewarm september night like a shadow she slipped up to the open parlour window and looked cautiously in between the white muslin curtains the next minute she had fallen on her knees in the mint bed she wished she could die then and there  the young man in the parlour was not randall burnley he was dark and smart and handsome he was sitting on the sofa by averys side holding her hands in his smiling into her rosy delighted excited face and he was bruce gordonno doubt of that bruce gordon the expected cousin from scotland  oh what have i done what have i done moaned poor janet wringing her hands she had seen averys face quite plainlyhad seen the look in her eyes avery had never looked at randall burnley like that granny thomas abominable ointment had worked all rightand avery had fallen in love with the wrong man  janet cold with horror and remorse dragged herself up to the window again and listened she must knowshe must be sure she could hear only a word here and there but that word was enough  i thought you promised to wait for me avery bruce said reproachfully  you were so long in coming backi thought you had forgotten me cried avery  i think i did forget a little avery i was such a boy but nowwell thank heaven i havent come too late  there was a silence and shameless janet peering above the window sill saw what she saw it was enough she crept away upstairs to her room she was lying there across the bed when avery swept ina splendid transfigured avery flushed triumphant janet sat up pallid tearstained and looked at her  janet said avery i am going to marry bruce gordon next wednesday night instead of randall burnley  janet sprang forward and caught averys hand  you must not she cried wildly its all my faultoh if i could only diei got the love ointment from granny thomas to rub on your eyes to make you love the first man you would see i meant it to be randalli thought it was randalloh avery  avery had been listening between amazement and anger now anger mastered amazement  janet sparhallow she cried are you crazy or do you mean that you went to granny thomasyou a sparhallowand asked her for a love philtre to make me love randall burnley  i didnt tell her it was for youshe thought i wanted it for myself moaned janet oh we must undo itill go to her againno doubt she knows of some way to undo the spell  avery whose rages never lasted long threw back her dark head and laughed ringingly  janet sparhallow you talk as if you lived in the dark ages the idea of supposing that horrid old woman could give you love philtres why girl ive always loved brucealways but i thought hed forgotten me and tonight when he came i found he hadnt theres the whole thing in a nutshell im going to marry him and go home with him to scotland  and what about randall said janet corpsewhite  oh randallpooh do you suppose im worrying about randall but you must go to him tomorrow and tell him for me janet  i will noti will not  then ill tell him myselfand ill tell him about you going to granny said avery cruelly janet dont stand there looking like that ive no patience with you i shall be perfectly happy with brucei would have been miserable with randall i know i shant sleep a wink tonightim so excited why janet ill be mrs gordon of gordon braeand ill have everything heart can desire and the man of my heart to boot what has lanky randall burnley with his little sixroomed house to set against that  if avery did not sleep neither did janet she lay awake till dawn suffering such misery as she had never endured in her life before she knew she must go to randall burnley tomorrow and break his heart if she did not avery would tell himtell him what janet had done and he must not know thathe must not janet could not bear that thought                                       it was a pallid dulleyed janet who went through the birch wood to the burnley farm next afternoon leaving behind her an excited household where the sudden change of bridegrooms as announced by avery had rather upset everybody janet found randall working in the garden of his new housesetting out rosebushes for averyavery who was to jilt him at the very altar so to speak he came over to open the gate for janet smiling his dear smile it was a dear smilejanet caught her breath over the dearness of itand she was going to blot it off his face  she spoke out with plainness and directness when you had to deal a mortal blow why try to lighten it  avery sent me to tell you that she is going to marry bruce gordon instead of you he came last nightand she says that she has always liked him best  a very curious change came over randalls facebut not the change janet had expected to see instead of turning pale randall flushed and instead of a sharp cry of pain and incredulity randall said in no uncertain tones thank god  janet wondered if she were dreaming granny thomas love potion seemed to have turned the world upside down for randalls arms were about her and randall was pressing his lean bronzed cheek to hers and randall was saying  now i can tell you janet how much i love you  me me choked janet  you why youre in the very core of my heart girl dont tell me you cant love meyou canyou mustwhy janet for his eyes had caught and locked with hers for a minute you do  there were five minutes about which nobody can tell anything for even randall and janet never knew clearly just what happened in those five minutes then janet feeling somehow as if she had died and then come back to life found her tongue  three years ago you came courting avery she said reproachfully  three years ago you were a child i did not think about you i wanted a wifeand avery was pretty i thought i was in love with her then you grew up all at onceand we were such good friendsi never could talk to averyshe wasnt interested in anything i saidand you have eyes that catch a manive always thought of your eyes but i was honourbound to averyi didnt dream you cared you
