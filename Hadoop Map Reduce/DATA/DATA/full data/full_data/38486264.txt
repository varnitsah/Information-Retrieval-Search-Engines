38486264	the scarlet letter  by nathaniel hawthorne    editors note  nathaniel hawthorne was already a man of fortysix and a tale writer of some twentyfour years standing when the scarlet letter appeared  he was born at salem mass on july 4th 1804 son of a seacaptain  he led there a shy and rather sombre life of few artistic encouragements yet not wholly uncongenial his moody intensely meditative temperament being considered  its colours and shadows are marvelously reflected in his twicetold tales and other short stories the product of his first literary period  even his college days at bowdoin did not quite break through his acquired and inherited reserve but beneath it all his faculty of divining men and women was exercised with almost uncanny prescience and subtlety  the scarlet letter which explains as much of this unique imaginative art as is to be gathered from reading his highest single achievement yet needs to be ranged with his other writings early and late to have its last effect  in the year that saw it published he began the house of the seven gables a later romance or prosetragedy of the puritanamerican community as he had himself known it defrauded of art and the joy of life starving for symbols as emerson has it  nathaniel hawthorne died at plymouth new hampshire on may 18th 1864  the following is the table of his romances stories and other works

the fireside and to my personal friendsan autobiographical impulse should twice in my life have taken possession of me in addressing the public  the first time was three or four years since when i favoured the readerinexcusably and for no earthly reason that either the indulgent reader or the intrusive author could imaginewith a description of my way of life in the deep quietude of an old manse  and nowbecause beyond my deserts i was happy enough to find a listener or two on the former occasioni again seize the public by the button and talk of my three years experience in a customhouse  the example of the famous p p clerk of this parish was never more faithfully followed  the truth seems to be however that when he casts his leaves forth upon the wind the author addresses not the many who will fling aside his volume or never take it up but the few who will understand him better than most of his schoolmates or lifemates some authors indeed do far more than this and indulge themselves in such confidential depths of revelation as could fittingly be addressed only and exclusively to the one heart and mind of perfect sympathy as if the printed book thrown at large on the wide world were certain to find out the divided segment of the writers own nature and complete his circle of existence by bringing him into communion with it  it is scarcely decorous however to speak all even where we speak impersonally  but as thoughts are frozen and utterance benumbed unless the speaker stand in some true relation with his audience it may be pardonable to imagine that a friend a kind and apprehensive though not the closest friend is listening to our talk and then a native reserve being thawed by this genial consciousness we may prate of the circumstances that lie around us and even of ourself but still keep the inmost me behind its veil  to this extent and within these limits an author methinks may be autobiographical without violating either the readers rights or his own  it will be seen likewise that this customhouse sketch has a certain propriety of a kind always recognised in literature as explaining how a large portion of the following pages came into my possession and as offering proofs of the authenticity of a narrative therein contained  this in facta desire to put myself in my true position as editor or very little more of the most prolix among the tales that make up my volumethis and no other is my true reason for assuming a personal relation with the public  in accomplishing the main purpose it has appeared allowable by a few extra touches to give a faint representation of a mode of life not heretofore described together with some of the characters that move in it among whom the author happened to make one  in my native town of salem at the head of what half a century ago in the days of old king derby was a bustling wharfbut which is now burdened with decayed wooden warehouses and exhibits few or no symptoms of commercial life except perhaps a bark or brig halfway down its melancholy length discharging hides or nearer at hand a nova scotia schooner pitching out her cargo of firewoodat the head i say of this dilapidated wharf which the tide often overflows and along which at the base and in the rear of the row of buildings the track of many languid years is seen in a border of unthrifty grasshere with a view from its front windows adown this not very enlivening prospect and thence across the harbour stands a spacious edifice of brick  from the loftiest point of its roof during precisely three and a half hours of each forenoon floats or droops in breeze or calm the banner of the republic but with the thirteen stripes turned vertically instead of horizontally and thus indicating that a civil and not a military post of uncle sams government is here established  its front is ornamented with a portico of halfadozen wooden pillars supporting a balcony beneath which a flight of wide granite steps descends towards the street  over the entrance hovers an enormous specimen of the american eagle with outspread wings a shield before her breast and if i recollect aright a bunch of intermingled thunderbolts and barbed arrows in each claw  with the customary infirmity of temper that characterizes this unhappy fowl she appears by the fierceness of her beak and eye and the general truculency of her attitude to threaten mischief to the inoffensive community and especially to warn all citizens careful of their safety against intruding on the premises which she overshadows with her wings  nevertheless vixenly as she looks many people are seeking at this very moment to shelter themselves under the wing of the federal eagle imagining i presume that her bosom has all the softness and snugness of an eiderdown pillow  but she has no great tenderness even in her best of moods and sooner or lateroftener soon than lateis apt to fling off her nestlings with a scratch of her claw a dab of her beak or a rankling wound from her barbed arrows  the pavement round about the abovedescribed edificewhich we may as well name at once as the customhouse of the porthas grass enough growing in its chinks to show that it has not of late days been worn by any multitudinous resort of business  in some months of the year however there often chances a forenoon when affairs move onward with a livelier tread  such occasions might remind the elderly citizen of that period before the last war with england when salem was a port by itself not scorned as she is now by her own merchants and shipowners who permit her wharves to crumble to ruin while their ventures go to swell needlessly and imperceptibly the mighty flood of commerce at new york or boston  on some such morning when three or four vessels happen to have arrived at once usually from africa or south americaor to be on the verge of their departure thitherward there is a sound of frequent feet passing briskly up and down the granite steps  here before his own wife has greeted him you may greet the seaflushed shipmaster just in port with his vessels papers under his arm in a tarnished tin box  here too comes his owner cheerful sombre gracious or in the sulks accordingly as his scheme of the now accomplished voyage has been realized in merchandise that will readily be turned to gold or has buried him under a bulk of incommodities such as nobody will care to rid him of  here likewisethe germ of the wrinklebrowed grizzlybearded careworn merchantwe have the smart young clerk who gets the taste of traffic as a wolfcub does of blood and already sends adventures in his masters ships when he had better be sailing mimic boats upon a millpond  another figure in the scene is the outwardbound sailor in quest of a protection or the recently arrived one pale and feeble seeking a passport to the hospital  nor must we forget the captains of the rusty little schooners that bring firewood from the british provinces a roughlooking set of tarpaulins without the alertness of the yankee aspect but contributing an item of no slight importance to our decaying trade  cluster all these individuals together as they sometimes were with other miscellaneous ones to diversify the group and for the time being it made the customhouse a stirring scene  more frequently however on ascending the steps you would discern in the entry if it were summer time or in their appropriate rooms if wintry or inclement weathersa row of venerable figures sitting in oldfashioned chairs which were tipped on their hind legs back against the wall  oftentimes they were asleep but occasionally might be heard talking together in voices between a speech and a snore and with that lack of energy that distinguishes the occupants of almshouses and all other human beings who depend for subsistence on charity on monopolized labour or anything else but their own independent exertions  these old gentlemenseated like matthew at the receipt of custom but not very liable to be summoned thence like him for apostolic errandswere customhouse officers  furthermore on the left hand as you enter the front door is a certain room or office about fifteen feet square and of a lofty height with two of its arched windows commanding a view of the aforesaid dilapidated wharf and the third looking across a narrow lane and along a portion of derby street  all three give glimpses of the shops of grocers blockmakers slopsellers and shipchandlers around the doors of which are generally to be seen laughing and gossiping clusters of old salts and such other wharfrats as haunt the wapping of a seaport  the room itself is cobwebbed and dingy with old paint its floor is strewn with grey sand in a fashion that has elsewhere fallen into long disuse and it is easy to conclude from the general slovenliness of the place that this is a sanctuary into which womankind with her tools of magic the broom and mop has very infrequent access  in the way of furniture there is a stove with a voluminous funnel an old pine desk with a threelegged stool beside it two or three woodenbottom chairs exceedingly decrepit and infirm andnot to forget the libraryon some shelves a score or two of volumes of the acts of congress and a bulky digest of the revenue laws  a tin pipe ascends through the ceiling and forms a medium of vocal communication with other parts of the edifice and here some six months agopacing from corner to corner or lounging on the longlegged stool with his elbow on the desk and his eyes wandering up and down the columns of the morning newspaperyou might have recognised honoured reader the same individual who welcomed you into his cheery little study where the sunshine glimmered so pleasantly through the willow branches on the western side of the old manse  but now should you go thither to seek him you would inquire in vain for the locofoco surveyor  the besom of reform hath swept him out of office and a worthier successor wears his dignity and pockets his emoluments  this old town of salemmy native place though i have dwelt much away from it both in boyhood and maturer yearspossesses or did possess a hold on my affection the force of which i have never realized during my seasons of actual residence here indeed so far as its physical aspect is concerned with its flat unvaried surface covered chiefly with wooden houses few or none of which pretend to architectural beautyits irregularity which is neither picturesque nor quaint but only tameits long and lazy street lounging wearisomely through the whole extent of the peninsula with gallows hill and new guinea at one end and a view of the almshouse at the othersuch being the features of my native town it would be quite as reasonable to form a sentimental attachment to a disarranged checkerboard  and yet though invariably happiest elsewhere there is within me a feeling for old salem which in lack of a better phrase i must be content to call affection  the sentiment is probably assignable to the deep and aged roots which my family has stuck into the soil  it is now nearly two centuries and a quarter since the original briton the earliest emigrant of my name made his appearance in the wild and forestbordered settlement which has since become a city  and here his descendants have been born and died and have mingled their earthly substance with the soil until no small portion of it must necessarily be akin to the mortal frame wherewith for a little while i walk the streets  in part therefore the attachment which i speak of is the mere sensuous sympathy of dust for dust  few of my countrymen can know what it is nor as frequent transplantation is perhaps better for the stock need they consider it desirable to know  but the sentiment has likewise its moral quality  the figure of that first ancestor invested by family tradition with a dim and dusky grandeur was present to my boyish imagination as far back as i can remember  it still haunts me and induces a sort of homefeeling with the past which i scarcely claim in reference to the present phase of the town  i seem to have a stronger claim to a residence here on account of this grave bearded sablecloaked and steeplecrowned progenitorwho came so early with his bible and his sword and trode the unworn street with such a stately port and made so large a figure as a man of war and peacea stronger claim than for myself whose name is seldom heard and my face hardly known  he was a soldier legislator judge he was a ruler in the church he had all the puritanic traits both good and evil  he was likewise a bitter persecutor as witness the quakers who have remembered him in their histories and relate an incident of his hard severity towards a woman of their sect which will last longer it is to be feared than any record of his better deeds although these were many  his son too inherited the persecuting spirit and made himself so conspicuous in the martyrdom of the witches that their blood may fairly be said to have left a stain upon him  so deep a stain indeed that his dry old bones in the charterstreet burialground must still retain it if they have not crumbled utterly to dust  i know not whether these ancestors of mine bethought themselves to repent and ask pardon of heaven for their cruelties or whether they are now groaning under the heavy consequences of them in another state of being  at all events i the present writer as their representative hereby take shame upon myself for their sakes and pray that any curse incurred by themas i have heard and as the dreary and unprosperous condition of the race for many a long year back would argue to existmay be now and henceforth removed  doubtless however either of these stern and blackbrowed puritans would have thought it quite a sufficient retribution for his sins that after so long a lapse of years the old trunk of the family tree with so much venerable moss upon it should have borne as its topmost bough an idler like myself  no aim that i have ever cherished would they recognise as laudable no success of mineif my life beyond its domestic scope had ever been brightened by successwould they deem otherwise than worthless if not positively disgraceful  what is he murmurs one grey shadow of my forefathers to the other  a writer of story books  what kind of business in lifewhat mode of glorifying god or being serviceable to mankind in his day and generationmay that be  why the degenerate fellow might as well have been a fiddler  such are the compliments bandied between my great grandsires and myself across the gulf of time and yet let them scorn me as they will strong traits of their nature have intertwined themselves with mine  planted deep in the towns earliest infancy and childhood by these two earnest and energetic men the race has ever since subsisted here always too in respectability never so far as i have known disgraced by a single unworthy member but seldom or never on the other hand after the first two generations performing any memorable deed or so much as putting forward a claim to public notice  gradually they have sunk almost out of sight as old houses here and there about the streets get covered halfway to the eaves by the accumulation of new soil from father to son for above a hundred years they followed the sea a greyheaded shipmaster in each generation retiring from the quarterdeck to the homestead while a boy of fourteen took the hereditary place before the mast confronting the salt spray and the gale which had blustered against his sire and grandsire the boy also in due time passed from the forecastle to the cabin spent a tempestuous manhood and returned from his worldwanderings to grow old and die and mingle his dust with the natal earth  this long connexion of a family with one spot as its place of birth and burial creates a kindred between the human being and the locality quite independent of any charm in the scenery or moral circumstances that surround him  it is not love but instinct  the new inhabitantwho came himself from a foreign land or whose father or grandfather camehas little claim to be called a salemite he has no conception of the oysterlike tenacity with which an old settler over whom his third century is creeping clings to the spot where his successive generations have been embedded  it is no matter that the place is joyless for him that he is weary of the old wooden houses the mud and dust the dead level of site and sentiment the chill east wind and the chillest of social atmospheresall these and whatever faults besides he may see or imagine are nothing to the purpose  the spell survives and just as powerfully as if the natal spot were an earthly paradise  so has it been in my case  i felt it almost as a destiny to make salem my home so that the mould of features and cast of character which had all along been familiar hereever as one representative of the race lay down in the grave another assuming as it were his sentrymarch along the main streetmight still in my little day be seen and recognised in the old town  nevertheless this very sentiment is an evidence that the connexion which has become an unhealthy one should at last be severed  human nature will not flourish any more than a potato if it be planted and replanted for too long a series of generations in the same wornout soil  my children have had other birthplaces and so far as their fortunes may be within my control shall strike their roots into unaccustomed earth  on emerging from the old manse it was chiefly this strange indolent unjoyous attachment for my native town that brought me to fill a place in uncle sams brick edifice when i might as well or better have gone somewhere else  my doom was on me  it was not the first time nor the second that i had gone awayas it seemed permanentlybut yet returned like the bad halfpenny or as if salem were for me the inevitable centre of the universe  so one fine morning i ascended the flight of granite steps with the presidents commission in my pocket and was introduced to the corps of gentlemen who were to aid me in my weighty responsibility as chief executive officer of the customhouse  i doubt greatlyor rather i do not doubt at allwhether any public functionary of the united states either in the civil or military line has ever had such a patriarchal body of veterans under his orders as myself  the whereabouts of the oldest inhabitant was at once settled when i looked at them  for upwards of twenty years before this epoch the independent position of the collector had kept the salem customhouse out of the whirlpool of political vicissitude which makes the tenure of office generally so fragile  a soldiernew englands most distinguished soldierhe stood firmly on the pedestal of his gallant services and himself secure in the wise liberality of the successive administrations through which he had held office he had been the safety of his subordinates in many an hour of danger and heartquake  general miller was radically conservative a man over whose kindly nature habit had no slight influence attaching himself strongly to familiar faces and with difficulty moved to change even when change might have brought unquestionable improvement  thus on taking charge of my department i found few but aged men  they were ancient seacaptains for the most part who after being tossed on every sea and standing up sturdily against lifes tempestuous blast had finally drifted into this quiet nook where with little to disturb them except the periodical terrors of a presidential election they one and all acquired a new lease of existence  though by no means less liable than their fellowmen to age and infirmity they had evidently some talisman or other that kept death at bay  two or three of their number as i was assured being gouty and rheumatic or perhaps bedridden never dreamed of making their appearance at the customhouse during a large part of the year but after a torpid winter would creep out into the warm sunshine of may or june go lazily about what they termed duty and at their own leisure and convenience betake themselves to bed again  i must plead guilty to the charge of abbreviating the official breath of more than one of these venerable servants of the republic  they were allowed on my representation to rest from their arduous labours and soon afterwardsas if their sole principle of life had been zeal for their countrys serviceas i verily believe it waswithdrew to a better world  it is a pious consolation to me that through my interference a sufficient space was allowed them for repentance of the evil and corrupt practices into which as a matter of course every customhouse officer must be supposed to fall neither the front nor the back entrance of the customhouse opens on the road to paradise  the greater part of my officers were whigs  it was well for their venerable brotherhood that the new surveyor was not a politician and though a faithful democrat in principle neither received nor held his office with any reference to political services  had it been otherwisehad an active politician been put into this influential post to assume the easy task of making head against a whig collector whose infirmities withheld him from the personal administration of his officehardly a man of the old corps would have drawn the breath of official life within a month after the exterminating angel had come up the customhouse steps  according to the received code in such matters it would have been nothing short of duty in a politician to bring every one of those white heads under the axe of the guillotine  it was plain enough to discern that the old fellows dreaded some such discourtesy at my hands  it pained and at the same time amused me to behold the terrors that attended my advent to see a furrowed cheek weatherbeaten by half a century of storm turn ashy pale at the glance of so harmless an individual as myself to detect as one or another addressed me the tremor of a voice which in longpast days had been wont to bellow through a speakingtrumpet hoarsely enough to frighten boreas himself to silence  they knew these excellent old persons that by all established ruleand as regarded some of them weighed by their own lack of efficiency for businessthey ought to have given place to younger men more orthodox in politics and altogether fitter than themselves to serve our common uncle  i knew it too but could never quite find in my heart to act upon the knowledge  much and deservedly to my own discredit therefore and considerably to the detriment of my official conscience they continued during my incumbency to creep about the wharves and loiter up and down the customhouse steps  they spent a good deal of time also asleep in their accustomed corners with their chairs tilted back against the walls awaking however once or twice in the forenoon to bore one another with the several thousandth repetition of old seastories and mouldy jokes that had grown to be passwords and countersigns among them  the discovery was soon made i imagine that the new surveyor had no great harm in him  so with lightsome hearts and the happy consciousness of being usefully employedin their own behalf at least if not for our beloved countrythese good old gentlemen went through the various formalities of office sagaciously under their spectacles did they peep into the holds of vessels  mighty was their fuss about little matters and marvellous sometimes the obtuseness that allowed greater ones to slip between their fingers whenever such a mischance occurredwhen a waggonload of valuable merchandise had been smuggled ashore at noonday perhaps and directly beneath their unsuspicious nosesnothing could exceed the vigilance and alacrity with which they proceeded to lock and doublelock and secure with tape and sealingwax all the avenues of the delinquent vessel  instead of a reprimand for their previous negligence the case seemed rather to require an eulogium on their praiseworthy caution after the mischief had happened a grateful recognition of the promptitude of their zeal the moment that there was no longer any remedy  unless people are more than commonly disagreeable it is my foolish habit to contract a kindness for them  the better part of my companions character if it have a better part is that which usually comes uppermost in my regard and forms the type whereby i recognise the man  as most of these old customhouse officers had good traits and as my position in reference to them being paternal and protective was favourable to the growth of friendly sentiments i soon grew to like them all  it was pleasant in the summer forenoonswhen the fervent heat that almost liquefied the rest of the human family merely communicated a genial warmth to their half torpid systemsit was pleasant to hear them chatting in the back entry a row of them all tipped against the wall as usual while the frozen witticisms of past generations were thawed out and came bubbling with laughter from their lips  externally the jollity of aged men has much in common with the mirth of children the intellect any more than a deep sense of humour has little to do with the matter it is with both a gleam that plays upon the surface and imparts a sunny and cheery aspect alike to the green branch and grey mouldering trunk  in one case however it is real sunshine in the other it more resembles the phosphorescent glow of decaying wood  it would be sad injustice the reader must understand to represent all my excellent old friends as in their dotage  in the first place my coadjutors were not invariably old there were men among them in their strength and prime of marked ability and energy and altogether superior to the sluggish and dependent mode of life on which their evil stars had cast them then moreover the white locks of age were sometimes found to be the thatch of an intellectual tenement in good repair  but as respects the majority of my corps of veterans there will be no wrong done if i characterize them generally as a set of wearisome old souls who had gathered nothing worth preservation from their varied experience of life  they seemed to have flung away all the golden grain of practical wisdom which they had enjoyed so many opportunities of harvesting and most carefully to have stored their memory with the husks  they spoke with far more interest and unction of their mornings breakfast or yesterdays todays or tomorrows dinner than of the shipwreck of forty or fifty years ago and all the worlds wonders which they had witnessed with their youthful eyes  the father of the customhousethe patriarch not only of this little squad of officials but i am bold to say of the respectable body of tidewaiters all over the united stateswas a certain permanent inspector  he might truly be termed a legitimate son of the revenue system dyed in the wool or rather born in the purple since his sire a revolutionary colonel and formerly collector of the port had created an office for him and appointed him to fill it at a period of the early ages which few living men can now remember  this inspector when i first knew him was a man of fourscore years or thereabouts and certainly one of the most wonderful specimens of wintergreen that you would be likely to discover in a lifetimes search  with his florid cheek his compact figure smartly arrayed in a brightbuttoned blue coat his brisk and vigorous step and his hale and hearty aspect altogether he seemednot young indeedbut a kind of new contrivance of mother nature in the shape of man whom age and infirmity had no business to touch  his voice and laugh which perpetually reechoed through the customhouse had nothing of the tremulous quaver and cackle of an old mans utterance they came strutting out of his lungs like the crow of a cock or the blast of a clarion  looking at him merely as an animaland there was very little else to look athe was a most satisfactory object from the thorough healthfulness and wholesomeness of his system and his capacity at that extreme age to enjoy all or nearly all the delights which he had ever aimed at or conceived of  the careless security of his life in the customhouse on a regular income and with but slight and infrequent apprehensions of removal had no doubt contributed to make time pass lightly over him  the original and more potent causes however lay in the rare perfection of his animal nature the moderate proportion of intellect and the very trifling admixture of moral and spiritual ingredients these latter qualities indeed being in barely enough measure to keep the old gentleman from walking on allfours  he possessed no power of thought no depth of feeling no troublesome sensibilities nothing in short but a few commonplace instincts which aided by the cheerful temper which grew inevitably out of his physical wellbeing did duty very respectably and to general acceptance in lieu of a heart he had been the husband of three wives all long since dead the father of twenty children most of whom at every age of childhood or maturity had likewise returned to dust  here one would suppose might have been sorrow enough to imbue the sunniest disposition through and through with a sable tinge  not so with our old inspector  one brief sigh sufficed to carry off the entire burden of these dismal reminiscences  the next moment he was as ready for sport as any unbreeched infant far readier than the collectors junior clerk who at nineteen years was much the elder and graver man of the two  i used to watch and study this patriarchal personage with i think livelier curiosity than any other form of humanity there presented to my notice  he was in truth a rare phenomenon so perfect in one point of view so shallow so delusive so impalpable such an absolute nonentity in every other  my conclusion was that he had no soul no heart no mind nothing as i have already said but instincts and yet withal so cunningly had the few materials of his character been put together that there was no painful perception of deficiency but on my part an entire contentment with what i found in him it might be difficultand it was soto conceive how he should exist hereafter so earthly and sensuous did he seem but surely his existence here admitting that it was to terminate with his last breath had been not unkindly given with no higher moral responsibilities than the beasts of the field but with a larger scope of enjoyment than theirs and with all their blessed immunity from the dreariness and duskiness of age  one point in which he had vastly the advantage over his fourfooted brethren was his ability to recollect the good dinners which it had made no small portion of the happiness of his life to eat  his gourmandism was a highly agreeable trait and to hear him talk of roast meat was as appetizing as a pickle or an oyster  as he possessed no higher attribute and neither sacrificed nor vitiated any spiritual endowment by devoting all his energies and ingenuities to subserve the delight and profit of his maw it always pleased and satisfied me to hear him expatiate on fish poultry and butchers meat and the most eligible methods of preparing them for the table  his reminiscences of good cheer however ancient the date of the actual banquet seemed to bring the savour of pig or turkey under ones very nostrils  there were flavours on his palate that had lingered there not less than sixty or seventy years and were still apparently as fresh as that of the mutton chop which he had just devoured for his breakfast  i have heard him smack his lips over dinners every guest at which except himself had long been food for worms  it was marvellous to observe how the ghosts of bygone meals were continually rising up before himnot in anger or retribution but as if grateful for his former appreciation and seeking to reduplicate an endless series of enjoyment at once shadowy and sensual a tenderloin of beef a hindquarter of veal a sparerib of pork a particular chicken or a remarkably praiseworthy turkey which had perhaps adorned his board in the days of the elder adams would be remembered while all the subsequent experience of our race and all the events that brightened or darkened his individual career had gone over him with as little permanent effect as the passing breeze  the chief tragic event of the old mans life so far as i could judge was his mishap with a certain goose which lived and died some twenty or forty years ago a goose of most promising figure but which at table proved so inveterately tough that the carvingknife would make no impression on its carcase and it could only be divided with an axe and handsaw  but it is time to quit this sketch on which however i should be glad to dwell at considerably more length because of all men whom i have ever known this individual was fittest to be a customhouse officer  most persons owing to causes which i may not have space to hint at suffer moral detriment from this peculiar mode of life  the old inspector was incapable of it and were he to continue in office to the end of time would be just as good as he was then and sit down to dinner with just as good an appetite  there is one likeness without which my gallery of customhouse portraits would be strangely incomplete but which my comparatively few opportunities for observation enable me to sketch only in the merest outline  it is that of the collector our gallant old general who after his brilliant military service subsequently to which he had ruled over a wild western territory had come hither twenty years before to spend the decline of his varied and honourable life  the brave soldier had already numbered nearly or quite his threescore years and ten and was pursuing the remainder of his earthly march burdened with infirmities which even the martial music of his own spiritstirring recollections could do little towards lightening  the step was palsied now that had been foremost in the charge  it was only with the assistance of a servant and by leaning his hand heavily on the iron balustrade that he could slowly and painfully ascend the customhouse steps and with a toilsome progress across the floor attain his customary chair beside the fireplace  there he used to sit gazing with a somewhat dim serenity of aspect at the figures that came and went amid the rustle of papers the administering of oaths the discussion of business and the casual talk of the office all which sounds and circumstances seemed but indistinctly to impress his senses and hardly to make their way into his inner sphere of contemplation  his countenance in this repose was mild and kindly  if his notice was sought an expression of courtesy and interest gleamed out upon his features proving that there was light within him and that it was only the outward medium of the intellectual lamp that obstructed the rays in their passage  the closer you penetrated to the substance of his mind the sounder it appeared  when no longer called upon to speak or listeneither of which operations cost him an evident efforthis face would briefly subside into its former not uncheerful quietude  it was not painful to behold this look for though dim it had not the imbecility of decaying age  the framework of his nature originally strong and massive was not yet crumpled into ruin  to observe and define his character however under such disadvantages was as difficult a task as to trace out and build up anew in imagination an old fortress like ticonderoga from a view of its grey and broken ruins  here and there perchance the walls may remain almost complete but elsewhere may be only a shapeless mound cumbrous with its very strength and overgrown through long years of peace and neglect with grass and alien weeds  nevertheless looking at the old warrior with affectionfor slight as was the communication between us my feeling towards him like that of all bipeds and quadrupeds who knew him might not improperly be termed soi could discern the main points of his portrait  it was marked with the noble and heroic qualities which showed it to be not a mere accident but of good right that he had won a distinguished name  his spirit could never i conceive have been characterized by an uneasy activity it must at any period of his life have required an impulse to set him in motion but once stirred up with obstacles to overcome and an adequate object to be attained it was not in the man to give out or fail  the heat that had formerly pervaded his nature and which was not yet extinct was never of the kind that flashes and flickers in a blaze but rather a deep red glow as of iron in a furnace  weight solidity firmnessthis was the expression of his repose even in such decay as had crept untimely over him at the period of which i speak  but i could imagine even then that under some excitement which should go deeply into his consciousnessroused by a trumpets peal loud enough to awaken all of his energies that were not dead but only slumberinghe was yet capable of flinging off his infirmities like a sick mans gown dropping the staff of age to seize a battlesword and starting up once more a warrior  and in so intense a moment his demeanour would have still been calm  such an exhibition however was but to be pictured in fancy not to be anticipated nor desired  what i saw in himas evidently as the indestructible ramparts of old ticonderoga already cited as the most appropriate similewas the features of stubborn and ponderous endurance which might well have amounted to obstinacy in his earlier days of integrity that like most of his other endowments lay in a somewhat heavy mass and was just as unmalleable or unmanageable as a ton of iron ore and of benevolence which fiercely as he led the bayonets on at chippewa or fort erie i take to be of quite as genuine a stamp as what actuates any or all the polemical philanthropists of the age  he had slain men with his own hand for aught i knowcertainly they had fallen like blades of grass at the sweep of the scythe before the charge to which his spirit imparted its triumphant energybut be that as it might there was never in his heart so much cruelty as would have brushed the down off a butterflys wing  i have not known the man to whose innate kindliness i would more confidently make an appeal  many characteristicsand those too which contribute not the least forcibly to impart resemblance in a sketchmust have vanished or been obscured before i met the general  all merely graceful attributes are usually the most evanescent nor does nature adorn the human ruin with blossoms of new beauty that have their roots and proper nutriment only in the chinks and crevices of decay as she sows wallflowers over the ruined fortress of ticonderoga  still even in respect of grace and beauty there were points well worth noting  a ray of humour now and then would make its way through the veil of dim obstruction and glimmer pleasantly upon our faces  a trait of native elegance seldom seen in the masculine character after childhood or early youth was shown in the generals fondness for the sight and fragrance of flowers  an old soldier might be supposed to prize only the bloody laurel on his brow but here was one who seemed to have a young girls appreciation of the floral tribe  there beside the fireplace the brave old general used to sit while the surveyorthough seldom when it could be avoided taking upon himself the difficult task of engaging him in conversationwas fond of standing at a distance and watching his quiet and almost slumberous countenance  he seemed away from us although we saw him but a few yards off remote though we passed close beside his chair unattainable though we might have stretched forth our hands and touched his own  it might be that he lived a more real life within his thoughts than amid the unappropriate environment of the collectors office  the evolutions of the parade the tumult of the battle the flourish of old heroic music heard thirty years beforesuch scenes and sounds perhaps were all alive before his intellectual sense meanwhile the merchants and shipmasters the spruce clerks and uncouth sailors entered and departed the bustle of his commercial and customhouse life kept up its little murmur round about him and neither with the men nor their affairs did the general appear to sustain the most distant relation  he was as much out of place as an old swordnow rusty but which had flashed once in the battles front and showed still a bright gleam along its bladewould have been among the inkstands paperfolders and mahogany rulers on the deputy collectors desk  there was one thing that much aided me in renewing and recreating the stalwart soldier of the niagara frontierthe man of true and simple energy  it was the recollection of those memorable words of hisill try sirspoken on the very verge of a desperate and heroic enterprise and breathing the soul and spirit of new england hardihood comprehending all perils and encountering all  if in our country valour were rewarded by heraldic honour this phrasewhich it seems so easy to speak but which only he with such a task of danger and glory before him has ever spokenwould be the best and fittest of all mottoes for the generals shield of arms  it contributes greatly towards a mans moral and intellectual health to be brought into habits of companionship with individuals unlike himself who care little for his pursuits and whose sphere and abilities he must go out of himself to appreciate  the accidents of my life have often afforded me this advantage but never with more fulness and variety than during my continuance in office  there was one man especially the observation of whose character gave me a new idea of talent  his gifts were emphatically those of a man of business prompt acute clearminded with an eye that saw through all perplexities and a faculty of arrangement that made them vanish as by the waving of an enchanters wand  bred up from boyhood in the customhouse it was his proper field of activity and the many intricacies of business so harassing to the interloper presented themselves before him with the regularity of a perfectly comprehended system  in my contemplation he stood as the ideal of his class  he was indeed the customhouse in himself or at all events the mainspring that kept its variously revolving wheels in motion for in an institution like this where its officers are appointed to subserve their own profit and convenience and seldom with a leading reference to their fitness for the duty to be performed they must perforce seek elsewhere the dexterity which is not in them thus by an inevitable necessity as a magnet attracts steelfilings so did our man of business draw to himself the difficulties which everybody met with  with an easy condescension and kind forbearance towards our stupiditywhich to his order of mind must have seemed little short of crimewould he forthwith by the merest touch of his finger make the incomprehensible as clear as daylight  the merchants valued him not less than we his esoteric friends  his integrity was perfect it was a law of nature with him rather than a choice or a principle nor can it be otherwise than the main condition of an intellect so remarkably clear and accurate as his to be honest and regular in the administration of affairs  a stain on his conscience as to anything that came within the range of his vocation would trouble such a man very much in the same way though to a far greater degree than an error in the balance of an account or an inkblot on the fair page of a book of record  here in a wordand it is a rare instance in my lifei had met with a person thoroughly adapted to the situation which he held  such were some of the people with whom i now found myself connected  i took it in good part at the hands of providence that i was thrown into a position so little akin to my past habits and set myself seriously to gather from it whatever profit was to be had  after my fellowship of toil and impracticable schemes with the dreamy brethren of brook farm after living for three years within the subtle influence of an intellect like emersons after those wild free days on the assabeth indulging fantastic speculations beside our fire of fallen boughs with ellery channing after talking with thoreau about pinetrees and indian relics in his hermitage at walden after growing fastidious by sympathy with the classic refinement of hillards culture after becoming imbued with poetic sentiment at longfellows hearthstoneit was time at length that i should exercise other faculties of my nature and nourish myself with food for which i had hitherto had little appetite even the old inspector was desirable as a change of diet to a man who had known alcott  i looked upon it as an evidence in some measure of a system naturally well balanced and lacking no essential part of a thorough organization that with such associates to remember i could mingle at once with men of altogether different qualities and never murmur at the change  literature its exertions and objects were now of little moment in my regard  i cared not at this period for books they were apart from me  natureexcept it were human naturethe nature that is developed in earth and sky was in one sense hidden from me and all the imaginative delight wherewith it had been spiritualized passed away out of my mind  a gift a faculty if it had not been departed was suspended and inanimate within me there would have been something sad unutterably dreary in all this had i not been conscious that it lay at my own option to recall whatever was valuable in the past  it might be true indeed that this was a life which could not with impunity be lived too long else it might make me permanently other than i had been without transforming me into any shape which it would be worth my while to take  but i never considered it as other than a transitory life  there was always a prophetic instinct a low whisper in my ear that within no long period and whenever a new change of custom should be essential to my good change would come  meanwhile there i was a surveyor of the revenue and so far as i have been able to understand as good a surveyor as need be  a man of thought fancy and sensibility had he ten times the surveyors proportion of those qualities may at any time be a man of affairs if he will only choose to give himself the trouble  my fellowofficers and the merchants and seacaptains with whom my official duties brought me into any manner of connection viewed me in no other light and probably knew me in no other character  none of them i presume had ever read a page of my inditing or would have cared a fig the more for me if they had read them all nor would it have mended the matter in the least had those same unprofitable pages been written with a pen like that of burns or of chaucer each of whom was a customhouse officer in his day as well as i it is a good lessonthough it may often be a hard onefor a man who has dreamed of literary fame and of making for himself a rank among the worlds dignitaries by such means to step aside out of the narrow circle in which his claims are recognized and to find how utterly devoid of significance beyond that circle is all that he achieves and all he aims at  i know not that i especially needed the lesson either in the way of warning or rebuke but at any rate i learned it thoroughly nor it gives me pleasure to reflect did the truth as it came home to my perception ever cost me a pang or require to be thrown off in a sigh  in the way of literary talk it is true the naval officeran excellent fellow who came into the office with me and went out only a little laterwould often engage me in a discussion about one or the other of his favourite topics napoleon or shakespeare  the collectors junior clerk too a young gentleman who it was whispered occasionally covered a sheet of uncle sams letter paper with what at the distance of a few yards looked very much like poetryused now and then to speak to me of books as matters with which i might possibly be conversant this was my all of lettered intercourse and it was quite sufficient for my necessities  no longer seeking nor caring that my name should be blasoned abroad on titlepages i smiled to think that it had now another kind of vogue  the customhouse marker imprinted it with a stencil and black paint on pepperbags and baskets of anatto and cigarboxes and bales of all kinds of dutiable merchandise in testimony that these commodities had paid the impost and gone regularly through the office  borne on such queer vehicle of fame a knowledge of my existence so far as a name conveys it was carried where it had never been before and i hope will never go again  but the past was not dead  once in a great while the thoughts that had seemed so vital and so active yet had been put to rest so quietly revived again  one of the most remarkable occasions when the habit of bygone days awoke in me was that which brings it within the law of literary propriety to offer the public the sketch which i am now writing  in the second storey of the customhouse there is a large room in which the brickwork and naked rafters have never been covered with panelling and plaster  the edificeoriginally projected on a scale adapted to the old commercial enterprise of the port and with an idea of subsequent prosperity destined never to be realizedcontains far more space than its occupants know what to do with  this airy hall therefore over the collectors apartments remains unfinished to this day and in spite of the aged cobwebs that festoon its dusky beams appears still to await the labour of the carpenter and mason  at one end of the room in a recess were a number of barrels piled one upon another containing bundles of official documents  large quantities of similar rubbish lay lumbering the floor  it was sorrowful to think how many days and weeks and months and years of toil had been wasted on these musty papers which were now only an encumbrance on earth and were hidden away in this forgotten corner never more to be glanced at by human eyes  but then what reams of other manuscriptsfilled not with the dulness of official formalities but with the thought of inventive brains and the rich effusion of deep heartshad gone equally to oblivion and that moreover without serving a purpose in their day as these heapedup papers had andsaddest of allwithout purchasing for their writers the comfortable livelihood which the clerks of the customhouse had gained by these worthless scratchings of the pen  yet not altogether worthless perhaps as materials of local history here no doubt statistics of the former commerce of salem might be discovered and memorials of her princely merchantsold king derbyold billy grayold simon forresterand many another magnate in his day whose powdered head however was scarcely in the tomb before his mountain pile of wealth began to dwindle the founders of the greater part of the families which now compose the aristocracy of salem might here be traced from the petty and obscure beginnings of their traffic at periods generally much posterior to the revolution upward to what their children look upon as longestablished rank  prior to the revolution there is a dearth of records the earlier documents and archives of the customhouse having probably been carried off to halifax when all the kings officials accompanied the british army in its flight from boston  it has often been a matter of regret with me for going back perhaps to the days of the protectorate those papers must have contained many references to forgotten or remembered men and to antique customs which would have affected me with the same pleasure as when i used to pick up indian arrowheads in the field near the old manse  but one idle and rainy day it was my fortune to make a discovery of some little interest  poking and burrowing into the heapedup rubbish in the corner unfolding one and another document and reading the names of vessels that had long ago foundered at sea or rotted at the wharves and those of merchants never heard of now on change nor very readily decipherable on their mossy tombstones glancing at such matters with the saddened weary halfreluctant interest which we bestow on the corpse of dead activityand exerting my fancy sluggish with little use to raise up from these dry bones an image of the old towns brighter aspect when india was a new region and only salem knew the way thitheri chanced to lay my hand on a small package carefully done up in a piece of ancient yellow parchment  this envelope had the air of an official record of some period long past when clerks engrossed their stiff and formal chirography on more substantial materials than at present  there was something about it that quickened an instinctive curiosity and made me undo the faded red tape that tied up the package with the sense that a treasure would here be brought to light  unbending the rigid folds of the parchment cover i found it to be a commission under the hand and seal of governor shirley in favour of one jonathan pue as surveyor of his majestys customs for the port of salem in the province of massachusetts bay  i remembered to have read probably in felts annals a notice of the decease of mr surveyor pue about fourscore years ago and likewise in a newspaper of recent times an account of the digging up of his remains in the little graveyard of st peters church during the renewal of that edifice  nothing if i rightly call to mind was left of my respected predecessor save an imperfect skeleton and some fragments of apparel and a wig of majestic frizzle which unlike the head that it once adorned was in very satisfactory preservation  but on examining the papers which the parchment commission served to envelop i found more traces of mr pues mental part and the internal operations of his head than the frizzled wig had contained of the venerable skull itself  they were documents in short not official but of a private nature or at least written in his private capacity and apparently with his own hand  i could account for their being included in the heap of customhouse lumber only by the fact that mr pues death had happened suddenly and that these papers which he probably kept in his official desk had never come to the knowledge of his heirs or were supposed to relate to the business of the revenue  on the transfer of the archives to halifax this package proving to be of no public concern was left behind and had remained ever since unopened  the ancient surveyorbeing little molested i suppose at that early day with business pertaining to his officeseems to have devoted some of his many leisure hours to researches as a local antiquarian and other inquisitions of a similar nature  these supplied material for petty activity to a mind that would otherwise have been eaten up with rust  a portion of his facts bytheby did me good service in the preparation of the article entitled main street included in the present volume  the remainder may perhaps be applied to purposes equally valuable hereafter or not impossibly may be worked up so far as they go into a regular history of salem should my veneration for the natal soil ever impel me to so pious a task  meanwhile they shall be at the command of any gentleman inclined and competent to take the unprofitable labour off my hands  as a final disposition i contemplate depositing them with the essex historical society  but the object that most drew my attention to the mysterious package was a certain affair of fine red cloth much worn and faded there were traces about it of gold embroidery which however was greatly frayed and defaced so that none or very little of the glitter was left  it had been wrought as was easy to perceive with wonderful skill of needlework and the stitch as i am assured by ladies conversant with such mysteries gives evidence of a now forgotten art not to be discovered even by the process of picking out the threads  this rag of scarlet clothfor time and wear and a sacrilegious moth had reduced it to little other than a ragon careful examination assumed the shape of a letter  it was the capital letter a  by an accurate measurement each limb proved to be precisely three inches and a quarter in length  it had been intended there could be no doubt as an ornamental article of dress but how it was to be worn or what rank honour and dignity in bypast times were signified by it was a riddle which so evanescent are the fashions of the world in these particulars i saw little hope of solving  and yet it strangely interested me  my eyes fastened themselves upon the old scarlet letter and would not be turned aside  certainly there was some deep meaning in it most worthy of interpretation and which as it were streamed forth from the mystic symbol subtly communicating itself to my sensibilities but evading the analysis of my mind  when thus perplexedand cogitating among other hypotheses whether the letter might not have been one of those decorations which the white men used to contrive in order to take the eyes of indiansi happened to place it on my breast  it seemed to methe reader may smile but must not doubt my wordit seemed to me then that i experienced a sensation not altogether physical yet almost so as of burning heat and as if the letter were not of red cloth but redhot iron  i shuddered and involuntarily let it fall upon the floor  in the absorbing contemplation of the scarlet letter i had hitherto neglected to examine a small roll of dingy paper around which it had been twisted  this i now opened and had the satisfaction to find recorded by the old surveyors pen a reasonably complete explanation of the whole affair  there were several foolscap sheets containing many particulars respecting the life and conversation of one hester prynne who appeared to have been rather a noteworthy personage in the view of our ancestors  she had flourished during the period between the early days of massachusetts and the close of the seventeenth century  aged persons alive in the time of mr surveyor pue and from whose oral testimony he had made up his narrative remembered her in their youth as a very old but not decrepit woman of a stately and solemn aspect  it had been her habit from an almost immemorial date to go about the country as a kind of voluntary nurse and doing whatever miscellaneous good she might taking upon herself likewise to give advice in all matters especially those of the heart by which meansas a person of such propensities inevitably mustshe gained from many people the reverence due to an angel but i should imagine was looked upon by others as an intruder and a nuisance  prying further into the manuscript i found the record of other doings and sufferings of this singular woman for most of which the reader is referred to the story entitled the scarlet letter and it should be borne carefully in mind that the main facts of that story are authorized and authenticated by the document of mr surveyor pue  the original papers together with the scarlet letter itselfa most curious relicare still in my possession and shall be freely exhibited to whomsoever induced by the great interest of the narrative may desire a sight of them  i must not be understood affirming that in the dressing up of the tale and imagining the motives and modes of passion that influenced the characters who figure in it i have invariably confined myself within the limits of the old surveyors halfadozen sheets of foolscap  on the contrary i have allowed myself as to such points nearly or altogether as much license as if the facts had been entirely of my own invention  what i contend for is the authenticity of the outline  this incident recalled my mind in some degree to its old track  there seemed to be here the groundwork of a tale  it impressed me as if the ancient surveyor in his garb of a hundred years gone by and wearing his immortal wigwhich was buried with him but did not perish in the gravehad met me in the deserted chamber of the customhouse  in his port was the dignity of one who had borne his majestys commission and who was therefore illuminated by a ray of the splendour that shone so dazzlingly about the throne  how unlike alas the hangdog look of a republican official who as the servant of the people feels himself less than the least and below the lowest of his masters  with his own ghostly hand the obscurely seen but majestic figure had imparted to me the scarlet symbol and the little roll of explanatory manuscript  with his own ghostly voice he had exhorted me on the sacred consideration of my filial duty and reverence towards himwho might reasonably regard himself as my official ancestorto bring his mouldy and motheaten lucubrations before the public  do this said the ghost of mr surveyor pue emphatically nodding the head that looked so imposing within its memorable wig do this and the profit shall be all your own  you will shortly need it for it is not in your days as it was in mine when a mans office was a lifelease and oftentimes an heirloom  but i charge you in this matter of old mistress prynne give to your predecessors memory the credit which will be rightfully due and i said to the ghost of mr surveyor puei will  on hester prynnes story therefore i bestowed much thought it was the subject of my meditations for many an hour while pacing to and fro across my room or traversing with a hundredfold repetition the long extent from the front door of the customhouse to the side entrance and back again  great were the weariness and annoyance of the old inspector and the weighers and gaugers whose slumbers were disturbed by the unmercifully lengthened tramp of my passing and returning footsteps  remembering their own former habits they used to say that the surveyor was walking the quarterdeck  they probably fancied that my sole objectand indeed the sole object for which a sane man could ever put himself into voluntary motionwas to get an appetite for dinner  and to say the truth an appetite sharpened by the east wind that generally blew along the passage was the only valuable result of so much indefatigable exercise  so little adapted is the atmosphere of a customhouse to the delicate harvest of fancy and sensibility that had i remained there through ten presidencies yet to come i doubt whether the tale of the scarlet letter would ever have been brought before the public eye  my imagination was a tarnished mirror  it would not reflect or only with miserable dimness the figures with which i did my best to people it  the characters of the narrative would not be warmed and rendered malleable by any heat that i could kindle at my intellectual forge  they would take neither the glow of passion nor the tenderness of sentiment but retained all the rigidity of dead corpses and stared me in the face with a fixed and ghastly grin of contemptuous defiance  what have you to do with us that expression seemed to say  the little power you might have once possessed over the tribe of unrealities is gone  you have bartered it for a pittance of the public gold  go then and earn your wages  in short the almost torpid creatures of my own fancy twitted me with imbecility and not without fair occasion  it was not merely during the three hours and a half which uncle sam claimed as his share of my daily life that this wretched numbness held possession of me  it went with me on my seashore walks and rambles into the country wheneverwhich was seldom and reluctantlyi bestirred myself to seek that invigorating charm of nature which used to give me such freshness and activity of thought the moment that i stepped across the threshold of the old manse  the same torpor as regarded the capacity for intellectual effort accompanied me home and weighed upon me in the chamber which i most absurdly termed my study  nor did it quit me when late at night i sat in the deserted parlour lighted only by the glimmering coalfire and the moon striving to picture forth imaginary scenes which the next day might flow out on the brightening page in manyhued description  if the imaginative faculty refused to act at such an hour it might well be deemed a hopeless case  moonlight in a familiar room falling so white upon the carpet and showing all its figures so distinctlymaking every object so minutely visible yet so unlike a morning or noontide visibilityis a medium the most suitable for a romancewriter to get acquainted with his illusive guests  there is the little domestic scenery of the wellknown apartment the chairs with each its separate individuality the centretable sustaining a workbasket a volume or two and an extinguished lamp the sofa the bookcase the picture on the wallall these details so completely seen are so spiritualised by the unusual light that they seem to lose their actual substance and become things of intellect  nothing is too small or too trifling to undergo this change and acquire dignity thereby  a childs shoe the doll seated in her little wicker carriage the hobbyhorsewhatever in a word has been used or played with during the day is now invested with a quality of strangeness and remoteness though still almost as vividly present as by daylight  thus therefore the floor of our familiar room has become a neutral territory somewhere between the real world and fairyland where the actual and the imaginary may meet and each imbue itself with the nature of the other  ghosts might enter here without affrighting us  it would be too much in keeping with the scene to excite surprise were we to look about us and discover a form beloved but gone hence now sitting quietly in a streak of this magic moonshine with an aspect that would make us doubt whether it had returned from afar or had never once stirred from our fireside  the somewhat dim coal fire has an essential influence in producing the effect which i would describe  it throws its unobtrusive tinge throughout the room with a faint ruddiness upon the walls and ceiling and a reflected gleam upon the polish of the furniture  this warmer light mingles itself with the cold spirituality of the moonbeams and communicates as it were a heart and sensibilities of human tenderness to the forms which fancy summons up  it converts them from snowimages into men and women  glancing at the lookingglass we beholddeep within its haunted vergethe smouldering glow of the halfextinguished anthracite the white moonbeams on the floor and a repetition of all the gleam and shadow of the picture with one remove further from the actual and nearer to the imaginative  then at such an hour and with this scene before him if a man sitting all alone cannot dream strange things and make them look like truth he need never try to write romances  but for myself during the whole of my customhouse experience moonlight and sunshine and the glow of firelight were just alike in my regard and neither of them was of one whit more avail than the twinkle of a tallowcandle  an entire class of susceptibilities and a gift connected with themof no great richness or value but the best i hadwas gone from me  it is my belief however that had i attempted a different order of composition my faculties would not have been found so pointless and inefficacious  i might for instance have contented myself with writing out the narratives of a veteran shipmaster one of the inspectors whom i should be most ungrateful not to mention since scarcely a day passed that he did not stir me to laughter and admiration by his marvelous gifts as a storyteller  could i have preserved the picturesque force of his style and the humourous colouring which nature taught him how to throw over his descriptions the result i honestly believe would have been something new in literature or i might readily have found a more serious task  it was a folly with the materiality of this daily life pressing so intrusively upon me to attempt to fling myself back into another age or to insist on creating the semblance of a world out of airy matter when at every moment the impalpable beauty of my soapbubble was broken by the rude contact of some actual circumstance  the wiser effort would have been to diffuse thought and imagination through the opaque substance of today and thus to make it a bright transparency to spiritualise the burden that began to weigh so heavily to seek resolutely the true and indestructible value that lay hidden in the petty and wearisome incidents and ordinary characters with which i was now conversant  the fault was mine  the page of life that was spread out before me seemed dull and commonplace only because i had not fathomed its deeper import  a better book than i shall ever write was there leaf after leaf presenting itself to me just as it was written out by the reality of the flitting hour and vanishing as fast as written only because my brain wanted the insight and my hand the cunning to transcribe it  at some future day it may be i shall remember a few scattered fragments and broken paragraphs and write them down and find the letters turn to gold upon the page  these perceptions had come too late  at the instant i was only conscious that what would have been a pleasure once was now a hopeless toil  there was no occasion to make much moan about this state of affairs  i had ceased to be a writer of tolerably poor tales and essays and had become a tolerably good surveyor of the customs  that was all  but nevertheless it is anything but agreeable to be haunted by a suspicion that ones intellect is dwindling away or exhaling without your consciousness like ether out of a phial so that at every glance you find a smaller and less volatile residuum  of the fact there could be no doubt and examining myself and others i was led to conclusions in reference to the effect of public office on the character not very favourable to the mode of life in question in some other form perhaps i may hereafter develop these effects  suffice it here to say that a customhouse officer of long continuance can hardly be a very praiseworthy or respectable personage for many reasons one of them the tenure by which he holds his situation and another the very nature of his business whichthough i trust an honest oneis of such a sort that he does not share in the united effort of mankind  an effectwhich i believe to be observable more or less in every individual who has occupied the positionis that while he leans on the mighty arm of the republic his own proper strength departs from him  he loses in an extent proportioned to the weakness or force of his original nature the capability of selfsupport  if he possesses an unusual share of native energy or the enervating magic of place do not operate too long upon him his forfeited powers may be redeemable  the ejected officerfortunate in the unkindly shove that sends him forth betimes to struggle amid a struggling worldmay return to himself and become all that he has ever been  but this seldom happens  he usually keeps his ground just long enough for his own ruin and is then thrust out with sinews all unstrung to totter along the difficult footpath of life as he best may conscious of his own infirmitythat his tempered steel and elasticity are losthe for ever afterwards looks wistfully about him in quest of support external to himself  his pervading and continual hopea hallucination which in the face of all discouragement and making light of impossibilities haunts him while he lives and i fancy like the convulsive throes of the cholera torments him for a brief space after deathis that finally and in no long time by some happy coincidence of circumstances he shall be restored to office  this faith more than anything else steals the pith and availability out of whatever enterprise he may dream of undertaking  why should he toil and moil and be at so much trouble to pick himself up out of the mud when in a little while hence the strong arm of his uncle will raise and support him  why should he work for his living here or go to dig gold in california when he is so soon to be made happy at monthly intervals with a little pile of glittering coin out of his uncles pocket  it is sadly curious to observe how slight a taste of office suffices to infect a poor fellow with this singular disease  uncle sams goldmeaning no disrespect to the worthy old gentlemanhas in this respect a quality of enchantment like that of the devils wages  whoever touches it should look well to himself or he may find the bargain to go hard against him involving if not his soul yet many of its better attributes its sturdy force its courage and constancy its truth its selfreliance and all that gives the emphasis to manly character  here was a fine prospect in the distance  not that the surveyor brought the lesson home to himself or admitted that he could be so utterly undone either by continuance in office or ejectment yet my reflections were not the most comfortable  i began to grow melancholy and restless continually prying into my mind to discover which of its poor properties were gone and what degree of detriment had already accrued to the remainder  i endeavoured to calculate how much longer i could stay in the customhouse and yet go forth a man  to confess the truth it was my greatest apprehensionas it would never be a measure of policy to turn out so quiet an individual as myself and it being hardly in the nature of a public officer to resignit was my chief trouble therefore that i was likely to grow grey and decrepit in the surveyorship and become much such another animal as the old inspector  might it not in the tedious lapse of official life that lay before me finally be with me as it was with this venerable friendto make the dinnerhour the nucleus of the day and to spend the rest of it as an old dog spends it asleep in the sunshine or in the shade  a dreary lookforward this for a man who felt it to be the best definition of happiness to live throughout the whole range of his faculties and sensibilities  but all this while i was giving myself very unnecessary alarm  providence had meditated better things for me than i could possibly imagine for myself  a remarkable event of the third year of my surveyorshipto adopt the tone of p p was the election of general taylor to the presidency  it is essential in order to form a complete estimate of the advantages of official life to view the incumbent at the incoming of a hostile administration  his position is then one of the most singularly irksome and in every contingency disagreeable that a wretched mortal can possibly occupy with seldom an alternative of good on either hand although what presents itself to him as the worst event may very probably be the best  but it is a strange experience to a man of pride and sensibility to know that his interests are within the control of individuals who neither love nor understand him and by whom since one or the other must needs happen he would rather be injured than obliged  strange too for one who has kept his calmness throughout the contest to observe the bloodthirstiness that is developed in the hour of triumph and to be conscious that he is himself among its objects  there are few uglier traits of human nature than this tendencywhich i now witnessed in men no worse than their neighboursto grow cruel merely because they possessed the power of inflicting harm  if the guillotine as applied to officeholders were a literal fact instead of one of the most apt of metaphors it is my sincere belief that the active members of the victorious party were sufficiently excited to have chopped off all our heads and have thanked heaven for the opportunity  it appears to mewho have been a calm and curious observer as well in victory as defeatthat this fierce and bitter spirit of malice and revenge has never distinguished the many triumphs of my own party as it now did that of the whigs the democrats take the offices as a general rule because they need them and because the practice of many years has made it the law of political warfare which unless a different system be proclaimed it was weakness and cowardice to murmur at  but the long habit of victory has made them generous  they know how to spare when they see occasion and when they strike the axe may be sharp indeed but its edge is seldom poisoned with illwill nor is it their custom ignominiously to kick the head which they have just struck off  in short unpleasant as was my predicament at best i saw much reason to congratulate myself that i was on the losing side rather than the triumphant one  if heretofore i had been none of the warmest of partisans i began now at this season of peril and adversity to be pretty acutely sensible with which party my predilections lay nor was it without something like regret and shame that according to a reasonable calculation of chances i saw my own prospect of retaining office to be better than those of my democratic brethren  but who can see an inch into futurity beyond his nose  my own head was the first that fell  the moment when a mans head drops off is seldom or never i am inclined to think precisely the most agreeable of his life nevertheless like the greater part of our misfortunes even so serious a contingency brings its remedy and consolation with it if the sufferer will but make the best rather than the worst of the accident which has befallen him  in my particular case the consolatory topics were close at hand and indeed had suggested themselves to my meditations a considerable time before it was requisite to use them  in view of my previous weariness of office and vague thoughts of resignation my fortune somewhat resembled that of a person who should entertain an idea of committing suicide and although beyond his hopes meet with the good hap to be murdered  in the customhouse as before in the old manse i had spent three yearsa term long enough to rest a weary brain long enough to break off old intellectual habits and make room for new ones long enough and too long to have lived in an unnatural state doing what was really of no advantage nor delight to any human being and withholding myself from toil that would at least have stilled an unquiet impulse in me  then moreover as regarded his unceremonious ejectment the late surveyor was not altogether illpleased to be recognised by the whigs as an enemy since his inactivity in political affairshis tendency to roam at will in that broad and quiet field where all mankind may meet rather than confine himself to those narrow paths where brethren of the same household must diverge from one anotherhad sometimes made it questionable with his brother democrats whether he was a friend  now after he had won the crown of martyrdom though with no longer a head to wear it on the point might be looked upon as settled  finally little heroic as he was it seemed more decorous to be overthrown in the downfall of the party with which he had been content to stand than to remain a forlorn survivor when so many worthier men were falling and at last after subsisting for four years on the mercy of a hostile administration to be compelled then to define his position anew and claim the yet more humiliating mercy of a friendly one  meanwhile the press had taken up my affair and kept me for a week or two careering through the public prints in my decapitated state like irvings headless horseman ghastly and grim and longing to be buried as a political dead man ought so much for my figurative self  the real human being all this time with his head safely on his shoulders had brought himself to the comfortable conclusion that everything was for the best and making an investment in ink paper and steel pens had opened his longdisused writing desk and was again a literary man  now it was that the lucubrations of my ancient predecessor mr surveyor pue came into play  rusty through long idleness some little space was requisite before my intellectual machinery could be brought to work upon the tale with an effect in any degree satisfactory  even yet though my thoughts were ultimately much absorbed in the task it wears to my eye a stern and sombre aspect too much ungladdened by genial sunshine too little relieved by the tender and familiar influences which soften almost every scene of nature and real life and undoubtedly should soften every picture of them  this uncaptivating effect is perhaps due to the period of hardly accomplished revolution and still seething turmoil in which the story shaped itself  it is no indication however of a lack of cheerfulness in the writers mind for he was happier while straying through the gloom of these sunless fantasies than at any time since he had quitted the old manse  some of the briefer articles which contribute to make up the volume have likewise been written since my involuntary withdrawal from the toils and honours of public life and the remainder are gleaned from annuals and magazines of such antique date that they have gone round the circle and come back to novelty again  keeping up the metaphor of the political guillotine the whole may be considered as the posthumous papers of a decapitated surveyor and the sketch which i am now bringing to a close if too autobiographical for a modest person to publish in his lifetime will readily be excused in a gentleman who writes from beyond the grave  peace be with all the world  my blessing on my friends  my forgiveness to my enemies  for i am in the realm of quiet  the life of the customhouse lies like a dream behind me  the old inspectorwho bythebye i regret to say was overthrown and killed by a horse some time ago else he would certainly have lived for everhe and all those other venerable personages who sat with him at the receipt of custom are but shadows in my view whiteheaded and wrinkled images which my fancy used to sport with and has now flung aside for ever  the merchantspingree phillips shepard upton kimball bertram huntthese and many other names which had such classic familiarity for my ear six months agothese men of traffic who seemed to occupy so important a position in the worldhow little time has it required to disconnect me from them all not merely in act but recollection  it is with an effort that i recall the figures and appellations of these few  soon likewise my old native town will loom upon me through the haze of memory a mist brooding over and around it as if it were no portion of the real earth but an overgrown village in cloudland with only imaginary inhabitants to people its wooden houses and walk its homely lanes and the unpicturesque prolixity of its main street  henceforth it ceases to be a reality of my life i am a citizen of somewhere else  my good townspeople will not much regret me forthough it has been as dear an object as any in my literary efforts to be of some importance in their eyes and to win myself a pleasant memory in this abode and burialplace of so many of my forefathersthere has never been for me the genial atmosphere which a literary man requires in order to ripen the best harvest of his mind  i shall do better amongst other faces and these familiar ones it need hardly be said will do just as well without me  it may be howeveroh transporting and triumphant thoughtthat the greatgrandchildren of the present race may sometimes think kindly of the scribbler of bygone days when the antiquary of days to come among the sites memorable in the towns history shall point out the locality of the town pump      the scarlet letter   i the prison door  a throng of bearded men in sadcoloured garments and grey steeplecrowned hats intermixed with women some wearing hoods and others bareheaded was assembled in front of a wooden edifice the door of which was heavily timbered with oak and studded with iron spikes  the founders of a new colony whatever utopia of human virtue and happiness they might originally project have invariably recognised it among their earliest practical necessities to allot a portion of the virgin soil as a cemetery and another portion as the site of a prison  in accordance with this rule it may safely be assumed that the forefathers of boston had built the first prisonhouse somewhere in the vicinity of cornhill almost as seasonably as they marked out the first burialground on isaac johnsons lot and round about his grave which subsequently became the nucleus of all the congregated sepulchres in the old churchyard of kings chapel  certain it is that some fifteen or twenty years after the settlement of the town the wooden jail was already marked with weatherstains and other indications of age which gave a yet darker aspect to its beetlebrowed and gloomy front  the rust on the ponderous ironwork of its oaken door looked more antique than anything else in the new world  like all that pertains to crime it seemed never to have known a youthful era  before this ugly edifice and between it and the wheeltrack of the street was a grassplot much overgrown with burdock pigweed applepern and such unsightly vegetation which evidently found something congenial in the soil that had so early borne the black flower of civilised society a prison  but on one side of the portal and rooted almost at the threshold was a wild rosebush covered in this month of june with its delicate gems which might be imagined to offer their fragrance and fragile beauty to the prisoner as he went in and to the condemned criminal as he came forth to his doom in token that the deep heart of nature could pity and be kind to him  this rosebush by a strange chance has been kept alive in history but whether it had merely survived out of the stern old wilderness so long after the fall of the gigantic pines and oaks that originally overshadowed it or whether as there is fair authority for believing it had sprung up under the footsteps of the sainted ann hutchinson as she entered the prisondoor we shall not take upon us to determine  finding it so directly on the threshold of our narrative which is now about to issue from that inauspicious portal we could hardly do otherwise than pluck one of its flowers and present it to the reader  it may serve let us hope to symbolise some sweet moral blossom that may be found along the track or relieve the darkening close of a tale of human frailty and sorrow    ii the marketplace  the grassplot before the jail in prison lane on a certain summer morning not less than two centuries ago was occupied by a pretty large number of the inhabitants of boston all with their eyes intently fastened on the ironclamped oaken door amongst any other population or at a later period in the history of new england the grim rigidity that petrified the bearded physiognomies of these good people would have augured some awful business in hand  it could have betokened nothing short of the anticipated execution of some noted culprit on whom the sentence of a legal tribunal had but confirmed the verdict of public sentiment  but in that early severity of the puritan character an inference of this kind could not so indubitably be drawn  it might be that a sluggish bondservant or an undutiful child whom his parents had given over to the civil authority was to be corrected at the whippingpost  it might be that an antinomian a quaker or other heterodox religionist was to be scourged out of the town or an idle or vagrant indian whom the white mans firewater had made riotous about the streets was to be driven with stripes into the shadow of the forest  it might be too that a witch like old mistress hibbins the bittertempered widow of the magistrate was to die upon the gallows  in either case there was very much the same solemnity of demeanour on the part of the spectators as befitted a people among whom religion and law were almost identical and in whose character both were so thoroughly interfused that the mildest and severest acts of public discipline were alike made venerable and awful  meagre indeed and cold was the sympathy that a transgressor might look for from such bystanders at the scaffold  on the other hand a penalty which in our days would infer a degree of mocking infamy and ridicule might then be invested with almost as stern a dignity as the punishment of death itself  it was a circumstance to be noted on the summer morning when our story begins its course that the women of whom there were several in the crowd appeared to take a peculiar interest in whatever penal infliction might be expected to ensue  the age had not so much refinement that any sense of impropriety restrained the wearers of petticoat and farthingale from stepping forth into the public ways and wedging their not unsubstantial persons if occasion were into the throng nearest to the scaffold at an execution  morally as well as materially there was a coarser fibre in those wives and maidens of old english birth and breeding than in their fair descendants separated from them by a series of six or seven generations for throughout that chain of ancestry every successive mother had transmitted to her child a fainter bloom a more delicate and briefer beauty and a slighter physical frame if not character of less force and solidity than her own  the women who were now standing about the prisondoor stood within less than half a century of the period when the manlike elizabeth had been the not altogether unsuitable representative of the sex they were her countrywomen and the beef and ale of their native land with a moral diet not a whit more refined entered largely into their composition  the bright morning sun therefore shone on broad shoulders and welldeveloped busts and on round and ruddy cheeks that had ripened in the faroff island and had hardly yet grown paler or thinner in the atmosphere of new england  there was moreover a boldness and rotundity of speech among these matrons as most of them seemed to be that would startle us at the present day whether in respect to its purport or its volume of tone  goodwives said a hardfeatured dame of fifty ill tell ye a piece of my mind  it would be greatly for the public behoof if we women being of mature age and churchmembers in good repute should have the handling of such malefactresses as this hester prynne  what think ye gossips  if the hussy stood up for judgment before us five that are now here in a knot together would she come off with such a sentence as the worshipful magistrates have awarded  marry i trow not  people say said another that the reverend master dimmesdale her godly pastor takes it very grievously to heart that such a scandal should have come upon his congregation  the magistrates are godfearing gentlemen but merciful overmuchthat is a truth added a third autumnal matron  at the very least they should have put the brand of a hot iron on hester prynnes forehead  madame hester would have winced at that i warrant me  but shethe naughty baggagelittle will she care what they put upon the bodice of her gown  why look you she may cover it with a brooch or such like heathenish adornment and so walk the streets as brave as ever  ah but interposed more softly a young wife holding a child by the hand let her cover the mark as she will the pang of it will be always in her heart  what do we talk of marks and brands whether on the bodice of her gown or the flesh of her forehead cried another female the ugliest as well as the most pitiless of these selfconstituted judges  this woman has brought shame upon us all and ought to die is there not law for it  truly there is both in the scripture and the statutebook  then let the magistrates who have made it of no effect thank themselves if their own wives and daughters go astray  mercy on us goodwife exclaimed a man in the crowd is there no virtue in woman save what springs from a wholesome fear of the gallows  that is the hardest word yet  hush now gossips for the lock is turning in the prisondoor and here comes mistress prynne herself  the door of the jail being flung open from within there appeared in the first place like a black shadow emerging into sunshine the grim and gristly presence of the townbeadle with a sword by his side and his staff of office in his hand  this personage prefigured and represented in his aspect the whole dismal severity of the puritanic code of law which it was his business to administer in its final and closest application to the offender  stretching forth the official staff in his left hand he laid his right upon the shoulder of a young woman whom he thus drew forward until on the threshold of the prisondoor she repelled him by an action marked with natural dignity and force of character and stepped into the open air as if by her own free will  she bore in her arms a child a baby of some three months old who winked and turned aside its little face from the too vivid light of day because its existence heretofore had brought it acquaintance only with the grey twilight of a dungeon or other darksome apartment of the prison  when the young womanthe mother of this childstood fully revealed before the crowd it seemed to be her first impulse to clasp the infant closely to her bosom not so much by an impulse of motherly affection as that she might thereby conceal a certain token which was wrought or fastened into her dress  in a moment however wisely judging that one token of her shame would but poorly serve to hide another she took the baby on her arm and with a burning blush and yet a haughty smile and a glance that would not be abashed looked around at her townspeople and neighbours  on the breast of her gown in fine red cloth surrounded with an elaborate embroidery and fantastic flourishes of gold thread appeared the letter a it was so artistically done and with so much fertility and gorgeous luxuriance of fancy that it had all the effect of a last and fitting decoration to the apparel which she wore and which was of a splendour in accordance with the taste of the age but greatly beyond what was allowed by the sumptuary regulations of the colony  the young woman was tall with a figure of perfect elegance on a large scale  she had dark and abundant hair so glossy that it threw off the sunshine with a gleam and a face which besides being beautiful from regularity of feature and richness of complexion had the impressiveness belonging to a marked brow and deep black eyes  she was ladylike too after the manner of the feminine gentility of those days characterised by a certain state and dignity rather than by the delicate evanescent and indescribable grace which is now recognised as its indication and never had hester prynne appeared more ladylike in the antique interpretation of the term than as she issued from the prison  those who had before known her and had expected to behold her dimmed and obscured by a disastrous cloud were astonished and even startled to perceive how her beauty shone out and made a halo of the misfortune and ignominy in which she was enveloped  it may be true that to a sensitive observer there was some thing exquisitely painful in it  her attire which indeed she had wrought for the occasion in prison and had modelled much after her own fancy seemed to express the attitude of her spirit the desperate recklessness of her mood by its wild and picturesque peculiarity  but the point which drew all eyes and as it were transfigured the wearerso that both men and women who had been familiarly acquainted with hester prynne were now impressed as if they beheld her for the first timewas that scarlet letter so fantastically embroidered and illuminated upon her bosom  it had the effect of a spell taking her out of the ordinary relations with humanity and enclosing her in a sphere by herself  she hath good skill at her needle thats certain remarked one of her female spectators but did ever a woman before this brazen hussy contrive such a way of showing it  why gossips what is it but to laugh in the faces of our godly magistrates and make a pride out of what they worthy gentlemen meant for a punishment  it were well muttered the most ironvisaged of the old dames if we stripped madame hesters rich gown off her dainty shoulders and as for the red letter which she hath stitched so curiously ill bestow a rag of mine own rheumatic flannel to make a fitter one  oh peace neighbourspeace whispered their youngest companion do not let her hear you  not a stitch in that embroidered letter but she has felt it in her heart  the grim beadle now made a gesture with his staff  make way good peoplemake way in the kings name cried he  open a passage and i promise ye mistress prynne shall be set where man woman and child may have a fair sight of her brave apparel from this time till an hour past meridian  a blessing on the righteous colony of the massachusetts where iniquity is dragged out into the sunshine  come along madame hester and show your scarlet letter in the marketplace  a lane was forthwith opened through the crowd of spectators preceded by the beadle and attended by an irregular procession of sternbrowed men and unkindly visaged women hester prynne set forth towards the place appointed for her punishment  a crowd of eager and curious schoolboys understanding little of the matter in hand except that it gave them a halfholiday ran before her progress turning their heads continually to stare into her face and at the winking baby in her arms and at the ignominious letter on her breast  it was no great distance in those days from the prison door to the marketplace  measured by the prisoners experience however it might be reckoned a journey of some length for haughty as her demeanour was she perchance underwent an agony from every footstep of those that thronged to see her as if her heart had been flung into the street for them all to spurn and trample upon  in our nature however there is a provision alike marvellous and merciful that the sufferer should never know the intensity of what he endures by its present torture but chiefly by the pang that rankles after it  with almost a serene deportment therefore hester prynne passed through this portion of her ordeal and came to a sort of scaffold at the western extremity of the marketplace  it stood nearly beneath the eaves of bostons earliest church and appeared to be a fixture there  in fact this scaffold constituted a portion of a penal machine which now for two or three generations past has been merely historical and traditionary among us but was held in the old time to be as effectual an agent in the promotion of good citizenship as ever was the guillotine among the terrorists of france  it was in short the platform of the pillory and above it rose the framework of that instrument of discipline so fashioned as to confine the human head in its tight grasp and thus hold it up to the public gaze  the very ideal of ignominy was embodied and made manifest in this contrivance of wood and iron  there can be no outrage methinks against our common naturewhatever be the delinquencies of the individualno outrage more flagrant than to forbid the culprit to hide his face for shame as it was the essence of this punishment to do in hester prynnes instance however as not unfrequently in other cases her sentence bore that she should stand a certain time upon the platform but without undergoing that gripe about the neck and confinement of the head the proneness to which was the most devilish characteristic of this ugly engine  knowing well her part she ascended a flight of wooden steps and was thus displayed to the surrounding multitude at about the height of a mans shoulders above the street  had there been a papist among the crowd of puritans he might have seen in this beautiful woman so picturesque in her attire and mien and with the infant at her bosom an object to remind him of the image of divine maternity which so many illustrious painters have vied with one another to represent something which should remind him indeed but only by contrast of that sacred image of sinless motherhood whose infant was to redeem the world  here there was the taint of deepest sin in the most sacred quality of human life working such effect that the world was only the darker for this womans beauty and the more lost for the infant that she had borne  the scene was not without a mixture of awe such as must always invest the spectacle of guilt and shame in a fellowcreature before society shall have grown corrupt enough to smile instead of shuddering at it  the witnesses of hester prynnes disgrace had not yet passed beyond their simplicity  they were stern enough to look upon her death had that been the sentence without a murmur at its severity but had none of the heartlessness of another social state which would find only a theme for jest in an exhibition like the present  even had there been a disposition to turn the matter into ridicule it must have been repressed and overpowered by the solemn presence of men no less dignified than the governor and several of his counsellors a judge a general and the ministers of the town all of whom sat or stood in a balcony of the meetinghouse looking down upon the platform  when such personages could constitute a part of the spectacle without risking the majesty or reverence of rank and office it was safely to be inferred that the infliction of a legal sentence would have an earnest and effectual meaning  accordingly the crowd was sombre and grave  the unhappy culprit sustained herself as best a woman might under the heavy weight of a thousand unrelenting eyes all fastened upon her and concentrated at her bosom  it was almost intolerable to be borne  of an impulsive and passionate nature she had fortified herself to encounter the stings and venomous stabs of public contumely wreaking itself in every variety of insult but there was a quality so much more terrible in the solemn mood of the popular mind that she longed rather to behold all those rigid countenances contorted with scornful merriment and herself the object  had a roar of laughter burst from the multitudeeach man each woman each little shrillvoiced child contributing their individual partshester prynne might have repaid them all with a bitter and disdainful smile  but under the leaden infliction which it was her doom to endure she felt at moments as if she must needs shriek out with the full power of her lungs and cast herself from the scaffold down upon the ground or else go mad at once  yet there were intervals when the whole scene in which she was the most conspicuous object seemed to vanish from her eyes or at least glimmered indistinctly before them like a mass of imperfectly shaped and spectral images  her mind and especially her memory was preternaturally active and kept bringing up other scenes than this roughly hewn street of a little town on the edge of the western wilderness other faces than were lowering upon her from beneath the brims of those steeplecrowned hats  reminiscences the most trifling and immaterial passages of infancy and schooldays sports childish quarrels and the little domestic traits of her maiden years came swarming back upon her intermingled with recollections of whatever was gravest in her subsequent life one picture precisely as vivid as another as if all were of similar importance or all alike a play  possibly it was an instinctive device of her spirit to relieve itself by the exhibition of these phantasmagoric forms from the cruel weight and hardness of the reality  be that as it might the scaffold of the pillory was a point of view that revealed to hester prynne the entire track along which she had been treading since her happy infancy  standing on that miserable eminence she saw again her native village in old england and her paternal home a decayed house of grey stone with a povertystricken aspect but retaining a half obliterated shield of arms over the portal in token of antique gentility she saw her fathers face with its bold brow and reverend white beard that flowed over the oldfashioned elizabethan ruff her mothers too with the look of heedful and anxious love which it always wore in her remembrance and which even since her death had so often laid the impediment of a gentle remonstrance in her daughters pathway  she saw her own face glowing with girlish beauty and illuminating all the interior of the dusky mirror in which she had been wont to gaze at it there she beheld another countenance of a man well stricken in years a pale thin scholarlike visage with eyes dim and bleared by the lamplight that had served them to pore over many ponderous books  yet those same bleared optics had a strange penetrating power when it was their owners purpose to read the human soul  this figure of the study and the cloister as hester prynnes womanly fancy failed not to recall was slightly deformed with the left shoulder a trifle higher than the right next rose before her in memorys picturegallery the intricate and narrow thoroughfares the tall grey houses the huge cathedrals and the public edifices ancient in date and quaint in architecture of a continental city where new life had awaited her still in connexion with the misshapen scholar a new life but feeding itself on timeworn materials like a tuft of green moss on a crumbling wall  lastly in lieu of these shifting scenes came back the rude marketplace of the puritan settlement with all the townspeople assembled and levelling their stern regards at hester prynneyes at herselfwho stood on the scaffold of the pillory an infant on her arm and the letter a in scarlet fantastically embroidered with gold thread upon her bosom  could it be true   she clutched the child so fiercely to her breast that it sent forth a cry she turned her eyes downward at the scarlet letter and even touched it with her finger to assure herself that the infant and the shame were real  yes these were her realitiesall else had vanished    iii  the recognition  from this intense consciousness of being the object of severe and universal observation the wearer of the scarlet letter was at length relieved by discerning on the outskirts of the crowd a figure which irresistibly took possession of her thoughts  an indian in his native garb was standing there but the red men were not so infrequent visitors of the english settlements that one of them would have attracted any notice from hester prynne at such a time much less would he have excluded all other objects and ideas from her mind  by the indians side and evidently sustaining a companionship with him stood a white man clad in a strange disarray of civilized and savage costume  he was small in stature with a furrowed visage which as yet could hardly be termed aged  there was a remarkable intelligence in his features as of a person who had so cultivated his mental part that it could not fail to mould the physical to itself and become manifest by unmistakable tokens  although by a seemingly careless arrangement of his heterogeneous garb he had endeavoured to conceal or abate the peculiarity it was sufficiently evident to hester prynne that one of this mans shoulders rose higher than the other  again at the first instant of perceiving that thin visage and the slight deformity of the figure she pressed her infant to her bosom with so convulsive a force that the poor babe uttered another cry of pain  but the mother did not seem to hear it  at his arrival in the marketplace and some time before she saw him the stranger had bent his eyes on hester prynne  it was carelessly at first like a man chiefly accustomed to look inward and to whom external matters are of little value and import unless they bear relation to something within his mind very soon however his look became keen and penetrative  a writhing horror twisted itself across his features like a snake gliding swiftly over them and making one little pause with all its wreathed intervolutions in open sight  his face darkened with some powerful emotion which nevertheless he so instantaneously controlled by an effort of his will that save at a single moment its expression might have passed for calmness  after a brief space the convulsion grew almost imperceptible and finally subsided into the depths of his nature  when he found the eyes of hester prynne fastened on his own and saw that she appeared to recognize him he slowly and calmly raised his finger made a gesture with it in the air and laid it on his lips  then touching the shoulder of a townsman who stood near to him he addressed him in a formal and courteous manner  i pray you good sir said he who is this womanand wherefore is she here set up to public shame  you must needs be a stranger in this region friend answered the townsman looking curiously at the questioner and his savage companion else you would surely have heard of mistress hester prynne and her evil doings  she hath raised a great scandal i promise you in godly master dimmesdales church  you say truly replied the other i am a stranger and have been a wanderer sorely against my will  i have met with grievous mishaps by sea and land and have been long held in bonds among the heathenfolk to the southward and am now brought hither by this indian to be redeemed out of my captivity  will it please you therefore to tell me of hester prynneshave i her name rightlyof this womans offences and what has brought her to yonder scaffold  truly friend and methinks it must gladden your heart after your troubles and sojourn in the wilderness said the townsman to find yourself at length in a land where iniquity is searched out and punished in the sight of rulers and people as here in our godly new england  yonder woman sir you must know was the wife of a certain learned man english by birth but who had long ago dwelt in amsterdam whence some good time agone he was minded to cross over and cast in his lot with us of the massachusetts  to this purpose he sent his wife before him remaining himself to look after some necessary affairs  marry good sir in some two years or less that the woman has been a dweller here in boston no tidings have come of this learned gentleman master prynne and his young wife look you being left to her own misguidance  ahahai conceive you said the stranger with a bitter smile  so learned a man as you speak of should have learned this too in his books  and who by your favour sir may be the father of yonder babeit is some three or four months old i should judgewhich mistress prynne is holding in her arms  of a truth friend that matter remaineth a riddle and the daniel who shall expound it is yet awanting answered the townsman  madame hester absolutely refuseth to speak and the magistrates have laid their heads together in vain  peradventure the guilty one stands looking on at this sad spectacle unknown of man and forgetting that god sees him  the learned man observed the stranger with another smile should come himself to look into the mystery  it behoves him well if he be still in life responded the townsman  now good sir our massachusetts magistracy bethinking themselves that this woman is youthful and fair and doubtless was strongly tempted to her fall and that moreover as is most likely her husband may be at the bottom of the sea they have not been bold to put in force the extremity of our righteous law against her  the penalty thereof is death  but in their great mercy and tenderness of heart they have doomed mistress prynne to stand only a space of three hours on the platform of the pillory and then and thereafter for the remainder of her natural life to wear a mark of shame upon her bosom  a wise sentence remarked the stranger gravely bowing his head  thus she will be a living sermon against sin until the ignominious letter be engraved upon her tombstone  it irks me nevertheless that the partner of her iniquity should not at least stand on the scaffold by her side  but he will be knownhe will be knownhe will be known  he bowed courteously to the communicative townsman and whispering a few words to his indian attendant they both made their way through the crowd  while this passed hester prynne had been standing on her pedestal still with a fixed gaze towards the strangerso fixed a gaze that at moments of intense absorption all other objects in the visible world seemed to vanish leaving only him and her such an interview perhaps would have been more terrible than even to meet him as she now did with the hot midday sun burning down upon her face and lighting up its shame with the scarlet token of infamy on her breast with the sinborn infant in her arms with a whole people drawn forth as to a festival staring at the features that should have been seen only in the quiet gleam of the fireside in the happy shadow of a home or beneath a matronly veil at church  dreadful as it was she was conscious of a shelter in the presence of these thousand witnesses  it was better to stand thus with so many betwixt him and her than to greet him face to facethey two alone  she fled for refuge as it were to the public exposure and dreaded the moment when its protection should be withdrawn from her involved in these thoughts she scarcely heard a voice behind her until it had repeated her name more than once in a loud and solemn tone audible to the whole multitude  hearken unto me hester prynne said the voice  it has already been noticed that directly over the platform on which hester prynne stood was a kind of balcony or open gallery appended to the meetinghouse  it was the place whence proclamations were wont to be made amidst an assemblage of the magistracy with all the ceremonial that attended such public observances in those days  here to witness the scene which we are describing sat governor bellingham himself with four sergeants about his chair bearing halberds as a guard of honour  he wore a dark feather in his hat a border of embroidery on his cloak and a black velvet tunic beneatha gentleman advanced in years with a hard experience written in his wrinkles  he was not illfitted to be the head and representative of a community which owed its origin and progress and its present state of development not to the impulses of youth but to the stern and tempered energies of manhood and the sombre sagacity of age accomplishing so much precisely because it imagined and hoped so little  the other eminent characters by whom the chief ruler was surrounded were distinguished by a dignity of mien belonging to a period when the forms of authority were felt to possess the sacredness of divine institutions  they were doubtless good men just and sage  but out of the whole human family it would not have been easy to select the same number of wise and virtuous persons who should be less capable of sitting in judgment on an erring womans heart and disentangling its mesh of good and evil than the sages of rigid aspect towards whom hester prynne now turned her face  she seemed conscious indeed that whatever sympathy she might expect lay in the larger and warmer heart of the multitude for as she lifted her eyes towards the balcony the unhappy woman grew pale and trembled  the voice which had called her attention was that of the reverend and famous john wilson the eldest clergyman of boston a great scholar like most of his contemporaries in the profession and withal a man of kind and genial spirit  this last attribute however had been less carefully developed than his intellectual gifts and was in truth rather a matter of shame than selfcongratulation with him  there he stood with a border of grizzled locks beneath his skullcap while his grey eyes accustomed to the shaded light of his study were winking like those of hesters infant in the unadulterated sunshine  he looked like the darkly engraved portraits which we see prefixed to old volumes of sermons and had no more right than one of those portraits would have to step forth as he now did and meddle with a question of human guilt passion and anguish  hester prynne said the clergyman i have striven with my young brother here under whose preaching of the word you have been privileged to sithere mr wilson laid his hand on the shoulder of a pale young man beside himi have sought i say to persuade this godly youth that he should deal with you here in the face of heaven and before these wise and upright rulers and in hearing of all the people as touching the vileness and blackness of your sin  knowing your natural temper better than i he could the better judge what arguments to use whether of tenderness or terror such as might prevail over your hardness and obstinacy insomuch that you should no longer hide the name of him who tempted you to this grievous fall  but he opposes to mewith a young mans oversoftness albeit wise beyond his yearsthat it were wronging the very nature of woman to force her to lay open her hearts secrets in such broad daylight and in presence of so great a multitude  truly as i sought to convince him the shame lay in the commission of the sin and not in the showing of it forth  what say you to it once again brother dimmesdale  must it be thou or i that shall deal with this poor sinners soul  there was a murmur among the dignified and reverend occupants of the balcony and governor bellingham gave expression to its purport speaking in an authoritative voice although tempered with respect towards the youthful clergyman whom he addressed  good master dimmesdale said he the responsibility of this womans soul lies greatly with you  it behoves you therefore to exhort her to repentance and to confession as a proof and consequence thereof  the directness of this appeal drew the eyes of the whole crowd upon the reverend mr dimmesdaleyoung clergyman who had come from one of the great english universities bringing all the learning of the age into our wild forest land  his eloquence and religious fervour had already given the earnest of high eminence in his profession  he was a person of very striking aspect with a white lofty and impending brow large brown melancholy eyes and a mouth which unless when he forcibly compressed it was apt to be tremulous expressing both nervous sensibility and a vast power of self restraint  notwithstanding his high native gifts and scholarlike attainments there was an air about this young ministeran apprehensive a startled a halffrightened lookas of a being who felt himself quite astray and at a loss in the pathway of human existence and could only be at ease in some seclusion of his own  therefore so far as his duties would permit he trod in the shadowy bypaths and thus kept himself simple and childlike coming forth when occasion was with a freshness and fragrance and dewy purity of thought which as many people said affected them like the speech of an angel  such was the young man whom the reverend mr wilson and the governor had introduced so openly to the public notice bidding him speak in the hearing of all men to that mystery of a womans soul so sacred even in its pollution  the trying nature of his position drove the blood from his cheek and made his lips tremulous  speak to the woman my brother said mr wilson  it is of moment to her soul and therefore as the worshipful governor says momentous to thine own in whose charge hers is  exhort her to confess the truth  the reverend mr dimmesdale bent his head in silent prayer as it seemed and then came forward  hester prynne said he leaning over the balcony and looking down steadfastly into her eyes thou hearest what this good man says and seest the accountability under which i labour  if thou feelest it to be for thy souls peace and that thy earthly punishment will thereby be made more effectual to salvation i charge thee to speak out the name of thy fellowsinner and fellowsufferer  be not silent from any mistaken pity and tenderness for him for believe me hester though he were to step down from a high place and stand there beside thee on thy pedestal of shame yet better were it so than to hide a guilty heart through life  what can thy silence do for him except it tempt himyea compel him as it wereto add hypocrisy to sin heaven hath granted thee an open ignominy that thereby thou mayest work out an open triumph over the evil within thee and the sorrow without  take heed how thou deniest to himwho perchance hath not the courage to grasp it for himselfthe bitter but wholesome cup that is now presented to thy lips  the young pastors voice was tremulously sweet rich deep and broken  the feeling that it so evidently manifested rather than the direct purport of the words caused it to vibrate within all hearts and brought the listeners into one accord of sympathy even the poor baby at hesters bosom was affected by the same influence for it directed its hitherto vacant gaze towards mr dimmesdale and held up its little arms with a halfpleased halfplaintive murmur  so powerful seemed the ministers appeal that the people could not believe but that hester prynne would speak out the guilty name or else that the guilty one himself in whatever high or lowly place he stood would be drawn forth by an inward and inevitable necessity and compelled to ascend the scaffold  hester shook her head  woman transgress not beyond the limits of heavens mercy cried the reverend mr wilson more harshly than before  that little babe hath been gifted with a voice to second and confirm the counsel which thou hast heard  speak out the name  that and thy repentance may avail to take the scarlet letter off thy breast  never replied hester prynne looking not at mr wilson but into the deep and troubled eyes of the younger clergyman  it is too deeply branded  ye cannot take it off  and would that i might endure his agony as well as mine  speak woman said another voice coldly and sternly proceeding from the crowd about the scaffold speak and give your child a father  i will not speak answered hester turning pale as death but responding to this voice which she too surely recognised  and my child must seek a heavenly father she shall never know an earthly one  she will not speak murmured mr dimmesdale who leaning over the balcony with his hand upon his heart had awaited the result of his appeal  he now drew back with a long respiration wondrous strength and generosity of a womans heart  she will not speak  discerning the impracticable state of the poor culprits mind the elder clergyman who had carefully prepared himself for the occasion addressed to the multitude a discourse on sin in all its branches but with continual reference to the ignominious letter  so forcibly did he dwell upon this symbol for the hour or more during which his periods were rolling over the peoples heads that it assumed new terrors in their imagination and seemed to derive its scarlet hue from the flames of the infernal pit  hester prynne meanwhile kept her place upon the pedestal of shame with glazed eyes and an air of weary indifference she had borne that morning all that nature could endure and as her temperament was not of the order that escapes from too intense suffering by a swoon her spirit could only shelter itself beneath a stony crust of insensibility while the faculties of animal life remained entire  in this state the voice of the preacher thundered remorselessly but unavailingly upon her ears  the infant during the latter portion of her ordeal pierced the air with its wailings and screams she strove to hush it mechanically but seemed scarcely to sympathise with its trouble  with the same hard demeanour she was led back to prison and vanished from the public gaze within its ironclamped portal  it was whispered by those who peered after her that the scarlet letter threw a lurid gleam along the dark passageway of the interior    iv   the interview  after her return to the prison hester prynne was found to be in a state of nervous excitement that demanded constant watchfulness lest she should perpetrate violence on herself or do some halffrenzied mischief to the poor babe  as night approached it proving impossible to quell her insubordination by rebuke or threats of punishment master brackett the jailer thought fit to introduce a physician  he described him as a man of skill in all christian modes of physical science and likewise familiar with whatever the savage people could teach in respect to medicinal herbs and roots that grew in the forest  to say the truth there was much need of professional assistance not merely for hester herself but still more urgently for the childwho drawing its sustenance from the maternal bosom seemed to have drank in with it all the turmoil the anguish and despair which pervaded the mothers system  it now writhed in convulsions of pain and was a forcible type in its little frame of the moral agony which hester prynne had borne throughout the day  closely following the jailer into the dismal apartment appeared that individual of singular aspect whose presence in the crowd had been of such deep interest to the wearer of the scarlet letter  he was lodged in the prison not as suspected of any offence but as the most convenient and suitable mode of disposing of him until the magistrates should have conferred with the indian sagamores respecting his ransom  his name was announced as roger chillingworth  the jailer after ushering him into the room remained a moment marvelling at the comparative quiet that followed his entrance for hester prynne had immediately become as still as death although the child continued to moan  prithee friend leave me alone with my patient said the practitioner  trust me good jailer you shall briefly have peace in your house and i promise you mistress prynne shall hereafter be more amenable to just authority than you may have found her heretofore  nay if your worship can accomplish that answered master brackett i shall own you for a man of skill indeed  verily the woman hath been like a possessed one and there lacks little that i should take in hand to drive satan out of her with stripes  the stranger had entered the room with the characteristic quietude of the profession to which he announced himself as belonging  nor did his demeanour change when the withdrawal of the prison keeper left him face to face with the woman whose absorbed notice of him in the crowd had intimated so close a relation between himself and her  his first care was given to the child whose cries indeed as she lay writhing on the trundlebed made it of peremptory necessity to postpone all other business to the task of soothing her  he examined the infant carefully and then proceeded to unclasp a leathern case which he took from beneath his dress  it appeared to contain medical preparations one of which he mingled with a cup of water  my old studies in alchemy observed he and my sojourn for above a year past among a people well versed in the kindly properties of simples have made a better physician of me than many that claim the medical degree  here woman  the child is yoursshe is none of mineneither will she recognise my voice or aspect as a fathers  administer this draught therefore with thine own hand  hester repelled the offered medicine at the same time gazing with strongly marked apprehension into his face  wouldst thou avenge thyself on the innocent babe whispered she  foolish woman responded the physician half coldly half soothingly  what should ail me to harm this misbegotten and miserable babe  the medicine is potent for good and were it my childyea mine own as well as thine  i could do no better for it  as she still hesitated being in fact in no reasonable state of mind he took the infant in his arms and himself administered the draught  it soon proved its efficacy and redeemed the leechs pledge  the moans of the little patient subsided its convulsive tossings gradually ceased and in a few moments as is the custom of young children after relief from pain it sank into a profound and dewy slumber  the physician as he had a fair right to be termed next bestowed his attention on the mother  with calm and intent scrutiny he felt her pulse looked into her eyesa gaze that made her heart shrink and shudder because so familiar and yet so strange and coldand finally satisfied with his investigation proceeded to mingle another draught  i know not lethe nor nepenthe remarked he but i have learned many new secrets in the wilderness and here is one of thema recipe that an indian taught me in requital of some lessons of my own that were as old as paracelsus  drink it  it may be less soothing than a sinless conscience  that i cannot give thee  but it will calm the swell and heaving of thy passion like oil thrown on the waves of a tempestuous sea  he presented the cup to hester who received it with a slow earnest look into his face not precisely a look of fear yet full of doubt and questioning as to what his purposes might be she looked also at her slumbering child  i have thought of death said shehave wished for itwould even have prayed for it were it fit that such as i should pray for anything  yet if death be in this cup i bid thee think again ere thou beholdest me quaff it  see it is even now at my lips  drink then replied he still with the same cold composure dost thou know me so little hester prynne  are my purposes wont to be so shallow  even if i imagine a scheme of vengeance what could i do better for my object than to let thee livethan to give thee medicines against all harm and peril of lifeso that this burning shame may still blaze upon thy bosom as he spoke he laid his long forefinger on the scarlet letter which forthwith seemed to scorch into hesters breast as if it had been red hot  he noticed her involuntary gesture and smiled live therefore and bear about thy doom with thee in the eyes of men and womenin the eyes of him whom thou didst call thy husbandin the eyes of yonder child  and that thou mayest live take off this draught  without further expostulation or delay hester prynne drained the cup and at the motion of the man of skill seated herself on the bed where the child was sleeping while he drew the only chair which the room afforded and took his own seat beside her she could not but tremble at these preparations for she felt thathaving now done all that humanity or principle or if so it were a refined cruelty impelled him to do for the relief of physical sufferinghe was next to treat with her as the man whom she had most deeply and irreparably injured  hester said he i ask not wherefore nor how thou hast fallen into the pit or say rather thou hast ascended to the pedestal of infamy on which i found thee  the reason is not far to seek  it was my folly and thy weakness  ia man of thoughtthe bookworm of great librariesa man already in decay having given my best years to feed the hungry dream of knowledgewhat had i to do with youth and beauty like thine own  misshapen from my birthhour how could i delude myself with the idea that intellectual gifts might veil physical deformity in a young girls fantasy  men call me wise  if sages were ever wise in their own behoof i might have foreseen all this  i might have known that as i came out of the vast and dismal forest and entered this settlement of christian men the very first object to meet my eyes would be thyself hester prynne standing up a statue of ignominy before the people nay from the moment when we came down the old churchsteps together a married pair i might have beheld the balefire of that scarlet letter blazing at the end of our path  thou knowest said hesterfor depressed as she was she could not endure this last quiet stab at the token of her shamethou knowest that i was frank with thee  i felt no love nor feigned any  true replied he  it was my folly  i have said it  but up to that epoch of my life i had lived in vain  the world had been so cheerless  my heart was a habitation large enough for many guests but lonely and chill and without a household fire i longed to kindle one  it seemed not so wild a dreamold as i was and sombre as i was and misshapen as i wasthat the simple bliss which is scattered far and wide for all mankind to gather up might yet be mine  and so hester i drew thee into my heart into its innermost chamber and sought to warm thee by the warmth which thy presence made there  i have greatly wronged thee murmured hester  we have wronged each other answered he  mine was the first wrong when i betrayed thy budding youth into a false and unnatural relation with my decay  therefore as a man who has not thought and philosophised in vain i seek no vengeance plot no evil against thee  between thee and me the scale hangs fairly balanced  but hester the man lives who has wronged us both  who is he  ask me not replied hester prynne looking firmly into his face  that thou shalt never know  never sayest thou rejoined he with a smile of dark and selfrelying intelligence  never know him  believe me hester there are few things whether in the outward world or to a certain depth in the invisible sphere of thoughtfew things hidden from the man who devotes himself earnestly and unreservedly to the solution of a mystery  thou mayest cover up thy secret from the prying multitude  thou mayest conceal it too from the ministers and magistrates even as thou didst this day when they sought to wrench the name out of thy heart and give thee a partner on thy pedestal  but as for me i come to the inquest with other senses than they possess  i shall seek this man as i have sought truth in books as i have sought gold in alchemy  there is a sympathy that will make me conscious of him  i shall see him tremble  i shall feel myself shudder suddenly and unawares  sooner or later he must needs be mine  the eyes of the wrinkled scholar glowed so intensely upon her that hester prynne clasped her hand over her heart dreading lest he should read the secret there at once  thou wilt not reveal his name   not the less he is mine resumed he with a look of confidence as if destiny were at one with him  he bears no letter of infamy wrought into his garment as thou dost but i shall read it on his heart  yet fear not for him  think not that i shall interfere with heavens own method of retribution or to my own loss betray him to the gripe of human law  neither do thou imagine that i shall contrive aught against his life no nor against his fame if as i judge he be a man of fair repute  let him live  let him hide himself in outward honour if he may  not the less he shall be mine  thy acts are like mercy said hester bewildered and appalled but thy words interpret thee as a terror  one thing thou that wast my wife i would enjoin upon thee continued the scholar  thou hast kept the secret of thy paramour  keep likewise mine  there are none in this land that know me  breathe not to any human soul that thou didst ever call me husband  here on this wild outskirt of the earth i shall pitch my tent for elsewhere a wanderer and isolated from human interests i find here a woman a man a child amongst whom and myself there exist the closest ligaments  no matter whether of love or hate no matter whether of right or wrong thou and thine hester prynne belong to me  my home is where thou art and where he is  but betray me not  wherefore dost thou desire it inquired hester shrinking she hardly knew why from this secret bond  why not announce thyself openly and cast me off at once  it may be he replied because i will not encounter the dishonour that besmirches the husband of a faithless woman  it may be for other reasons  enough it is my purpose to live and die unknown  let therefore thy husband be to the world as one already dead and of whom no tidings shall ever come  recognise me not by word by sign by look  breathe not the secret above all to the man thou wottest of  shouldst thou fail me in this beware  his fame his position his life will be in my hands beware  i will keep thy secret as i have his said hester  swear it rejoined he  and she took the oath  and now mistress prynne said old roger chillingworth as he was hereafter to be named i leave thee alone alone with thy infant and the scarlet letter  how is it hester  doth thy sentence bind thee to wear the token in thy sleep  art thou not afraid of nightmares and hideous dreams  why dost thou smile so at me inquired hester troubled at the expression of his eyes  art thou like the black man that haunts the forest round about us  hast thou enticed me into a bond that will prove the ruin of my soul  not thy soul he answered with another smile  no not thine    v  hester at her needle  hester prynnes term of confinement was now at an end  her prisondoor was thrown open and she came forth into the sunshine which falling on all alike seemed to her sick and morbid heart as if meant for no other purpose than to reveal the scarlet letter on her breast  perhaps there was a more real torture in her first unattended footsteps from the threshold of the prison than even in the procession and spectacle that have been described where she was made the common infamy at which all mankind was summoned to point its finger  then she was supported by an unnatural tension of the nerves and by all the combative energy of her character which enabled her to convert the scene into a kind of lurid triumph  it was moreover a separate and insulated event to occur but once in her lifetime and to meet which therefore reckless of economy she might call up the vital strength that would have sufficed for many quiet years  the very law that condemned hera giant of stern features but with vigour to support as well as to annihilate in his iron armhad held her up through the terrible ordeal of her ignominy  but now with this unattended walk from her prison door began the daily custom and she must either sustain and carry it forward by the ordinary resources of her nature or sink beneath it  she could no longer borrow from the future to help her through the present grief  tomorrow would bring its own trial with it so would the next day and so would the next each its own trial and yet the very same that was now so unutterably grievous to be borne  the days of the faroff future would toil onward still with the same burden for her to take up and bear along with her but never to fling down for the accumulating days and added years would pile up their misery upon the heap of shame  throughout them all giving up her individuality she would become the general symbol at which the preacher and moralist might point and in which they might vivify and embody their images of womans frailty and sinful passion  thus the young and pure would be taught to look at her with the scarlet letter flaming on her breastat her the child of honourable parentsat her the mother of a babe that would hereafter be a womanat her who had once been innocentas the figure the body the reality of sin  and over her grave the infamy that she must carry thither would be her only monument  it may seem marvellous that with the world before herkept by no restrictive clause of her condemnation within the limits of the puritan settlement so remote and so obscurefree to return to her birthplace or to any other european land and there hide her character and identity under a new exterior as completely as if emerging into another state of beingand having also the passes of the dark inscrutable forest open to her where the wildness of her nature might assimilate itself with a people whose customs and life were alien from the law that had condemned herit may seem marvellous that this woman should still call that place her home where and where only she must needs be the type of shame  but there is a fatality a feeling so irresistible and inevitable that it has the force of doom which almost invariably compels human beings to linger around and haunt ghostlike the spot where some great and marked event has given the colour to their lifetime and still the more irresistibly the darker the tinge that saddens it  her sin her ignominy were the roots which she had struck into the soil  it was as if a new birth with stronger assimilations than the first had converted the forestland still so uncongenial to every other pilgrim and wanderer into hester prynnes wild and dreary but lifelong home  all other scenes of eartheven that village of rural england where happy infancy and stainless maidenhood seemed yet to be in her mothers keeping like garments put off long agowere foreign to her in comparison the chain that bound her here was of iron links and galling to her inmost soul but could never be broken  it might be toodoubtless it was so although she hid the secret from herself and grew pale whenever it struggled out of her heart like a serpent from its holeit might be that another feeling kept her within the scene and pathway that had been so fatal  there dwelt there trode the feet of one with whom she deemed herself connected in a union that unrecognised on earth would bring them together before the bar of final judgment and make that their marriagealtar for a joint futurity of endless retribution  over and over again the tempter of souls had thrust this idea upon hesters contemplation and laughed at the passionate and desperate joy with which she seized and then strove to cast it from her  she barely looked the idea in the face and hastened to bar it in its dungeon  what she compelled herself to believewhat finally she reasoned upon as her motive for continuing a resident of new englandwas half a truth and half a selfdelusion  here she said to herself had been the scene of her guilt and here should be the scene of her earthly punishment and so perchance the torture of her daily shame would at length purge her soul and work out another purity than that which she had lost more saintlike because the result of martyrdom  hester prynne therefore did not flee  on the outskirts of the town within the verge of the peninsula but not in close vicinity to any other habitation there was a small thatched cottage  it had been built by an earlier settler and abandoned because the soil about it was too sterile for cultivation while its comparative remoteness put it out of the sphere of that social activity which already marked the habits of the emigrants  it stood on the shore looking across a basin of the sea at the forestcovered hills towards the west  a clump of scrubby trees such as alone grew on the peninsula did not so much conceal the cottage from view as seem to denote that here was some object which would fain have been or at least ought to be concealed  in this little lonesome dwelling with some slender means that she possessed and by the licence of the magistrates who still kept an inquisitorial watch over her hester established herself with her infant child  a mystic shadow of suspicion immediately attached itself to the spot children too young to comprehend wherefore this woman should be shut out from the sphere of human charities would creep nigh enough to behold her plying her needle at the cottagewindow or standing in the doorway or labouring in her little garden or coming forth along the pathway that led townward and discerning the scarlet letter on her breast would scamper off with a strange contagious fear  lonely as was hesters situation and without a friend on earth who dared to show himself she however incurred no risk of want  she possessed an art that sufficed even in a land that afforded comparatively little scope for its exercise to supply food for her thriving infant and herself  it was the art then as now almost the only one within a womans graspof needlework  she bore on her breast in the curiously embroidered letter a specimen of her delicate and imaginative skill of which the dames of a court might gladly have availed themselves to add the richer and more spiritual adornment of human ingenuity to their fabrics of silk and gold  here indeed in the sable simplicity that generally characterised the puritanic modes of dress there might be an infrequent call for the finer productions of her handiwork  yet the taste of the age demanding whatever was elaborate in compositions of this kind did not fail to extend its influence over our stern progenitors who had cast behind them so many fashions which it might seem harder to dispense with  public ceremonies such as ordinations the installation of magistrates and all that could give majesty to the forms in which a new government manifested itself to the people were as a matter of policy marked by a stately and wellconducted ceremonial and a sombre but yet a studied magnificence  deep ruffs painfully wrought bands and gorgeously embroidered gloves were all deemed necessary to the official state of men assuming the reins of power and were readily allowed to individuals dignified by rank or wealth even while sumptuary laws forbade these and similar extravagances to the plebeian order  in the array of funerals toowhether for the apparel of the dead body or to typify by manifold emblematic devices of sable cloth and snowy lawn the sorrow of the survivorsthere was a frequent and characteristic demand for such labour as hester prynne could supply  babylinenfor babies then wore robes of stateafforded still another possibility of toil and emolument  by degrees not very slowly her handiwork became what would now be termed the fashion  whether from commiseration for a woman of so miserable a destiny or from the morbid curiosity that gives a fictitious value even to common or worthless things or by whatever other intangible circumstance was then as now sufficient to bestow on some persons what others might seek in vain or because hester really filled a gap which must otherwise have remained vacant it is certain that she had ready and fairly requited employment for as many hours as she saw fit to occupy with her needle  vanity it may be chose to mortify itself by putting on for ceremonials of pomp and state the garments that had been wrought by her sinful hands  her needlework was seen on the ruff of the governor military men wore it on their scarfs and the minister on his band it decked the babys little cap it was shut up to be mildewed and moulder away in the coffins of the dead  but it is not recorded that in a single instance her skill was called in to embroider the white veil which was to cover the pure blushes of a bride the exception indicated the ever relentless vigour with which society frowned upon her sin  hester sought not to acquire anything beyond a subsistence of the plainest and most ascetic description for herself and a simple abundance for her child  her own dress was of the coarsest materials and the most sombre hue with only that one ornamentthe scarlet letterwhich it was her doom to wear  the childs attire on the other hand was distinguished by a fanciful or we may rather say a fantastic ingenuity which served indeed to heighten the airy charm that early began to develop itself in the little girl but which appeared to have also a deeper meaning  we may speak further of it hereafter except for that small expenditure in the decoration of her infant hester bestowed all her superfluous means in charity on wretches less miserable than herself and who not unfrequently insulted the hand that fed them  much of the time which she might readily have applied to the better efforts of her art she employed in making coarse garments for the poor  it is probable that there was an idea of penance in this mode of occupation and that she offered up a real sacrifice of enjoyment in devoting so many hours to such rude handiwork  she had in her nature a rich voluptuous oriental characteristica taste for the gorgeously beautiful which save in the exquisite productions of her needle found nothing else in all the possibilities of her life to exercise itself upon  women derive a pleasure incomprehensible to the other sex from the delicate toil of the needle  to hester prynne it might have been a mode of expressing and therefore soothing the passion of her life like all other joys she rejected it as sin  this morbid meddling of conscience with an immaterial matter betokened it is to be feared no genuine and steadfast penitence but something doubtful something that might be deeply wrong beneath  in this manner hester prynne came to have a part to perform in the world  with her native energy of character and rare capacity it could not entirely cast her off although it had set a mark upon her more intolerable to a womans heart than that which branded the brow of cain  in all her intercourse with society however there was nothing that made her feel as if she belonged to it  every gesture every word and even the silence of those with whom she came in contact implied and often expressed that she was banished and as much alone as if she inhabited another sphere or communicated with the common nature by other organs and senses than the rest of human kind  she stood apart from mortal interests yet close beside them like a ghost that revisits the familiar fireside and can no longer make itself seen or felt no more smile with the household joy nor mourn with the kindred sorrow or should it succeed in manifesting its forbidden sympathy awakening only terror and horrible repugnance  these emotions in fact and its bitterest scorn besides seemed to be the sole portion that she retained in the universal heart  it was not an age of delicacy and her position although she understood it well and was in little danger of forgetting it was often brought before her vivid selfperception like a new anguish by the rudest touch upon the tenderest spot  the poor as we have already said whom she sought out to be the objects of her bounty often reviled the hand that was stretched forth to succour them  dames of elevated rank likewise whose doors she entered in the way of her occupation were accustomed to distil drops of bitterness into her heart sometimes through that alchemy of quiet malice by which women can concoct a subtle poison from ordinary trifles and sometimes also by a coarser expression that fell upon the sufferers defenceless breast like a rough blow upon an ulcerated wound  hester had schooled herself long and well and she never responded to these attacks save by a flush of crimson that rose irrepressibly over her pale cheek and again subsided into the depths of her bosom  she was patienta martyr indeed but she forebore to pray for enemies lest in spite of her forgiving aspirations the words of the blessing should stubbornly twist themselves into a curse  continually and in a thousand other ways did she feel the innumerable throbs of anguish that had been so cunningly contrived for her by the undying the everactive sentence of the puritan tribunal  clergymen paused in the streets to address words of exhortation that brought a crowd with its mingled grin and frown around the poor sinful woman  if she entered a church trusting to share the sabbath smile of the universal father it was often her mishap to find herself the text of the discourse  she grew to have a dread of children for they had imbibed from their parents a vague idea of something horrible in this dreary woman gliding silently through the town with never any companion but one only child  therefore first allowing her to pass they pursued her at a distance with shrill cries and the utterances of a word that had no distinct purport to their own minds but was none the less terrible to her as proceeding from lips that babbled it unconsciously  it seemed to argue so wide a diffusion of her shame that all nature knew of it it could have caused her no deeper pang had the leaves of the trees whispered the dark story among themselveshad the summer breeze murmured about ithad the wintry blast shrieked it aloud  another peculiar torture was felt in the gaze of a new eye  when strangers looked curiously at the scarlet letter and none ever failed to do sothey branded it afresh in hesters soul so that oftentimes she could scarcely refrain yet always did refrain from covering the symbol with her hand  but then again an accustomed eye had likewise its own anguish to inflict  its cool stare of familiarity was intolerable  from first to last in short hester prynne had always this dreadful agony in feeling a human eye upon the token the spot never grew callous it seemed on the contrary to grow more sensitive with daily torture  but sometimes once in many days or perchance in many months she felt an eyea human eyeupon the ignominious brand that seemed to give a momentary relief as if half of her agony were shared  the next instant back it all rushed again with still a deeper throb of pain for in that brief interval she had sinned anew  had hester sinned alone  her imagination was somewhat affected and had she been of a softer moral and intellectual fibre would have been still more so by the strange and solitary anguish of her life  walking to and fro with those lonely footsteps in the little world with which she was outwardly connected it now and then appeared to hesterif altogether fancy it was nevertheless too potent to be resistedshe felt or fancied then that the scarlet letter had endowed her with a new sense  she shuddered to believe yet could not help believing that it gave her a sympathetic knowledge of the hidden sin in other hearts  she was terrorstricken by the revelations that were thus made  what were they could they be other than the insidious whispers of the bad angel who would fain have persuaded the struggling woman as yet only half his victim that the outward guise of purity was but a lie and that if truth were everywhere to be shown a scarlet letter would blaze forth on many a bosom besides hester prynnes  or must she receive those intimationsso obscure yet so distinctas truth  in all her miserable experience there was nothing else so awful and so loathsome as this sense it perplexed as well as shocked her by the irreverent inopportuneness of the occasions that brought it into vivid action  sometimes the red infamy upon her breast would give a sympathetic throb as she passed near a venerable minister or magistrate the model of piety and justice to whom that age of antique reverence looked up as to a mortal man in fellowship with angels  what evil thing is at hand would hester say to herself  lifting her reluctant eyes there would be nothing human within the scope of view save the form of this earthly saint  again a mystic sisterhood would contumaciously assert itself as she met the sanctified frown of some matron who according to the rumour of all tongues had kept cold snow within her bosom throughout life  that unsunned snow in the matrons bosom and the burning shame on hester prynneswhat had the two in common  or once more the electric thrill would give her warningbehold hester here is a companion and looking up she would detect the eyes of a young maiden glancing at the scarlet letter shyly and aside and quickly averted with a faint chill crimson in her cheeks as if her purity were somewhat sullied by that momentary glance  o fiend whose talisman was that fatal symbol wouldst thou leave nothing whether in youth or age for this poor sinner to reveresuch loss of faith is ever one of the saddest results of sin  be it accepted as a proof that all was not corrupt in this poor victim of her own frailty and mans hard law that hester prynne yet struggled to believe that no fellowmortal was guilty like herself  the vulgar who in those dreary old times were always contributing a grotesque horror to what interested their imaginations had a story about the scarlet letter which we might readily work up into a terrific legend  they averred that the symbol was not mere scarlet cloth tinged in an earthly dyepot but was redhot with infernal fire and could be seen glowing all alight whenever hester prynne walked abroad in the nighttime  and we must needs say it seared hesters bosom so deeply that perhaps there was more truth in the rumour than our modern incredulity may be inclined to admit    vi  pearl  we have as yet hardly spoken of the infant that little creature whose innocent life had sprung by the inscrutable decree of providence a lovely and immortal flower out of the rank luxuriance of a guilty passion  how strange it seemed to the sad woman as she watched the growth and the beauty that became every day more brilliant and the intelligence that threw its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child  her pearlfor so had hester called her not as a name expressive of her aspect which had nothing of the calm white unimpassioned lustre that would be indicated by the comparison  but she named the infant pearl as being of great pricepurchased with all she hadher mothers only treasure  how strange indeed  man had marked this womans sin by a scarlet letter which had such potent and disastrous efficacy that no human sympathy could reach her save it were sinful like herself  god as a direct consequence of the sin which man thus punished had given her a lovely child whose place was on that same dishonoured bosom to connect her parent for ever with the race and descent of mortals and to be finally a blessed soul in heaven  yet these thoughts affected hester prynne less with hope than apprehension  she knew that her deed had been evil she could have no faith therefore that its result would be good  day after day she looked fearfully into the childs expanding nature ever dreading to detect some dark and wild peculiarity that should correspond with the guiltiness to which she owed her being  certainly there was no physical defect  by its perfect shape its vigour and its natural dexterity in the use of all its untried limbs the infant was worthy to have been brought forth in eden worthy to have been left there to be the plaything of the angels after the worlds first parents were driven out  the child had a native grace which does not invariably coexist with faultless beauty its attire however simple always impressed the beholder as if it were the very garb that precisely became it best  but little pearl was not clad in rustic weeds  her mother with a morbid purpose that may be better understood hereafter had bought the richest tissues that could be procured and allowed her imaginative faculty its full play in the arrangement and decoration of the dresses which the child wore before the public eye  so magnificent was the small figure when thus arrayed and such was the splendour of pearls own proper beauty shining through the gorgeous robes which might have extinguished a paler loveliness that there was an absolute circle of radiance around her on the darksome cottage floor  and yet a russet gown torn and soiled with the childs rude play made a picture of her just as perfect  pearls aspect was imbued with a spell of infinite variety in this one child there were many children comprehending the full scope between the wildflower prettiness of a peasantbaby and the pomp in little of an infant princess  throughout all however there was a trait of passion a certain depth of hue which she never lost and if in any of her changes she had grown fainter or paler she would have ceased to be herselfit would have been no longer pearl  this outward mutability indicated and did not more than fairly express the various properties of her inner life  her nature appeared to possess depth too as well as variety butor else hesters fears deceived herit lacked reference and adaptation to the world into which she was born  the child could not be made amenable to rules  in giving her existence a great law had been broken and the result was a being whose elements were perhaps beautiful and brilliant but all in disorder or with an order peculiar to themselves amidst which the point of variety and arrangement was difficult or impossible to be discovered hester could only account for the childs characterand even then most vaguely and imperfectlyby recalling what she herself had been during that momentous period while pearl was imbibing her soul from the spiritual world and her bodily frame from its material of earth  the mothers impassioned state had been the medium through which were transmitted to the unborn infant the rays of its moral life and however white and clear originally they had taken the deep stains of crimson and gold the fiery lustre the black shadow and the untempered light of the intervening substance  above all the warfare of hesters spirit at that epoch was perpetuated in pearl  she could recognize her wild desperate defiant mood the flightiness of her temper and even some of the very cloudshapes of gloom and despondency that had brooded in her heart  they were now illuminated by the morning radiance of a young childs disposition but later in the day of earthly existence might be prolific of the storm and whirlwind  the discipline of the family in those days was of a far more rigid kind than now  the frown the harsh rebuke the frequent application of the rod enjoined by scriptural authority were used not merely in the way of punishment for actual offences but as a wholesome regimen for the growth and promotion of all childish virtues  hester prynne nevertheless the loving mother of this one child ran little risk of erring on the side of undue severity  mindful however of her own errors and misfortunes she early sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant immortality that was committed to her charge  but the task was beyond her skill  after testing both smiles and frowns and proving that neither mode of treatment possessed any calculable influence hester was ultimately compelled to stand aside and permit the child to be swayed by her own impulses  physical compulsion or restraint was effectual of course while it lasted  as to any other kind of discipline whether addressed to her mind or heart little pearl might or might not be within its reach in accordance with the caprice that ruled the moment  her mother while pearl was yet an infant grew acquainted with a certain peculiar look that warned her when it would be labour thrown away to insist persuade or plead  it was a look so intelligent yet inexplicable perverse sometimes so malicious but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits that hester could not help questioning at such moments whether pearl was a human child  she seemed rather an airy sprite which after playing its fantastic sports for a little while upon the cottage floor would flit away with a mocking smile  whenever that look appeared in her wild bright deeply black eyes it invested her with a strange remoteness and intangibility it was as if she were hovering in the air and might vanish like a glimmering light that comes we know not whence and goes we know not whither  beholding it hester was constrained to rush towards the childto pursue the little elf in the flight which she invariably beganto snatch her to her bosom with a close pressure and earnest kissesnot so much from overflowing love as to assure herself that pearl was flesh and blood and not utterly delusive  but pearls laugh when she was caught though full of merriment and music made her mother more doubtful than before  heartsmitten at this bewildering and baffling spell that so often came between herself and her sole treasure whom she had bought so dear and who was all her world hester sometimes burst into passionate tears  then perhapsfor there was no foreseeing how it might affect herpearl would frown and clench her little fist and harden her small features into a stern unsympathising look of discontent  not seldom she would laugh anew and louder than before like a thing incapable and unintelligent of human sorrow  orbut this more rarely happenedshe would be convulsed with rage of grief and sob out her love for her mother in broken words and seem intent on proving that she had a heart by breaking it  yet hester was hardly safe in confiding herself to that gusty tenderness it passed as suddenly as it came  brooding over all these matters the mother felt like one who has evoked a spirit but by some irregularity in the process of conjuration has failed to win the masterword that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence  her only real comfort was when the child lay in the placidity of sleep  then she was sure of her and tasted hours of quiet sad delicious happiness untilperhaps with that perverse expression glimmering from beneath her opening lidslittle pearl awoke  how soonwith what strange rapidity indeed did pearl arrive at an age that was capable of social intercourse beyond the mothers everready smile and nonsensewords  and then what a happiness would it have been could hester prynne have heard her clear birdlike voice mingling with the uproar of other childish voices and have distinguished and unravelled her own darlings tones amid all the entangled outcry of a group of sportive children  but this could never be  pearl was a born outcast of the infantile world  an imp of evil emblem and product of sin she had no right among christened infants nothing was more remarkable than the instinct as it seemed with which the child comprehended her loneliness the destiny that had drawn an inviolable circle round about her the whole peculiarity in short of her position in respect to other children  never since her release from prison had hester met the public gaze without her  in all her walks about the town pearl too was there first as the babe in arms and afterwards as the little girl small companion of her mother holding a forefinger with her whole grasp and tripping along at the rate of three or four footsteps to one of hesters  she saw the children of the settlement on the grassy margin of the street or at the domestic thresholds disporting themselves in such grim fashions as the puritanic nurture would permit playing at going to church perchance or at scourging quakers or taking scalps in a sham fight with the indians or scaring one another with freaks of imitative witchcraft  pearl saw and gazed intently but never sought to make acquaintance  if spoken to she would not speak again  if the children gathered about her as they sometimes did pearl would grow positively terrible in her puny wrath snatching up stones to fling at them with shrill incoherent exclamations that made her mother tremble because they had so much the sound of a witchs anathemas in some unknown tongue  the truth was that the little puritans being of the most intolerant brood that ever lived had got a vague idea of something outlandish unearthly or at variance with ordinary fashions in the mother and child and therefore scorned them in their hearts and not unfrequently reviled them with their tongues  pearl felt the sentiment and requited it with the bitterest hatred that can be supposed to rankle in a childish bosom  these outbreaks of a fierce temper had a kind of value and even comfort for the mother because there was at least an intelligible earnestness in the mood instead of the fitful caprice that so often thwarted her in the childs manifestations  it appalled her nevertheless to discern here again a shadowy reflection of the evil that had existed in herself  all this enmity and passion had pearl inherited by inalienable right out of hesters heart  mother and daughter stood together in the same circle of seclusion from human society and in the nature of the child seemed to be perpetuated those unquiet elements that had distracted hester prynne before pearls birth but had since begun to be soothed away by the softening influences of maternity  at home within and around her mothers cottage pearl wanted not a wide and various circle of acquaintance  the spell of life went forth from her evercreative spirit and communicated itself to a thousand objects as a torch kindles a flame wherever it may be applied  the unlikeliest materialsa stick a bunch of rags a flowerwere the puppets of pearls witchcraft and without undergoing any outward change became spiritually adapted to whatever drama occupied the stage of her inner world  her one babyvoice served a multitude of imaginary personages old and young to talk withal  the pinetrees aged black and solemn and flinging groans and other melancholy utterances on the breeze needed little transformation to figure as puritan elders the ugliest weeds of the garden were their children whom pearl smote down and uprooted most unmercifully it was wonderful the vast variety of forms into which she threw her intellect with no continuity indeed but darting up and dancing always in a state of preternatural activitysoon sinking down as if exhausted by so rapid and feverish a tide of lifeand succeeded by other shapes of a similar wild energy  it was like nothing so much as the phantasmagoric play of the northern lights  in the mere exercise of the fancy however and the sportiveness of a growing mind there might be a little more than was observable in other children of bright faculties except as pearl in the dearth of human playmates was thrown more upon the visionary throng which she created  the singularity lay in the hostile feelings with which the child regarded all these offsprings of her own heart and mind  she never created a friend but seemed always to be sowing broadcast the dragons teeth whence sprung a harvest of armed enemies against whom she rushed to battle  it was inexpressibly sadthen what depth of sorrow to a mother who felt in her own heart the causeto observe in one so young this constant recognition of an adverse world and so fierce a training of the energies that were to make good her cause in the contest that must ensue  gazing at pearl hester prynne often dropped her work upon her knees and cried out with an agony which she would fain have hidden but which made utterance for itself betwixt speech and a groano father in heavenif thou art still my fatherwhat is this being which i have brought into the world and pearl overhearing the ejaculation or aware through some more subtile channel of those throbs of anguish would turn her vivid and beautiful little face upon her mother smile with spritelike intelligence and resume her play  one peculiarity of the childs deportment remains yet to be told  the very first thing which she had noticed in her life waswhatnot the mothers smile responding to it as other babies do by that faint embryo smile of the little mouth remembered so doubtfully afterwards and with such fond discussion whether it were indeed a smile  by no means  but that first object of which pearl seemed to become aware wasshall we say itthe scarlet letter on hesters bosom  one day as her mother stooped over the cradle the infants eyes had been caught by the glimmering of the gold embroidery about the letter and putting up her little hand she grasped at it smiling not doubtfully but with a decided gleam that gave her face the look of a much older child  then gasping for breath did hester prynne clutch the fatal token instinctively endeavouring to tear it away so infinite was the torture inflicted by the intelligent touch of pearls babyhand  again as if her mothers agonised gesture were meant only to make sport for her did little pearl look into her eyes and smile from that epoch except when the child was asleep hester had never felt a moments safety not a moments calm enjoyment of her  weeks it is true would sometimes elapse during which pearls gaze might never once be fixed upon the scarlet letter but then again it would come at unawares like the stroke of sudden death and always with that peculiar smile and odd expression of the eyes  once this freakish elvish cast came into the childs eyes while hester was looking at her own image in them as mothers are fond of doing and suddenly for women in solitude and with troubled hearts are pestered with unaccountable delusions she fancied that she beheld not her own miniature portrait but another face in the small black mirror of pearls eye  it was a face fiendlike full of smiling malice yet bearing the semblance of features that she had known full well though seldom with a smile and never with malice in them  it was as if an evil spirit possessed the child and had just then peeped forth in mockery  many a time afterwards had hester been tortured though less vividly by the same illusion  in the afternoon of a certain summers day after pearl grew big enough to run about she amused herself with gathering handfuls of wild flowers and flinging them one by one at her mothers bosom dancing up and down like a little elf whenever she hit the scarlet letter  hesters first motion had been to cover her bosom with her clasped hands  but whether from pride or resignation or a feeling that her penance might best be wrought out by this unutterable pain she resisted the impulse and sat erect pale as death looking sadly into little pearls wild eyes  still came the battery of flowers almost invariably hitting the mark and covering the mothers breast with hurts for which she could find no balm in this world nor knew how to seek it in another  at last her shot being all expended the child stood still and gazed at hester with that little laughing image of a fiend peeping outor whether it peeped or no her mother so imagined itfrom the unsearchable abyss of her black eyes  child what art thou cried the mother  oh i am your little pearl answered the child  but while she said it pearl laughed and began to dance up and down with the humoursome gesticulation of a little imp whose next freak might be to fly up the chimney  art thou my child in very truth asked hester  nor did she put the question altogether idly but for the moment with a portion of genuine earnestness for such was pearls wonderful intelligence that her mother half doubted whether she were not acquainted with the secret spell of her existence and might not now reveal herself  yes i am little pearl repeated the child continuing her antics  thou art not my child  thou art no pearl of mine said the mother half playfully for it was often the case that a sportive impulse came over her in the midst of her deepest suffering tell me then what thou art and who sent thee hither  tell me mother said the child seriously coming up to hester and pressing herself close to her knees  do thou tell me  thy heavenly father sent thee answered hester prynne  but she said it with a hesitation that did not escape the acuteness of the child  whether moved only by her ordinary freakishness or because an evil spirit prompted her she put up her small forefinger and touched the scarlet letter  he did not send me cried she positively  i have no heavenly father  hush pearl hush  thou must not talk so answered the mother suppressing a groan  he sent us all into the world  he sent even me thy mother  then much more thee  or if not thou strange and elfish child whence didst thou come  tell me  tell me repeated pearl no longer seriously but laughing and capering about the floor  it is thou that must tell me  but hester could not resolve the query being herself in a dismal labyrinth of doubt  she rememberedbetwixt a smile and a shudderthe talk of the neighbouring townspeople who seeking vainly elsewhere for the childs paternity and observing some of her odd attributes had given out that poor little pearl was a demon offspring such as ever since old catholic times had occasionally been seen on earth through the agency of their mothers sin and to promote some foul and wicked purpose luther according to the scandal of his monkish enemies was a brat of that hellish breed nor was pearl the only child to whom this inauspicious origin was assigned among the new england puritans    vii  the governors hall  hester prynne went one day to the mansion of governor bellingham with a pair of gloves which she had fringed and embroidered to his order and which were to be worn on some great occasion of state for though the chances of a popular election had caused this former ruler to descend a step or two from the highest rank he still held an honourable and influential place among the colonial magistracy  another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves impelled hester at this time to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the settlement  it had reached her ears that there was a design on the part of some of the leading inhabitants cherishing the more rigid order of principles in religion and government to deprive her of her child  on the supposition that pearl as already hinted was of demon origin these good people not unreasonably argued that a christian interest in the mothers soul required them to remove such a stumblingblock from her path  if the child on the other hand were really capable of moral and religious growth and possessed the elements of ultimate salvation then surely it would enjoy all the fairer prospect of these advantages by being transferred to wiser and better guardianship than hester prynnes  among those who promoted the design governor bellingham was said to be one of the most busy  it may appear singular and indeed not a little ludicrous that an affair of this kind which in later days would have been referred to no higher jurisdiction than that of the select men of the town should then have been a question publicly discussed and on which statesmen of eminence took sides  at that epoch of pristine simplicity however matters of even slighter public interest and of far less intrinsic weight than the welfare of hester and her child were strangely mixed up with the deliberations of legislators and acts of state  the period was hardly if at all earlier than that of our story when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not only caused a fierce and bitter contest in the legislative body of the colony but resulted in an important modification of the framework itself of the legislature  full of concern thereforebut so conscious of her own right that it seemed scarcely an unequal match between the public on the one side and a lonely woman backed by the sympathies of nature on the otherhester prynne set forth from her solitary cottage  little pearl of course was her companion  she was now of an age to run lightly along by her mothers side and constantly in motion from morn till sunset could have accomplished a much longer journey than that before her  often nevertheless more from caprice than necessity she demanded to be taken up in arms but was soon as imperious to be let down again and frisked onward before hester on the grassy pathway with many a harmless trip and tumble  we have spoken of pearls rich and luxuriant beautya beauty that shone with deep and vivid tints a bright complexion eyes possessing intensity both of depth and glow and hair already of a deep glossy brown and which in after years would be nearly akin to black  there was fire in her and throughout her she seemed the unpremeditated offshoot of a passionate moment  her mother in contriving the childs garb had allowed the gorgeous tendencies of her imagination their full play arraying her in a crimson velvet tunic of a peculiar cut abundantly embroidered in fantasies and flourishes of gold thread  so much strength of colouring which must have given a wan and pallid aspect to cheeks of a fainter bloom was admirably adapted to pearls beauty and made her the very brightest little jet of flame that ever danced upon the earth  but it was a remarkable attribute of this garb and indeed of the childs whole appearance that it irresistibly and inevitably reminded the beholder of the token which hester prynne was doomed to wear upon her bosom  it was the scarlet letter in another form the scarlet letter endowed with life the mother herselfas if the red ignominy were so deeply scorched into her brain that all her conceptions assumed its formhad carefully wrought out the similitude lavishing many hours of morbid ingenuity to create an analogy between the object of her affection and the emblem of her guilt and torture but in truth pearl was the one as well as the other and only in consequence of that identity had hester contrived so perfectly to represent the scarlet letter in her appearance  as the two wayfarers came within the precincts of the town the children of the puritans looked up from their playor what passed for play with those sombre little urchinsand spoke gravely one to another  behold verily there is the woman of the scarlet letter and of a truth moreover there is the likeness of the scarlet letter running along by her side  come therefore and let us fling mud at them  but pearl who was a dauntless child after frowning stamping her foot and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures suddenly made a rush at the knot of her enemies and put them all to flight  she resembled in her fierce pursuit of them an infant pestilencethe scarlet fever or some such halffledged angel of judgmentwhose mission was to punish the sins of the rising generation  she screamed and shouted too with a terrific volume of sound which doubtless caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them  the victory accomplished pearl returned quietly to her mother and looked up smiling into her face  without further adventure they reached the dwelling of governor bellingham  this was a large wooden house built in a fashion of which there are specimens still extant in the streets of our older towns now mossgrown crumbling to decay and melancholy at heart with the many sorrowful or joyful occurrences remembered or forgotten that have happened and passed away within their dusky chambers  then however there was the freshness of the passing year on its exterior and the cheerfulness gleaming forth from the sunny windows of a human habitation into which death had never entered  it had indeed a very cheery aspect the walls being overspread with a kind of stucco in which fragments of broken glass were plentifully intermixed so that when the sunshine fell aslantwise over the front of the edifice it glittered and sparkled as if diamonds had been flung against it by the double handful  the brilliancy might have be fitted aladdins palace rather than the mansion of a grave old puritan ruler  it was further decorated with strange and seemingly cabalistic figures and diagrams suitable to the quaint taste of the age which had been drawn in the stucco when newly laid on and had now grown hard and durable for the admiration of after times  pearl looking at this bright wonder of a house began to caper and dance and imperatively required that the whole breadth of sunshine should be stripped off its front and given her to play with  no my little pearl said her mother thou must gather thine own sunshine  i have none to give thee  they approached the door which was of an arched form and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projection of the edifice in both of which were latticewindows the wooden shutters to close over them at need  lifting the iron hammer that hung at the portal hester prynne gave a summons which was answered by one of the governors bond servanta freeborn englishman but now a seven years slave  during that term he was to be the property of his master and as much a commodity of bargain and sale as an ox or a jointstool  the serf wore the customary garb of servingmen at that period and long before in the old hereditary halls of england  is the worshipful governor bellingham within inquired hester  yea forsooth replied the bondservant staring with wideopen eyes at the scarlet letter which being a newcomer in the country he had never before seen  yea his honourable worship is within  but he hath a godly minister or two with him and likewise a leech  ye may not see his worship now  nevertheless i will enter answered hester prynne and the bondservant perhaps judging from the decision of her air and the glittering symbol in her bosom that she was a great lady in the land offered no opposition  so the mother and little pearl were admitted into the hall of entrance  with many variations suggested by the nature of his building materials diversity of climate and a different mode of social life governor bellingham had planned his new habitation after the residences of gentlemen of fair estate in his native land  here then was a wide and reasonably lofty hall extending through the whole depth of the house and forming a medium of general communication more or less directly with all the other apartments  at one extremity this spacious room was lighted by the windows of the two towers which formed a small recess on either side of the portal  at the other end though partly muffled by a curtain it was more powerfully illuminated by one of those embowed hall windows which we read of in old books and which was provided with a deep and cushioned seat  here on the cushion lay a folio tome probably of the chronicles of england or other such substantial literature even as in our own days we scatter gilded volumes on the centre table to be turned over by the casual guest  the furniture of the hall consisted of some ponderous chairs the backs of which were elaborately carved with wreaths of oaken flowers and likewise a table in the same taste the whole being of the elizabethan age or perhaps earlier and heirlooms transferred hither from the governors paternal home  on the tablein token that the sentiment of old english hospitality had not been left behindstood a large pewter tankard at the bottom of which had hester or pearl peeped into it they might have seen the frothy remnant of a recent draught of ale  on the wall hung a row of portraits representing the forefathers of the bellingham lineage some with armour on their breasts and others with stately ruffs and robes of peace  all were characterised by the sternness and severity which old portraits so invariably put on as if they were the ghosts rather than the pictures of departed worthies and were gazing with harsh and intolerant criticism at the pursuits and enjoyments of living men  at about the centre of the oaken panels that lined the hall was suspended a suit of mail not like the pictures an ancestral relic but of the most modern date for it had been manufactured by a skilful armourer in london the same year in which governor bellingham came over to new england  there was a steel headpiece a cuirass a gorget and greaves with a pair of gauntlets and a sword hanging beneath all and especially the helmet and breastplate so highly burnished as to glow with white radiance and scatter an illumination everywhere about upon the floor  this bright panoply was not meant for mere idle show but had been worn by the governor on many a solemn muster and training field and had glittered moreover at the head of a regiment in the pequod war  for though bred a lawyer and accustomed to speak of bacon coke noye and finch as his professional associates the exigencies of this new country had transformed governor bellingham into a soldier as well as a statesman and ruler  little pearl who was as greatly pleased with the gleaming armour as she had been with the glittering frontispiece of the house spent some time looking into the polished mirror of the breastplate  mother cried she i see you here  look  look  hester looked by way of humouring the child and she saw that owing to the peculiar effect of this convex mirror the scarlet letter was represented in exaggerated and gigantic proportions so as to be greatly the most prominent feature of her appearance  in truth she seemed absolutely hidden behind it pearl pointed upwards also at a similar picture in the headpiece smiling at her mother with the elfish intelligence that was so familiar an expression on her small physiognomy that look of naughty merriment was likewise reflected in the mirror with so much breadth and intensity of effect that it made hester prynne feel as if it could not be the image of her own child but of an imp who was seeking to mould itself into pearls shape  come along pearl said she drawing her away come and look into this fair garden  it may be we shall see flowers there more beautiful ones than we find in the woods  pearl accordingly ran to the bowwindow at the further end of the hall and looked along the vista of a garden walk carpeted with closelyshaven grass and bordered with some rude and immature attempt at shrubbery  but the proprietor appeared already to have relinquished as hopeless the effort to perpetuate on this side of the atlantic in a hard soil and amid the close struggle for subsistence the native english taste for ornamental gardening  cabbages grew in plain sight and a pumpkinvine rooted at some distance had run across the intervening space and deposited one of its gigantic products directly beneath the hall window as if to warn the governor that this great lump of vegetable gold was as rich an ornament as new england earth would offer him  there were a few rosebushes however and a number of appletrees probably the descendants of those planted by the reverend mr blackstone the first settler of the peninsula that half mythological personage who rides through our early annals seated on the back of a bull  pearl seeing the rosebushes began to cry for a red rose and would not be pacified  hush childhush said her mother earnestly  do not cry dear little pearl  i hear voices in the garden  the governor is coming and gentlemen along with him  in fact adown the vista of the garden avenue a number of persons were seen approaching towards the house  pearl in utter scorn of her mothers attempt to quiet her gave an eldritch scream and then became silent not from any notion of obedience but because the quick and mobile curiosity of her disposition was excited by the appearance of those new personages    viii  the elfchild and the minister  governor bellingham in a loose gown and easy capsuch as elderly gentlemen loved to endue themselves with in their domestic privacywalked foremost and appeared to be showing off his estate and expatiating on his projected improvements the wide circumference of an elaborate ruff beneath his grey beard in the antiquated fashion of king jamess reign caused his head to look not a little like that of john the baptist in a charger  the impression made by his aspect so rigid and severe and frostbitten with more than autumnal age was hardly in keeping with the appliances of worldly enjoyment wherewith he had evidently done his utmost to surround himself  but it is an error to suppose that our great forefathersthough accustomed to speak and think of human existence as a state merely of trial and warfare and though unfeignedly prepared to sacrifice goods and life at the behest of dutymade it a matter of conscience to reject such means of comfort or even luxury as lay fairly within their grasp  this creed was never taught for instance by the venerable pastor john wilson whose beard white as a snowdrift was seen over governor bellinghams shoulders while its wearer suggested that pears and peaches might yet be naturalised in the new england climate and that purple grapes might possibly be compelled to flourish against the sunny gardenwall  the old clergyman nurtured at the rich bosom of the english church had a long established and legitimate taste for all good and comfortable things and however stern he might show himself in the pulpit or in his public reproof of such transgressions as that of hester prynne still the genial benevolence of his private life had won him warmer affection than was accorded to any of his professional contemporaries  behind the governor and mr wilson came two other guestsone the reverend arthur dimmesdale whom the reader may remember as having taken a brief and reluctant part in the scene of hester prynnes disgrace and in close companionship with him old roger chillingworth a person of great skill in physic who for two or three years past had been settled in the town  it was understood that this learned man was the physician as well as friend of the young minister whose health had severely suffered of late by his too unreserved selfsacrifice to the labours and duties of the pastoral relation  the governor in advance of his visitors ascended one or two steps and throwing open the leaves of the great hall window found himself close to little pearl  the shadow of the curtain fell on hester prynne and partially concealed her  what have we here said governor bellingham looking with surprise at the scarlet little figure before him  i profess i have never seen the like since my days of vanity in old king jamess time when i was wont to esteem it a high favour to be admitted to a court mask  there used to be a swarm of these small apparitions in holiday time and we called them children of the lord of misrule  but how gat such a guest into my hall  ay indeed cried good old mr wilson  what little bird of scarlet plumage may this be  methinks i have seen just such figures when the sun has been shining through a richly painted window and tracing out the golden and crimson images across the floor  but that was in the old land  prithee young one who art thou and what has ailed thy mother to bedizen thee in this strange fashion  art thou a christian childha  dost know thy catechism  or art thou one of those naughty elfs or fairies whom we thought to have left behind us with other relics of papistry in merry old england  i am mothers child answered the scarlet vision and my name is pearl  pearlruby ratheror coralor red rose at the very least judging from thy hue responded the old minister putting forth his hand in a vain attempt to pat little pearl on the cheek  but where is this mother of thine  ah  i see he added and turning to governor bellingham whispered this is the selfsame child of whom we have held speech together and behold here the unhappy woman hester prynne her mother  sayest thou so cried the governor  nay we might have judged that such a childs mother must needs be a scarlet woman and a worthy type of her of babylon  but she comes at a good time and we will look into this matter forthwith  governor bellingham stepped through the window into the hall followed by his three guests  hester prynne said he fixing his naturally stern regard on the wearer of the scarlet letter there hath been much question concerning thee of late  the point hath been weightily discussed whether we that are of authority and influence do well discharge our consciences by trusting an immortal soul such as there is in yonder child to the guidance of one who hath stumbled and fallen amid the pitfalls of this world  speak thou the childs own mother  were it not thinkest thou for thy little ones temporal and eternal welfare that she be taken out of thy charge and clad soberly and disciplined strictly and instructed in the truths of heaven and earth  what canst thou do for the child in this kind  i can teach my little pearl what i have learned from this answered hester prynne laying her finger on the red token  woman it is thy badge of shame replied the stern magistrate it is because of the stain which that letter indicates that we would transfer thy child to other hands  nevertheless said the mother calmly though growing more pale this badge hath taught meit daily teaches meit is teaching me at this momentlessons whereof my child may be the wiser and better albeit they can profit nothing to myself  we will judge warily said bellingham and look well what we are about to do  good master wilson i pray you examine this pearlsince that is her nameand see whether she hath had such christian nurture as befits a child of her age  the old minister seated himself in an armchair and made an effort to draw pearl betwixt his knees  but the child unaccustomed to the touch or familiarity of any but her mother escaped through the open window and stood on the upper step looking like a wild tropical bird of rich plumage ready to take flight into the upper air  mr wilson not a little astonished at this outbreakfor he was a grandfatherly sort of personage and usually a vast favourite with childrenessayed however to proceed with the examination  pearl said he with great solemnity thou must take heed to instruction that so in due season thou mayest wear in thy bosom the pearl of great price  canst thou tell me my child who made thee  now pearl knew well enough who made her for hester prynne the daughter of a pious home very soon after her talk with the child about her heavenly father had begun to inform her of those truths which the human spirit at whatever stage of immaturity imbibes with such eager interest  pearl thereforeso large were the attainments of her three years lifetimecould have borne a fair examination in the new england primer or the first column of the westminster catechisms although unacquainted with the outward form of either of those celebrated works  but that perversity which all children have more or less of and of which little pearl had a tenfold portion now at the most inopportune moment took thorough possession of her and closed her lips or impelled her to speak words amiss  after putting her finger in her mouth with many ungracious refusals to answer good mr wilsons question the child finally announced that she had not been made at all but had been plucked by her mother off the bush of wild roses that grew by the prisondoor  this phantasy was probably suggested by the near proximity of the governors red roses as pearl stood outside of the window together with her recollection of the prison rosebush which she had passed in coming hither  old roger chillingworth with a smile on his face whispered something in the young clergymans ear  hester prynne looked at the man of skill and even then with her fate hanging in the balance was startled to perceive what a change had come over his featureshow much uglier they were how his dark complexion seemed to have grown duskier and his figure more misshapensince the days when she had familiarly known him  she met his eyes for an instant but was immediately constrained to give all her attention to the scene now going forward  this is awful cried the governor slowly recovering from the astonishment into which pearls response had thrown him  here is a child of three years old and she cannot tell who made her without question she is equally in the dark as to her soul its present depravity and future destiny  methinks gentlemen we need inquire no further  hester caught hold of pearl and drew her forcibly into her arms confronting the old puritan magistrate with almost a fierce expression  alone in the world cast off by it and with this sole treasure to keep her heart alive she felt that she possessed indefeasible rights against the world and was ready to defend them to the death  god gave me the child cried she  he gave her in requital of all things else which ye had taken from me  she is my happinessshe is my torture none the less  pearl keeps me here in life  pearl punishes me too  see ye not she is the scarlet letter only capable of being loved and so endowed with a millionfold the power of retribution for my sin  ye shall not take her  i will die first  my poor woman said the not unkind old minister the child shall be well cared forfar better than thou canst do for it  god gave her into my keeping repeated hester prynne raising her voice almost to a shriek  i will not give her up  and here by a sudden impulse she turned to the young clergyman mr dimmesdale at whom up to this moment she had seemed hardly so much as once to direct her eyes  speak thou for me cried she thou wast my pastor and hadst charge of my soul and knowest me better than these men can  i will not lose the child  speak for me  thou knowestfor thou hast sympathies which these men lackthou knowest what is in my heart and what are a mothers rights and how much the stronger they are when that mother has but her child and the scarlet letter  look thou to it  i will not lose the child  look to it  at this wild and singular appeal which indicated that hester prynnes situation had provoked her to little less than madness the young minister at once came forward pale and holding his hand over his heart as was his custom whenever his peculiarly nervous temperament was thrown into agitation  he looked now more careworn and emaciated than as we described him at the scene of hesters public ignominy and whether it were his failing health or whatever the cause might be his large dark eyes had a world of pain in their troubled and melancholy depth  there is truth in what she says began the minister with a voice sweet tremulous but powerful insomuch that the hall reechoed and the hollow armour rang with ittruth in what hester says and in the feeling which inspires her  god gave her the child and gave her too an instinctive knowledge of its nature and requirementsboth seemingly so peculiarwhich no other mortal being can possess  and moreover is there not a quality of awful sacredness in the relation between this mother and this child  ayhow is that good master dimmesdale interrupted the governor  make that plain i pray you  it must be even so resumed the minister  for if we deem it otherwise do we not thereby say that the heavenly father the creator of all flesh hath lightly recognised a deed of sin and made of no account the distinction between unhallowed lust and holy love  this child of its fathers guilt and its mothers shame has come from the hand of god to work in many ways upon her heart who pleads so earnestly and with such bitterness of spirit the right to keep her  it was meant for a blessingfor the one blessing of her life  it was meant doubtless the mother herself hath told us for a retribution too a torture to be felt at many an unthoughtof moment a pang a sting an everrecurring agony in the midst of a troubled joy  hath she not expressed this thought in the garb of the poor child so forcibly reminding us of that red symbol which sears her bosom  well said again cried good mr wilson  i feared the woman had no better thought than to make a mountebank of her child  oh not sonot so continued mr dimmesdale  she recognises believe me the solemn miracle which god hath wrought in the existence of that child  and may she feel toowhat methinks is the very truththat this boon was meant above all things else to keep the mothers soul alive and to preserve her from blacker depths of sin into which satan might else have sought to plunge her  therefore it is good for this poor sinful woman that she hath an infant immortality a being capable of eternal joy or sorrow confided to her careto be trained up by her to righteousness to remind her at every moment of her fall but yet to teach her as if it were by the creators sacred pledge that if she bring the child to heaven the child also will bring its parents thither  herein is the sinful mother happier than the sinful father  for hester prynnes sake then and no less for the poor childs sake let us leave them as providence hath seen fit to place them  you speak my friend with a strange earnestness said old roger chillingworth smiling at him  and there is a weighty import in what my young brother hath spoken added the rev  mr wilson  what say you worshipful master bellingham  hath he not pleaded well for the poor woman  indeed hath he answered the magistrate and hath adduced such arguments that we will even leave the matter as it now stands so long at least as there shall be no further scandal in the woman  care must be had nevertheless to put the child to due and stated examination in the catechism at thy hands or master dimmesdales  moreover at a proper season the tithingmen must take heed that she go both to school and to meeting  the young minister on ceasing to speak had withdrawn a few steps from the group and stood with his face partially concealed in the heavy folds of the windowcurtain while the shadow of his figure which the sunlight cast upon the floor was tremulous with the vehemence of his appeal  pearl that wild and flighty little elf stole softly towards him and taking his hand in the grasp of both her own laid her cheek against it a caress so tender and withal so unobtrusive that her mother who was looking on asked herselfis that my pearl yet she knew that there was love in the childs heart although it mostly revealed itself in passion and hardly twice in her lifetime had been softened by such gentleness as now  the ministerfor save the longsought regards of woman nothing is sweeter than these marks of childish preference accorded spontaneously by a spiritual instinct and therefore seeming to imply in us something truly worthy to be lovedthe minister looked round laid his hand on the childs head hesitated an instant and then kissed her brow  little pearls unwonted mood of sentiment lasted no longer she laughed and went capering down the hall so airily that old mr wilson raised a question whether even her tiptoes touched the floor  the little baggage hath witchcraft in her i profess said he to mr dimmesdale  she needs no old womans broomstick to fly withal  a strange child remarked old roger chillingworth  it is easy to see the mothers part in her  would it be beyond a philosophers research think ye gentlemen to analyse that childs nature and from it make a mould to give a shrewd guess at the father  nay it would be sinful in such a question to follow the clue of profane philosophy said mr wilson  better to fast and pray upon it and still better it may be to leave the mystery as we find it unless providence reveal it of its own accord thereby every good christian man hath a title to show a fathers kindness towards the poor deserted babe  the affair being so satisfactorily concluded hester prynne with pearl departed from the house  as they descended the steps it is averred that the lattice of a chamberwindow was thrown open and forth into the sunny day was thrust the face of mistress hibbins governor bellinghams bittertempered sister and the same who a few years later was executed as a witch  hist hist said she while her illomened physiognomy seemed to cast a shadow over the cheerful newness of the house  wilt thou go with us tonight  there will be a merry company in the forest and i wellnigh promised the black man that comely hester prynne should make one  make my excuse to him so please you answered hester with a triumphant smile  i must tarry at home and keep watch over my little pearl  had they taken her from me i would willingly have gone with thee into the forest and signed my name in the black mans book too and that with mine own blood  we shall have thee there anon said the witchlady frowning as she drew back her head  but hereif we suppose this interview betwixt mistress hibbins and hester prynne to be authentic and not a parablewas already an illustration of the young ministers argument against sundering the relation of a fallen mother to the offspring of her frailty  even thus early had the child saved her from satans snare    ix  the leech  under the appellation of roger chillingworth the reader will remember was hidden another name which its former wearer had resolved should never more be spoken  it has been related how in the crowd that witnessed hester prynnes ignominious exposure stood a man elderly travelworn who just emerging from the perilous wilderness beheld the woman in whom he hoped to find embodied the warmth and cheerfulness of home set up as a type of sin before the people  her matronly fame was trodden under all mens feet  infamy was babbling around her in the public marketplace  for her kindred should the tidings ever reach them and for the companions of her unspotted life there remained nothing but the contagion of her dishonour which would not fail to be distributed in strict accordance and proportion with the intimacy and sacredness of their previous relationship then whysince the choice was with himselfshould the individual whose connexion with the fallen woman had been the most intimate and sacred of them all come forward to vindicate his claim to an inheritance so little desirable  he resolved not to be pilloried beside her on her pedestal of shame  unknown to all but hester prynne and possessing the lock and key of her silence he chose to withdraw his name from the roll of mankind and as regarded his former ties and interest to vanish out of life as completely as if he indeed lay at the bottom of the ocean whither rumour had long ago consigned him  this purpose once effected new interests would immediately spring up and likewise a new purpose dark it is true if not guilty but of force enough to engage the full strength of his faculties  in pursuance of this resolve he took up his residence in the puritan town as roger chillingworth without other introduction than the learning and intelligence of which he possessed more than a common measure  as his studies at a previous period of his life had made him extensively acquainted with the medical science of the day it was as a physician that he presented himself and as such was cordially received  skilful men of the medical and chirurgical profession were of rare occurrence in the colony  they seldom it would appear partook of the religious zeal that brought other emigrants across the atlantic in their researches into the human frame it may be that the higher and more subtle faculties of such men were materialised and that they lost the spiritual view of existence amid the intricacies of that wondrous mechanism which seemed to involve art enough to comprise all of life within itself  at all events the health of the good town of boston so far as medicine had aught to do with it had hitherto lain in the guardianship of an aged deacon and apothecary whose piety and godly deportment were stronger testimonials in his favour than any that he could have produced in the shape of a diploma  the only surgeon was one who combined the occasional exercise of that noble art with the daily and habitual flourish of a razor  to such a professional body roger chillingworth was a brilliant acquisition  he soon manifested his familiarity with the ponderous and imposing machinery of antique physic in which every remedy contained a multitude of farfetched and heterogeneous ingredients as elaborately compounded as if the proposed result had been the elixir of life  in his indian captivity moreover he had gained much knowledge of the properties of native herbs and roots nor did he conceal from his patients that these simple medicines natures boon to the untutored savage had quite as large a share of his own confidence as the european pharmacopoeia which so many learned doctors had spent centuries in elaborating  this learned stranger was exemplary as regarded at least the outward forms of a religious life and early after his arrival had chosen for his spiritual guide the reverend mr dimmesdale the young divine whose scholarlike renown still lived in oxford was considered by his more fervent admirers as little less than a heavenly ordained apostle destined should he live and labour for the ordinary term of life to do as great deeds for the now feeble new england church as the early fathers had achieved for the infancy of the christian faith  about this period however the health of mr dimmesdale had evidently begun to fail  by those best acquainted with his habits the paleness of the young ministers cheek was accounted for by his too earnest devotion to study his scrupulous fulfilment of parochial duty and more than all to the fasts and vigils of which he made a frequent practice in order to keep the grossness of this earthly state from clogging and obscuring his spiritual lamp  some declared that if mr dimmesdale were really going to die it was cause enough that the world was not worthy to be any longer trodden by his feet  he himself on the other hand with characteristic humility avowed his belief that if providence should see fit to remove him it would be because of his own unworthiness to perform its humblest mission here on earth  with all this difference of opinion as to the cause of his decline there could be no question of the fact  his form grew emaciated his voice though still rich and sweet had a certain melancholy prophecy of decay in it he was often observed on any slight alarm or other sudden accident to put his hand over his heart with first a flush and then a paleness indicative of pain  such was the young clergymans condition and so imminent the prospect that his dawning light would be extinguished all untimely when roger chillingworth made his advent to the town his first entry on the scene few people could tell whence dropping down as it were out of the sky or starting from the nether earth had an aspect of mystery which was easily heightened to the miraculous  he was now known to be a man of skill it was observed that he gathered herbs and the blossoms of wildflowers and dug up roots and plucked off twigs from the foresttrees like one acquainted with hidden virtues in what was valueless to common eyes  he was heard to speak of sir kenelm digby and other famous menwhose scientific attainments were esteemed hardly less than supernaturalas having been his correspondents or associates  why with such rank in the learned world had he come hither  what could he whose sphere was in great cities be seeking in the wilderness  in answer to this query a rumour gained groundand however absurd was entertained by some very sensible peoplethat heaven had wrought an absolute miracle by transporting an eminent doctor of physic from a german university bodily through the air and setting him down at the door of mr dimmesdales study individuals of wiser faith indeed who knew that heaven promotes its purposes without aiming at the stageeffect of what is called miraculous interposition were inclined to see a providential hand in roger chillingworths so opportune arrival  this idea was countenanced by the strong interest which the physician ever manifested in the young clergyman he attached himself to him as a parishioner and sought to win a friendly regard and confidence from his naturally reserved sensibility he expressed great alarm at his pastors state of health but was anxious to attempt the cure and if early undertaken seemed not despondent of a favourable result  the elders the deacons the motherly dames and the young and fair maidens of mr dimmesdales flock were alike importunate that he should make trial of the physicians frankly offered skill  mr dimmesdale gently repelled their entreaties  i need no medicine said he  but how could the young minister say so when with every successive sabbath his cheek was paler and thinner and his voice more tremulous than beforewhen it had now become a constant habit rather than a casual gesture to press his hand over his heart  was he weary of his labours  did he wish to die these questions were solemnly propounded to mr dimmesdale by the elder ministers of boston and the deacons of his church who to use their own phrase dealt with him on the sin of rejecting the aid which providence so manifestly held out  he listened in silence and finally promised to confer with the physician  were it gods will said the reverend mr dimmesdale when in fulfilment of this pledge he requested old roger chillingworths professional advice i could be well content that my labours and my sorrows and my sins and my pains should shortly end with me and what is earthly of them be buried in my grave and the spiritual go with me to my eternal state rather than that you should put your skill to the proof in my behalf  ah replied roger chillingworth with that quietness which whether imposed or natural marked all his deportment it is thus that a young clergyman is apt to speak  youthful men not having taken a deep root give up their hold of life so easily and saintly men who walk with god on earth would fain be away to walk with him on the golden pavements of the new jerusalem  nay rejoined the young minister putting his hand to his heart with a flush of pain flitting over his brow were i worthier to walk there i could be better content to toil here  good men ever interpret themselves too meanly said the physician  in this manner the mysterious old roger chillingworth became the medical adviser of the reverend mr dimmesdale  as not only the disease interested the physician but he was strongly moved to look into the character and qualities of the patient these two men so different in age came gradually to spend much time together  for the sake of the ministers health and to enable the leech to gather plants with healing balm in them they took long walks on the seashore or in the forest mingling various walks with the splash and murmur of the waves and the solemn windanthem among the treetops  often likewise one was the guest of the other in his place of study and retirement  there was a fascination for the minister in the company of the man of science in whom he recognised an intellectual cultivation of no moderate depth or scope together with a range and freedom of ideas that he would have vainly looked for among the members of his own profession  in truth he was startled if not shocked to find this attribute in the physician  mr dimmesdale was a true priest a true religionist with the reverential sentiment largely developed and an order of mind that impelled itself powerfully along the track of a creed and wore its passage continually deeper with the lapse of time  in no state of society would he have been what is called a man of liberal views it would always be essential to his peace to feel the pressure of a faith about him supporting while it confined him within its iron framework  not the less however though with a tremulous enjoyment did he feel the occasional relief of looking at the universe through the medium of another kind of intellect than those with which he habitually held converse  it was as if a window were thrown open admitting a freer atmosphere into the close and stifled study where his life was wasting itself away amid lamplight or obstructed daybeams and the musty fragrance be it sensual or moral that exhales from books  but the air was too fresh and chill to be long breathed with comfort  so the minister and the physician with him withdrew again within the limits of what their church defined as orthodox  thus roger chillingworth scrutinised his patient carefully both as he saw him in his ordinary life keeping an accustomed pathway in the range of thoughts familiar to him and as he appeared when thrown amidst other moral scenery the novelty of which might call out something new to the surface of his character  he deemed it essential it would seem to know the man before attempting to do him good  wherever there is a heart and an intellect the diseases of the physical frame are tinged with the peculiarities of these  in arthur dimmesdale thought and imagination were so active and sensibility so intense that the bodily infirmity would be likely to have its groundwork there  so roger chillingworththe man of skill the kind and friendly physicianstrove to go deep into his patients bosom delving among his principles prying into his recollections and probing everything with a cautious touch like a treasureseeker in a dark cavern  few secrets can escape an investigator who has opportunity and licence to undertake such a quest and skill to follow it up  a man burdened with a secret should especially avoid the intimacy of his physician  if the latter possess native sagacity and a nameless something morelet us call it intuition if he show no intrusive egotism nor disagreeable prominent characteristics of his own if he have the power which must be born with him to bring his mind into such affinity with his patients that this last shall unawares have spoken what he imagines himself only to have thought if such revelations be received without tumult and acknowledged not so often by an uttered sympathy as by silence an inarticulate breath and here and there a word to indicate that all is understood if to these qualifications of a confidant be joined the advantages afforded by his recognised character as a physicianthen at some inevitable moment will the soul of the sufferer be dissolved and flow forth in a dark but transparent stream bringing all its mysteries into the daylight  roger chillingworth possessed all or most of the attributes above enumerated  nevertheless time went on a kind of intimacy as we have said grew up between these two cultivated minds which had as wide a field as the whole sphere of human thought and study to meet upon they discussed every topic of ethics and religion of public affairs and private character they talked much on both sides of matters that seemed personal to themselves and yet no secret such as the physician fancied must exist there ever stole out of the ministers consciousness into his companions ear  the latter had his suspicions indeed that even the nature of mr dimmesdales bodily disease had never fairly been revealed to him  it was a strange reserve  after a time at a hint from roger chillingworth the friends of mr dimmesdale effected an arrangement by which the two were lodged in the same house so that every ebb and flow of the ministers lifetide might pass under the eye of his anxious and attached physician  there was much joy throughout the town when this greatly desirable object was attained  it was held to be the best possible measure for the young clergymans welfare unless indeed as often urged by such as felt authorised to do so he had selected some one of the many blooming damsels spiritually devoted to him to become his devoted wife  this latter step however there was no present prospect that arthur dimmesdale would be prevailed upon to take he rejected all suggestions of the kind as if priestly celibacy were one of his articles of church discipline  doomed by his own choice therefore as mr dimmesdale so evidently was to eat his unsavoury morsel always at anothers board and endure the lifelong chill which must be his lot who seeks to warm himself only at anothers fireside it truly seemed that this sagacious experienced benevolent old physician with his concord of paternal and reverential love for the young pastor was the very man of all mankind to be constantly within reach of his voice  the new abode of the two friends was with a pious widow of good social rank who dwelt in a house covering pretty nearly the site on which the venerable structure of kings chapel has since been built  it had the graveyard originally isaac johnsons homefield on one side and so was well adapted to call up serious reflections suited to their respective employments in both minister and man of physic  the motherly care of the good widow assigned to mr dimmesdale a front apartment with a sunny exposure and heavy windowcurtains to create a noontide shadow when desirable  the walls were hung round with tapestry said to be from the gobelin looms and at all events representing the scriptural story of david and bathsheba and nathan the prophet in colours still unfaded but which made the fair woman of the scene almost as grimly picturesque as the woedenouncing seer here the pale clergyman piled up his library rich with parchmentbound folios of the fathers and the lore of rabbis and monkish erudition of which the protestant divines even while they vilified and decried that class of writers were yet constrained often to avail themselves  on the other side of the house old roger chillingworth arranged his study and laboratory not such as a modern man of science would reckon even tolerably complete but provided with a distilling apparatus and the means of compounding drugs and chemicals which the practised alchemist knew well how to turn to purpose with such commodiousness of situation these two learned persons sat themselves down each in his own domain yet familiarly passing from one apartment to the other and bestowing a mutual and not incurious inspection into one anothers business  and the reverend arthur dimmesdales best discerning friends as we have intimated very reasonably imagined that the hand of providence had done all this for the purposebesought in so many public and domestic and secret prayersof restoring the young minister to health  but it must now be said another portion of the community had latterly begun to take its own view of the relation betwixt mr dimmesdale and the mysterious old physician  when an uninstructed multitude attempts to see with its eyes it is exceedingly apt to be deceived  when however it forms its judgment as it usually does on the intuitions of its great and warm heart the conclusions thus attained are often so profound and so unerring as to possess the character of truth supernaturally revealed  the people in the case of which we speak could justify its prejudice against roger chillingworth by no fact or argument worthy of serious refutation  there was an aged handicraftsman it is true who had been a citizen of london at the period of sir thomas overburys murder now some thirty years agone he testified to having seen the physician under some other name which the narrator of the story had now forgotten in company with dr forman the famous old conjurer who was implicated in the affair of overbury  two or three individuals hinted that the man of skill during his indian captivity had enlarged his medical attainments by joining in the incantations of the savage priests who were universally acknowledged to be powerful enchanters often performing seemingly miraculous cures by their skill in the black art  a large numberand many of these were persons of such sober sense and practical observation that their opinions would have been valuable in other mattersaffirmed that roger chillingworths aspect had undergone a remarkable change while he had dwelt in town and especially since his abode with mr dimmesdale  at first his expression had been calm meditative scholarlike  now there was something ugly and evil in his face which they had not previously noticed and which grew still the more obvious to sight the oftener they looked upon him  according to the vulgar idea the fire in his laboratory had been brought from the lower regions and was fed with infernal fuel and so as might be expected his visage was getting sooty with the smoke  to sum up the matter it grew to be a widely diffused opinion that the rev  arthur dimmesdale like many other personages of special sanctity in all ages of the christian world was haunted either by satan himself or satans emissary in the guise of old roger chillingworth  this diabolical agent had the divine permission for a season to burrow into the clergymans intimacy and plot against his soul  no sensible man it was confessed could doubt on which side the victory would turn  the people looked with an unshaken hope to see the minister come forth out of the conflict transfigured with the glory which he would unquestionably win  meanwhile nevertheless it was sad to think of the perchance mortal agony through which he must struggle towards his triumph  alas  to judge from the gloom and terror in the depth of the poor ministers eyes the battle was a sore one and the victory anything but secure    x  the leech and his patient  old roger chillingworth throughout life had been calm in temperament kindly though not of warm affections but ever and in all his relations with the world a pure and upright man he had begun an investigation as he imagined with the severe and equal integrity of a judge desirous only of truth even as if the question involved no more than the airdrawn lines and figures of a geometrical problem instead of human passions and wrongs inflicted on himself  but as he proceeded a terrible fascination a kind of fierce though still calm necessity seized the old man within its gripe and never set him free again until he had done all its bidding  he now dug into the poor clergymans heart like a miner searching for gold or rather like a sexton delving into a grave possibly in quest of a jewel that had been buried on the dead mans bosom but likely to find nothing save mortality and corruption  alas for his own soul if these were what he sought  sometimes a light glimmered out of the physicians eyes burning blue and ominous like the reflection of a furnace or let us say like one of those gleams of ghastly fire that darted from bunyans awful doorway in the hillside and quivered on the pilgrims face  the soil where this dark miner was working had perchance shown indications that encouraged him  this man said he at one such moment to himself pure as they deem himall spiritual as he seemshath inherited a strong animal nature from his father or his mother  let us dig a little further in the direction of this vein  then after long search into the ministers dim interior and turning over many precious materials in the shape of high aspirations for the welfare of his race warm love of souls pure sentiments natural piety strengthened by thought and study and illuminated by revelationall of which invaluable gold was perhaps no better than rubbish to the seekerhe would turn back discouraged and begin his quest towards another point  he groped along as stealthily with as cautious a tread and as wary an outlook as a thief entering a chamber where a man lies only half asleepor it may be broad awakewith purpose to steal the very treasure which this man guards as the apple of his eye  in spite of his premeditated carefulness the floor would now and then creak his garments would rustle the shadow of his presence in a forbidden proximity would be thrown across his victim  in other words mr dimmesdale whose sensibility of nerve often produced the effect of spiritual intuition would become vaguely aware that something inimical to his peace had thrust itself into relation with him  but old roger chillingworth too had perceptions that were almost intuitive and when the minister threw his startled eyes towards him there the physician sat his kind watchful sympathising but never intrusive friend  yet mr dimmesdale would perhaps have seen this individuals character more perfectly if a certain morbidness to which sick hearts are liable had not rendered him suspicious of all mankind  trusting no man as his friend he could not recognize his enemy when the latter actually appeared  he therefore still kept up a familiar intercourse with him daily receiving the old physician in his study or visiting the laboratory and for recreations sake watching the processes by which weeds were converted into drugs of potency  one day leaning his forehead on his hand and his elbow on the sill of the open window that looked towards the graveyard he talked with roger chillingworth while the old man was examining a bundle of unsightly plants  where asked he with a look askance at themfor it was the clergymans peculiarity that he seldom nowadays looked straight forth at any object whether human or inanimate where my kind doctor did you gather those herbs with such a dark flabby leaf  even in the graveyard here at hand answered the physician continuing his employment  they are new to me  i found them growing on a grave which bore no tombstone no other memorial of the dead man save these ugly weeds that have taken upon themselves to keep him in remembrance  they grew out of his heart and typify it may be some hideous secret that was buried with him and which he had done better to confess during his lifetime  perchance said mr dimmesdale he earnestly desired it but could not  and wherefore rejoined the physician  wherefore not since all the powers of nature call so earnestly for the confession of sin that these black weeds have sprung up out of a buried heart to make manifest an outspoken crime  that good sir is but a phantasy of yours replied the minister  there can be if i forbode aright no power short of the divine mercy to disclose whether by uttered words or by type or emblem the secrets that may be buried in the human heart  the heart making itself guilty of such secrets must perforce hold them until the day when all hidden things shall be revealed  nor have i so read or interpreted holy writ as to understand that the disclosure of human thoughts and deeds then to be made is intended as a part of the retribution  that surely were a shallow view of it  no these revelations unless i greatly err are meant merely to promote the intellectual satisfaction of all intelligent beings who will stand waiting on that day to see the dark problem of this life made plain  a knowledge of mens hearts will be needful to the completest solution of that problem  and i conceive moreover that the hearts holding such miserable secrets as you speak of will yield them up at that last day not with reluctance but with a joy unutterable  then why not reveal it here asked roger chillingworth glancing quietly aside at the minister  why should not the guilty ones sooner avail themselves of this unutterable solace  they mostly do said the clergyman griping hard at his breast as if afflicted with an importunate throb of pain many many a poor soul hath given its confidence to me not only on the deathbed but while strong in life and fair in reputation  and ever after such an outpouring oh what a relief have i witnessed in those sinful brethren even as in one who at last draws free air after a long stifling with his own polluted breath  how can it be otherwise  why should a wretched manguilty we will say of murderprefer to keep the dead corpse buried in his own heart rather than fling it forth at once and let the universe take care of it  yet some men bury their secrets thus observed the calm physician  true there are such men answered mr dimmesdale  but not to suggest more obvious reasons it may be that they are kept silent by the very constitution of their nature  orcan we not suppose itguilty as they may be retaining nevertheless a zeal for gods glory and mans welfare they shrink from displaying themselves black and filthy in the view of men because thenceforward no good can be achieved by them no evil of the past be redeemed by better service  so to their own unutterable torment they go about among their fellowcreatures looking pure as newfallen snow while their hearts are all speckled and spotted with iniquity of which they cannot rid themselves  these men deceive themselves said roger chillingworth with somewhat more emphasis than usual and making a slight gesture with his forefinger  they fear to take up the shame that rightfully belongs to them  their love for man their zeal for gods servicethese holy impulses may or may not coexist in their hearts with the evil inmates to which their guilt has unbarred the door and which must needs propagate a hellish breed within them  but if they seek to glorify god let them not lift heavenward their unclean hands  if they would serve their fellowmen let them do it by making manifest the power and reality of conscience in constraining them to penitential selfabasement  would thou have me to believe o wise and pious friend that a false show can be bettercan be more for gods glory or man welfarethan gods own truth  trust me such men deceive themselves  it may be so said the young clergyman indifferently as waiving a discussion that he considered irrelevant or unseasonable  he had a ready faculty indeed of escaping from any topic that agitated his too sensitive and nervous temperamentbut now i would ask of my wellskilled physician whether in good sooth he deems me to have profited by his kindly care of this weak frame of mine  before roger chillingworth could answer they heard the clear wild laughter of a young childs voice proceeding from the adjacent burialground  looking instinctively from the open windowfor it was summertimethe minister beheld hester prynne and little pearl passing along the footpath that traversed the enclosure  pearl looked as beautiful as the day but was in one of those moods of perverse merriment which whenever they occurred seemed to remove her entirely out of the sphere of sympathy or human contact  she now skipped irreverently from one grave to another until coming to the broad flat armorial tombstone of a departed worthyperhaps of isaac johnson himselfshe began to dance upon it  in reply to her mothers command and entreaty that she would behave more decorously little pearl paused to gather the prickly burrs from a tall burdock which grew beside the tomb  taking a handful of these she arranged them along the lines of the scarlet letter that decorated the maternal bosom to which the burrs as their nature was tenaciously adhered  hester did not pluck them off  roger chillingworth had by this time approached the window and smiled grimly down  there is no law nor reverence for authority no regard for human ordinances or opinions right or wrong mixed up with that childs composition remarked he as much to himself as to his companion  i saw her the other day bespatter the governor himself with water at the cattletrough in spring lane  what in heavens name is she  is the imp altogether evil  hath she affections  hath she any discoverable principle of being  none save the freedom of a broken law answered mr dimmesdale in a quiet way as if he had been discussing the point within himself whether capable of good i know not  the child probably overheard their voices for looking up to the window with a bright but naughty smile of mirth and intelligence she threw one of the prickly burrs at the rev  mr dimmesdale  the sensitive clergyman shrank with nervous dread from the light missile  detecting his emotion pearl clapped her little hands in the most extravagant ecstacy  hester prynne likewise had involuntarily looked up and all these four persons old and young regarded one another in silence till the child laughed aloud and shoutedcome away mother  come away or yonder old black man will catch you  he hath got hold of the minister already  come away mother or he will catch you but he cannot catch little pearl  so she drew her mother away skipping dancing and frisking fantastically among the hillocks of the dead people like a creature that had nothing in common with a bygone and buried generation nor owned herself akin to it  it was as if she had been made afresh out of new elements and must perforce be permitted to live her own life and be a law unto herself without her eccentricities being reckoned to her for a crime  there goes a woman resumed roger chillingworth after a pause who be her demerits what they may hath none of that mystery of hidden sinfulness which you deem so grievous to be borne  is hester prynne the less miserable think you for that scarlet letter on her breast  i do verily believe it answered the clergyman nevertheless i cannot answer for her  there was a look of pain in her face which i would gladly have been spared the sight of but still methinks it must needs be better for the sufferer to be free to show his pain as this poor woman hester is than to cover it up in his heart  there was another pause and the physician began anew to examine and arrange the plants which he had gathered  you inquired of me a little time agone said he at length my judgment as touching your health  i did answered the clergyman and would gladly learn it speak frankly i pray you be it for life or death  freely then and plainly said the physician still busy with his plants but keeping a wary eye on mr dimmesdale the disorder is a strange one not so much in itself nor as outwardly manifestedin so far at least as the symptoms have been laid open to my observation  looking daily at you my good sir and watching the tokens of your aspect now for months gone by i should deem you a man sore sick it may be yet not so sick but that an instructed and watchful physician might well hope to cure you  but i know not what to say the disease is what i seem to know yet know it not  you speak in riddles learned sir said the pale minister glancing aside out of the window  then to speak more plainly continued the physician and i crave pardon sir should it seem to require pardon for this needful plainness of my speech  let me ask as your friend as one having charge under providence of your life and physical well being hath all the operations of this disorder been fairly laid open and recounted to me  how can you question it asked the minister  surely it were childs play to call in a physician and then hide the sore  you would tell me then that i know all said roger chillingworth deliberately and fixing an eye bright with intense and concentrated intelligence on the ministers face be it so  but again  he to whom only the outward and physical evil is laid open knoweth oftentimes but half the evil which he is called upon to cure  a bodily disease which we look upon as whole and entire within itself may after all be but a symptom of some ailment in the spiritual part  your pardon once again good sir if my speech give the shadow of offence  you sir of all men whom i have known are he whose body is the closest conjoined and imbued and identified so to speak with the spirit whereof it is the instrument  then i need ask no further said the clergyman somewhat hastily rising from his chair  you deal not i take it in medicine for the soul  thus a sickness continued roger chillingworth going on in an unaltered tone without heeding the interruption but standing up and confronting the emaciated and whitecheeked minister with his low dark and misshapen figurea sickness a sore place if we may so call it in your spirit hath immediately its appropriate manifestation in your bodily frame  would you therefore that your physician heal the bodily evil  how may this be unless you first lay open to him the wound or trouble in your soul  no not to thee  not to an earthly physician cried mr dimmesdale passionately and turning his eyes full and bright and with a kind of fierceness on old roger chillingworth  not to thee  but if it be the souls disease then do i commit myself to the one physician of the soul  he if it stand with his good pleasure can cure or he can kill  let him do with me as in his justice and wisdom he shall see good  but who art thou that meddlest in this matter that dares thrust himself between the sufferer and his god  with a frantic gesture he rushed out of the room  it is as well to have made this step said roger chillingworth to himself looking after the minister with a grave smile there is nothing lost  we shall be friends again anon  but see now how passion takes hold upon this man and hurrieth him out of himself  as with one passion so with another  he hath done a wild thing ere now this pious master dimmesdale in the hot passion of his heart  it proved not difficult to reestablish the intimacy of the two companions on the same footing and in the same degree as heretofore  the young clergyman after a few hours of privacy was sensible that the disorder of his nerves had hurried him into an unseemly outbreak of temper which there had been nothing in the physicians words to excuse or palliate  he marvelled indeed at the violence with which he had thrust back the kind old man when merely proffering the advice which it was his duty to bestow and which the minister himself had expressly sought  with these remorseful feelings he lost no time in making the amplest apologies and besought his friend still to continue the care which if not successful in restoring him to health had in all probability been the means of prolonging his feeble existence to that hour  roger chillingworth readily assented and went on with his medical supervision of the minister doing his best for him in all good faith but always quitting the patients apartment at the close of the professional interview with a mysterious and puzzled smile upon his lips  this expression was invisible in mr dimmesdales presence but grew strongly evident as the physician crossed the threshold  a rare case he muttered  i must needs look deeper into it a strange sympathy betwixt soul and body  were it only for the arts sake i must search this matter to the bottom  it came to pass not long after the scene above recorded that the reverend mr dimmesdale noonday and entirely unawares fell into a deep deep slumber sitting in his chair with a large blackletter volume open before him on the table  it must have been a work of vast ability in the somniferous school of literature  the profound depth of the ministers repose was the more remarkable inasmuch as he was one of those persons whose sleep ordinarily is as light as fitful and as easily scared away as a small bird hopping on a twig  to such an unwonted remoteness however had his spirit now withdrawn into itself that he stirred not in his chair when old roger chillingworth without any extraordinary precaution came into the room  the physician advanced directly in front of his patient laid his hand upon his bosom and thrust aside the vestment that hitherto had always covered it even from the professional eye  then indeed mr dimmesdale shuddered and slightly stirred  after a brief pause the physician turned away  but with what a wild look of wonder joy and horror  with what a ghastly rapture as it were too mighty to be expressed only by the eye and features and therefore bursting forth through the whole ugliness of his figure and making itself even riotously manifest by the extravagant gestures with which he threw up his arms towards the ceiling and stamped his foot upon the floor  had a man seen old roger chillingworth at that moment of his ecstasy he would have had no need to ask how satan comports himself when a precious human soul is lost to heaven and won into his kingdom  but what distinguished the physicians ecstasy from satans was the trait of wonder in it    xi  the interior of a heart  after the incident last described the intercourse between the clergyman and the physician though externally the same was really of another character than it had previously been  the intellect of roger chillingworth had now a sufficiently plain path before it  it was not indeed precisely that which he had laid out for himself to tread  calm gentle passionless as he appeared there was yet we fear a quiet depth of malice hitherto latent but active now in this unfortunate old man which led him to imagine a more intimate revenge than any mortal had ever wreaked upon an enemy  to make himself the one trusted friend to whom should be confided all the fear the remorse the agony the ineffectual repentance the backward rush of sinful thoughts expelled in vain  all that guilty sorrow hidden from the world whose great heart would have pitied and forgiven to be revealed to him the pitilessto him the unforgiving  all that dark treasure to be lavished on the very man to whom nothing else could so adequately pay the debt of vengeance  the clergymans shy and sensitive reserve had balked this scheme  roger chillingworth however was inclined to be hardly if at all less satisfied with the aspect of affairs which providenceusing the avenger and his victim for its own purposes and perchance pardoning where it seemed most to punishhad substituted for his black devices  a revelation he could almost say had been granted to him  it mattered little for his object whether celestial or from what other region  by its aid in all the subsequent relations betwixt him and mr dimmesdale not merely the external presence but the very inmost soul of the latter seemed to be brought out before his eyes so that he could see and comprehend its every movement  he became thenceforth not a spectator only but a chief actor in the poor ministers interior world  he could play upon him as he chose  would he arouse him with a throb of agony  the victim was for ever on the rack it needed only to know the spring that controlled the engine and the physician knew it well  would he startle him with sudden fear  as at the waving of a magicians wand up rose a grisly phantomup rose a thousand phantomsin many shapes of death or more awful shame all flocking round about the clergyman and pointing with their fingers at his breast  all this was accomplished with a subtlety so perfect that the minister though he had constantly a dim perception of some evil influence watching over him could never gain a knowledge of its actual nature  true he looked doubtfully fearfullyeven at times with horror and the bitterness of hatredat the deformed figure of the old physician  his gestures his gait his grizzled beard his slightest and most indifferent acts the very fashion of his garments were odious in the clergymans sight a token implicitly to be relied on of a deeper antipathy in the breast of the latter than he was willing to acknowledge to himself  for as it was impossible to assign a reason for such distrust and abhorrence so mr dimmesdale conscious that the poison of one morbid spot was infecting his hearts entire substance attributed all his presentiments to no other cause he took himself to task for his bad sympathies in reference to roger chillingworth disregarded the lesson that he should have drawn from them and did his best to root them out  unable to accomplish this he nevertheless as a matter of principle continued his habits of social familiarity with the old man and thus gave him constant opportunities for perfecting the purpose to whichpoor forlorn creature that he was and more wretched than his victimthe avenger had devoted himself  while thus suffering under bodily disease and gnawed and tortured by some black trouble of the soul and given over to the machinations of his deadliest enemy the reverend mr dimmesdale had achieved a brilliant popularity in his sacred office  he won it indeed in great part by his sorrows  his intellectual gifts his moral perceptions his power of experiencing and communicating emotion were kept in a state of preternatural activity by the prick and anguish of his daily life  his fame though still on its upward slope already overshadowed the soberer reputations of his fellowclergymen eminent as several of them were  there are scholars among them who had spent more years in acquiring abstruse lore connected with the divine profession than mr dimmesdale had lived and who might well therefore be more profoundly versed in such solid and valuable attainments than their youthful brother there were men too of a sturdier texture of mind than his and endowed with a far greater share of shrewd hard iron or granite understanding which duly mingled with a fair proportion of doctrinal ingredient constitutes a highly respectable efficacious and unamiable variety of the clerical species  there were others again true saintly fathers whose faculties had been elaborated by weary toil among their books and by patient thought and etherealised moreover by spiritual communications with the better world into which their purity of life had almost introduced these holy personages with their garments of mortality still clinging to them  all that they lacked was the gift that descended upon the chosen disciples at pentecost in tongues of flame symbolising it would seem not the power of speech in foreign and unknown languages but that of addressing the whole human brotherhood in the hearts native language  these fathers otherwise so apostolic lacked heavens last and rarest attestation of their office the tongue of flame  they would have vainly soughthad they ever dreamed of seekingto express the highest truths through the humblest medium of familiar words and images  their voices came down afar and indistinctly from the upper heights where they habitually dwelt  not improbably it was to this latter class of men that mr dimmesdale by many of his traits of character naturally belonged  to the high mountain peaks of faith and sanctity he would have climbed had not the tendency been thwarted by the burden whatever it might be of crime or anguish beneath which it was his doom to totter  it kept him down on a level with the lowest him the man of ethereal attributes whose voice the angels might else have listened to and answered  but this very burden it was that gave him sympathies so intimate with the sinful brotherhood of mankind so that his heart vibrated in unison with theirs and received their pain into itself and sent its own throb of pain through a thousand other hearts in gushes of sad persuasive eloquence  oftenest persuasive but sometimes terrible  the people knew not the power that moved them thus they deemed the young clergyman a miracle of holiness  they fancied him the mouthpiece of heavens messages of wisdom and rebuke and love  in their eyes the very ground on which he trod was sanctified  the virgins of his church grew pale around him victims of a passion so imbued with religious sentiment that they imagined it to be all religion and brought it openly in their white bosoms as their most acceptable sacrifice before the altar  the aged members of his flock beholding mr dimmesdales frame so feeble while they were themselves so rugged in their infirmity believed that he would go heavenward before them and enjoined it upon their children that their old bones should be buried close to their young pastors holy grave and all this time perchance when poor mr dimmesdale was thinking of his grave he questioned with himself whether the grass would ever grow on it because an accursed thing must there be buried  it is inconceivable the agony with which this public veneration tortured him  it was his genuine impulse to adore the truth and to reckon all things shadowlike and utterly devoid of weight or value that had not its divine essence as the life within their life  then what was hea substanceor the dimmest of all shadows  he longed to speak out from his own pulpit at the full height of his voice and tell the people what he was  i whom you behold in these black garments of the priesthoodi who ascend the sacred desk and turn my pale face heavenward taking upon myself to hold communion in your behalf with the most high omnisciencei in whose daily life you discern the sanctity of enochi whose footsteps as you suppose leave a gleam along my earthly track whereby the pilgrims that shall come after me may be guided to the regions of the blesti who have laid the hand of baptism upon your childreni who have breathed the parting prayer over your dying friends to whom the amen sounded faintly from a world which they had quittedi your pastor whom you so reverence and trust am utterly a pollution and a lie  more than once mr dimmesdale had gone into the pulpit with a purpose never to come down its steps until he should have spoken words like the above  more than once he had cleared his throat and drawn in the long deep and tremulous breath which when sent forth again would come burdened with the black secret of his soul  more than oncenay more than a hundred timeshe had actually spoken  spoken  but how  he had told his hearers that he was altogether vile a viler companion of the vilest the worst of sinners an abomination a thing of unimaginable iniquity and that the only wonder was that they did not see his wretched body shrivelled up before their eyes by the burning wrath of the almighty  could there be plainer speech than this would not the people start up in their seats by a simultaneous impulse and tear him down out of the pulpit which he defiled not so indeed  they heard it all and did but reverence him the more  they little guessed what deadly purport lurked in those selfcondemning words  the godly youth said they among themselves  the saint on earth  alas if he discern such sinfulness in his own white soul what horrid spectacle would he behold in thine or mine  the minister well knewsubtle but remorseful hypocrite that he wasthe light in which his vague confession would be viewed  he had striven to put a cheat upon himself by making the avowal of a guilty conscience but had gained only one other sin and a selfacknowledged shame without the momentary relief of being selfdeceived  he had spoken the very truth and transformed it into the veriest falsehood  and yet by the constitution of his nature he loved the truth and loathed the lie as few men ever did  therefore above all things else he loathed his miserable self  his inward trouble drove him to practices more in accordance with the old corrupted faith of rome than with the better light of the church in which he had been born and bred  in mr dimmesdales secret closet under lock and key there was a bloody scourge  oftentimes this protestant and puritan divine had plied it on his own shoulders laughing bitterly at himself the while and smiting so much the more pitilessly because of that bitter laugh  it was his custom too as it has been that of many other pious puritans to fastnot however like them in order to purify the body and render it the fitter medium of celestial illuminationbut rigorously and until his knees trembled beneath him as an act of penance  he kept vigils likewise night after night sometimes in utter darkness sometimes with a glimmering lamp and sometimes viewing his own face in a lookingglass by the most powerful light which he could throw upon it  he thus typified the constant introspection wherewith he tortured but could not purify himself  in these lengthened vigils his brain often reeled and visions seemed to flit before him perhaps seen doubtfully and by a faint light of their own in the remote dimness of the chamber or more vividly and close beside him within the lookingglass  now it was a herd of diabolic shapes that grinned and mocked at the pale minister and beckoned him away with them now a group of shining angels who flew upward heavily as sorrowladen but grew more ethereal as they rose  now came the dead friends of his youth and his whitebearded father with a saintlike frown and his mother turning her face away as she passed by ghost of a motherthinnest fantasy of a mothermethinks she might yet have thrown a pitying glance towards her son  and now through the chamber which these spectral thoughts had made so ghastly glided hester prynne leading along little pearl in her scarlet garb and pointing her forefinger first at the scarlet letter on her bosom and then at the clergymans own breast  none of these visions ever quite deluded him  at any moment by an effort of his will he could discern substances through their misty lack of substance and convince himself that they were not solid in their nature like yonder table of carved oak or that big square leatherbound and brazenclasped volume of divinity  but for all that they were in one sense the truest and most substantial things which the poor minister now dealt with  it is the unspeakable misery of a life so false as his that it steals the pith and substance out of whatever realities there are around us and which were meant by heaven to be the spirits joy and nutriment  to the untrue man the whole universe is falseit is impalpableit shrinks to nothing within his grasp  and he himself in so far as he shows himself in a false light becomes a shadow or indeed ceases to exist the only truth that continued to give mr dimmesdale a real existence on this earth was the anguish in his inmost soul and the undissembled expression of it in his aspect  had he once found power to smile and wear a face of gaiety there would have been no such man  on one of those ugly nights which we have faintly hinted at but forborne to picture forth the minister started from his chair  a new thought had struck him  there might be a moments peace in it  attiring himself with as much care as if it had been for public worship and precisely in the same manner he stole softly down the staircase undid the door and issued forth    xii  the ministers vigil  walking in the shadow of a dream as it were and perhaps actually under the influence of a species of somnambulism mr dimmesdale reached the spot where now so long since hester prynne had lived through her first hours of public ignominy  the same platform or scaffold black and weatherstained with the storm or sunshine of seven long years and footworn too with the tread of many culprits who had since ascended it remained standing beneath the balcony of the meetinghouse  the minister went up the steps  it was an obscure night in early may  an unvaried pall of cloud muffled the whole expanse of sky from zenith to horizon if the same multitude which had stood as eyewitnesses while hester prynne sustained her punishment could now have been summoned forth they would have discerned no face above the platform nor hardly the outline of a human shape in the dark grey of the midnight  but the town was all asleep  there was no peril of discovery  the minister might stand there if it so pleased him until morning should redden in the east without other risk than that the dank and chill night air would creep into his frame and stiffen his joints with rheumatism and clog his throat with catarrh and cough thereby defrauding the expectant audience of tomorrows prayer and sermon  no eye could see him save that everwakeful one which had seen him in his closet wielding the bloody scourge  why then had he come hither  was it but the mockery of penitence  a mockery indeed but in which his soul trifled with itself  a mockery at which angels blushed and wept while fiends rejoiced with jeering laughter  he had been driven hither by the impulse of that remorse which dogged him everywhere and whose own sister and closely linked companion was that cowardice which invariably drew him back with her tremulous gripe just when the other impulse had hurried him to the verge of a disclosure  poor miserable man what right had infirmity like his to burden itself with crime  crime is for the ironnerved who have their choice either to endure it or if it press too hard to exert their fierce and savage strength for a good purpose and fling it off at once  this feeble and most sensitive of spirits could do neither yet continually did one thing or another which intertwined in the same inextricable knot the agony of heavendefying guilt and vain repentance  and thus while standing on the scaffold in this vain show of expiation mr dimmesdale was overcome with a great horror of mind as if the universe were gazing at a scarlet token on his naked breast right over his heart  on that spot in very truth there was and there had long been the gnawing and poisonous tooth of bodily pain  without any effort of his will or power to restrain himself he shrieked aloud an outcry that went pealing through the night and was beaten back from one house to another and reverberated from the hills in the background as if a company of devils detecting so much misery and terror in it had made a plaything of the sound and were bandying it to and fro  it is done muttered the minister covering his face with his hands  the whole town will awake and hurry forth and find me here  but it was not so  the shriek had perhaps sounded with a far greater power to his own startled ears than it actually possessed  the town did not awake or if it did the drowsy slumberers mistook the cry either for something frightful in a dream or for the noise of witches whose voices at that period were often heard to pass over the settlements or lonely cottages as they rode with satan through the air  the clergyman therefore hearing no symptoms of disturbance uncovered his eyes and looked about him  at one of the chamberwindows of governor bellinghams mansion which stood at some distance on the line of another street he beheld the appearance of the old magistrate himself with a lamp in his hand a white nightcap on his head and a long white gown enveloping his figure  he looked like a ghost evoked unseasonably from the grave  the cry had evidently startled him  at another window of the same house moreover appeared old mistress hibbins the governors sister also with a lamp which even thus far off revealed the expression of her sour and discontented face  she thrust forth her head from the lattice and looked anxiously upward  beyond the shadow of a doubt this venerable witchlady had heard mr dimmesdales outcry and interpreted it with its multitudinous echoes and reverberations as the clamour of the fiends and nighthags with whom she was well known to make excursions in the forest  detecting the gleam of governor bellinghams lamp the old lady quickly extinguished her own and vanished  possibly she went up among the clouds  the minister saw nothing further of her motions  the magistrate after a wary observation of the darknessinto which nevertheless he could see but little further than he might into a millstoneretired from the window  the minister grew comparatively calm  his eyes however were soon greeted by a little glimmering light which at first a long way off was approaching up the street  it threw a gleam of recognition on here a post and there a garden fence and here a latticed windowpane and there a pump with its full trough of water and here again an arched door of oak with an iron knocker and a rough log for the doorstep  the reverend mr dimmesdale noted all these minute particulars even while firmly convinced that the doom of his existence was stealing onward in the footsteps which he now heard and that the gleam of the lantern would fall upon him in a few moments more and reveal his longhidden secret  as the light drew nearer he beheld within its illuminated circle his brother clergymanor to speak more accurately his professional father as well as highly valued friendthe reverend mr wilson who as mr dimmesdale now conjectured had been praying at the bedside of some dying man  and so he had  the good old minister came freshly from the deathchamber of governor winthrop who had passed from earth to heaven within that very hour  and now surrounded like the saintlike personage of olden times with a radiant halo that glorified him amid this gloomy night of sinas if the departed governor had left him an inheritance of his glory or as if he had caught upon himself the distant shine of the celestial city while looking thitherward to see the triumphant pilgrim pass within its gatesnow in short good father wilson was moving homeward aiding his footsteps with a lighted lantern  the glimmer of this luminary suggested the above conceits to mr dimmesdale who smilednay almost laughed at themand then wondered if he was going mad  as the reverend mr wilson passed beside the scaffold closely muffling his geneva cloak about him with one arm and holding the lantern before his breast with the other the minister could hardly restrain himself from speaking  a good evening to you venerable father wilson  come up hither i pray you and pass a pleasant hour with me  good heavens  had mr dimmesdale actually spoken  for one instant he believed that these words had passed his lips  but they were uttered only within his imagination  the venerable father wilson continued to step slowly onward looking carefully at the muddy pathway before his feet and never once turning his head towards the guilty platform  when the light of the glimmering lantern had faded quite away the minister discovered by the faintness which came over him that the last few moments had been a crisis of terrible anxiety although his mind had made an involuntary effort to relieve itself by a kind of lurid playfulness  shortly afterwards the like grisly sense of the humorous again stole in among the solemn phantoms of his thought  he felt his limbs growing stiff with the unaccustomed chilliness of the night and doubted whether he should be able to descend the steps of the scaffold  morning would break and find him there the neighbourhood would begin to rouse itself  the earliest riser coming forth in the dim twilight would perceive a vaguelydefined figure aloft on the place of shame and halfcrazed betwixt alarm and curiosity would go knocking from door to door summoning all the people to behold the ghostas he needs must think itof some defunct transgressor  a dusky tumult would flap its wings from one house to another  thenthe morning light still waxing strongerold patriarchs would rise up in great haste each in his flannel gown and matronly dames without pausing to put off their nightgear  the whole tribe of decorous personages who had never heretofore been seen with a single hair of their heads awry would start into public view with the disorder of a nightmare in their aspects  old governor bellingham would come grimly forth with his king james ruff fastened askew and mistress hibbins with some twigs of the forest clinging to her skirts and looking sourer than ever as having hardly got a wink of sleep after her night ride and good father wilson too after spending half the night at a deathbed and liking ill to be disturbed thus early out of his dreams about the glorified saints  hither likewise would come the elders and deacons of mr dimmesdales church and the young virgins who so idolized their minister and had made a shrine for him in their white bosoms which now bythebye in their hurry and confusion they would scantly have given themselves time to cover with their kerchiefs  all people in a word would come stumbling over their thresholds and turning up their amazed and horrorstricken visages around the scaffold  whom would they discern there with the red eastern light upon his brow  whom but the reverend arthur dimmesdale halffrozen to death overwhelmed with shame and standing where hester prynne had stood  carried away by the grotesque horror of this picture the minister unawares and to his own infinite alarm burst into a great peal of laughter  it was immediately responded to by a light airy childish laugh in which with a thrill of the heartbut he knew not whether of exquisite pain or pleasure as acutehe recognised the tones of little pearl  pearl  little pearl cried he after a moments pause then suppressing his voicehester  hester prynne  are you there  yes it is hester prynne she replied in a tone of surprise and the minister heard her footsteps approaching from the sidewalk along which she had been passing  it is i and my little pearl  whence come you hester asked the minister  what sent you hither  i have been watching at a deathbed answered hester prynne at governor winthrops deathbed and have taken his measure for a robe and am now going homeward to my dwelling  come up hither hester thou and little pearl said the reverend mr dimmesdale  ye have both been here before but i was not with you  come up hither once again and we will stand all three together  she silently ascended the steps and stood on the platform holding little pearl by the hand  the minister felt for the childs other hand and took it  the moment that he did so there came what seemed a tumultuous rush of new life other life than his own pouring like a torrent into his heart and hurrying through all his veins as if the mother and the child were communicating their vital warmth to his halftorpid system  the three formed an electric chain  minister whispered little pearl  what wouldst thou say child asked mr dimmesdale  wilt thou stand here with mother and me tomorrow noontide inquired pearl  nay not so my little pearl answered the minister for with the new energy of the moment all the dread of public exposure that had so long been the anguish of his life had returned upon him and he was already trembling at the conjunction in whichwith a strange joy neverthelesshe now found himselfnot so my child  i shall indeed stand with thy mother and thee one other day but not tomorrow  pearl laughed and attempted to pull away her hand  but the minister held it fast  a moment longer my child said he  but wilt thou promise asked pearl to take my hand and mothers hand tomorrow noontide  not then pearl said the minister but another time  and what other time persisted the child  at the great judgment day whispered the minister and strangely enough the sense that he was a professional teacher of the truth impelled him to answer the child so  then and there before the judgmentseat thy mother and thou and i must stand together  but the daylight of this world shall not see our meeting  pearl laughed again  but before mr dimmesdale had done speaking a light gleamed far and wide over all the muffled sky  it was doubtless caused by one of those meteors which the nightwatcher may so often observe burning out to waste in the vacant regions of the atmosphere  so powerful was its radiance that it thoroughly illuminated the dense medium of cloud betwixt the sky and earth the great vault brightened like the dome of an immense lamp  it showed the familiar scene of the street with the distinctness of midday but also with the awfulness that is always imparted to familiar objects by an unaccustomed light  the wooden houses with their jutting storeys and quaint gablepeaks the doorsteps and thresholds with the early grass springing up about them the gardenplots black with freshlyturned earth the wheeltrack little worn and even in the marketplace margined with green on either sideall were visible but with a singularity of aspect that seemed to give another moral interpretation to the things of this world than they had ever borne before  and there stood the minister with his hand over his heart and hester prynne with the embroidered letter glimmering on her bosom and little pearl herself a symbol and the connecting link between those two  they stood in the noon of that strange and solemn splendour as if it were the light that is to reveal all secrets and the daybreak that shall unite all who belong to one another  there was witchcraft in little pearls eyes and her face as she glanced upward at the minister wore that naughty smile which made its expression frequently so elvish  she withdrew her hand from mr dimmesdales and pointed across the street  but he clasped both his hands over his breast and cast his eyes towards the zenith  nothing was more common in those days than to interpret all meteoric appearances and other natural phenomena that occurred with less regularity than the rise and set of sun and moon as so many revelations from a supernatural source  thus a blazing spear a sword of flame a bow or a sheaf of arrows seen in the midnight sky prefigured indian warfare  pestilence was known to have been foreboded by a shower of crimson light  we doubt whether any marked event for good or evil ever befell new england from its settlement down to revolutionary times of which the inhabitants had not been previously warned by some spectacle of its nature  not seldom it had been seen by multitudes  oftener however its credibility rested on the faith of some lonely eyewitness who beheld the wonder through the coloured magnifying and distorted medium of his imagination and shaped it more distinctly in his afterthought it was indeed a majestic idea that the destiny of nations should be revealed in these awful hieroglyphics on the cope of heaven  a scroll so wide might not be deemed too expensive for providence to write a peoples doom upon  the belief was a favourite one with our forefathers as betokening that their infant commonwealth was under a celestial guardianship of peculiar intimacy and strictness  but what shall we say when an individual discovers a revelation addressed to himself alone on the same vast sheet of record  in such a case it could only be the symptom of a highly disordered mental state when a man rendered morbidly selfcontemplative by long intense and secret pain had extended his egotism over the whole expanse of nature until the firmament itself should appear no more than a fitting page for his souls history and fate  we impute it therefore solely to the disease in his own eye and heart that the minister looking upward to the zenith beheld there the appearance of an immense letterthe letter amarked out in lines of dull red light  not but the meteor may have shown itself at that point burning duskily through a veil of cloud but with no such shape as his guilty imagination gave it or at least with so little definiteness that anothers guilt might have seen another symbol in it  there was a singular circumstance that characterised mr dimmesdales psychological state at this moment  all the time that he gazed upward to the zenith he was nevertheless perfectly aware that little pearl was pointing her finger towards old roger chillingworth who stood at no great distance from the scaffold  the minister appeared to see him with the same glance that discerned the miraculous letter  to his feature as to all other objects the meteoric light imparted a new expression or it might well be that the physician was not careful then as at all other times to hide the malevolence with which he looked upon his victim  certainly if the meteor kindled up the sky and disclosed the earth with an awfulness that admonished hester prynne and the clergyman of the day of judgment then might roger chillingworth have passed with them for the archfiend standing there with a smile and scowl to claim his own  so vivid was the expression or so intense the ministers perception of it that it seemed still to remain painted on the darkness after the meteor had vanished with an effect as if the street and all things else were at once annihilated  who is that man hester gasped mr dimmesdale overcome with terror  i shiver at him  dost thou know the man  i hate him hester  she remembered her oath and was silent  i tell thee my soul shivers at him muttered the minister again  who is he  who is he  canst thou do nothing for me  i have a nameless horror of the man  minister said little pearl i can tell thee who he is  quickly then child said the minister bending his ear close to her lips  quickly and as low as thou canst whisper  pearl mumbled something into his ear that sounded indeed like human language but was only such gibberish as children may be heard amusing themselves with by the hour together  at all events if it involved any secret information in regard to old roger chillingworth it was in a tongue unknown to the erudite clergyman and did but increase the bewilderment of his mind the elvish child then laughed aloud  dost thou mock me now said the minister  thou wast not boldthou wast not true answered the child thou wouldst not promise to take my hand and mothers hand tomorrow noontide  worthy sir answered the physician who had now advanced to the foot of the platformpious master dimmesdale can this be you  well well indeed  we men of study whose heads are in our books have need to be straitly looked after  we dream in our waking moments and walk in our sleep  come good sir and my dear friend i pray you let me lead you home  how knewest thou that i was here asked the minister fearfully  verily and in good faith answered roger chillingworth i knew nothing of the matter  i had spent the better part of the night at the bedside of the worshipful governor winthrop doing what my poor skill might to give him ease  he going home to a better world i likewise was on my way homeward when this light shone out  come with me i beseech you reverend sir else you will be poorly able to do sabbath duty tomorrow  aha see now how they trouble the brainthese booksthese books  you should study less good sir and take a little pastime or these night whimsies will grow upon you  i will go home with you said mr dimmesdale  with a chill despondency like one awakening all nerveless from an ugly dream he yielded himself to the physician and was led away  the next day however being the sabbath he preached a discourse which was held to be the richest and most powerful and the most replete with heavenly influences that had ever proceeded from his lips  souls it is said more souls than one were brought to the truth by the efficacy of that sermon and vowed within themselves to cherish a holy gratitude towards mr dimmesdale throughout the long hereafter  but as he came down the pulpit steps the greybearded sexton met him holding up a black glove which the minister recognised as his own  it was found said the sexton this morning on the scaffold where evildoers are set up to public shame  satan dropped it there i take it intending a scurrilous jest against your reverence  but indeed he was blind and foolish as he ever and always is  a pure hand needs no glove to cover it  thank you my good friend said the minister gravely but startled at heart for so confused was his remembrance that he had almost brought himself to look at the events of the past night as visionary  yes it seems to be my glove indeed  and since satan saw fit to steal it your reverence must needs handle him without gloves henceforward remarked the old sexton grimly smiling  but did your reverence hear of the portent that was seen last night a great red letter in the skythe letter a which we interpret to stand for angel  for as our good governor winthrop was made an angel this past night it was doubtless held fit that there should be some notice thereof  no answered the minister i had not heard of it    xiii  another view of hester  in her late singular interview with mr dimmesdale hester prynne was shocked at the condition to which she found the clergyman reduced  his nerve seemed absolutely destroyed  his moral force was abased into more than childish weakness  it grovelled helpless on the ground even while his intellectual faculties retained their pristine strength or had perhaps acquired a morbid energy which disease only could have given them  with her knowledge of a train of circumstances hidden from all others she could readily infer that besides the legitimate action of his own conscience a terrible machinery had been brought to bear and was still operating on mr dimmesdales wellbeing and repose  knowing what this poor fallen man had once been her whole soul was moved by the shuddering terror with which he had appealed to herthe outcast womanfor support against his instinctively discovered enemy  she decided moreover that he had a right to her utmost aid  little accustomed in her long seclusion from society to measure her ideas of right and wrong by any standard external to herself hester sawor seemed to seethat there lay a responsibility upon her in reference to the clergyman which she owned to no other nor to the whole world besides  the links that united her to the rest of humankindlinks of flowers or silk or gold or whatever the materialhad all been broken  here was the iron link of mutual crime which neither he nor she could break  like all other ties it brought along with it its obligations  hester prynne did not now occupy precisely the same position in which we beheld her during the earlier periods of her ignominy years had come and gone  pearl was now seven years old  her mother with the scarlet letter on her breast glittering in its fantastic embroidery had long been a familiar object to the townspeople  as is apt to be the case when a person stands out in any prominence before the community and at the same time interferes neither with public nor individual interests and convenience a species of general regard had ultimately grown up in reference to hester prynne  it is to the credit of human nature that except where its selfishness is brought into play it loves more readily than it hates  hatred by a gradual and quiet process will even be transformed to love unless the change be impeded by a continually new irritation of the original feeling of hostility  in this matter of hester prynne there was neither irritation nor irksomeness  she never battled with the public but submitted uncomplainingly to its worst usage she made no claim upon it in requital for what she suffered she did not weigh upon its sympathies  then also the blameless purity of her life during all these years in which she had been set apart to infamy was reckoned largely in her favour with nothing now to lose in the sight of mankind and with no hope and seemingly no wish of gaining anything it could only be a genuine regard for virtue that had brought back the poor wanderer to its paths  it was perceived too that while hester never put forward even the humblest title to share in the worlds privilegesfurther than to breathe the common air and earn daily bread for little pearl and herself by the faithful labour of her handsshe was quick to acknowledge her sisterhood with the race of man whenever benefits were to be conferred  none so ready as she to give of her little substance to every demand of poverty even though the bitterhearted pauper threw back a gibe in requital of the food brought regularly to his door or the garments wrought for him by the fingers that could have embroidered a monarchs robe  none so selfdevoted as hester when pestilence stalked through the town  in all seasons of calamity indeed whether general or of individuals the outcast of society at once found her place  she came not as a guest but as a rightful inmate into the household that was darkened by trouble as if its gloomy twilight were a medium in which she was entitled to hold intercourse with her fellowcreature  there glimmered the embroidered letter with comfort in its unearthly ray  elsewhere the token of sin it was the taper of the sick chamber  it had even thrown its gleam in the sufferers bard extremity across the verge of time  it had shown him where to set his foot while the light of earth was fast becoming dim and ere the light of futurity could reach him  in such emergencies hesters nature showed itself warm and richa wellspring of human tenderness unfailing to every real demand and inexhaustible by the largest  her breast with its badge of shame was but the softer pillow for the head that needed one she was selfordained a sister of mercy or we may rather say the worlds heavy hand had so ordained her when neither the world nor she looked forward to this result  the letter was the symbol of her calling  such helpfulness was found in herso much power to do and power to sympathisethat many people refused to interpret the scarlet a by its original signification  they said that it meant abel so strong was hester prynne with a womans strength  it was only the darkened house that could contain her  when sunshine came again she was not there  her shadow had faded across the threshold  the helpful inmate had departed without one backward glance to gather up the meed of gratitude if any were in the hearts of those whom she had served so zealously meeting them in the street she never raised her head to receive their greeting  if they were resolute to accost her she laid her finger on the scarlet letter and passed on  this might be pride but was so like humility that it produced all the softening influence of the latter quality on the public mind the public is despotic in its temper it is capable of denying common justice when too strenuously demanded as a right but quite as frequently it awards more than justice when the appeal is made as despots love to have it made entirely to its generosity  interpreting hester prynnes deportment as an appeal of this nature society was inclined to show its former victim a more benign countenance than she cared to be favoured with or perchance than she deserved  the rulers and the wise and learned men of the community were longer in acknowledging the influence of hesters good qualities than the people  the prejudices which they shared in common with the latter were fortified in themselves by an iron framework of reasoning that made it a far tougher labour to expel them  day by day nevertheless their sour and rigid wrinkles were relaxing into something which in the due course of years might grow to be an expression of almost benevolence  thus it was with the men of rank on whom their eminent position imposed the guardianship of the public morals  individuals in private life meanwhile had quite forgiven hester prynne for her frailty nay more they had begun to look upon the scarlet letter as the token not of that one sin for which she had borne so long and dreary a penance but of her many good deeds since  do you see that woman with the embroidered badge they would say to strangers  it is our hesterthe towns own hesterwho is so kind to the poor so helpful to the sick so comfortable to the afflicted  then it is true the propensity of human nature to tell the very worst of itself when embodied in the person of another would constrain them to whisper the black scandal of bygone years  it was none the less a fact however that in the eyes of the very men who spoke thus the scarlet letter had the effect of the cross on a nuns bosom  it imparted to the wearer a kind of sacredness which enabled her to walk securely amid all peril  had she fallen among thieves it would have kept her safe  it was reported and believed by many that an indian had drawn his arrow against the badge and that the missile struck it and fell harmless to the ground  the effect of the symbolor rather of the position in respect to society that was indicated by iton the mind of hester prynne herself was powerful and peculiar  all the light and graceful foliage of her character had been withered up by this redhot brand and had long ago fallen away leaving a bare and harsh outline which might have been repulsive had she possessed friends or companions to be repelled by it  even the attractiveness of her person had undergone a similar change  it might be partly owing to the studied austerity of her dress and partly to the lack of demonstration in her manners  it was a sad transformation too that her rich and luxuriant hair had either been cut off or was so completely hidden by a cap that not a shining lock of it ever once gushed into the sunshine  it was due in part to all these causes but still more to something else that there seemed to be no longer anything in hesters face for love to dwell upon nothing in hesters form though majestic and statue like that passion would ever dream of clasping in its embrace nothing in hesters bosom to make it ever again the pillow of affection  some attribute had departed from her the permanence of which had been essential to keep her a woman  such is frequently the fate and such the stern development of the feminine character and person when the woman has encountered and lived through an experience of peculiar severity  if she be all tenderness she will die  if she survive the tenderness will either be crushed out of her orand the outward semblance is the samecrushed so deeply into her heart that it can never show itself more  the latter is perhaps the truest theory  she who has once been a woman and ceased to be so might at any moment become a woman again if there were only the magic touch to effect the transformation  we shall see whether hester prynne were ever afterwards so touched and so transfigured  much of the marble coldness of hesters impression was to be attributed to the circumstance that her life had turned in a great measure from passion and feeling to thought  standing alone in the worldalone as to any dependence on society and with little pearl to be guided and protectedalone and hopeless of retrieving her position even had she not scorned to consider it desirableshe cast away the fragment of a broken chain  the worlds law was no law for her mind  it was an age in which the human intellect newly emancipated had taken a more active and a wider range than for many centuries before  men of the sword had overthrown nobles and kings  men bolder than these had overthrown and rearrangednot actually but within the sphere of theory which was their most real abodethe whole system of ancient prejudice wherewith was linked much of ancient principle  hester prynne imbibed this spirit  she assumed a freedom of speculation then common enough on the other side of the atlantic but which our forefathers had they known it would have held to be a deadlier crime than that stigmatised by the scarlet letter  in her lonesome cottage by the seashore thoughts visited her such as dared to enter no other dwelling in new england shadowy guests that would have been as perilous as demons to their entertainer could they have been seen so much as knocking at her door  it is remarkable that persons who speculate the most boldly often conform with the most perfect quietude to the external regulations of society  the thought suffices them without investing itself in the flesh and blood of action  so it seemed to be with hester  yet had little pearl never come to her from the spiritual world it might have been far otherwise  then she might have come down to us in history hand in hand with ann hutchinson as the foundress of a religious sect  she might in one of her phases have been a prophetess  she might and not improbably would have suffered death from the stern tribunals of the period for attempting to undermine the foundations of the puritan establishment  but in the education of her child the mothers enthusiasm of thought had something to wreak itself upon  providence in the person of this little girl had assigned to hesters charge the germ and blossom of womanhood to be cherished and developed amid a host of difficulties everything was against her  the world was hostile  the childs own nature had something wrong in it which continually betokened that she had been born amissthe effluence of her mothers lawless passionand often impelled hester to ask in bitterness of heart whether it were for ill or good that the poor little creature had been born at all  indeed the same dark question often rose into her mind with reference to the whole race of womanhood  was existence worth accepting even to the happiest among them  as concerned her own individual existence she had long ago decided in the negative and dismissed the point as settled  a tendency to speculation though it may keep women quiet as it does man yet makes her sad  she discerns it may be such a hopeless task before her as a first step the whole system of society is to be torn down and built up anew  then the very nature of the opposite sex or its long hereditary habit which has become like nature is to be essentially modified before woman can be allowed to assume what seems a fair and suitable position  finally all other difficulties being obviated woman cannot take advantage of these preliminary reforms until she herself shall have undergone a still mightier change in which perhaps the ethereal essence wherein she has her truest life will be found to have evaporated  a woman never overcomes these problems by any exercise of thought  they are not to be solved or only in one way  if her heart chance to come uppermost they vanish  thus hester prynne whose heart had lost its regular and healthy throb wandered without a clue in the dark labyrinth of mind now turned aside by an insurmountable precipice now starting back from a deep chasm  there was wild and ghastly scenery all around her and a home and comfort nowhere  at times a fearful doubt strove to possess her soul whether it were not better to send pearl at once to heaven and go herself to such futurity as eternal justice should provide  the scarlet letter had not done its office  now however her interview with the reverend mr dimmesdale on the night of his vigil had given her a new theme of reflection and held up to her an object that appeared worthy of any exertion and sacrifice for its attainment  she had witnessed the intense misery beneath which the minister struggled or to speak more accurately had ceased to struggle  she saw that he stood on the verge of lunacy if he had not already stepped across it  it was impossible to doubt that whatever painful efficacy there might be in the secret sting of remorse a deadlier venom had been infused into it by the hand that proffered relief  a secret enemy had been continually by his side under the semblance of a friend and helper and had availed himself of the opportunities thus afforded for tampering with the delicate springs of mr dimmesdales nature  hester could not but ask herself whether there had not originally been a defect of truth courage and loyalty on her own part in allowing the minister to be thrown into a position where so much evil was to be foreboded and nothing auspicious to be hoped  her only justification lay in the fact that she had been able to discern no method of rescuing him from a blacker ruin than had overwhelmed herself except by acquiescing in roger chillingworths scheme of disguise  under that impulse she had made her choice and had chosen as it now appeared the more wretched alternative of the two  she determined to redeem her error so far as it might yet be possible  strengthened by years of hard and solemn trial she felt herself no longer so inadequate to cope with roger chillingworth as on that night abased by sin and halfmaddened by the ignominy that was still new when they had talked together in the prisonchamber  she had climbed her way since then to a higher point  the old man on the other hand had brought himself nearer to her level or perhaps below it by the revenge which he had stooped for  in fine hester prynne resolved to meet her former husband and do what might be in her power for the rescue of the victim on whom he had so evidently set his gripe  the occasion was not long to seek  one afternoon walking with pearl in a retired part of the peninsula she beheld the old physician with a basket on one arm and a staff in the other hand stooping along the ground in quest of roots and herbs to concoct his medicine withal    xiv  hester and the physician  hester bade little pearl run down to the margin of the water and play with the shells and tangled seaweed until she should have talked awhile with yonder gatherer of herbs  so the child flew away like a bird and making bare her small white feet went pattering along the moist margin of the sea  here and there she came to a full stop and peeped curiously into a pool left by the retiring tide as a mirror for pearl to see her face in forth peeped at her out of the pool with dark glistening curls around her head and an elfsmile in her eyes the image of a little maid whom pearl having no other playmate invited to take her hand and run a race with her  but the visionary little maid on her part beckoned likewise as if to saythis is a better place come thou into the pool  and pearl stepping in midleg deep beheld her own white feet at the bottom while out of a still lower depth came the gleam of a kind of fragmentary smile floating to and fro in the agitated water  meanwhile her mother had accosted the physician  i would speak a word with you said shea word that concerns us much  aha and is it mistress hester that has a word for old roger chillingworth answered he raising himself from his stooping posture  with all my heart  why mistress i hear good tidings of you on all hands  no longer ago than yestereve a magistrate a wise and godly man was discoursing of your affairs mistress hester and whispered me that there had been question concerning you in the council  it was debated whether or no with safety to the commonweal yonder scarlet letter might be taken off your bosom  on my life hester i made my intreaty to the worshipful magistrate that it might be done forthwith  it lies not in the pleasure of the magistrates to take off the badge calmly replied hester  were i worthy to be quit of it it would fall away of its own nature or be transformed into something that should speak a different purport  nay then wear it if it suit you better rejoined he a woman must needs follow her own fancy touching the adornment of her person  the letter is gaily embroidered and shows right bravely on your bosom  all this while hester had been looking steadily at the old man and was shocked as well as wondersmitten to discern what a change had been wrought upon him within the past seven years  it was not so much that he had grown older for though the traces of advancing life were visible he bore his age well and seemed to retain a wiry vigour and alertness  but the former aspect of an intellectual and studious man calm and quiet which was what she best remembered in him had altogether vanished and been succeeded by an eager searching almost fierce yet carefully guarded look  it seemed to be his wish and purpose to mask this expression with a smile but the latter played him false and flickered over his visage so derisively that the spectator could see his blackness all the better for it  ever and anon too there came a glare of red light out of his eyes as if the old mans soul were on fire and kept on smouldering duskily within his breast until by some casual puff of passion it was blown into a momentary flame  this he repressed as speedily as possible and strove to look as if nothing of the kind had happened  in a word old roger chillingworth was a striking evidence of mans faculty of transforming himself into a devil if he will only for a reasonable space of time undertake a devils office  this unhappy person had effected such a transformation by devoting himself for seven years to the constant analysis of a heart full of torture and deriving his enjoyment thence and adding fuel to those fiery tortures which he analysed and gloated over  the scarlet letter burned on hester prynnes bosom  here was another ruin the responsibility of which came partly home to her  what see you in my face asked the physician that you look at it so earnestly  something that would make me weep if there were any tears bitter enough for it answered she  but let it pass  it is of yonder miserable man that i would speak  and what of him cried roger chillingworth eagerly as if he loved the topic and were glad of an opportunity to discuss it with the only person of whom he could make a confidant  not to hide the truth mistress hester my thoughts happen just now to be busy with the gentleman  so speak freely and i will make answer  when we last spake together said hester now seven years ago it was your pleasure to extort a promise of secrecy as touching the former relation betwixt yourself and me  as the life and good fame of yonder man were in your hands there seemed no choice to me save to be silent in accordance with your behest  yet it was not without heavy misgivings that i thus bound myself for having cast off all duty towards other human beings there remained a duty towards him and something whispered me that i was betraying it in pledging myself to keep your counsel  since that day no man is so near to him as you you tread behind his every footstep  you are beside him sleeping and waking  you search his thoughts  you burrow and rankle in his heart  your clutch is on his life and you cause him to die daily a living death and still he knows you not  in permitting this i have surely acted a false part by the only man to whom the power was left me to be true  what choice had you asked roger chillingworth  my finger pointed at this man would have hurled him from his pulpit into a dungeon thence peradventure to the gallows  it had been better so said hester prynne  what evil have i done the man asked roger chillingworth again  i tell thee hester prynne the richest fee that ever physician earned from monarch could not have bought such care as i have wasted on this miserable priest  but for my aid his life would have burned away in torments within the first two years after the perpetration of his crime and thine  for hester his spirit lacked the strength that could have borne up as thine has beneath a burden like thy scarlet letter  oh i could reveal a goodly secret  but enough  what art can do i have exhausted on him  that he now breathes and creeps about on earth is owing all to me  better he had died at once said hester prynne  yea woman thou sayest truly cried old roger chillingworth letting the lurid fire of his heart blaze out before her eyes better had he died at once  never did mortal suffer what this man has suffered  and all all in the sight of his worst enemy he has been conscious of me  he has felt an influence dwelling always upon him like a curse  he knew by some spiritual sensefor the creator never made another being so sensitive as thishe knew that no friendly hand was pulling at his heartstrings and that an eye was looking curiously into him which sought only evil and found it  but he knew not that the eye and hand were mine  with the superstition common to his brotherhood he fancied himself given over to a fiend to be tortured with frightful dreams and desperate thoughts the sting of remorse and despair of pardon as a foretaste of what awaits him beyond the grave  but it was the constant shadow of my presence the closest propinquity of the man whom he had most vilely wronged and who had grown to exist only by this perpetual poison of the direst revenge  yea indeed he did not err there was a fiend at his elbow  a mortal man with once a human heart has become a fiend for his especial torment  the unfortunate physician while uttering these words lifted his hands with a look of horror as if he had beheld some frightful shape which he could not recognise usurping the place of his own image in a glass  it was one of those momentswhich sometimes occur only at the interval of yearswhen a mans moral aspect is faithfully revealed to his minds eye  not improbably he had never before viewed himself as he did now  hast thou not tortured him enough said hester noticing the old mans look  has he not paid thee all  no no  he has but increased the debt answered the physician and as he proceeded his manner lost its fiercer characteristics and subsided into gloom  dost thou remember me hester as i was nine years agone  even then i was in the autumn of my days nor was it the early autumn  but all my life had been made up of earnest studious thoughtful quiet years bestowed faithfully for the increase of mine own knowledge and faithfully too though this latter object was but casual to the otherfaithfully for the advancement of human welfare  no life had been more peaceful and innocent than mine few lives so rich with benefits conferred  dost thou remember me  was i not though you might deem me cold nevertheless a man thoughtful for others craving little for himselfkind true just and of constant if not warm affections  was i not all this  all this and more said hester  and what am i now demanded he looking into her face and permitting the whole evil within him to be written on his features  i have already told thee what i ama fiend  who made me so  it was myself cried hester shuddering  it was i not less than he  why hast thou not avenged thyself on me  i have left thee to the scarlet letter replied roger chillingworth  if that has not avenged me i can do no more  he laid his finger on it with a smile  it has avenged thee answered hester prynne  i judged no less said the physician  and now what wouldst thou with me touching this man  i must reveal the secret answered hester firmly  he must discern thee in thy true character  what may be the result i know not  but this long debt of confidence due from me to him whose bane and ruin i have been shall at length be paid  so far as concerns the overthrow or preservation of his fair fame and his earthly state and perchance his life he is in my hands nor do iwhom the scarlet letter has disciplined to truth though it be the truth of redhot iron entering into the soulnor do i perceive such advantage in his living any longer a life of ghastly emptiness that i shall stoop to implore thy mercy  do with him as thou wilt  there is no good for him no good for me no good for thee  there is no good for little pearl  there is no path to guide us out of this dismal maze  woman i could wellnigh pity thee said roger chillingworth unable to restrain a thrill of admiration too for there was a quality almost majestic in the despair which she expressed thou hadst great elements  peradventure hadst thou met earlier with a better love than mine this evil had not been  i pity thee for the good that has been wasted in thy nature  and i thee answered hester prynne for the hatred that has transformed a wise and just man to a fiend  wilt thou yet purge it out of thee and be once more human  if not for his sake then doubly for thine own  forgive and leave his further retribution to the power that claims it  i said but now that there could be no good event for him or thee or me who are here wandering together in this gloomy maze of evil and stumbling at every step over the guilt wherewith we have strewn our path  it is not so  there might be good for thee and thee alone since thou hast been deeply wronged and hast it at thy will to pardon  wilt thou give up that only privilege  wilt thou reject that priceless benefit  peace hesterpeace replied the old man with gloomy sternnessit is not granted me to pardon  i have no such power as thou tellest me of  my old faith long forgotten comes back to me and explains all that we do and all we suffer  by thy first step awry thou didst plant the germ of evil but since that moment it has all been a dark necessity  ye that have wronged me are not sinful save in a kind of typical illusion neither am i fiendlike who have snatched a fiends office from his hands  it is our fate  let the black flower blossom as it may  now go thy ways and deal as thou wilt with yonder man  he waved his hand and betook himself again to his employment of gathering herbs     xv  hester and pearl  so roger chillingwortha deformed old figure with a face that haunted mens memories longer than they likedtook leave of hester prynne and went stooping away along the earth  he gathered here and there a herb or grubbed up a root and put it into the basket on his arm  his gray beard almost touched the ground as he crept onward  hester gazed after him a little while looking with a half fantastic curiosity to see whether the tender grass of early spring would not be blighted beneath him and show the wavering track of his footsteps sere and brown across its cheerful verdure  she wondered what sort of herbs they were which the old man was so sedulous to gather would not the earth quickened to an evil purpose by the sympathy of his eye greet him with poisonous shrubs of species hitherto unknown that would start up under his fingers  or might it suffice him that every wholesome growth should be converted into something deleterious and malignant at his touch did the sun which shone so brightly everywhere else really fall upon him  or was there as it rather seemed a circle of ominous shadow moving along with his deformity whichever way he turned himself  and whither was he now going  would he not suddenly sink into the earth leaving a barren and blasted spot where in due course of time would be seen deadly nightshade dogwood henbane and whatever else of vegetable wickedness the climate could produce all flourishing with hideous luxuriance or would he spread bats wings and flee away looking so much the uglier the higher he rose towards heaven  be it sin or no said hester prynne bitterly as still she gazed after him i hate the man  she upbraided herself for the sentiment but could not overcome or lessen it  attempting to do so she thought of those longpast days in a distant land when he used to emerge at eventide from the seclusion of his study and sit down in the firelight of their home and in the light of her nuptial smile he needed to bask himself in that smile he said in order that the chill of so many lonely hours among his books might be taken off the scholars heart  such scenes had once appeared not otherwise than happy but now as viewed through the dismal medium of her subsequent life they classed themselves among her ugliest remembrances  she marvelled how such scenes could have been  she marvelled how she could ever have been wrought upon to marry him  she deemed it her crime most to be repented of that she had ever endured and reciprocated the lukewarm grasp of his hand and had suffered the smile of her lips and eyes to mingle and melt into his own  and it seemed a fouler offence committed by roger chillingworth than any which had since been done him that in the time when her heart knew no better he had persuaded her to fancy herself happy by his side  yes i hate him repeated hester more bitterly than before he betrayed me  he has done me worse wrong than i did him  let men tremble to win the hand of woman unless they win along with it the utmost passion of her heart  else it may be their miserable fortune as it was roger chillingworths when some mightier touch than their own may have awakened all her sensibilities to be reproached even for the calm content the marble image of happiness which they will have imposed upon her as the warm reality  but hester ought long ago to have done with this injustice  what did it betoken  had seven long years under the torture of the scarlet letter inflicted so much of misery and wrought out no repentance  the emotion of that brief space while she stood gazing after the crooked figure of old roger chillingworth threw a dark light on hesters state of mind revealing much that she might not otherwise have acknowledged to herself  he being gone she summoned back her child  pearl  little pearl  where are you  pearl whose activity of spirit never flagged had been at no loss for amusement while her mother talked with the old gatherer of herbs  at first as already told she had flirted fancifully with her own image in a pool of water beckoning the phantom forth andas it declined to ventureseeking a passage for herself into its sphere of impalpable earth and unattainable sky  soon finding however that either she or the image was unreal she turned elsewhere for better pastime  she made little boats out of birchbark and freighted them with snailshells and sent out more ventures on the mighty deep than any merchant in new england but the larger part of them foundered near the shore  she seized a live horseshoe by the tail and made prize of several fivefingers and laid out a jellyfish to melt in the warm sun  then she took up the white foam that streaked the line of the advancing tide and threw it upon the breeze scampering after it with winged footsteps to catch the great snowflakes ere they fell  perceiving a flock of beachbirds that fed and fluttered along the shore the naughty child picked up her apron full of pebbles and creeping from rock to rock after these small seafowl displayed remarkable dexterity in pelting them  one little gray bird with a white breast pearl was almost sure had been hit by a pebble and fluttered away with a broken wing  but then the elfchild sighed and gave up her sport because it grieved her to have done harm to a little being that was as wild as the seabreeze or as wild as pearl herself  her final employment was to gather seaweed of various kinds and make herself a scarf or mantle and a headdress and thus assume the aspect of a little mermaid  she inherited her mothers gift for devising drapery and costume  as the last touch to her mermaids garb pearl took some eelgrass and imitated as best she could on her own bosom the decoration with which she was so familiar on her mothers  a letterthe letter abut freshly green instead of scarlet  the child bent her chin upon her breast and contemplated this device with strange interest even as if the one only thing for which she had been sent into the world was to make out its hidden import  i wonder if mother will ask me what it means thought pearl  just then she heard her mothers voice and flitting along as lightly as one of the little seabirds appeared before hester prynne dancing laughing and pointing her finger to the ornament upon her bosom  my little pearl said hester after a moments silence the green letter and on thy childish bosom has no purport  but dost thou know my child what this letter means which thy mother is doomed to wear  yes mother said the child  it is the great letter a  thou hast taught me in the hornbook  hester looked steadily into her little face but though there was that singular expression which she had so often remarked in her black eyes she could not satisfy herself whether pearl really attached any meaning to the symbol  she felt a morbid desire to ascertain the point  dost thou know child wherefore thy mother wears this letter  truly do i answered pearl looking brightly into her mothers face  it is for the same reason that the minister keeps his hand over his heart  and what reason is that asked hester half smiling at the absurd incongruity of the childs observation but on second thoughts turning pale  what has the letter to do with any heart save mine  nay mother i have told all i know said pearl more seriously than she was wont to speak  ask yonder old man whom thou hast been talking withit may be he can tell  but in good earnest now mother dear what does this scarlet letter meanand why dost thou wear it on thy bosomand why does the minister keep his hand over his heart  she took her mothers hand in both her own and gazed into her eyes with an earnestness that was seldom seen in her wild and capricious character  the thought occurred to hester that the child might really be seeking to approach her with childlike confidence and doing what she could and as intelligently as she knew how to establish a meetingpoint of sympathy  it showed pearl in an unwonted aspect  heretofore the mother while loving her child with the intensity of a sole affection had schooled herself to hope for little other return than the waywardness of an april breeze which spends its time in airy sport and has its gusts of inexplicable passion and is petulant in its best of moods and chills oftener than caresses you when you take it to your bosom in requital of which misdemeanours it will sometimes of its own vague purpose kiss your cheek with a kind of doubtful tenderness and play gently with your hair and then be gone about its other idle business leaving a dreamy pleasure at your heart  and this moreover was a mothers estimate of the childs disposition  any other observer might have seen few but unamiable traits and have given them a far darker colouring  but now the idea came strongly into hesters mind that pearl with her remarkable precocity and acuteness might already have approached the age when she could have been made a friend and intrusted with as much of her mothers sorrows as could be imparted without irreverence either to the parent or the child  in the little chaos of pearls character there might be seen emerging and could have been from the very firstthe steadfast principles of an unflinching couragean uncontrollable willsturdy pride which might be disciplined into selfrespectand a bitter scorn of many things which when examined might be found to have the taint of falsehood in them  she possessed affections too though hitherto acrid and disagreeable as are the richest flavours of unripe fruit  with all these sterling attributes thought hester the evil which she inherited from her mother must be great indeed if a noble woman do not grow out of this elfish child  pearls inevitable tendency to hover about the enigma of the scarlet letter seemed an innate quality of her being  from the earliest epoch of her conscious life she had entered upon this as her appointed mission  hester had often fancied that providence had a design of justice and retribution in endowing the child with this marked propensity but never until now had she bethought herself to ask whether linked with that design there might not likewise be a purpose of mercy and beneficence if little pearl were entertained with faith and trust as a spirit messenger no less than an earthly child might it not be her errand to soothe away the sorrow that lay cold in her mothers heart and converted it into a tomband to help her to overcome the passion once so wild and even yet neither dead nor asleep but only imprisoned within the same tomblike heart  such were some of the thoughts that now stirred in hesters mind with as much vivacity of impression as if they had actually been whispered into her ear  and there was little pearl all this while holding her mothers hand in both her own and turning her face upward while she put these searching questions once and again and still a third time  what does the letter mean mother  and why dost thou wear it and why does the minister keep his hand over his heart  what shall i say thought hester to herself  no  if this be the price of the childs sympathy i cannot pay it  then she spoke aloud  silly pearl said she what questions are these  there are many things in this world that a child must not ask about  what know i of the ministers heart  and as for the scarlet letter i wear it for the sake of its gold thread  in all the seven bygone years hester prynne had never before been false to the symbol on her bosom  it may be that it was the talisman of a stern and severe but yet a guardian spirit who now forsook her as recognising that in spite of his strict watch over her heart some new evil had crept into it or some old one had never been expelled  as for little pearl the earnestness soon passed out of her face  but the child did not see fit to let the matter drop  two or three times as her mother and she went homeward and as often at suppertime and while hester was putting her to bed and once after she seemed to be fairly asleep pearl looked up with mischief gleaming in her black eyes  mother said she what does the scarlet letter mean  and the next morning the first indication the child gave of being awake was by popping up her head from the pillow and making that other enquiry which she had so unaccountably connected with her investigations about the scarlet letter  mothermotherwhy does the minister keep his hand over his heart  hold thy tongue naughty child answered her mother with an asperity that she had never permitted to herself before  do not tease me else i shall put thee into the dark closet    xvi  a forest walk  hester prynne remained constant in her resolve to make known to mr dimmesdale at whatever risk of present pain or ulterior consequences the true character of the man who had crept into his intimacy  for several days however she vainly sought an opportunity of addressing him in some of the meditative walks which she knew him to be in the habit of taking along the shores of the peninsula or on the wooded hills of the neighbouring country  there would have been no scandal indeed nor peril to the holy whiteness of the clergymans good fame had she visited him in his own study where many a penitent ere now had confessed sins of perhaps as deep a dye as the one betokened by the scarlet letter  but partly that she dreaded the secret or undisguised interference of old roger chillingworth and partly that her conscious heart imparted suspicion where none could have been felt and partly that both the minister and she would need the whole wide world to breathe in while they talked togetherfor all these reasons hester never thought of meeting him in any narrower privacy than beneath the open sky  at last while attending a sick chamber whither the rev  mr dimmesdale had been summoned to make a prayer she learnt that he had gone the day before to visit the apostle eliot among his indian converts  he would probably return by a certain hour in the afternoon of the morrow  betimes therefore the next day hester took little pearlwho was necessarily the companion of all her mothers expeditions however inconvenient her presenceand set forth  the road after the two wayfarers had crossed from the peninsula to the mainland was no other than a footpath  it straggled onward into the mystery of the primeval forest  this hemmed it in so narrowly and stood so black and dense on either side and disclosed such imperfect glimpses of the sky above that to hesters mind it imaged not amiss the moral wilderness in which she had so long been wandering  the day was chill and sombre overhead was a gray expanse of cloud slightly stirred however by a breeze so that a gleam of flickering sunshine might now and then be seen at its solitary play along the path  this flitting cheerfulness was always at the further extremity of some long vista through the forest  the sportive sunlightfeebly sportive at best in the predominant pensiveness of the day and scenewithdrew itself as they came nigh and left the spots where it had danced the drearier because they had hoped to find them bright  mother said little pearl the sunshine does not love you it runs away and hides itself because it is afraid of something on your bosom  now see  there it is playing a good way off stand you here and let me run and catch it  i am but a child it will not flee from mefor i wear nothing on my bosom yet  nor ever will my child i hope said hester  and why not mother asked pearl stopping short just at the beginning of her race  will not it come of its own accord when i am a woman grown  run away child answered her mother and catch the sunshine it will soon be gone  pearl set forth at a great pace and as hester smiled to perceive did actually catch the sunshine and stood laughing in the midst of it all brightened by its splendour and scintillating with the vivacity excited by rapid motion  the light lingered about the lonely child as if glad of such a playmate until her mother had drawn almost nigh enough to step into the magic circle too  it will go now said pearl shaking her head  see answered hester smiling now i can stretch out my hand and grasp some of it  as she attempted to do so the sunshine vanished or to judge from the bright expression that was dancing on pearls features her mother could have fancied that the child had absorbed it into herself and would give it forth again with a gleam about her path as they should plunge into some gloomier shade  there was no other attribute that so much impressed her with a sense of new and untransmitted vigour in pearls nature as this never failing vivacity of spirits she had not the disease of sadness which almost all children in these latter days inherit with the scrofula from the troubles of their ancestors  perhaps this too was a disease and but the reflex of the wild energy with which hester had fought against her sorrows before pearls birth  it was certainly a doubtful charm imparting a hard metallic lustre to the childs character  she wantedwhat some people want throughout lifea grief that should deeply touch her and thus humanise and make her capable of sympathy  but there was time enough yet for little pearl  come my child said hester looking about her from the spot where pearl had stood still in the sunshinewe will sit down a little way within the wood and rest ourselves  i am not aweary mother replied the little girl  but you may sit down if you will tell me a story meanwhile  a story child said hester  and about what  oh a story about the black man answered pearl taking hold of her mothers gown and looking up half earnestly half mischievously into her face  how he haunts this forest and carries a book with him a big heavy book with iron clasps and how this ugly black man offers his book and an iron pen to everybody that meets him here among the trees and they are to write their names with their own blood and then he sets his mark on their bosoms  didst thou ever meet the black man mother  and who told you this story pearl asked her mother recognising a common superstition of the period  it was the old dame in the chimney corner at the house where you watched last night said the child  but she fancied me asleep while she was talking of it  she said that a thousand and a thousand people had met him here and had written in his book and have his mark on them  and that ugly tempered lady old mistress hibbins was one  and mother the old dame said that this scarlet letter was the black mans mark on thee and that it glows like a red flame when thou meetest him at midnight here in the dark wood  is it true mother  and dost thou go to meet him in the nighttime  didst thou ever awake and find thy mother gone asked hester not that i remember said the child  if thou fearest to leave me in our cottage thou mightest take me along with thee  i would very gladly go  but mother tell me now  is there such a black man  and didst thou ever meet him  and is this his mark  wilt thou let me be at peace if i once tell thee asked her mother  yes if thou tellest me all answered pearl  once in my life i met the black man said her mother  this scarlet letter is his mark  thus conversing they entered sufficiently deep into the wood to secure themselves from the observation of any casual passenger along the forest track  here they sat down on a luxuriant heap of moss which at some epoch of the preceding century had been a gigantic pine with its roots and trunk in the darksome shade and its head aloft in the upper atmosphere  it was a little dell where they had seated themselves with a leafstrewn bank rising gently on either side and a brook flowing through the midst over a bed of fallen and drowned leaves  the trees impending over it had flung down great branches from time to time which choked up the current and compelled it to form eddies and black depths at some points while in its swifter and livelier passages there appeared a channelway of pebbles and brown sparkling sand  letting the eyes follow along the course of the stream they could catch the reflected light from its water at some short distance within the forest but soon lost all traces of it amid the bewilderment of treetrunks and underbrush and here and there a huge rock covered over with gray lichens  all these giant trees and boulders of granite seemed intent on making a mystery of the course of this small brook fearing perhaps that with its neverceasing loquacity it should whisper tales out of the heart of the old forest whence it flowed or mirror its revelations on the smooth surface of a pool  continually indeed as it stole onward the streamlet kept up a babble kind quiet soothing but melancholy like the voice of a young child that was spending its infancy without playfulness and knew not how to be merry among sad acquaintance and events of sombre hue  oh brook  oh foolish and tiresome little brook cried pearl after listening awhile to its talk why art thou so sad pluck up a spirit and do not be all the time sighing and murmuring  but the brook in the course of its little lifetime among the forest trees had gone through so solemn an experience that it could not help talking about it and seemed to have nothing else to say  pearl resembled the brook inasmuch as the current of her life gushed from a wellspring as mysterious and had flowed through scenes shadowed as heavily with gloom  but unlike the little stream she danced and sparkled and prattled airily along her course  what does this sad little brook say mother inquired she  if thou hadst a sorrow of thine own the brook might tell thee of it answered her mother even as it is telling me of mine but now pearl i hear a footstep along the path and the noise of one putting aside the branches  i would have thee betake thyself to play and leave me to speak with him that comes yonder  is it the black man asked pearl  wilt thou go and play child repeated her mother but do not stray far into the wood  and take heed that thou come at my first call  yes mother answered pearl but if it be the black man wilt thou not let me stay a moment and look at him with his big book under his arm  go silly child said her mother impatiently  it is no black man  thou canst see him now through the trees  it is the minister  and so it is said the child  and mother he has his hand over his heart  is it because when the minister wrote his name in the book the black man set his mark in that place  but why does he not wear it outside his bosom as thou dost mother  go now child and thou shalt tease me as thou wilt another time cried hester prynne  but do not stray far  keep where thou canst hear the babble of the brook  the child went singing away following up the current of the brook and striving to mingle a more lightsome cadence with its melancholy voice  but the little stream would not be comforted and still kept telling its unintelligible secret of some very mournful mystery that had happenedor making a prophetic lamentation about something that was yet to happenwithin the verge of the dismal forest  so pearl who had enough of shadow in her own little life chose to break off all acquaintance with this repining brook  she set herself therefore to gathering violets and woodanemones and some scarlet columbines that she found growing in the crevice of a high rock  when her elfchild had departed hester prynne made a step or two towards the track that led through the forest but still remained under the deep shadow of the trees  she beheld the minister advancing along the path entirely alone and leaning on a staff which he had cut by the wayside  he looked haggard and feeble and betrayed a nerveless despondency in his air which had never so remarkably characterised him in his walks about the settlement nor in any other situation where he deemed himself liable to notice  here it was wofully visible in this intense seclusion of the forest which of itself would have been a heavy trial to the spirits  there was a listlessness in his gait as if he saw no reason for taking one step further nor felt any desire to do so but would have been glad could he be glad of anything to fling himself down at the root of the nearest tree and lie there passive for evermore  the leaves might bestrew him and the soil gradually accumulate and form a little hillock over his frame no matter whether there were life in it or no death was too definite an object to be wished for or avoided  to hesters eye the reverend mr dimmesdale exhibited no symptom of positive and vivacious suffering except that as little pearl had remarked he kept his hand over his heart    xvii   the pastor and his parishioner  slowly as the minister walked he had almost gone by before hester prynne could gather voice enough to attract his observation  at length she succeeded  arthur dimmesdale she said faintly at first then louder but hoarselyarthur dimmesdale  who speaks answered the minister  gathering himself quickly up he stood more erect like a man taken by surprise in a mood to which he was reluctant to have witnesses  throwing his eyes anxiously in the direction of the voice he indistinctly beheld a form under the trees clad in garments so sombre and so little relieved from the gray twilight into which the clouded sky and the heavy foliage had darkened the noontide that he knew not whether it were a woman or a shadow  it may be that his pathway through life was haunted thus by a spectre that had stolen out from among his thoughts  he made a step nigher and discovered the scarlet letter  hester  hester prynne said he is it thou  art thou in life  even so she answered  in such life as has been mine these seven years past  and thou arthur dimmesdale dost thou yet live  it was no wonder that they thus questioned one anothers actual and bodily existence and even doubted of their own  so strangely did they meet in the dim wood that it was like the first encounter in the world beyond the grave of two spirits who had been intimately connected in their former life but now stood coldly shuddering in mutual dread as not yet familiar with their state nor wonted to the companionship of disembodied beings  each a ghost and awestricken at the other ghost  they were awestricken likewise at themselves because the crisis flung back to them their consciousness and revealed to each heart its history and experience as life never does except at such breathless epochs  the soul beheld its features in the mirror of the passing moment  it was with fear and tremulously and as it were by a slow reluctant necessity that arthur dimmesdale put forth his hand chill as death and touched the chill hand of hester prynne  the grasp cold as it was took away what was dreariest in the interview  they now felt themselves at least inhabitants of the same sphere  without a word more spokenneither he nor she assuming the guidance but with an unexpressed consentthey glided back into the shadow of the woods whence hester had emerged and sat down on the heap of moss where she and pearl had before been sitting when they found voice to speak it was at first only to utter remarks and inquiries such as any two acquaintances might have made about the gloomy sky the threatening storm and next the health of each  thus they went onward not boldly but step by step into the themes that were brooding deepest in their hearts  so long estranged by fate and circumstances they needed something slight and casual to run before and throw open the doors of intercourse so that their real thoughts might be led across the threshold  after awhile the minister fixed his eyes on hester prynnes  hester said he hast thou found peace  she smiled drearily looking down upon her bosom  hast thou she asked  nonenothing but despair he answered  what else could i look for being what i am and leading such a life as mine  were i an atheista man devoid of consciencea wretch with coarse and brutal instinctsi might have found peace long ere now nay i never should have lost it  but as matters stand with my soul whatever of good capacity there originally was in me all of gods gifts that were the choicest have become the ministers of spiritual torment  hester i am most miserable  the people reverence thee said hester  and surely thou workest good among them  doth this bring thee no comfort  more misery hesteronly the more misery answered the clergyman with a bitter smile  as concerns the good which i may appear to do i have no faith in it  it must needs be a delusion  what can a ruined soul like mine effect towards the redemption of other soulsor a polluted soul towards their purification  and as for the peoples reverence would that it were turned to scorn and hatred  canst thou deem it hester a consolation that i must stand up in my pulpit and meet so many eyes turned upward to my face as if the light of heaven were beaming from itmust see my flock hungry for the truth and listening to my words as if a tongue of pentecost were speakingand then look inward and discern the black reality of what they idolise  i have laughed in bitterness and agony of heart at the contrast between what i seem and what i am  and satan laughs at it  you wrong yourself in this said hester gently  you have deeply and sorely repented  your sin is left behind you in the days long past  your present life is not less holy in very truth than it seems in peoples eyes  is there no reality in the penitence thus sealed and witnessed by good works  and wherefore should it not bring you peace  no hesterno replied the clergyman  there is no substance in it  it is cold and dead and can do nothing for me  of penance i have had enough  of penitence there has been none else i should long ago have thrown off these garments of mock holiness and have shown myself to mankind as they will see me at the judgmentseat  happy are you hester that wear the scarlet letter openly upon your bosom  mine burns in secret thou little knowest what a relief it is after the torment of a seven years cheat to look into an eye that recognises me for what i am  had i one friendor were it my worst enemyto whom when sickened with the praises of all other men i could daily betake myself and be known as the vilest of all sinners methinks my soul might keep itself alive thereby  even thus much of truth would save me  but now it is all falsehoodall emptinessall death  hester prynne looked into his face but hesitated to speak yet uttering his longrestrained emotions so vehemently as he did his words here offered her the very point of circumstances in which to interpose what she came to say  she conquered her fears and spoke  such a friend as thou hast even now wished for said she with whom to weep over thy sin thou hast in me the partner of it  again she hesitated but brought out the words with an effortthou hast long had such an enemy and dwellest with him under the same roof  the minister started to his feet gasping for breath and clutching at his heart as if he would have torn it out of his bosom  ha  what sayest thou cried he  an enemy  and under mine own roof  what mean you  hester prynne was now fully sensible of the deep injury for which she was responsible to this unhappy man in permitting him to lie for so many years or indeed for a single moment at the mercy of one whose purposes could not be other than malevolent  the very contiguity of his enemy beneath whatever mask the latter might conceal himself was enough to disturb the magnetic sphere of a being so sensitive as arthur dimmesdale there had been a period when hester was less alive to this consideration or perhaps in the misanthropy of her own trouble she left the minister to bear what she might picture to herself as a more tolerable doom  but of late since the night of his vigil all her sympathies towards him had been both softened and invigorated  she now read his heart more accurately  she doubted not that the continual presence of roger chillingworththe secret poison of his malignity infecting all the air about himand his authorised interference as a physician with the ministers physical and spiritual infirmitiesthat these bad opportunities had been turned to a cruel purpose  by means of them the sufferers conscience had been kept in an irritated state the tendency of which was not to cure by wholesome pain but to disorganize and corrupt his spiritual being  its result on earth could hardly fail to be insanity and hereafter that eternal alienation from the good and true of which madness is perhaps the earthly type  such was the ruin to which she had brought the man oncenay why should we not speak itstill so passionately loved  hester felt that the sacrifice of the clergymans good name and death itself as she had already told roger chillingworth would have been infinitely preferable to the alternative which she had taken upon herself to choose  and now rather than have had this grievous wrong to confess she would gladly have laid down on the forest leaves and died there at arthur dimmesdales feet  oh arthur cried she forgive me  in all things else i have striven to be true  truth was the one virtue which i might have held fast and did hold fast through all extremity save when thy goodthy lifethy famewere put in question  then i consented to a deception  but a lie is never good even though death threaten on the other side  dost thou not see what i would say  that old manthe physicianhe whom they call roger chillingworthhe was my husband  the minister looked at her for an instant with all that violence of passion whichintermixed in more shapes than one with his higher purer softer qualitieswas in fact the portion of him which the devil claimed and through which he sought to win the rest  never was there a blacker or a fiercer frown than hester now encountered  for the brief space that it lasted it was a dark transfiguration  but his character had been so much enfeebled by suffering that even its lower energies were incapable of more than a temporary struggle  he sank down on the ground and buried his face in his hands  i might have known it murmured hei did know it  was not the secret told me in the natural recoil of my heart at the first sight of him and as often as i have seen him since  why did i not understand  oh hester prynne thou little little knowest all the horror of this thing  and the shamethe indelicacythe horrible ugliness of this exposure of a sick and guilty heart to the very eye that would gloat over it woman woman thou art accountable for thisi cannot forgive thee  thou shalt forgive me cried hester flinging herself on the fallen leaves beside him  let god punish  thou shalt forgive  with sudden and desperate tenderness she threw her arms around him and pressed his head against her bosom little caring though his cheek rested on the scarlet letter  he would have released himself but strove in vain to do so  hester would not set him free lest he should look her sternly in the face  all the world had frowned on herfor seven long years had it frowned upon this lonely womanand still she bore it all nor ever once turned away her firm sad eyes  heaven likewise had frowned upon her and she had not died  but the frown of this pale weak sinful and sorrowstricken man was what hester could not bear and live  wilt thou yet forgive me she repeated over and over again wilt thou not frown  wilt thou forgive  i do forgive you hester replied the minister at length with a deep utterance out of an abyss of sadness but no anger  i freely forgive you now  may god forgive us both  we are not hester the worst sinners in the world  there is one worse than even the polluted priest  that old mans revenge has been blacker than my sin  he has violated in cold blood the sanctity of a human heart  thou and i hester never did so  never never whispered she  what we did had a consecration of its own  we felt it so  we said so to each other  hast thou forgotten it  hush hester said arthur dimmesdale rising from the ground no i have not forgotten  they sat down again side by side and hand clasped in hand on the mossy trunk of the fallen tree  life had never brought them a gloomier hour it was the point whither their pathway had so long been tending and darkening ever as it stole alongand yet it unclosed a charm that made them linger upon it and claim another and another and after all another moment  the forest was obscure around them and creaked with a blast that was passing through it  the boughs were tossing heavily above their heads while one solemn old tree groaned dolefully to another as if telling the sad story of the pair that sat beneath or constrained to forbode evil to come  and yet they lingered  how dreary looked the foresttrack that led backward to the settlement where hester prynne must take up again the burden of her ignominy and the minister the hollow mockery of his good name  so they lingered an instant longer  no golden light had ever been so precious as the gloom of this dark forest  here seen only by his eyes the scarlet letter need not burn into the bosom of the fallen woman  here seen only by her eyes arthur dimmesdale false to god and man might be for one moment true  he started at a thought that suddenly occurred to him  hester cried he here is a new horror  roger chillingworth knows your purpose to reveal his true character  will he continue then to keep our secret  what will now be the course of his revenge  there is a strange secrecy in his nature replied hester thoughtfully and it has grown upon him by the hidden practices of his revenge  i deem it not likely that he will betray the secret  he will doubtless seek other means of satiating his dark passion  and ihow am i to live longer breathing the same air with this deadly enemy exclaimed arthur dimmesdale shrinking within himself and pressing his hand nervously against his hearta gesture that had grown involuntary with him  think for me hester  thou art strong  resolve for me  thou must dwell no longer with this man said hester slowly and firmly  thy heart must be no longer under his evil eye  it were far worse than death replied the minister  but how to avoid it  what choice remains to me  shall i lie down again on these withered leaves where i cast myself when thou didst tell me what he was  must i sink down there and die at once  alas  what a ruin has befallen thee said hester with the tears gushing into her eyes  wilt thou die for very weakness there is no other cause  the judgment of god is on me answered the consciencestricken priest  it is too mighty for me to struggle with  heaven would show mercy rejoined hester hadst thou but the strength to take advantage of it  be thou strong for me answered he  advise me what to do  is the world then so narrow exclaimed hester prynne fixing her deep eyes on the ministers and instinctively exercising a magnetic power over a spirit so shattered and subdued that it could hardly hold itself erect  doth the universe lie within the compass of yonder town which only a little time ago was but a leafstrewn desert as lonely as this around us  whither leads yonder foresttrack  backward to the settlement thou sayest yes but onward too  deeper it goes and deeper into the wilderness less plainly to be seen at every step until some few miles hence the yellow leaves will show no vestige of the white mans tread  there thou art free  so brief a journey would bring thee from a world where thou hast been most wretched to one where thou mayest still be happy  is there not shade enough in all this boundless forest to hide thy heart from the gaze of roger chillingworth  yes hester but only under the fallen leaves replied the minister with a sad smile  then there is the broad pathway of the sea continued hester it brought thee hither  if thou so choose it will bear thee back again  in our native land whether in some remote rural village or in vast londonor surely in germany in france in pleasant italythou wouldst be beyond his power and knowledge  and what hast thou to do with all these iron men and their opinions  they have kept thy better part in bondage too long already  it cannot be answered the minister listening as if he were called upon to realise a dream  i am powerless to go  wretched and sinful as i am i have had no other thought than to drag on my earthly existence in the sphere where providence hath placed me  lost as my own soul is i would still do what i may for other human souls  i dare not quit my post though an unfaithful sentinel whose sure reward is death and dishonour when his dreary watch shall come to an end  thou art crushed under this seven years weight of misery replied hester fervently resolved to buoy him up with her own energy  but thou shalt leave it all behind thee  it shall not cumber thy steps as thou treadest along the forestpath neither shalt thou freight the ship with it if thou prefer to cross the sea  leave this wreck and ruin here where it hath happened  meddle no more with it  begin all anew  hast thou exhausted possibility in the failure of this one trial  not so the future is yet full of trial and success  there is happiness to be enjoyed  there is good to be done  exchange this false life of thine for a true one  be if thy spirit summon thee to such a mission the teacher and apostle of the red men  or as is more thy nature be a scholar and a sage among the wisest and the most renowned of the cultivated world  preach  write  act do anything save to lie down and die  give up this name of arthur dimmesdale and make thyself another and a high one such as thou canst wear without fear or shame  why shouldst thou tarry so much as one other day in the torments that have so gnawed into thy life that have made thee feeble to will and to do that will leave thee powerless even to repent  up and away  oh hester cried arthur dimmesdale in whose eyes a fitful light kindled by her enthusiasm flashed up and died away thou tellest of running a race to a man whose knees are tottering beneath him  i must die here  there is not the strength or courage left me to venture into the wide strange difficult world alone  it was the last expression of the despondency of a broken spirit  he lacked energy to grasp the better fortune that seemed within his reach  he repeated the wordalone hester  thou shall not go alone answered she in a deep whisper then all was spoken    xviii  a flood of sunshine  arthur dimmesdale gazed into hesters face with a look in which hope and joy shone out indeed but with fear betwixt them and a kind of horror at her boldness who had spoken what he vaguely hinted at but dared not speak  but hester prynne with a mind of native courage and activity and for so long a period not merely estranged but outlawed from society had habituated herself to such latitude of speculation as was altogether foreign to the clergyman  she had wandered without rule or guidance in a moral wilderness as vast as intricate and shadowy as the untamed forest amid the gloom of which they were now holding a colloquy that was to decide their fate  her intellect and heart had their home as it were in desert places where she roamed as freely as the wild indian in his woods  for years past she had looked from this estranged point of view at human institutions and whatever priests or legislators had established criticising all with hardly more reverence than the indian would feel for the clerical band the judicial robe the pillory the gallows the fireside or the church  the tendency of her fate and fortunes had been to set her free  the scarlet letter was her passport into regions where other women dared not tread  shame despair solitude  these had been her teachersstern and wild onesand they had made her strong but taught her much amiss  the minister on the other hand had never gone through an experience calculated to lead him beyond the scope of generally received laws although in a single instance he had so fearfully transgressed one of the most sacred of them  but this had been a sin of passion not of principle nor even purpose since that wretched epoch he had watched with morbid zeal and minuteness not his actsfor those it was easy to arrangebut each breath of emotion and his every thought  at the head of the social system as the clergymen of that day stood he was only the more trammelled by its regulations its principles and even its prejudices  as a priest the framework of his order inevitably hemmed him in  as a man who had once sinned but who kept his conscience all alive and painfully sensitive by the fretting of an unhealed wound he might have been supposed safer within the line of virtue than if he had never sinned at all  thus we seem to see that as regarded hester prynne the whole seven years of outlaw and ignominy had been little other than a preparation for this very hour  but arthur dimmesdale  were such a man once more to fall what plea could be urged in extenuation of his crime  none unless it avail him somewhat that he was broken down by long and exquisite suffering that his mind was darkened and confused by the very remorse which harrowed it that between fleeing as an avowed criminal and remaining as a hypocrite conscience might find it hard to strike the balance that it was human to avoid the peril of death and infamy and the inscrutable machinations of an enemy that finally to this poor pilgrim on his dreary and desert path faint sick miserable there appeared a glimpse of human affection and sympathy a new life and a true one in exchange for the heavy doom which he was now expiating  and be the stern and sad truth spoken that the breach which guilt has once made into the human soul is never in this mortal state repaired  it may be watched and guarded so that the enemy shall not force his way again into the citadel and might even in his subsequent assaults select some other avenue in preference to that where he had formerly succeeded  but there is still the ruined wall and near it the stealthy tread of the foe that would win over again his unforgotten triumph  the struggle if there were one need not be described  let it suffice that the clergyman resolved to flee and not alone  if in all these past seven years thought he i could recall one instant of peace or hope i would yet endure for the sake of that earnest of heavens mercy  but nowsince i am irrevocably doomedwherefore should i not snatch the solace allowed to the condemned culprit before his execution  or if this be the path to a better life as hester would persuade me i surely give up no fairer prospect by pursuing it  neither can i any longer live without her companionship so powerful is she to sustainso tender to soothe  o thou to whom i dare not lift mine eyes wilt thou yet pardon me  thou wilt go said hester calmly as he met her glance  the decision once made a glow of strange enjoyment threw its flickering brightness over the trouble of his breast  it was the exhilarating effectupon a prisoner just escaped from the dungeon of his own heartof breathing the wild free atmosphere of an unredeemed unchristianised lawless region  his spirit rose as it were with a bound and attained a nearer prospect of the sky than throughout all the misery which had kept him grovelling on the earth  of a deeply religious temperament there was inevitably a tinge of the devotional in his mood  do i feel joy again cried he wondering at himself methought the germ of it was dead in me  oh hester thou art my better angel  i seem to have flung myselfsick sinstained and sorrowblackeneddown upon these forest leaves and to have risen up all made anew and with new powers to glorify him that hath been merciful  this is already the better life  why did we not find it sooner  let us not look back answered hester prynne  the past is gone  wherefore should we linger upon it now  see  with this symbol i undo it all and make it as if it had never been  so speaking she undid the clasp that fastened the scarlet letter and taking it from her bosom threw it to a distance among the withered leaves  the mystic token alighted on the hither verge of the stream  with a handsbreadth further flight it would have fallen into the water and have given the little brook another woe to carry onward besides the unintelligible tale which it still kept murmuring about  but there lay the embroidered letter glittering like a lost jewel which some illfated wanderer might pick up and thenceforth be haunted by strange phantoms of guilt sinkings of the heart and unaccountable misfortune  the stigma gone hester heaved a long deep sigh in which the burden of shame and anguish departed from her spirit  o exquisite relief  she had not known the weight until she felt the freedom  by another impulse she took off the formal cap that confined her hair and down it fell upon her shoulders dark and rich with at once a shadow and a light in its abundance and imparting the charm of softness to her features there played around her mouth and beamed out of her eyes a radiant and tender smile that seemed gushing from the very heart of womanhood  a crimson flush was glowing on her cheek that had been long so pale  her sex her youth and the whole richness of her beauty came back from what men call the irrevocable past and clustered themselves with her maiden hope and a happiness before unknown within the magic circle of this hour  and as if the gloom of the earth and sky had been but the effluence of these two mortal hearts it vanished with their sorrow  all at once as with a sudden smile of heaven forth burst the sunshine pouring a very flood into the obscure forest gladdening each green leaf transmuting the yellow fallen ones to gold and gleaming adown the gray trunks of the solemn trees  the objects that had made a shadow hitherto embodied the brightness now  the course of the little brook might be traced by its merry gleam afar into the woods heart of mystery which had become a mystery of joy  such was the sympathy of naturethat wild heathen nature of the forest never subjugated by human law nor illumined by higher truthwith the bliss of these two spirits  love whether newlyborn or aroused from a deathlike slumber must always create a sunshine filling the heart so full of radiance that it overflows upon the outward world  had the forest still kept its gloom it would have been bright in hesters eyes and bright in arthur dimmesdales  hester looked at him with a thrill of another joy  thou must know pearl said she  our little pearl  thou hast seen heryes i know itbut thou wilt see her now with other eyes  she is a strange child  i hardly comprehend her  but thou wilt love her dearly as i do and wilt advise me how to deal with her  dost thou think the child will be glad to know me asked the minister somewhat uneasily  i have long shrunk from children because they often show a distrusta backwardness to be familiar with me  i have even been afraid of little pearl  ah that was sad answered the mother  but she will love thee dearly and thou her  she is not far off  i will call her pearl  pearl  i see the child observed the minister  yonder she is standing in a streak of sunshine a good way off on the other side of the brook  so thou thinkest the child will love me  hester smiled and again called to pearl who was visible at some distance as the minister had described her like a brightapparelled vision in a sunbeam which fell down upon her through an arch of boughs  the ray quivered to and fro making her figure dim or distinctnow like a real child now like a childs spiritas the splendour went and came again  she heard her mothers voice and approached slowly through the forest  pearl had not found the hour pass wearisomely while her mother sat talking with the clergyman  the great black foreststern as it showed itself to those who brought the guilt and troubles of the world into its bosombecame the playmate of the lonely infant as well as it knew how  sombre as it was it put on the kindest of its moods to welcome her  it offered her the partridgeberries the growth of the preceding autumn but ripening only in the spring and now red as drops of blood upon the withered leaves  these pearl gathered and was pleased with their wild flavour  the small denizens of the wilderness hardly took pains to move out of her path  a partridge indeed with a brood of ten behind her ran forward threateningly but soon repented of her fierceness and clucked to her young ones not to be afraid  a pigeon alone on a low branch allowed pearl to come beneath and uttered a sound as much of greeting as alarm a squirrel from the lofty depths of his domestic tree chattered either in anger or merrimentfor the squirrel is such a choleric and humorous little personage that it is hard to distinguish between his moodsso he chattered at the child and flung down a nut upon her head  it was a last years nut and already gnawed by his sharp tooth  a fox startled from his sleep by her light footstep on the leaves looked inquisitively at pearl as doubting whether it were better to steal off or renew his nap on the same spot  a wolf it is saidbut here the tale has surely lapsed into the improbablecame up and smelt of pearls robe and offered his savage head to be patted by her hand  the truth seems to be however that the motherforest and these wild things which it nourished all recognised a kindred wilderness in the human child  and she was gentler here than in the grassymargined streets of the settlement or in her mothers cottage  the bowers appeared to know it and one and another whispered as she passed adorn thyself with me thou beautiful child adorn thyself with meand to please them pearl gathered the violets and anemones and columbines and some twigs of the freshest green which the old trees held down before her eyes  with these she decorated her hair and her young waist and became a nymph child or an infant dryad or whatever else was in closest sympathy with the antique wood  in such guise had pearl adorned herself when she heard her mothers voice and came slowly back  slowlyfor she saw the clergyman    xix  the child at the brookside  thou wilt love her dearly repeated hester prynne as she and the minister sat watching little pearl  dost thou not think her beautiful  and see with what natural skill she has made those simple flowers adorn her  had she gathered pearls and diamonds and rubies in the wood they could not have become her better she is a splendid child  but i know whose brow she has  dost thou know hester said arthur dimmesdale with an unquiet smile that this dear child tripping about always at thy side hath caused me many an alarm  methoughtoh hester what a thought is that and how terrible to dread itthat my own features were partly repeated in her face and so strikingly that the world might see them  but she is mostly thine  no no  not mostly answered the mother with a tender smile a little longer and thou needest not to be afraid to trace whose child she is  but how strangely beautiful she looks with those wild flowers in her hair  it is as if one of the fairies whom we left in dear old england had decked her out to meet us  it was with a feeling which neither of them had ever before experienced that they sat and watched pearls slow advance  in her was visible the tie that united them  she had been offered to the world these seven past years as the living hieroglyphic in which was revealed the secret they so darkly sought to hideall written in this symbolall plainly manifesthad there been a prophet or magician skilled to read the character of flame  and pearl was the oneness of their being  be the foregone evil what it might how could they doubt that their earthly lives and future destinies were conjoined when they beheld at once the material union and the spiritual idea in whom they met and were to dwell immortally together thoughts like theseand perhaps other thoughts which they did not acknowledge or definethrew an awe about the child as she came onward  let her see nothing strangeno passion or eagernessin thy way of accosting her whispered hester  our pearl is a fitful and fantastic little elf sometimes  especially she is generally intolerant of emotion when she does not fully comprehend the why and wherefore  but the child hath strong affections  she loves me and will love thee  thou canst not think said the minister glancing aside at hester prynne how my heart dreads this interview and yearns for it  but in truth as i already told thee children are not readily won to be familiar with me  they will not climb my knee nor prattle in my ear nor answer to my smile but stand apart and eye me strangely  even little babes when i take them in my arms weep bitterly  yet pearl twice in her little lifetime hath been kind to me  the first timethou knowest it well  the last was when thou ledst her with thee to the house of yonder stern old governor  and thou didst plead so bravely in her behalf and mine answered the mother  i remember it and so shall little pearl fear nothing  she may be strange and shy at first but will soon learn to love thee  by this time pearl had reached the margin of the brook and stood on the further side gazing silently at hester and the clergyman who still sat together on the mossy treetrunk waiting to receive her  just where she had paused the brook chanced to form a pool so smooth and quiet that it reflected a perfect image of her little figure with all the brilliant picturesqueness of her beauty in its adornment of flowers and wreathed foliage but more refined and spiritualized than the reality  this image so nearly identical with the living pearl seemed to communicate somewhat of its own shadowy and intangible quality to the child herself  it was strange the way in which pearl stood looking so steadfastly at them through the dim medium of the forest gloom herself meanwhile all glorified with a ray of sunshine that was attracted thitherward as by a certain sympathy  in the brook beneath stood another childanother and the samewith likewise its ray of golden light  hester felt herself in some indistinct and tantalizing manner estranged from pearl as if the child in her lonely ramble through the forest had strayed out of the sphere in which she and her mother dwelt together and was now vainly seeking to return to it  there were both truth and error in the impression the child and mother were estranged but through hesters fault not pearls since the latter rambled from her side another inmate had been admitted within the circle of the mothers feelings and so modified the aspect of them all that pearl the returning wanderer could not find her wonted place and hardly knew where she was  i have a strange fancy observed the sensitive minister that this brook is the boundary between two worlds and that thou canst never meet thy pearl again  or is she an elfish spirit who as the legends of our childhood taught us is forbidden to cross a running stream  pray hasten her for this delay has already imparted a tremor to my nerves  come dearest child said hester encouragingly and stretching out both her arms  how slow thou art  when hast thou been so sluggish before now  here is a friend of mine who must be thy friend also  thou wilt have twice as much love henceforward as thy mother alone could give thee  leap across the brook and come to us  thou canst leap like a young deer  pearl without responding in any manner to these honeysweet expressions remained on the other side of the brook  now she fixed her bright wild eyes on her mother now on the minister and now included them both in the same glance as if to detect and explain to herself the relation which they bore to one another  for some unaccountable reason as arthur dimmesdale felt the childs eyes upon himself his handwith that gesture so habitual as to have become involuntarystole over his heart at length assuming a singular air of authority pearl stretched out her hand with the small forefinger extended and pointing evidently towards her mothers breast  and beneath in the mirror of the brook there was the flowergirdled and sunny image of little pearl pointing her small forefinger too  thou strange child  why dost thou not come to me exclaimed hester  pearl still pointed with her forefinger and a frown gathered on her browthe more impressive from the childish the almost babylike aspect of the features that conveyed it  as her mother still kept beckoning to her and arraying her face in a holiday suit of unaccustomed smiles the child stamped her foot with a yet more imperious look and gesture  in the brook again was the fantastic beauty of the image with its reflected frown its pointed finger and imperious gesture giving emphasis to the aspect of little pearl  hasten pearl or i shall be angry with thee cried hester prynne who however inured to such behaviour on the elfchilds part at other seasons was naturally anxious for a more seemly deportment now  leap across the brook naughty child and run hither  else i must come to thee  but pearl not a whit startled at her mothers threats any more than mollified by her entreaties now suddenly burst into a fit of passion gesticulating violently and throwing her small figure into the most extravagant contortions  she accompanied this wild outbreak with piercing shrieks which the woods reverberated on all sides so that alone as she was in her childish and unreasonable wrath it seemed as if a hidden multitude were lending her their sympathy and encouragement seen in the brook once more was the shadowy wrath of pearls image crowned and girdled with flowers but stamping its foot wildly gesticulating and in the midst of all still pointing its small forefinger at hesters bosom  i see what ails the child whispered hester to the clergyman and turning pale in spite of a strong effort to conceal her trouble and annoyance children will not abide any the slightest change in the accustomed aspect of things that are daily before their eyes  pearl misses something that she has always seen me wear  i pray you answered the minister if thou hast any means of pacifying the child do it forthwith  save it were the cankered wrath of an old witch like mistress hibbins added he attempting to smile i know nothing that i would not sooner encounter than this passion in a child  in pearls young beauty as in the wrinkled witch it has a preternatural effect  pacify her if thou lovest me  hester turned again towards pearl with a crimson blush upon her cheek a conscious glance aside clergyman and then a heavy sigh while even before she had time to speak the blush yielded to a deadly pallor  pearl said she sadly look down at thy feet  therebefore theeon the hither side of the brook  the child turned her eyes to the point indicated and there lay the scarlet letter so close upon the margin of the stream that the gold embroidery was reflected in it  bring it hither said hester  come thou and take it up answered pearl  was ever such a child observed hester aside to the minister oh i have much to tell thee about her  but in very truth she is right as regards this hateful token  i must bear its torture yet a little longeronly a few days longeruntil we shall have left this region and look back hither as to a land which we have dreamed of  the forest cannot hide it  the midocean shall take it from my hand and swallow it up for ever  with these words she advanced to the margin of the brook took up the scarlet letter and fastened it again into her bosom hopefully but a moment ago as hester had spoken of drowning it in the deep sea there was a sense of inevitable doom upon her as she thus received back this deadly symbol from the hand of fate  she had flung it into infinite space she had drawn an hours free breath and here again was the scarlet misery glittering on the old spot  so it ever is whether thus typified or no that an evil deed invests itself with the character of doom  hester next gathered up the heavy tresses of her hair and confined them beneath her cap  as if there were a withering spell in the sad letter her beauty the warmth and richness of her womanhood departed like fading sunshine and a gray shadow seemed to fall across her  when the dreary change was wrought she extended her hand to pearl  dost thou know thy mother now child asked she reproachfully but with a subdued tone  wilt thou come across the brook and own thy mother now that she has her shame upon hernow that she is sad  yes now i will answered the child bounding across the brook and clasping hester in her arms now thou art my mother indeed and i am thy little pearl  in a mood of tenderness that was not usual with her she drew down her mothers head and kissed her brow and both her cheeks but thenby a kind of necessity that always impelled this child to alloy whatever comfort she might chance to give with a throb of anguishpearl put up her mouth and kissed the scarlet letter too  that was not kind said hester  when thou hast shown me a little love thou mockest me  why doth the minister sit yonder asked pearl  he waits to welcome thee replied her mother  come thou and entreat his blessing  he loves thee my little pearl and loves thy mother too  wilt thou not love him  come he longs to greet thee  doth he love us said pearl looking up with acute intelligence into her mothers face  will he go back with us hand in hand we three together into the town  not now my child answered hester  but in days to come he will walk hand in hand with us  we will have a home and fireside of our own and thou shalt sit upon his knee and he will teach thee many things and love thee dearly  thou wilt love himwilt thou not  and will he always keep his hand over his heart inquired pearl  foolish child what a question is that exclaimed her mother come and ask his blessing  but whether influenced by the jealousy that seems instinctive with every petted child towards a dangerous rival or from whatever caprice of her freakish nature pearl would show no favour to the clergyman  it was only by an exertion of force that her mother brought her up to him hanging back and manifesting her reluctance by odd grimaces of which ever since her babyhood she had possessed a singular variety and could transform her mobile physiognomy into a series of different aspects with a new mischief in them each and all  the ministerpainfully embarrassed but hoping that a kiss might prove a talisman to admit him into the childs kindlier regardsbent forward and impressed one on her brow  hereupon pearl broke away from her mother and running to the brook stooped over it and bathed her forehead until the unwelcome kiss was quite washed off and diffused through a long lapse of the gliding water  she then remained apart silently watching hester and the clergyman while they talked together and made such arrangements as were suggested by their new position and the purposes soon to be fulfilled  and now this fateful interview had come to a close  the dell was to be left in solitude among its dark old trees which with their multitudinous tongues would whisper long of what had passed there and no mortal be the wiser  and the melancholy brook would add this other tale to the mystery with which its little heart was already overburdened and whereof it still kept up a murmuring babble with not a whit more cheerfulness of tone than for ages heretofore    xx  the minister in a maze  as the minister departed in advance of hester prynne and little pearl he threw a backward glance half expecting that he should discover only some faintly traced features or outline of the mother and the child slowly fading into the twilight of the woods  so great a vicissitude in his life could not at once be received as real  but there was hester clad in her gray robe still standing beside the treetrunk which some blast had overthrown a long antiquity ago and which time had ever since been covering with moss so that these two fated ones with earths heaviest burden on them might there sit down together and find a single hours rest and solace  and there was pearl too lightly dancing from the margin of the brooknow that the intrusive third person was goneand taking her old place by her mothers side  so the minister had not fallen asleep and dreamed  in order to free his mind from this indistinctness and duplicity of impression which vexed it with a strange disquietude he recalled and more thoroughly defined the plans which hester and himself had sketched for their departure  it had been determined between them that the old world with its crowds and cities offered them a more eligible shelter and concealment than the wilds of new england or all america with its alternatives of an indian wigwam or the few settlements of europeans scattered thinly along the seaboard  not to speak of the clergymans health so inadequate to sustain the hardships of a forest life his native gifts his culture and his entire development would secure him a home only in the midst of civilization and refinement the higher the state the more delicately adapted to it the man  in furtherance of this choice it so happened that a ship lay in the harbour one of those unquestionable cruisers frequent at that day which without being absolutely outlaws of the deep yet roamed over its surface with a remarkable irresponsibility of character  this vessel had recently arrived from the spanish main and within three days time would sail for bristol  hester prynnewhose vocation as a selfenlisted sister of charity had brought her acquainted with the captain and crewcould take upon herself to secure the passage of two individuals and a child with all the secrecy which circumstances rendered more than desirable  the minister had inquired of hester with no little interest the precise time at which the vessel might be expected to depart  it would probably be on the fourth day from the present this is most fortunate he had then said to himself  now why the reverend mr dimmesdale considered it so very fortunate we hesitate to reveal  neverthelessto hold nothing back from the readerit was because on the third day from the present he was to preach the election sermon and as such an occasion formed an honourable epoch in the life of a new england clergyman he could not have chanced upon a more suitable mode and time of terminating his professional career  at least they shall say of me thought this exemplary man that i leave no public duty unperformed or illperformed  sad indeed that an introspection so profound and acute as this poor ministers should be so miserably deceived  we have had and may still have worse things to tell of him but none we apprehend so pitiably weak no evidence at once so slight and irrefragable of a subtle disease that had long since begun to eat into the real substance of his character  no man for any considerable period can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the true  the excitement of mr dimmesdales feelings as he returned from his interview with hester lent him unaccustomed physical energy and hurried him townward at a rapid pace  the pathway among the woods seemed wilder more uncouth with its rude natural obstacles and less trodden by the foot of man than he remembered it on his outward journey  but he leaped across the plashy places thrust himself through the clinging underbrush climbed the ascent plunged into the hollow and overcame in short all the difficulties of the track with an unweariable activity that astonished him  he could not but recall how feebly and with what frequent pauses for breath he had toiled over the same ground only two days before  as he drew near the town he took an impression of change from the series of familiar objects that presented themselves  it seemed not yesterday not one not two but many days or even years ago since he had quitted them  there indeed was each former trace of the street as he remembered it and all the peculiarities of the houses with the due multitude of gablepeaks and a weathercock at every point where his memory suggested one  not the less however came this importunately obtrusive sense of change  the same was true as regarded the acquaintances whom he met and all the wellknown shapes of human life about the little town  they looked neither older nor younger now the beards of the aged were no whiter nor could the creeping babe of yesterday walk on his feet today it was impossible to describe in what respect they differed from the individuals on whom he had so recently bestowed a parting glance and yet the ministers deepest sense seemed to inform him of their mutability  a similar impression struck him most remarkably as he passed under the walls of his own church  the edifice had so very strange and yet so familiar an aspect that mr dimmesdales mind vibrated between two ideas either that he had seen it only in a dream hitherto or that he was merely dreaming about it now  this phenomenon in the various shapes which it assumed indicated no external change but so sudden and important a change in the spectator of the familiar scene that the intervening space of a single day had operated on his consciousness like the lapse of years  the ministers own will and hesters will and the fate that grew between them had wrought this transformation  it was the same town as heretofore but the same minister returned not from the forest  he might have said to the friends who greeted himi am not the man for whom you take me  i left him yonder in the forest withdrawn into a secret dell by a mossy tree trunk and near a melancholy brook  go seek your minister and see if his emaciated figure his thin cheek his white heavy painwrinkled brow be not flung down there like a castoff garment  his friends no doubt would still have insisted with himthou art thyself the man but the error would have been their own not his  before mr dimmesdale reached home his inner man gave him other evidences of a revolution in the sphere of thought and feeling in truth nothing short of a total change of dynasty and moral code in that interior kingdom was adequate to account for the impulses now communicated to the unfortunate and startled minister  at every step he was incited to do some strange wild wicked thing or other with a sense that it would be at once involuntary and intentional in spite of himself yet growing out of a profounder self than that which opposed the impulse for instance he met one of his own deacons  the good old man addressed him with the paternal affection and patriarchal privilege which his venerable age his upright and holy character and his station in the church entitled him to use and conjoined with this the deep almost worshipping respect which the ministers professional and private claims alike demanded  never was there a more beautiful example of how the majesty of age and wisdom may comport with the obeisance and respect enjoined upon it as from a lower social rank and inferior order of endowment towards a higher  now during a conversation of some two or three moments between the reverend mr dimmesdale and this excellent and hoarybearded deacon it was only by the most careful selfcontrol that the former could refrain from uttering certain blasphemous suggestions that rose into his mind respecting the communionsupper  he absolutely trembled and turned pale as ashes lest his tongue should wag itself in utterance of these horrible matters and plead his own consent for so doing without his having fairly given it  and even with this terror in his heart he could hardly avoid laughing to imagine how the sanctified old patriarchal deacon would have been petrified by his ministers impiety  again another incident of the same nature  hurrying along the street the reverend mr dimmesdale encountered the eldest female member of his church a most pious and exemplary old dame poor widowed lonely and with a heart as full of reminiscences about her dead husband and children and her dead friends of long ago as a burialground is full of storied gravestones  yet all this which would else have been such heavy sorrow was made almost a solemn joy to her devout old soul by religious consolations and the truths of scripture wherewith she had fed herself continually for more than thirty years  and since mr dimmesdale had taken her in charge the good grandams chief earthly comfortwhich unless it had been likewise a heavenly comfort could have been none at allwas to meet her pastor whether casually or of set purpose and be refreshed with a word of warm fragrant heavenbreathing gospel truth from his beloved lips into her dulled but rapturously attentive ear  but on this occasion up to the moment of putting his lips to the old womans ear mr dimmesdale as the great enemy of souls would have it could recall no text of scripture nor aught else except a brief pithy and as it then appeared to him unanswerable argument against the immortality of the human soul  the instilment thereof into her mind would probably have caused this aged sister to drop down dead at once as by the effect of an intensely poisonous infusion  what he really did whisper the minister could never afterwards recollect  there was perhaps a fortunate disorder in his utterance which failed to impart any distinct idea to the good widows comprehension or which providence interpreted after a method of its own  assuredly as the minister looked back he beheld an expression of divine gratitude and ecstasy that seemed like the shine of the celestial city on her face so wrinkled and ashy pale  again a third instance  after parting from the old church member he met the youngest sister of them all  it was a maiden newlywonand won by the reverend mr dimmesdales own sermon on the sabbath after his vigilto barter the transitory pleasures of the world for the heavenly hope that was to assume brighter substance as life grew dark around her and which would gild the utter gloom with final glory  she was fair and pure as a lily that had bloomed in paradise  the minister knew well that he was himself enshrined within the stainless sanctity of her heart which hung its snowy curtains about his image imparting to religion the warmth of love and to love a religious purity satan that afternoon had surely led the poor young girl away from her mothers side and thrown her into the pathway of this sorely tempted orshall we not rather saythis lost and desperate man  as she drew nigh the archfiend whispered him to condense into small compass and drop into her tender bosom a germ of evil that would be sure to blossom darkly soon and bear black fruit betimes  such was his sense of power over this virgin soul trusting him as she did that the minister felt potent to blight all the field of innocence with but one wicked look and develop all its opposite with but a word  sowith a mightier struggle than he had yet sustainedhe held his geneva cloak before his face and hurried onward making no sign of recognition and leaving the young sister to digest his rudeness as she might  she ransacked her consciencewhich was full of harmless little matters like her pocket or her workbagand took herself to task poor thing for a thousand imaginary faults and went about her household duties with swollen eyelids the next morning   before the minister had time to celebrate his victory over this last temptation he was conscious of another impulse more ludicrous and almost as horrible  it waswe blush to tell itit was to stop short in the road and teach some very wicked words to a knot of little puritan children who were playing there and had but just begun to talk  denying himself this freak as unworthy of his cloth he met a drunken seaman one of the ships crew from the spanish main  and here since he had so valiantly forborne all other wickedness poor mr dimmesdale longed at least to shake hands with the tarry blackguard and recreate himself with a few improper jests such as dissolute sailors so abound with and a volley of good round solid satisfactory and heavendefying oaths  it was not so much a better principle as partly his natural good taste and still more his buckramed habit of clerical decorum that carried him safely through the latter crisis  what is it that haunts and tempts me thus cried the minister to himself at length pausing in the street and striking his hand against his forehead  am i mad  or am i given over utterly to the fiend  did i make a contract with him in the forest and sign it with my blood and does he now summon me to its fulfilment by suggesting the performance of every wickedness which his most foul imagination can conceive  at the moment when the reverend mr dimmesdale thus communed with himself and struck his forehead with his hand old mistress hibbins the reputed witchlady is said to have been passing by  she made a very grand appearance having on a high headdress a rich gown of velvet and a ruff done up with the famous yellow starch of which anne turner her especial friend had taught her the secret before this last good lady had been hanged for sir thomas overburys murder  whether the witch had read the ministers thoughts or no she came to a full stop looked shrewdly into his face smiled craftily andthough little given to converse with clergymenbegan a conversation  so reverend sir you have made a visit into the forest observed the witchlady nodding her high headdress at him the next time i pray you to allow me only a fair warning and i shall be proud to bear you company  without taking overmuch upon myself my good word will go far towards gaining any strange gentleman a fair reception from yonder potentate you wot of  i profess madam answered the clergyman with a grave obeisance such as the ladys rank demanded and his own good breeding made imperativei profess on my conscience and character that i am utterly bewildered as touching the purport of your words  i went not into the forest to seek a potentate neither do i at any future time design a visit thither with a view to gaining the favour of such personage  my one sufficient object was to greet that pious friend of mine the apostle eliot and rejoice with him over the many precious souls he hath won from heathendom  ha ha ha cackled the old witchlady still nodding her high headdress at the minister  well well we must needs talk thus in the daytime  you carry it off like an old hand  but at midnight and in the forest we shall have other talk together  she passed on with her aged stateliness but often turning back her head and smiling at him like one willing to recognise a secret intimacy of connexion  have i then sold myself thought the minister to the fiend whom if men say true this yellowstarched and velveted old hag has chosen for her prince and master  the wretched minister  he had made a bargain very like it tempted by a dream of happiness he had yielded himself with deliberate choice as he had never done before to what he knew was deadly sin  and the infectious poison of that sin had been thus rapidly diffused throughout his moral system  it had stupefied all blessed impulses and awakened into vivid life the whole brotherhood of bad ones  scorn bitterness unprovoked malignity gratuitous desire of ill ridicule of whatever was good and holy all awoke to tempt even while they frightened him  and his encounter with old mistress hibbins if it were a real incident did but show its sympathy and fellowship with wicked mortals and the world of perverted spirits  he had by this time reached his dwelling on the edge of the burial ground and hastening up the stairs took refuge in his study  the minister was glad to have reached this shelter without first betraying himself to the world by any of those strange and wicked eccentricities to which he had been continually impelled while passing through the streets  he entered the accustomed room and looked around him on its books its windows its fireplace and the tapestried comfort of the walls with the same perception of strangeness that had haunted him throughout his walk from the forest dell into the town and thitherward  here he had studied and written here gone through fast and vigil and come forth half alive here striven to pray here borne a hundred thousand agonies  there was the bible in its rich old hebrew with moses and the prophets speaking to him and gods voice through all  there on the table with the inky pen beside it was an unfinished sermon with a sentence broken in the midst where his thoughts had ceased to gush out upon the page two days before  he knew that it was himself the thin and whitecheeked minister who had done and suffered these things and written thus far into the election sermon  but he seemed to stand apart and eye this former self with scornful pitying but halfenvious curiosity  that self was gone  another man had returned out of the foresta wiser onewith a knowledge of hidden mysteries which the simplicity of the former never could have reached  a bitter kind of knowledge that  while occupied with these reflections a knock came at the door of the study and the minister said come innot wholly devoid of an idea that he might behold an evil spirit  and so he did  it was old roger chillingworth that entered  the minister stood white and speechless with one hand on the hebrew scriptures and the other spread upon his breast  welcome home reverend sir said the physician and how found you that godly man the apostle eliot  but methinks dear sir you look pale as if the travel through the wilderness had been too sore for you  will not my aid be requisite to put you in heart and strength to preach your election sermon  nay i think not so rejoined the reverend mr dimmesdale  my journey and the sight of the holy apostle yonder and the free air which i have breathed have done me good after so long confinement in my study  i think to need no more of your drugs my kind physician good though they be and administered by a friendly hand  all this time roger chillingworth was looking at the minister with the grave and intent regard of a physician towards his patient  but in spite of this outward show the latter was almost convinced of the old mans knowledge or at least his confident suspicion with respect to his own interview with hester prynne  the physician knew then that in the ministers regard he was no longer a trusted friend but his bitterest enemy  so much being known it would appear natural that a part of it should be expressed  it is singular however how long a time often passes before words embody things and with what security two persons who choose to avoid a certain subject may approach its very verge and retire without disturbing it  thus the minister felt no apprehension that roger chillingworth would touch in express words upon the real position which they sustained towards one another  yet did the physician in his dark way creep frightfully near the secret  were it not better said he that you use my poor skill tonight  verily dear sir we must take pains to make you strong and vigorous for this occasion of the election discourse  the people look for great things from you apprehending that another year may come about and find their pastor gone  yes to another world replied the minister with pious resignation  heaven grant it be a better one for in good sooth i hardly think to tarry with my flock through the flitting seasons of another year  but touching your medicine kind sir in my present frame of body i need it not  i joy to hear it answered the physician  it may be that my remedies so long administered in vain begin now to take due effect  happy man were i and well deserving of new englands gratitude could i achieve this cure  i thank you from my heart most watchful friend said the reverend mr dimmesdale with a solemn smile  i thank you and can but requite your good deeds with my prayers  a good mans prayers are golden recompense rejoined old roger chillingworth as he took his leave  yea they are the current gold coin of the new jerusalem with the kings own mint mark on them  left alone the minister summoned a servant of the house and requested food which being set before him he ate with ravenous appetite  then flinging the already written pages of the election sermon into the fire he forthwith began another which he wrote with such an impulsive flow of thought and emotion that he fancied himself inspired and only wondered that heaven should see fit to transmit the grand and solemn music of its oracles through so foul an organ pipe as he however leaving that mystery to solve itself or go unsolved for ever he drove his task onward with earnest haste and ecstasy  thus the night fled away as if it were a winged steed and he careering on it morning came and peeped blushing through the curtains and at last sunrise threw a golden beam into the study and laid it right across the ministers bedazzled eyes there he was with the pen still between his fingers and a vast immeasurable tract of written space behind him    xxi  the new england holiday  betimes in the morning of the day on which the new governor was to receive his office at the hands of the people hester prynne and little pearl came into the marketplace  it was already thronged with the craftsmen and other plebeian inhabitants of the town in considerable numbers among whom likewise were many rough figures whose attire of deerskins marked them as belonging to some of the forest settlements which surrounded the little metropolis of the colony  on this public holiday as on all other occasions for seven years past hester was clad in a garment of coarse gray cloth not more by its hue than by some indescribable peculiarity in its fashion it had the effect of making her fade personally out of sight and outline while again the scarlet letter brought her back from this twilight indistinctness and revealed her under the moral aspect of its own illumination  her face so long familiar to the townspeople showed the marble quietude which they were accustomed to behold there  it was like a mask or rather like the frozen calmness of a dead womans features owing this dreary resemblance to the fact that hester was actually dead in respect to any claim of sympathy and had departed out of the world with which she still seemed to mingle  it might be on this one day that there was an expression unseen before nor indeed vivid enough to be detected now unless some preternaturally gifted observer should have first read the heart and have afterwards sought a corresponding development in the countenance and mien  such a spiritual seer might have conceived that after sustaining the gaze of the multitude through several miserable years as a necessity a penance and something which it was a stern religion to endure she now for one last time more encountered it freely and voluntarily in order to convert what had so long been agony into a kind of triumph  look your last on the scarlet letter and its wearerthe peoples victim and lifelong bondslave as they fancied her might say to them  yet a little while and she will be beyond your reach  a few hours longer and the deep mysterious ocean will quench and hide for ever the symbol which ye have caused to burn on her bosom  nor were it an inconsistency too improbable to be assigned to human nature should we suppose a feeling of regret in hesters mind at the moment when she was about to win her freedom from the pain which had been thus deeply incorporated with her being  might there not be an irresistible desire to quaff a last long breathless draught of the cup of wormwood and aloes with which nearly all her years of womanhood had been perpetually flavoured  the wine of life henceforth to be presented to her lips must be indeed rich delicious and exhilarating in its chased and golden beaker or else leave an inevitable and weary languor after the lees of bitterness wherewith she had been drugged as with a cordial of intensest potency  pearl was decked out with airy gaiety  it would have been impossible to guess that this bright and sunny apparition owed its existence to the shape of gloomy gray or that a fancy at once so gorgeous and so delicate as must have been requisite to contrive the childs apparel was the same that had achieved a task perhaps more difficult in imparting so distinct a peculiarity to hesters simple robe  the dress so proper was it to little pearl seemed an effluence or inevitable development and outward manifestation of her character no more to be separated from her than the manyhued brilliancy from a butterflys wing or the painted glory from the leaf of a bright flower  as with these so with the child her garb was all of one idea with her nature  on this eventful day moreover there was a certain singular inquietude and excitement in her mood resembling nothing so much as the shimmer of a diamond that sparkles and flashes with the varied throbbings of the breast on which it is displayed  children have always a sympathy in the agitations of those connected with them always especially a sense of any trouble or impending revolution of whatever kind in domestic circumstances and therefore pearl who was the gem on her mothers unquiet bosom betrayed by the very dance of her spirits the emotions which none could detect in the marble passiveness of hesters brow  this effervescence made her flit with a birdlike movement rather than walk by her mothers side  she broke continually into shouts of a wild inarticulate and sometimes piercing music  when they reached the marketplace she became still more restless on perceiving the stir and bustle that enlivened the spot for it was usually more like the broad and lonesome green before a village meetinghouse than the centre of a towns business  why what is this mother cried she  wherefore have all the people left their work today  is it a playday for the whole world  see there is the blacksmith  he has washed his sooty face and put on his sabbathday clothes and looks as if he would gladly be merry if any kind body would only teach him how  and there is master brackett the old jailer nodding and smiling at me  why does he do so mother  he remembers thee a little babe my child answered hester  he should not nod and smile at me for all thatthe black grim uglyeyed old man said pearl  he may nod at thee if he will for thou art clad in gray and wearest the scarlet letter but see mother how many faces of strange people and indians among them and sailors  what have they all come to do here in the marketplace  they wait to see the procession pass said hester  for the governor and the magistrates are to go by and the ministers and all the great people and good people with the music and the soldiers marching before them  and will the minister be there asked pearl  and will he hold out both his hands to me as when thou ledst me to him from the brookside  he will be there child answered her mother but he will not greet thee today nor must thou greet him  what a strange sad man is he said the child as if speaking partly to herself  in the dark nighttime he calls us to him and holds thy hand and mine as when we stood with him on the scaffold yonder  and in the deep forest where only the old trees can hear and the strip of sky see it he talks with thee sitting on a heap of moss  and he kisses my forehead too so that the little brook would hardly wash it off  but here in the sunny day and among all the people he knows us not nor must we know him  a strange sad man is he with his hand always over his heart  be quiet pearlthou understandest not these things said her mother  think not now of the minister but look about thee and see how cheery is everybodys face today  the children have come from their schools and the grown people from their workshops and their fields on purpose to be happy for today a new man is beginning to rule over them and soas has been the custom of mankind ever since a nation was first gatheredthey make merry and rejoice as if a good and golden year were at length to pass over the poor old world  it was as hester said in regard to the unwonted jollity that brightened the faces of the people  into this festal season of the yearas it already was and continued to be during the greater part of two centuriesthe puritans compressed whatever mirth and public joy they deemed allowable to human infirmity thereby so far dispelling the customary cloud that for the space of a single holiday they appeared scarcely more grave than most other communities at a period of general affliction  but we perhaps exaggerate the gray or sable tinge which undoubtedly characterized the mood and manners of the age  the persons now in the marketplace of boston had not been born to an inheritance of puritanic gloom  they were native englishmen whose fathers had lived in the sunny richness of the elizabethan epoch a time when the life of england viewed as one great mass would appear to have been as stately magnificent and joyous as the world has ever witnessed  had they followed their hereditary taste the new england settlers would have illustrated all events of public importance by bonfires banquets pageantries and processions  nor would it have been impracticable in the observance of majestic ceremonies to combine mirthful recreation with solemnity and give as it were a grotesque and brilliant embroidery to the great robe of state which a nation at such festivals puts on  there was some shadow of an attempt of this kind in the mode of celebrating the day on which the political year of the colony commenced  the dim reflection of a remembered splendour a colourless and manifold diluted repetition of what they had beheld in proud old londonwe will not say at a royal coronation but at a lord mayors showmight be traced in the customs which our forefathers instituted with reference to the annual installation of magistrates  the fathers and founders of the commonwealththe statesman the priest and the soldierseemed it a duty then to assume the outward state and majesty which in accordance with antique style was looked upon as the proper garb of public and social eminence  all came forth to move in procession before the peoples eye and thus impart a needed dignity to the simple framework of a government so newly constructed  then too the people were countenanced if not encouraged in relaxing the severe and close application to their various modes of rugged industry which at all other times seemed of the same piece and material with their religion  here it is true were none of the appliances which popular merriment would so readily have found in the england of elizabeths time or that of jamesno rude shows of a theatrical kind no minstrel with his harp and legendary ballad nor gleeman with an ape dancing to his music no juggler with his tricks of mimic witchcraft no merry andrew to stir up the multitude with jests perhaps a hundred years old but still effective by their appeals to the very broadest sources of mirthful sympathy  all such professors of the several branches of jocularity would have been sternly repressed not only by the rigid discipline of law but by the general sentiment which give law its vitality  not the less however the great honest face of the people smiledgrimly perhaps but widely too  nor were sports wanting such as the colonists had witnessed and shared in long ago at the country fairs and on the villagegreens of england and which it was thought well to keep alive on this new soil for the sake of the courage and manliness that were essential in them  wrestling matches in the different fashions of cornwall and devonshire were seen here and there about the marketplace in one corner there was a friendly bout at quarterstaff andwhat attracted most interest of allon the platform of the pillory already so noted in our pages two masters of defence were commencing an exhibition with the buckler and broadsword  but much to the disappointment of the crowd this latter business was broken off by the interposition of the town beadle who had no idea of permitting the majesty of the law to be violated by such an abuse of one of its consecrated places  it may not be too much to affirm on the whole the people being then in the first stages of joyless deportment and the offspring of sires who had known how to be merry in their day that they would compare favourably in point of holiday keeping with their descendants even at so long an interval as ourselves  their immediate posterity the generation next to the early emigrants wore the blackest shade of puritanism and so darkened the national visage with it that all the subsequent years have not sufficed to clear it up  we have yet to learn again the forgotten art of gaiety  the picture of human life in the marketplace though its general tint was the sad gray brown or black of the english emigrants was yet enlivened by some diversity of hue  a party of indiansin their savage finery of curiously embroidered deerskin robes wampumbelts red and yellow ochre and feathers and armed with the bow and arrow and stoneheaded spearstood apart with countenances of inflexible gravity beyond what even the puritan aspect could attain  nor wild as were these painted barbarians were they the wildest feature of the scene  this distinction could more justly be claimed by some marinersa part of the crew of the vessel from the spanish mainwho had come ashore to see the humours of election day they were roughlooking desperadoes with sunblackened faces and an immensity of beard their wide short trousers were confined about the waist by belts often clasped with a rough plate of gold and sustaining always a long knife and in some instances a sword  from beneath their broadbrimmed hats of palmleaf gleamed eyes which even in goodnature and merriment had a kind of animal ferocity  they transgressed without fear or scruple the rules of behaviour that were binding on all others smoking tobacco under the beadles very nose although each whiff would have cost a townsman a shilling and quaffing at their pleasure draughts of wine or aquavitae from pocket flasks which they freely tendered to the gaping crowd around them  it remarkably characterised the incomplete morality of the age rigid as we call it that a licence was allowed the seafaring class not merely for their freaks on shore but for far more desperate deeds on their proper element the sailor of that day would go near to be arraigned as a pirate in our own  there could be little doubt for instance that this very ships crew though no unfavourable specimens of the nautical brotherhood had been guilty as we should phrase it of depredations on the spanish commerce such as would have perilled all their necks in a modern court of justice  but the sea in those old times heaved swelled and foamed very much at its own will or subject only to the tempestuous wind with hardly any attempts at regulation by human law  the buccaneer on the wave might relinquish his calling and become at once if he chose a man of probity and piety on land nor even in the full career of his reckless life was he regarded as a personage with whom it was disreputable to traffic or casually associate  thus the puritan elders in their black cloaks starched bands and steeplecrowned hats smiled not unbenignantly at the clamour and rude deportment of these jolly seafaring men and it excited neither surprise nor animadversion when so reputable a citizen as old roger chillingworth the physician was seen to enter the marketplace in close and familiar talk with the commander of the questionable vessel  the latter was by far the most showy and gallant figure so far as apparel went anywhere to be seen among the multitude  he wore a profusion of ribbons on his garment and gold lace on his hat which was also encircled by a gold chain and surmounted with a feather  there was a sword at his side and a swordcut on his forehead which by the arrangement of his hair he seemed anxious rather to display than hide  a landsman could hardly have worn this garb and shown this face and worn and shown them both with such a galliard air without undergoing stern question before a magistrate and probably incurring a fine or imprisonment or perhaps an exhibition in the stocks  as regarded the shipmaster however all was looked upon as pertaining to the character as to a fish his glistening scales  after parting from the physician the commander of the bristol ship strolled idly through the marketplace until happening to approach the spot where hester prynne was standing he appeared to recognise and did not hesitate to address her  as was usually the case wherever hester stood a small vacant areaa sort of magic circlehad formed itself about her into which though the people were elbowing one another at a little distance none ventured or felt disposed to intrude  it was a forcible type of the moral solitude in which the scarlet letter enveloped its fated wearer partly by her own reserve and partly by the instinctive though no longer so unkindly withdrawal of her fellowcreatures  now if never before it answered a good purpose by enabling hester and the seaman to speak together without risk of being overheard and so changed was hester prynnes repute before the public that the matron in town most eminent for rigid morality could not have held such intercourse with less result of scandal than herself  so mistress said the mariner i must bid the steward make ready one more berth than you bargained for  no fear of scurvy or ship fever this voyage  what with the ships surgeon and this other doctor our only danger will be from drug or pill more by token as there is a lot of apothecarys stuff aboard which i traded for with a spanish vessel  what mean you inquired hester startled more than she permitted to appear  have you another passenger  why know you not cried the shipmaster that this physician herechillingworth he calls himselfis minded to try my cabinfare with you  ay ay you must have known it for he tells me he is of your party and a close friend to the gentleman you spoke ofhe that is in peril from these sour old puritan rulers  they know each other well indeed replied hester with a mien of calmness though in the utmost consternation  they have long dwelt together  nothing further passed between the mariner and hester prynne but at that instant she beheld old roger chillingworth himself standing in the remotest corner of the marketplace and smiling on her a smile whichacross the wide and bustling square and through all the talk and laughter and various thoughts moods and interests of the crowdconveyed secret and fearful meaning    xxii  the procession  before hester prynne could call together her thoughts and consider what was practicable to be done in this new and startling aspect of affairs the sound of military music was heard approaching along a contiguous street  it denoted the advance of the procession of magistrates and citizens on its way towards the meetinghouse where in compliance with a custom thus early established and ever since observed the reverend mr dimmesdale was to deliver an election sermon  soon the head of the procession showed itself with a slow and stately march turning a corner and making its way across the marketplace  first came the music  it comprised a variety of instruments perhaps imperfectly adapted to one another and played with no great skill but yet attaining the great object for which the harmony of drum and clarion addresses itself to the multitudethat of imparting a higher and more heroic air to the scene of life that passes before the eye  little pearl at first clapped her hands but then lost for an instant the restless agitation that had kept her in a continual effervescence throughout the morning she gazed silently and seemed to be borne upward like a floating seabird on the long heaves and swells of sound  but she was brought back to her former mood by the shimmer of the sunshine on the weapons and bright armour of the military company which followed after the music and formed the honorary escort of the procession  this body of soldierywhich still sustains a corporate existence and marches down from past ages with an ancient and honourable famewas composed of no mercenary materials  its ranks were filled with gentlemen who felt the stirrings of martial impulse and sought to establish a kind of college of arms where as in an association of knights templars they might learn the science and so far as peaceful exercise would teach them the practices of war  the high estimation then placed upon the military character might be seen in the lofty port of each individual member of the company  some of them indeed by their services in the low countries and on other fields of european warfare had fairly won their title to assume the name and pomp of soldiership  the entire array moreover clad in burnished steel and with plumage nodding over their bright morions had a brilliancy of effect which no modern display can aspire to equal  and yet the men of civil eminence who came immediately behind the military escort were better worth a thoughtful observers eye  even in outward demeanour they showed a stamp of majesty that made the warriors haughty stride look vulgar if not absurd  it was an age when what we call talent had far less consideration than now but the massive materials which produce stability and dignity of character a great deal more  the people possessed by hereditary right the quality of reverence which in their descendants if it survive at all exists in smaller proportion and with a vastly diminished force in the selection and estimate of public men  the change may be for good or ill and is partly perhaps for both  in that old day the english settler on these rude shoreshaving left king nobles and all degrees of awful rank behind while still the faculty and necessity of reverence was strong in himbestowed it on the white hair and venerable brow of ageon longtried integrityon solid wisdom and sadcoloured experienceon endowments of that grave and weighty order which gave the idea of permanence and comes under the general definition of respectability  these primitive statesmen thereforebradstreet endicott dudley bellingham and their compeerswho were elevated to power by the early choice of the people seem to have been not often brilliant but distinguished by a ponderous sobriety rather than activity of intellect  they had fortitude and selfreliance and in time of difficulty or peril stood up for the welfare of the state like a line of cliffs against a tempestuous tide  the traits of character here indicated were well represented in the square cast of countenance and large physical development of the new colonial magistrates  so far as a demeanour of natural authority was concerned the mother country need not have been ashamed to see these foremost men of an actual democracy adopted into the house of peers or make the privy council of the sovereign  next in order to the magistrates came the young and eminently distinguished divine from whose lips the religious discourse of the anniversary was expected  his was the profession at that era in which intellectual ability displayed itself far more than in political life forleaving a higher motive out of the question it offered inducements powerful enough in the almost worshipping respect of the community to win the most aspiring ambition into its service  even political poweras in the case of increase matherwas within the grasp of a successful priest  it was the observation of those who beheld him now that never since mr dimmesdale first set his foot on the new england shore had he exhibited such energy as was seen in the gait and air with which he kept his pace in the procession  there was no feebleness of step as at other times his frame was not bent nor did his hand rest ominously upon his heart  yet if the clergyman were rightly viewed his strength seemed not of the body  it might be spiritual and imparted to him by angelical ministrations  it might be the exhilaration of that potent cordial which is distilled only in the furnaceglow of earnest and longcontinued thought  or perchance his sensitive temperament was invigorated by the loud and piercing music that swelled heavenward and uplifted him on its ascending wave nevertheless so abstracted was his look it might be questioned whether mr dimmesdale even heard the music  there was his body moving onward and with an unaccustomed force  but where was his mind  far and deep in its own region busying itself with preternatural activity to marshal a procession of stately thoughts that were soon to issue thence and so he saw nothing heard nothing knew nothing of what was around him but the spiritual element took up the feeble frame and carried it along unconscious of the burden and converting it to spirit like itself  men of uncommon intellect who have grown morbid possess this occasional power of mighty effort into which they throw the life of many days and then are lifeless for as many more  hester prynne gazing steadfastly at the clergyman felt a dreary influence come over her but wherefore or whence she knew not unless that he seemed so remote from her own sphere and utterly beyond her reach  one glance of recognition she had imagined must needs pass between them  she thought of the dim forest with its little dell of solitude and love and anguish and the mossy treetrunk where sitting handinhand they had mingled their sad and passionate talk with the melancholy murmur of the brook  how deeply had they known each other then  and was this the man  she hardly knew him now  he moving proudly past enveloped as it were in the rich music with the procession of majestic and venerable fathers he so unattainable in his worldly position and still more so in that far vista of his unsympathizing thoughts through which she now beheld him  her spirit sank with the idea that all must have been a delusion and that vividly as she had dreamed it there could be no real bond betwixt the clergyman and herself  and thus much of woman was there in hester that she could scarcely forgive himleast of all now when the heavy footstep of their approaching fate might be heard nearer nearer nearerfor being able so completely to withdraw himself from their mutual worldwhile she groped darkly and stretched forth her cold hands and found him not  pearl either saw and responded to her mothers feelings or herself felt the remoteness and intangibility that had fallen around the minister  while the procession passed the child was uneasy fluttering up and down like a bird on the point of taking flight  when the whole had gone by she looked up into hesters face  mother said she was that the same minister that kissed me by the brook  hold thy peace dear little pearl whispered her mother  we must not always talk in the marketplace of what happens to us in the forest  i could not be sure that it was heso strange he looked continued the child  else i would have run to him and bid him kiss me now before all the people even as he did yonder among the dark old trees  what would the minister have said mother would he have clapped his hand over his heart and scowled on me and bid me begone  what should he say pearl answered hester save that it was no time to kiss and that kisses are not to be given in the marketplace  well for thee foolish child that thou didst not speak to him  another shade of the same sentiment in reference to mr dimmesdale was expressed by a person whose eccentricitiesinsanity as we should term itled her to do what few of the townspeople would have ventured onto begin a conversation with the wearer of the scarlet letter in public  it was mistress hibbins who arrayed in great magnificence with a triple ruff a broidered stomacher a gown of rich velvet and a goldheaded cane had come forth to see the procession  as this ancient lady had the renown which subsequently cost her no less a price than her life of being a principal actor in all the works of necromancy that were continually going forward the crowd gave way before her and seemed to fear the touch of her garment as if it carried the plague among its gorgeous folds seen in conjunction with hester prynnekindly as so many now felt towards the latterthe dread inspired by mistress hibbins had doubled and caused a general movement from that part of the marketplace in which the two women stood  now what mortal imagination could conceive it whispered the old lady confidentially to hester  yonder divine man  that saint on earth as the people uphold him to be and asi must needs sayhe really looks  who now that saw him pass in the procession would think how little while it is since he went forth out of his studychewing a hebrew text of scripture in his mouth i warrantto take an airing in the forest  aha we know what that means hester prynne  but truly forsooth i find it hard to believe him the same man  many a church member saw i walking behind the music that has danced in the same measure with me when somebody was fiddler and it might be an indian powwow or a lapland wizard changing hands with us  that is but a trifle when a woman knows the world  but this minister  couldst thou surely tell hester whether he was the same man that encountered thee on the forest path  madam i know not of what you speak answered hester prynne feeling mistress hibbins to be of infirm mind yet strangely startled and awestricken by the confidence with which she affirmed a personal connexion between so many persons herself among them and the evil one  it is not for me to talk lightly of a learned and pious minister of the word like the reverend mr dimmesdale  fie womanfie cried the old lady shaking her finger at hester  dost thou think i have been to the forest so many times and have yet no skill to judge who else has been there yea though no leaf of the wild garlands which they wore while they danced be left in their hair  i know thee hester for i behold the token  we may all see it in the sunshine and it glows like a red flame in the dark  thou wearest it openly so there need be no question about that  but this minister  let me tell thee in thine ear  when the black man sees one of his own servants signed and sealed so shy of owning to the bond as is the reverend mr dimmesdale he hath a way of ordering matters so that the mark shall be disclosed in open daylight to the eyes of all the world  what is that the minister seeks to hide with his hand always over his heart  ha hester prynne  what is it good mistress hibbins eagerly asked little pearl hast thou seen it  no matter darling responded mistress hibbins making pearl a profound reverence  thou thyself wilt see it one time or another  they say child thou art of the lineage of the prince of air  wilt thou ride with me some fine night to see thy father  then thou shalt know wherefore the minister keeps his hand over his heart  laughing so shrilly that all the marketplace could hear her the weird old gentlewoman took her departure  by this time the preliminary prayer had been offered in the meetinghouse and the accents of the reverend mr dimmesdale were heard commencing his discourse  an irresistible feeling kept hester near the spot  as the sacred edifice was too much thronged to admit another auditor she took up her position close beside the scaffold of the pillory  it was in sufficient proximity to bring the whole sermon to her ears in the shape of an indistinct but varied murmur and flow of the ministers very peculiar voice  this vocal organ was in itself a rich endowment insomuch that a listener comprehending nothing of the language in which the preacher spoke might still have been swayed to and fro by the mere tone and cadence  like all other music it breathed passion and pathos and emotions high or tender in a tongue native to the human heart wherever educated  muffled as the sound was by its passage through the church walls hester prynne listened with such intenseness and sympathized so intimately that the sermon had throughout a meaning for her entirely apart from its indistinguishable words  these perhaps if more distinctly heard might have been only a grosser medium and have clogged the spiritual sense  now she caught the low undertone as of the wind sinking down to repose itself then ascended with it as it rose through progressive gradations of sweetness and power until its volume seemed to envelop her with an atmosphere of awe and solemn grandeur  and yet majestic as the voice sometimes became there was for ever in it an essential character of plaintiveness  a loud or low expression of anguishthe whisper or the shriek as it might be conceived of suffering humanity that touched a sensibility in every bosom  at times this deep strain of pathos was all that could be heard and scarcely heard sighing amid a desolate silence  but even when the ministers voice grew high and commandingwhen it gushed irrepressibly upwardwhen it assumed its utmost breadth and power so overfilling the church as to burst its way through the solid walls and diffuse itself in the open airstill if the auditor listened intently and for the purpose he could detect the same cry of pain  what was it  the complaint of a human heart sorrowladen perchance guilty telling its secret whether of guilt or sorrow to the great heart of mankind beseeching its sympathy or forgivenessat every momentin each accentand never in vain  it was this profound and continual undertone that gave the clergyman his most appropriate power  during all this time hester stood statuelike at the foot of the scaffold  if the ministers voice had not kept her there there would nevertheless have been an inevitable magnetism in that spot whence she dated the first hour of her life of ignominy  there was a sense within hertoo illdefined to be made a thought but weighing heavily on her mindthat her whole orb of life both before and after was connected with this spot as with the one point that gave it unity  little pearl meanwhile had quitted her mothers side and was playing at her own will about the marketplace  she made the sombre crowd cheerful by her erratic and glistening ray even as a bird of bright plumage illuminates a whole tree of dusky foliage by darting to and fro half seen and half concealed amid the twilight of the clustering leaves  she had an undulating but oftentimes a sharp and irregular movement  it indicated the restless vivacity of her spirit which today was doubly indefatigable in its tiptoe dance because it was played upon and vibrated with her mothers disquietude  whenever pearl saw anything to excite her ever active and wandering curiosity she flew thitherward and as we might say seized upon that man or thing as her own property so far as she desired it but without yielding the minutest degree of control over her motions in requital  the puritans looked on and if they smiled were none the less inclined to pronounce the child a demon offspring from the indescribable charm of beauty and eccentricity that shone through her little figure and sparkled with its activity  she ran and looked the wild indian in the face and he grew conscious of a nature wilder than his own  thence with native audacity but still with a reserve as characteristic she flew into the midst of a group of mariners the swarthycheeked wild men of the ocean as the indians were of the land and they gazed wonderingly and admiringly at pearl as if a flake of the seafoam had taken the shape of a little maid and were gifted with a soul of the seafire that flashes beneath the prow in the nighttime  one of these seafaring men the shipmaster indeed who had spoken to hester prynne was so smitten with pearls aspect that he attempted to lay hands upon her with purpose to snatch a kiss  finding it as impossible to touch her as to catch a hummingbird in the air he took from his hat the gold chain that was twisted about it and threw it to the child  pearl immediately twined it around her neck and waist with such happy skill that once seen there it became a part of her and it was difficult to imagine her without it  thy mother is yonder woman with the scarlet letter said the seaman wilt thou carry her a message from me  if the message pleases me i will answered pearl  then tell her rejoined he that i spake again with the blackavisaged hump shouldered old doctor and he engages to bring his friend the gentleman she wots of aboard with him  so let thy mother take no thought save for herself and thee  wilt thou tell her this thou witchbaby  mistress hibbins says my father is the prince of the air cried pearl with a naughty smile  if thou callest me that illname i shall tell him of thee and he will chase thy ship with a tempest  pursuing a zigzag course across the marketplace the child returned to her mother and communicated what the mariner had said  hesters strong calm steadfastlyenduring spirit almost sank at last on beholding this dark and grim countenance of an inevitable doom which at the moment when a passage seemed to open for the minister and herself out of their labyrinth of miseryshowed itself with an unrelenting smile right in the midst of their path  with her mind harassed by the terrible perplexity in which the shipmasters intelligence involved her she was also subjected to another trial  there were many people present from the country round about who had often heard of the scarlet letter and to whom it had been made terrific by a hundred false or exaggerated rumours but who had never beheld it with their own bodily eyes  these after exhausting other modes of amusement now thronged about hester prynne with rude and boorish intrusiveness  unscrupulous as it was however it could not bring them nearer than a circuit of several yards  at that distance they accordingly stood fixed there by the centrifugal force of the repugnance which the mystic symbol inspired  the whole gang of sailors likewise observing the press of spectators and learning the purport of the scarlet letter came and thrust their sunburnt and desperadolooking faces into the ring  even the indians were affected by a sort of cold shadow of the white mans curiosity and gliding through the crowd fastened their snakelike black eyes on hesters bosom conceiving perhaps that the wearer of this brilliantly embroidered badge must needs be a personage of high dignity among her people  lastly the inhabitants of the town their own interest in this wornout subject languidly reviving itself by sympathy with what they saw others feel lounged idly to the same quarter and tormented hester prynne perhaps more than all the rest with their cool wellacquainted gaze at her familiar shame  hester saw and recognized the selfsame faces of that group of matrons who had awaited her forthcoming from the prisondoor seven years ago all save one the youngest and only compassionate among them whose burialrobe she had since made at the final hour when she was so soon to fling aside the burning letter it had strangely become the centre of more remark and excitement and was thus made to sear her breast more painfully than at any time since the first day she put it on  while hester stood in that magic circle of ignominy where the cunning cruelty of her sentence seemed to have fixed her for ever the admirable preacher was looking down from the sacred pulpit upon an audience whose very inmost spirits had yielded to his control  the sainted minister in the church  the woman of the scarlet letter in the marketplace  what imagination would have been irreverent enough to surmise that the same scorching stigma was on them both    xxiii   the revelation of the scarlet letter   the eloquent voice on which the souls of the listening audience had been borne aloft as on the swelling waves of the sea at length came to a pause  there was a momentary silence profound as what should follow the utterance of oracles  then ensued a murmur and halfhushed tumult as if the auditors released from the high spell that had transported them into the region of anothers mind were returning into themselves with all their awe and wonder still heavy on them  in a moment more the crowd began to gush forth from the doors of the church  now that there was an end they needed more breath more fit to support the gross and earthly life into which they relapsed than that atmosphere which the preacher had converted into words of flame and had burdened with the rich fragrance of his thought  in the open air their rapture broke into speech  the street and the marketplace absolutely babbled from side to side with applauses of the minister  his hearers could not rest until they had told one another of what each knew better than he could tell or hear  according to their united testimony never had man spoken in so wise so high and so holy a spirit as he that spake this day nor had inspiration ever breathed through mortal lips more evidently than it did through his  its influence could be seen as it were descending upon him and possessing him and continually lifting him out of the written discourse that lay before him and filling him with ideas that must have been as marvellous to himself as to his audience  his subject it appeared had been the relation between the deity and the communities of mankind with a special reference to the new england which they were here planting in the wilderness  and as he drew towards the close a spirit as of prophecy had come upon him constraining him to its purpose as mightily as the old prophets of israel were constrained only with this difference that whereas the jewish seers had denounced judgments and ruin on their country it was his mission to foretell a high and glorious destiny for the newly gathered people of the lord  but throughout it all and through the whole discourse there had been a certain deep sad undertone of pathos which could not be interpreted otherwise than as the natural regret of one soon to pass away  yes their minister whom they so lovedand who so loved them all that he could not depart heavenward without a sighhad the foreboding of untimely death upon him and would soon leave them in their tears  this idea of his transitory stay on earth gave the last emphasis to the effect which the preacher had produced it was as if an angel in his passage to the skies had shaken his bright wings over the people for an instantat once a shadow and a splendourand had shed down a shower of golden truths upon them  thus there had come to the reverend mr dimmesdaleas to most men in their various spheres though seldom recognised until they see it far behind theman epoch of life more brilliant and full of triumph than any previous one or than any which could hereafter be  he stood at this moment on the very proudest eminence of superiority to which the gifts or intellect rich lore prevailing eloquence and a reputation of whitest sanctity could exalt a clergyman in new englands earliest days when the professional character was of itself a lofty pedestal  such was the position which the minister occupied as he bowed his head forward on the cushions of the pulpit at the close of his election sermon  meanwhile hester prynne was standing beside the scaffold of the pillory with the scarlet letter still burning on her breast  now was heard again the clamour of the music and the measured tramp of the military escort issuing from the church door  the procession was to be marshalled thence to the town hall where a solemn banquet would complete the ceremonies of the day  once more therefore the train of venerable and majestic fathers were seen moving through a broad pathway of the people who drew back reverently on either side as the governor and magistrates the old and wise men the holy ministers and all that were eminent and renowned advanced into the midst of them when they were fairly in the marketplace their presence was greeted by a shout  thisthough doubtless it might acquire additional force and volume from the childlike loyalty which the age awarded to its rulerswas felt to be an irrepressible outburst of enthusiasm kindled in the auditors by that high strain of eloquence which was yet reverberating in their ears each felt the impulse in himself and in the same breath caught it from his neighbour  within the church it had hardly been kept down beneath the sky it pealed upward to the zenith  there were human beings enough and enough of highly wrought and symphonious feeling to produce that more impressive sound than the organ tones of the blast or the thunder or the roar of the sea even that mighty swell of many voices blended into one great voice by the universal impulse which makes likewise one vast heart out of the many  never from the soil of new england had gone up such a shout  never on new england soil had stood the man so honoured by his mortal brethren as the preacher  how fared it with him then  were there not the brilliant particles of a halo in the air about his head  so etherealised by spirit as he was and so apotheosised by worshipping admirers did his footsteps in the procession really tread upon the dust of earth  as the ranks of military men and civil fathers moved onward all eyes were turned towards the point where the minister was seen to approach among them  the shout died into a murmur as one portion of the crowd after another obtained a glimpse of him how feeble and pale he looked amid all his triumph  the energyor say rather the inspiration which had held him up until he should have delivered the sacred message that had brought its own strength along with it from heavenwas withdrawn now that it had so faithfully performed its office the glow which they had just before beheld burning on his cheek was extinguished like a flame that sinks down hopelessly among the late decaying embers  it seemed hardly the face of a man alive with such a deathlike hue it was hardly a man with life in him that tottered on his path so nervously yet tottered and did not fall  one of his clerical brethrenit was the venerable john wilsonobserving the state in which mr dimmesdale was left by the retiring wave of intellect and sensibility stepped forward hastily to offer his support  the minister tremulously but decidedly repelled the old mans arm  he still walked onward if that movement could be so described which rather resembled the wavering effort of an infant with its mothers arms in view outstretched to tempt him forward  and now almost imperceptible as were the latter steps of his progress he had come opposite the wellremembered and weatherdarkened scaffold where long since with all that dreary lapse of time between hester prynne had encountered the worlds ignominious stare there stood hester holding little pearl by the hand  and there was the scarlet letter on her breast  the minister here made a pause although the music still played the stately and rejoicing march to which the procession moved  it summoned him onwardinward to the festivalbut here he made a pause  bellingham for the last few moments had kept an anxious eye upon him  he now left his own place in the procession and advanced to give assistance judging from mr dimmesdales aspect that he must otherwise inevitably fall  but there was something in the latters expression that warned back the magistrate although a man not readily obeying the vague intimations that pass from one spirit to another  the crowd meanwhile looked on with awe and wonder  this earthly faintness was in their view only another phase of the ministers celestial strength nor would it have seemed a miracle too high to be wrought for one so holy had he ascended before their eyes waxing dimmer and brighter and fading at last into the light of heaven  he turned towards the scaffold and stretched forth his arms  hester said he come hither  come my little pearl  it was a ghastly look with which he regarded them but there was something at once tender and strangely triumphant in it  the child with the birdlike motion which was one of her characteristics flew to him and clasped her arms about his knees  hester prynneslowly as if impelled by inevitable fate and against her strongest willlikewise drew near but paused before she reached him  at this instant old roger chillingworth thrust himself through the crowdor perhaps so dark disturbed and evil was his look he rose up out of some nether regionto snatch back his victim from what he sought to do  be that as it might the old man rushed forward and caught the minister by the arm  madman hold  what is your purpose whispered he  wave back that woman  cast off this child  all shall be well  do not blacken your fame and perish in dishonour  i can yet save you would you bring infamy on your sacred profession  ha tempter  methinks thou art too late answered the minister encountering his eye fearfully but firmly  thy power is not what it was  with gods help i shall escape thee now  he again extended his hand to the woman of the scarlet letter  hester prynne cried he with a piercing earnestness in the name of him so terrible and so merciful who gives me grace at this last moment to do whatfor my own heavy sin and miserable agonyi withheld myself from doing seven years ago come hither now and twine thy strength about me  thy strength hester but let it be guided by the will which god hath granted me  this wretched and wronged old man is opposing it with all his mightwith all his own might and the fiends  come hestercome  support me up yonder scaffold  the crowd was in a tumult  the men of rank and dignity who stood more immediately around the clergyman were so taken by surprise and so perplexed as to the purport of what they sawunable to receive the explanation which most readily presented itself or to imagine any otherthat they remained silent and inactive spectators of the judgement which providence seemed about to work  they beheld the minister leaning on hesters shoulder and supported by her arm around him approach the scaffold and ascend its steps while still the little hand of the sinborn child was clasped in his  old roger chillingworth followed as one intimately connected with the drama of guilt and sorrow in which they had all been actors and well entitled therefore to be present at its closing scene  hadst thou sought the whole earth over said he looking darkly at the clergyman there was no one place so secretno high place nor lowly place where thou couldst have escaped mesave on this very scaffold  thanks be to him who hath led me hither answered the minister  yet he trembled and turned to hester with an expression of doubt and anxiety in his eyes not the less evidently betrayed that there was a feeble smile upon his lips  is not this better murmured he than what we dreamed of in the forest  i know not  i know not she hurriedly replied  better  yea so we may both die and little pearl die with us  for thee and pearl be it as god shall order said the minister and god is merciful  let me now do the will which he hath made plain before my sight  for hester i am a dying man so let me make haste to take my shame upon me  partly supported by hester prynne and holding one hand of little pearls the reverend mr dimmesdale turned to the dignified and venerable rulers to the holy ministers who were his brethren to the people whose great heart was thoroughly appalled yet overflowing with tearful sympathy as knowing that some deep lifematterwhich if full of sin was full of anguish and repentance likewisewas now to be laid open to them  the sun but little past its meridian shone down upon the clergyman and gave a distinctness to his figure as he stood out from all the earth to put in his plea of guilty at the bar of eternal justice  people of new england cried he with a voice that rose over them high solemn and majesticyet had always a tremor through it and sometimes a shriek struggling up out of a fathomless depth of remorse and woeye that have loved meye that have deemed me holybehold me here the one sinner of the world  at lastat lasti stand upon the spot where seven years since i should have stood here with this woman whose arm more than the little strength wherewith i have crept hitherward sustains me at this dreadful moment from grovelling down upon my face  lo the scarlet letter which hester wears  ye have all shuddered at it  wherever her walk hath beenwherever so miserably burdened she may have hoped to find reposeit hath cast a lurid gleam of awe and horrible repugnance round about her  but there stood one in the midst of you at whose brand of sin and infamy ye have not shuddered  it seemed at this point as if the minister must leave the remainder of his secret undisclosed  but he fought back the bodily weaknessand still more the faintness of heartthat was striving for the mastery with him  he threw off all assistance and stepped passionately forward a pace before the woman and the children  it was on him he continued with a kind of fierceness so determined was he to speak out the whole  gods eye beheld it the angels were for ever pointing at it the devil knew it well and fretted it continually with the touch of his burning finger but he hid it cunningly from men and walked among you with the mien of a spirit mournful because so pure in a sinful worldand sad because he missed his heavenly kindred  now at the deathhour he stands up before you  he bids you look again at hesters scarlet letter  he tells you that with all its mysterious horror it is but the shadow of what he bears on his own breast and that even this his own red stigma is no more than the type of what has seared his inmost heart  stand any here that question gods judgment on a sinner  behold  behold a dreadful witness of it  with a convulsive motion he tore away the ministerial band from before his breast  it was revealed  but it were irreverent to describe that revelation  for an instant the gaze of the horrorstricken multitude was concentrated on the ghastly miracle while the minister stood with a flush of triumph in his face as one who in the crisis of acutest pain had won a victory  then down he sank upon the scaffold  hester partly raised him and supported his head against her bosom  old roger chillingworth knelt down beside him with a blank dull countenance out of which the life seemed to have departed  thou hast escaped me he repeated more than once  thou hast escaped me  may god forgive thee said the minister  thou too hast deeply sinned  he withdrew his dying eyes from the old man and fixed them on the woman and the child  my little pearl said he feebly and there was a sweet and gentle smile over his face as of a spirit sinking into deep repose nay now that the burden was removed it seemed almost as if he would be sportive with the childdear little pearl wilt thou kiss me now  thou wouldst not yonder in the forest but now thou wilt  pearl kissed his lips  a spell was broken  the great scene of grief in which the wild infant bore a part had developed all her sympathies and as her tears fell upon her fathers cheek they were the pledge that she would grow up amid human joy and sorrow nor forever do battle with the world but be a woman in it  towards her mother too pearls errand as a messenger of anguish was fulfilled  hester said the clergyman farewell  shall we not meet again whispered she bending her face down close to his  shall we not spend our immortal life together surely surely we have ransomed one another with all this woe thou lookest far into eternity with those bright dying eyes then tell me what thou seest  hush hesterhush said he with tremulous solemnity  the law we brokethe sin here awfully revealedlet these alone be in thy thoughts  i fear  i fear  it may be that when we forgot our godwhen we violated our reverence each for the others soulit was thenceforth vain to hope that we could meet hereafter in an everlasting and pure reunion  god knows and he is merciful  he hath proved his mercy most of all in my afflictions  by giving me this burning torture to bear upon my breast  by sending yonder dark and terrible old man to keep the torture always at redheat  by bringing me hither to die this death of triumphant ignominy before the people  had either of these agonies been wanting i had been lost for ever  praised be his name  his will be done  farewell  that final word came forth with the ministers expiring breath the multitude silent till then broke out in a strange deep voice of awe and wonder which could not as yet find utterance save in this murmur that rolled so heavily after the departed spirit    xxiv  conclusion  after many days when time sufficed for the people to arrange their thoughts in reference to the foregoing scene there was more than one account of what had been witnessed on the scaffold   most of the spectators testified to having seen on the breast of the unhappy minister a scarlet letterthe very semblance of that worn by hester prynneimprinted in the flesh  as regarded its origin there were various explanations all of which must necessarily have been conjectural  some affirmed that the reverend mr dimmesdale on the very day when hester prynne first wore her ignominious badge had begun a course of penancewhich he afterwards in so many futile methods followed outby inflicting a hideous torture on himself  others contended that the stigma had not been produced until a long time subsequent when old roger chillingworth being a potent necromancer had caused it to appear through the agency of magic and poisonous drugs  others again and those best able to appreciate the ministers peculiar sensibility and the wonderful operation of his spirit upon the bodywhispered their belief that the awful symbol was the effect of the everactive tooth of remorse gnawing from the inmost heart outwardly and at last manifesting heavens dreadful judgment by the visible presence of the letter  the reader may choose among these theories  we have thrown all the light we could acquire upon the portent and would gladly now that it has done its office erase its deep print out of our own brain where long meditation has fixed it in very undesirable distinctness  it is singular nevertheless that certain persons who were spectators of the whole scene and professed never once to have removed their eyes from the reverend mr dimmesdale denied that there was any mark whatever on his breast more than on a newborn infants  neither by their report had his dying words acknowledged nor even remotely implied anythe slightestconnexion on his part with the guilt for which hester prynne had so long worn the scarlet letter  according to these highlyrespectable witnesses the minister conscious that he was dyingconscious also that the reverence of the multitude placed him already among saints and angelshad desired by yielding up his breath in the arms of that fallen woman to express to the world how utterly nugatory is the choicest of mans own righteousness  after exhausting life in his efforts for mankinds spiritual good he had made the manner of his death a parable in order to impress on his admirers the mighty and mournful lesson that in the view of infinite purity we are sinners all alike  it was to teach them that the holiest amongst us has but attained so far above his fellows as to discern more clearly the mercy which looks down and repudiate more utterly the phantom of human merit which would look aspiringly upward  without disputing a truth so momentous we must be allowed to consider this version of mr dimmesdales story as only an instance of that stubborn fidelity with which a mans friendsand especially a clergymanswill sometimes uphold his character when proofs clear as the midday sunshine on the scarlet letter establish him a false and sinstained creature of the dust  the authority which we have chiefly followeda manuscript of old date drawn up from the verbal testimony of individuals some of whom had known hester prynne while others had heard the tale from contemporary witnesses fully confirms the view taken in the foregoing pages  among many morals which press upon us from the poor ministers miserable experience we put only this into a sentencebe true  be true  be true  show freely to the world if not your worst yet some trait whereby the worst may be inferred  nothing was more remarkable than the change which took place almost immediately after mr dimmesdales death in the appearance and demeanour of the old man known as roger chillingworth  all his strength and energyall his vital and intellectual forceseemed at once to desert him insomuch that he positively withered up shrivelled away and almost vanished from mortal sight like an uprooted weed that lies wilting in the sun  this unhappy man had made the very principle of his life to consist in the pursuit and systematic exercise of revenge and when by its completest triumph consummation that evil principle was left with no further material to support itwhen in short there was no more devils work on earth for him to do it only remained for the unhumanised mortal to betake himself whither his master would find him tasks enough and pay him his wages duly  but to all these shadowy beings so long our near acquaintancesas well roger chillingworth as his companions we would fain be merciful  it is a curious subject of observation and inquiry whether hatred and love be not the same thing at bottom  each in its utmost development supposes a high degree of intimacy and heartknowledge each renders one individual dependent for the food of his affections and spiritual fife upon another each leaves the passionate lover or the no less passionate hater forlorn and desolate by the withdrawal of his subject  philosophically considered therefore the two passions seem essentially the same except that one happens to be seen in a celestial radiance and the other in a dusky and lurid glow  in the spiritual world the old physician and the ministermutual victims as they have beenmay unawares have found their earthly stock of hatred and antipathy transmuted into golden love  leaving this discussion apart we have a matter of business to communicate to the reader  at old roger chillingworths decease which took place within the year and by his last will and testament of which governor bellingham and the reverend mr wilson were executors he bequeathed a very considerable amount of property both here and in england to little pearl the daughter of hester prynne  so pearlthe elf childthe demon offspring as some people up to that epoch persisted in considering herbecame the richest heiress of her day in the new world  not improbably this circumstance wrought a very material change in the public estimation and had the mother and child remained here little pearl at a marriageable period of life might have mingled her wild blood with the lineage of the devoutest puritan among them all  but in no long time after the physicians death the wearer of the scarlet letter disappeared and pearl along with her  for many years though a vague report would now and then find its way across the sealike a shapeless piece of driftwood tossed ashore with the initials of a name upon ityet no tidings of them unquestionably authentic were received  the story of the scarlet letter grew into a legend  its spell however was still potent and kept the scaffold awful where the poor minister had died and likewise the cottage by the seashore where hester prynne had dwelt  near this latter spot one afternoon some children were at play when they beheld a tall woman in a gray robe approach the cottagedoor  in all those years it had never once been opened but either she unlocked it or the decaying wood and iron yielded to her hand or she glided shadowlike through these impedimentsand at all events went in  on the threshold she pausedturned partly roundfor perchance the idea of entering alone and all so changed the home of so intense a former life was more dreary and desolate than even she could bear  but her hesitation was only for an instant though long enough to display a scarlet letter on her breast  and hester prynne had returned and taken up her longforsaken shame  but where was little pearl if still alive she must now have been in the flush and bloom of early womanhood  none knewnor ever learned with the fulness of perfect certaintywhether the elfchild had gone thus untimely to a maiden grave or whether her wild rich nature had been softened and subdued and made capable of a womans gentle happiness  but through the remainder of hesters life there were indications that the recluse of the scarlet letter was the object of love and interest with some inhabitant of another land  letters came with armorial seals upon them though of bearings unknown to english heraldry  in the cottage there were articles of comfort and luxury such as hester never cared to use but which only wealth could have purchased and affection have imagined for her there were trifles too little ornaments beautiful tokens of a continual remembrance that must have been wrought by delicate fingers at the impulse of a fond heart  and once hester was seen embroidering a babygarment with such a lavish richness of golden fancy as would have raised a public tumult had any infant thus apparelled been shown to our soberhued community  in fine the gossips of that day believedand mr surveyor pue who made investigations a century later believedand one of his recent successors in office moreover faithfully believesthat pearl was not only alive but married and happy and mindful of her mother and that she would most joyfully have entertained that sad and lonely mother at her fireside  but there was a more real life for hester prynne here in new england than in that unknown region where pearl had found a home  here had been her sin here her sorrow and here was yet to be her penitence  she had returned therefore and resumedof her own free will for not the sternest magistrate of that iron period would have imposed itresumed the symbol of which we have related so dark a tale  never afterwards did it quit her bosom  but in the lapse of the toilsome thoughtful and selfdevoted years that made up hesters life the scarlet letter ceased to be a stigma which attracted the worlds scorn and bitterness and became a type of something to be sorrowed over and looked upon with awe yet with reverence too  and as hester prynne had no selfish ends nor lived in any measure for her own profit and enjoyment people brought all their sorrows and perplexities and besought her counsel as one who had herself

belief that at some brighter period when the world should have grown ripe for it in heavens own time a new truth would be revealed in order to establish the whole relation between man and woman on a surer ground of mutual happiness earlier in life hester had vainly imagined that she herself might be the destined prophetess but had long since recognised the impossibility that any mission of divine and mysterious truth should be confided to a woman stained with sin bowed down with shame or even burdened with a lifelong sorrow  the angel and apostle of the coming revelation must be a woman indeed but lofty pure and beautiful and wise moreover not through dusky grief but the ethereal medium of joy and showing how sacred love should make us happy by the truest test of a life successful to such an end  so said hester prynne and glanced her sad eyes downward at the scarlet letter  and after many many years a new grave was delved near an old and sunken one in that burialground beside which kings chapel has since been built  it was near that old and sunken grave yet with a space between as if the dust of the two sleepers had no right to mingle  yet one tombstone served for both  all around there were monuments carved with armorial bearings and on this simple slab of slateas the curious investigator may still discern and perplex himself with the purportthere appeared the semblance of an engraved escutcheon  it bore a device a heralds wording of which may serve for a motto and brief description of our now concluded legend so sombre is it and relieved only by one everglowing point of light gloomier than the shadow  on a field sable the letter a gules
