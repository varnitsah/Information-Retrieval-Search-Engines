5468004	the book of dreams and ghosts      preface to the new impression   since the first edition of this book appeared 1897 a considerable number of new and startling ghost stories british foreign and colonial not yet published have reached me  second sight abounds crystal gazing has also advanced in popularity  for a singular series of such visions in which distant persons and places unknown to the gazer were correctly described by her i may refer to my book the making of religion 1898  a memorial stone has been erected on the scene of the story called the foul fords p 269 so that tale is likely to endure in tradition  july 1899     preface to the first edition   the chief purpose of this book is if fortune helps to entertain people interested in the kind of narratives here collected  for the sake of orderly arrangement the stories are classed in different grades as they advance from the normal and familiar to the undeniably startling  at the same time an account of the current theories of apparitions is offered in language as free from technicalities as possible  according to modern opinion every ghost is a hallucination a false perception the perception of something which is not present  it has not been thought necessary to discuss the psychological and physiological processes involved in perception real or false  every hallucination is a perception as good and true a sensation as if there were a real object there  the object happens not to be there that is all 0a  we are not here concerned with the visions of insanity delirium drugs drink remorse or anxiety but with sporadic cases of hallucination visiting people only once in a lifetime which seems to be by far the most frequent type  these says mr james are on any theory hard to understand in detail  they are often extraordinarily complete and the fact that many of them are reported as veridical that is as coinciding with real events such as accidents deaths etc of the persons seen is an additional complication of the phenomenon 0b  a ghost if seen is undeniably so far a hallucination that it gives the impression of the presence of a real person in flesh blood and usually clothes  no such person in flesh blood and clothes is actually there  so far at least every ghost is a hallucination that in the language of captain cuttle you may lay to without offending science religion or commonsense  and that in brief is the modern doctrine of ghosts  the old doctrine of ghosts regarded them as actual spirits of the living or the dead freed from the flesh or from the grave  this view whatever else may be said for it represents the simple philosophy of the savage which may be correct or erroneous  about the time of the reformation writers especially protestant writers preferred to look on apparitions as the work of deceitful devils who masqueraded in the aspect of the dead or living or made up phantasms out of compressed air  the commonsense of the eighteenth century dismissed all apparitions as dreams or hoaxes or illusions caused by real objects misinterpreted such as rats cats white posts maniacs at large sleepwalkers thieves and so forth  modern science when it admits the possibility of occasional hallucinations in the sane and healthy also admits of course the existence of apparitions  these for our purposes are hallucinatory appearances occurring in the experience of people healthy and sane  the difficulty begins when we ask whether these appearances ever have any provoking mental cause outside the minds of the people who experience themany cause arising in the minds of others alive or dead  this is a question which orthodox psychology does not approach standing aside from any evidence which may be produced  this book does not pretend to be a convincing but merely an illustrative collection of evidence  it may or may not suggest to some readers the desirableness of further inquiry the author certainly does not hope to do more if as much  it may be urged that many of the stories here narrated come from remote times and as the testimony for these cannot be rigidly studied that the old unauthenticated stories clash with the analogous tales current on better authority in our own day  but these ancient legends are given not as evidence but for three reasons  first because of their merit as mere stories next because several of them are now perhaps for the first time offered with a critical discussion of their historical sources lastly because the old legends seem to show how the fancy of periods less critical than ours dealt with such facts as are now reported in a dull undramatic manner  thus 1 the icelandic ghost stories have peculiar literary merit as simple dramatic narratives  2 every one has heard of the wesley ghost sir george villierss spectre lord lytteltons ghost the beresford ghost mr williamss dream of mr percevals murder and so forth but the original sources have not as a rule been examined in the ordinary spirit of calm historical criticism by aid of a comparison of the earliest versions in print or manuscript  3 even ghost stories as a rule have some basis of fact whether fact of hallucination or illusion or imposture  they are at lowest human documents  now granting such facts of imposture hallucination or what you will as our dull modern narratives contain we can regard these facts or things like these as the nuclei which our less critical ancestors elaborated into their extraordinary romances  in this way the belief in demoniacal possession distinguished as such from madness and epilepsy has its nucleus some contend in the phenomena of alternating personalities in certain patients  their characters ideas habits and even voices change and the most obvious solution of the problem in the past was to suppose that a new alien personalitya devilhad entered into the sufferer  again the phenomena occurring in haunted houses whether caused or not by imposture or hallucination or both were easily magnified into such legends as that of grettir and glam and into the monstrosities of the witch trials  once more the simple hallucination of a dead persons appearance in his house demanded an explanation this was easily given by evolving a legend that he was a spirit escaped from purgatory or the grave to fulfil a definite purpose the rarity of such purposeful ghosts in an age like ours so rich in ghost stories must have a cause  that cause is probably a dwindling of the mythmaking faculty  any one who takes these matters seriously as facts in human nature must have discovered the difficulty of getting evidence at first hand this arises from several causes  first the cocksure commonsense of the years from 1660 to 1850 or so regarded every one who had experience of a hallucination as a dupe a lunatic or a liar  in this healthy state of opinion eminent people like lord brougham kept their experience to themselves or at most nervously protested that they were sure it was only a dream  next to tell the story was often to enter on a narrative of intimate perhaps painful domestic circumstances  thirdly many persons now refuse information as a matter of principle or of religious principle though it is difficult to see where either principle or religion is concerned if the witness is telling what he believes to be true  next some devotees of science aver that these studies may bring back faith by a side wind and with faith the fires of smithfield and the torturing of witches  these opponents are what professor huxley called dreadful consequences argufiers when similar reasons were urged against the doctrine of evolution  their position is strongest when they maintain that these topics have a tendency to befog the intellect  a desire to prove the existence of new forces may beget indifference to logic and to the laws of evidence  this is true and we have several dreadful examples among men otherwise scientific  but all studies have their temptations  many a historian to prove the guilt or innocence of queen mary has put evidence and logic and common honesty far from him  yet this is no reason for abandoning the study of history  there is another class of difficulties  as anthropology becomes popular every inquirer knows what customs he ought to find among savages so of course he finds them  in the same way people may now know what customs it is orthodox to find among ghosts and may pretend to find them or may simulate them by imposture  the white sheet and clanking chains are forsaken for a more realistic rendering of the ghostly part  the desire of social notoriety may beget wanton fabrications  in short all studies have their perils and these are among the dangers which beset the path of the inquirer into things ghostly  he must adopt the stoical maxim  be sober and do not believein a hurry  if there be truth in even one case of telepathy it will follow that the human soul is a thing endowed with attributes not yet recognised by science  it cannot be denied that this is a serious consideration and that very startling consequences might be deduced from it such beliefs indeed as were generally entertained in the ages of christian darkness which preceded the present era of enlightenment but our business in studies of any kind is of course with truth as we are often told not with the consequences however ruinous to our most settled convictions or however pernicious to society  the very opposite objection comes from the side of religion  these things we learn are spiritual mysteries into which men must not inquire  this is only a relic of the ancient opinion that he was an impious character who first launched a boat god having made man a terrestrial animal  assuredly god put us into a world of phenomena and gave us inquiring minds  we have as much right to explore the phenomena of these minds as to explore the ocean  again if it be said that our inquiries may lead to an undignified theory of the future life so far they have not led to any theory at all that also is the position of the dreadful consequences argufier  lastly the stories may frighten children  for children the book is not written any more than if it were a treatise on comparative anatomy  the author has frequently been asked both publicly and privately do you believe in ghosts  one can only answer  how do you define a ghost  i do believe with all students of human nature in hallucinations of one or of several or even of all the senses  but as to whether such hallucinations among the sane are ever caused by psychical influences from the minds of others alive or dead not communicated through the ordinary channels of sense my mind is in a balance of doubt  it is a question of evidence  in this collection many stories are given without the real names of the witnesses  in most of the cases the real names and their owners are well known to myself  in not publishing the names i only take the common privilege of writers on medicine and psychology  in other instances the names are known to the managers of the society for psychical research who have kindly permitted me to borrow from their collections  while this book passed through the press a long correspondence called on the trail of a ghost appeared in the times  it illustrated the copious fallacies which haunt the human intellect  thus it was maintained by some persons and denied by others that sounds of unknown origin were occasionally heard in a certain house  these it was suggested might if really heard be caused by slight seismic disturbances  now many people argue blunderstone house is not haunted for i passed a night there and nothing unusual occurred apply this to a house where noises are actually caused by young earthquakes  would anybody say  there are no seismic disturbances near blunderstone house for i passed a night there and none occurred  why should a noisy ghost if there is such a thing or a hallucinatory sound if there is such a thing be expected to be more punctual and pertinacious than a seismic disturbance  again the gentleman who opened the correspondence with a long statement on the negative side cried out like others for scientific publicity for names of people and places  but neither he nor his allies gave their own names  he did not precisely establish his claim to confidence by publishing his version of private conversations  yet he expected science and the public to believe his anonymous account of a conversation with an unnamed person at which he did not and could not pretend to have been present  he had a theory of sounds heard by himself which could have been proved or disproved in five minutes by a simple experiment  but that experiment he does not say that he made  this kind of evidence is thought good enough on the negative side  it certainly would not be accepted by any sane person for the affirmative side  if what is called psychical research has no other results at least it enables us to perceive the fallacies which can impose on the credulity of commonsense  in preparing this collection of tales i owe much to mr w a craigie who translated the stories from the gaelic and the icelandic to miss elspeth campbell who gives a version of the curious argyll tradition of ticonderoga rhymed by mr robert louis stevenson who put a cameron where a campbell should be to miss violet simpson who found the windham ms about the duke of buckinghams story and made other researches and to miss goodrich freer who pointed out the family version of the tyrone ghost     chapter i   arbuthnot on political lying  begin with great swingeing falsehoods  the opposite method to be used in telling ghost stones begin with the more familiar and credible

features of ghosts and dreams  mark twains story  theory of commonsense  not logical fulfilled dreams  the pig in the palace  the mignonette  dreams of reawakened memory  the lost cheque  the ducks

before  sir walters experience  explanations  the knot in the shutter transition to stranger dreams  arbuthnot in his humorous work on political lying commends the whigs for occasionally trying the people with great swingeing falsehoods when these are once got down by the populace anything may follow without difficulty  excellently as this practice has worked in politics compare the warmingpan lie of 1688 in the telling of ghost stories a different plan has its merits  beginning with the commonplace and familiar and therefore credible with the thin end of the wedge in fact a wise narrator will advance to the rather unusual the extremely rare the undeniably startling and so arrive at statements which without this discreet and gradual initiation a hasty reader might justly or unjustly dismiss as great swingeing falsehoods  the nature of things and of men has fortunately made this method at once easy obvious and scientific  even in the rather fantastic realm of ghosts the stories fall into regular groups advancing in difficulty like exercises in music or in a foreign language  we therefore start from the easiest exercises in belief or even from those which present no difficulty at all  the defect of the method is that easy stories are dull reading  but the student can skip  we begin with common everynight dreams  sleeping is as natural as waking dreams are nearly as frequent as everyday sensations thoughts and emotions  but dreams being familiar are credible it is admitted that people do dream we reach the less credible as we advance to the less familiar  for if we think for a moment the alleged events of ghostdomapparitions of all sortsare precisely identical with the everynight phenomena of dreaming except for the avowed element of sleep in dreams  in dreams time and space are annihilated and two severed lovers may be made happy  in dreams amidst a grotesque confusion of things remembered and things forgot we see the events of the past i have been at culloden fight and at the siege of troy we are present in places remote we behold the absent we converse with the dead and we may even let us say by chance coincidence forecast the future  all these things except the last are familiar to everybody who dreams it is also certain that similar but yet more vivid false experiences may be produced at the word of the hypnotiser in persons under the hypnotic sleep  a hypnotised man will take water for wine and get drunk on it  now the ghostly is nothing but the experience when men are awake or apparently awake of the everynight phenomena of dreaming  the vision of the absent seen by a waking or apparently waking man is called a wraith the waking or apparently waking vision of the dead is called a ghost  yet as st augustine says the absent man or the dead man may know no more of the vision and may have no more to do with causing it than have the absent or the dead whom we are perfectly accustomed to see in our dreams  moreover the comparatively rare cases in which two or more waking people are alleged to have seen the same ghost simultaneously or in succession have their parallel in sleep where two or more persons simultaneously dream the same dream  of this curious fact let us give one example  the names only are altered  the dog fanti  mrs ogilvie of drumquaigh had a poodle named fanti  her family or at least those who lived with her were her son the laird and three daughters  of these the two younger at a certain recent date were paying a short visit to a neighbouring country house  mrs ogilvie was accustomed to breakfast in her bedroom not being in the best of health  one morning miss ogilvie came down to breakfast and said to her brother i had an odd dream i dreamed fanti went mad  well that is odd said her brother  so did i  we had better not tell mother it might make her nervous  miss ogilvie went up after breakfast to see the elder lady who said do turn out fanti i dreamed last night that he went mad and bit  in the afternoon the two younger sisters came home  how did you enjoy yourselves one of the others asked  we didnt sleep well  i was dreaming that fanti went mad when mary wakened me and said she had dreamed fanti went mad and turned into a cat and we threw him into the fire  thus as several people may see the same ghost at once several people may dream the same dream at once  as a matter of fact fanti lived sane and harmless all the length of all his years 4  now this anecdote is credible certainly is credible by people who know the dreaming family  it is nothing more than a curiosity of coincidences and as fanti remained a sober peaceful hound in face of five dreamers the absence of fulfilment increases the readiness of belief  but compare the case of the swithinbanks  mr swithinbank on 20th may 1883 signed for publication a statement to this effect  during the peninsular war his father and his two brothers were quartered at dover  their family were at bradford  the brothers slept in various quarters of dover camp  one morning they met after parade  o william i have had a queer dream said mr swithinbanks father  so have i replied the brother when to the astonishment of both the other brother john said i have had a queer dream as well  i dreamt that mother was dead   so did i said each of the other brothers  and the mother had died on the night of this dreaming  mrs hudson daughter of one of the brothers heard the story from all three 5a  the distribution of the fulfilled is less than that of the unfulfilled dream by three to five  it has the extra coincidence of the death but as it is very common to dream of deaths some such dreams must occasionally hit the target  other examples might be given of shared dreams  5b they are only mentioned here to prove that all the waking experiences of things ghostly such as visions of the absent and of the dead and of the nonexistent are familiar and may even be common simultaneously to several persons in sleep  that men may sleep without being aware of it even while walking abroad that we may drift while we think ourselves awake into a semisomnolent state for a period of time perhaps almost imperceptible is certain enough  now the peculiarity of sleep is to expand or contract time as we may choose to put the case  alfred maury the wellknown writer on greek religion dreamed a long vivid dream of the reign of terror of his own trial before a revolutionary tribunal and of his execution in the moment of time during which he was awakened by the accidental fall of a rod in the canopy of his bed which touched him on the neck  thus even a prolonged interview with a ghost may conceivably be in real time a less than momentary dream occupying an imperceptible tenth of a second of somnolence the sleeper not realising that he has been asleep  mark twain who is seriously interested in these subjects has published an experience illustrative of such possibilities  he tells his tale at considerable length but it amounts to this  mark twains story  mark was smoking his cigar outside the door of his house when he saw a man a stranger approaching him  suddenly he ceased to be visible mark who had long desired to see a ghost rushed into his house to record the phenomenon  there seated on a chair in the hall was the very man who had come on some business  as marks negro footman acts when the bell is rung on the principle perhaps they wont persevere his master is wholly unable to account for the disappearance of the visitor whom he never saw passing him or waiting at his doorexcept on the theory of an unconscious nap  now a disappearance is quite as mystical as an appearance and much less common  this theory that apparitions come in an infinitesimal moment of sleep while a man is conscious of his surroundings and believes himself to be awake was the current explanation of ghosts in the eighteenth century  any educated man who saw a ghost or had a hallucination called it a dream as lord brougham and lord lyttelton did  but if the death of the person seen coincided with his appearance to them they illogically argued that out of the innumerable multitude of dreams some must coincide accidentally with facts  they strove to forget that though dreams in sleep are universal and countless dreams in waking hours are extremely rare unique for instance in lord broughams own experience  therefore the odds against chance coincidence are very great  dreams only form subjects of good dreamstories when the vision coincides with and adequately represents an unknown event in the past the present or the future  we dream however vividly of the murder of rizzio  nobody is surprised at that the incident being familiar to most people in history and art  but if we dreamed of being present at an unchronicled scene in queen marys life and if after the dream was recorded a document proving its accuracy should be for the first time recovered then there is matter for a good dreamstory 8  again we dream of an event not to be naturally guessed or known by us and our dream which should be recorded before tidings of the fact arrive tallies with the news of the event when it comes  or finally we dream of an event recording the dream and that event occurs in the future  in all these cases the actual occurrence of the unknown event is the only addition to the dreams usual power of crumpling up time and space  as a rule such dreams are only mentioned after the event and so are not worth noticing  very often the dream is forgotten by the dreamer till he hears of or sees the event  he is then either reminded of his dream by association of ideas or he has never dreamed at all and his belief that he has dreamed is only a form of false memory of the common sensation of having been here before which he attributes to an awakened memory of a real dream  still more often the dream is unconsciously cooked by the narrator into harmony with facts  as a rule fulfilled dreams deal with the most trivial affairs and such as being usual may readily occur by chance coincidence  indeed it is impossible to set limits to such coincidence for it would indeed be extraordinary if extraordinary coincidences never occurred  to take examples  the pig in the diningroom  mrs atlay wife of a late bishop of hereford dreamed one night that there was a pig in the diningroom of the palace  she came downstairs and in the hall told her governess and children of the dream before family prayers  when these were over nobody who was told the story having left the hall in the interval she went into the diningroom and there was the pig  it was proved to have escaped from the sty after mrs atlay got up  here the dream is of the common grotesque type millions of such things are dreamed  the event the pig in the palace is unusual and the coincidence of pig and dream is still more so  but unusual events must occur and each has millions of dreams as targets to aim at so to speak  it would be surprising if no such target were ever hit  here is another casecurious because the dream was forgotten till the corresponding event occurred but there was a slight discrepancy between event and dream  the mignonette  mrs herbert returned with her husband from london to their country home on the border  they arrived rather late in the day prepared to visit the garden and decided to put off the visit till the morrow at night mrs herbert dreamed that they went into the garden down a long walk to a mignonette bed near the vinery  the mignonette was black with innumerable bees and wilburd the gardener came up and advised mr and mrs herbert not to go nearer  next morning the pair went to the garden  the air round the mignonette was dark with wasps  mrs herbert now first remembered and told her dream adding but in the dream they were bees  wilburd now came up and advised them not to go nearer as a wasps nest had been injured and the wasps were on the warpath  here accidental coincidence is probable enough 10  there is another class of dreams very useful and apparently not so very uncommon that are veracious and communicate correct information which the dreamer did not know that he knew and was very anxious to know  these are rare enough to be rather difficult to believe  thus  the lost cheque  mr a a barrister sat up one night to write letters and about halfpast twelve went out to put them in the post  on undressing he missed a cheque for a large sum which he had received during the day he hunted everywhere in vain went to bed slept and dreamed that he saw the cheque curled round an area railing not far from his own door he woke got up dressed walked down the street and found his cheque in the place he had dreamed of  in his opinion he had noticed it fall from his pocket as he walked to the letterbox without consciously remarking it and his deeper memory awoke in slumber 11a  the ducks eggs  a little girl of the authors family kept ducks and was anxious to sell the eggs to her mother  but the eggs could not be found by eager search  on going to bed she said perhaps i shall dream of them next morning she exclaimed i did dream of them they are in a place between grey rock broom and mallow that must be the poneys field  and there the eggs were found 11b  the lost key  lady x after walking in a wood near her house in ireland found that she had lost an important key  she dreamed that it was lying at the root of a certain tree where she found it next day and her theory is the same as that of mr a the owner of the lost cheque 11c  as a rule dreams throw everything into a dramatic form  some one knocks at our door and the dream bases a little drama on the noise it constructs an explanatory myth a myth to account for the noise which is acted out in the theatre of the brain  to take an instance a disappointing one  the lost securities  a lady dreamed that she was sitting at a window watching the end of an autumn sunset  there came a knock at the front door and a gentleman and lady were ushered in  the gentleman wore an old fashioned snuffcoloured suit of the beginning of the century he was in fact an aged uncle who during the napoleonic wars had been one of the english detenus in france  the lady was very beautiful and wore something like a black spanish mantilla  the pair carried with them a curiously wrought steel box  before conversation was begun the maid still in the dream brought in the ladys chocolate and the figures vanished  when the maid withdrew the figures reappeared standing by the table  the box was now open and the old gentleman drew forth some yellow papers written on in faded ink  these he said were lists of securities which had been in his possession when he went abroad in 18 and in france became engaged to his beautiful companion  the securities he said are now in the strong box of messrs  another rap at the door and the actual maid entered with real hot water  it was time to get up  the whole dream had its origin in the first rap heard by the dreamer and dramatised into the arrival of visitors  probably it did not last for more than two or three seconds of real time  the maids second knock just prevented the revelation of the name of messrs  who like the lady in the mantilla were probably nonexistent people 13  thus dream dramatises on the impulse of some faint hardly perceived real sensation  and thus either mere empty fancies as in the case of the lost securities or actual knowledge which we may have once possessed but have totally forgotten or conclusions which have passed through our brains as unheeded guesses may in a dream be as it were revealed through the lips of a character in the brains theatre that character may in fact be alive or dead or merely fantastical a very good case is given with this explanation lost knowledge revived in a dramatic dream about a dead man by sir walter scott in a note to the antiquary  familiar as the story is it may be offered here for a reason which will presently be obvious  the arrears of teind  mr rutherford of bowland a gentleman of landed property in the vale of gala was prosecuted for a very considerable sum the accumulated arrears of teind or tithe for which he was said to be indebted to a noble family the titulars lay impropriators of the tithes  mr rutherford was strongly impressed with the belief that his father had by a form of process peculiar to the law of scotland purchased these teinds from the titular and therefore that the present prosecution was groundless  but after an industrious search among his fathers papers an investigation among the public records and a careful inquiry among all persons who had transacted law business for his father no evidence could be recovered to support his defence  the period was now near at hand when he conceived the loss of his lawsuit to be inevitable and he had formed the determination to ride to edinburgh next day and make the best bargain he could in the way of compromise  he went to bed with this resolution and with all the circumstances of the case floating upon his mind had a dream to the following purpose  his father who had been many years dead appeared to him he thought and asked him why he was disturbed in his mind  in dreams men are not surprised at such apparitions  mr rutherford thought that he informed his father of the cause of his distress adding that the payment of a considerable sum of money was the more unpleasant to him because he had a strong consciousness that it was not due though he was unable to recover any evidence in support of his belief  you are right my son replied the paternal shade  i did acquire right to these teinds for payment of which you are now prosecuted  the papers relating to the transaction are in the hands of mr  a writer or attorney who is now retired from professional business and resides at inveresk near edinburgh  he was a person whom i employed on that occasion for a particular reason but who never on any other occasion transacted business on my account  it is very possible pursued the vision that mr  may have forgotten a matter which is now of a very old date but you may call it to his recollection by this token that when i came to pay his account there was difficulty in getting change for a portugal piece of gold and we were forced to drink out the balance at a tavern  mr rutherford awoke in the morning with all the words of the vision imprinted on his mind and thought it worth while to walk across the country to inveresk instead of going straight to edinburgh  when he came there he waited on the gentleman mentioned in the dreama very old man  without saying anything of the vision he inquired whether he ever remembered having conducted such a matter for his deceased father  the old gentleman could not at first bring the circumstance to his recollection but on mention of the portugal piece of gold the whole returned upon his memory  he made an immediate search for the papers and recovered them so that mr rutherford carried to edinburgh the documents necessary to gain the cause which he was on the verge of losing  the story is reproduced because it is clearly one of the tales which come round in cycles either because events repeat themselves or because people will unconsciously localise old legends in new places and assign old occurrences or fables to new persons  thus every one has heard how lord westbury called a certain man in the heralds office a foolish old fellow who did not even know his own foolish old business  lord westbury may very well have said this but long before his time the remark was attributed to the famous lord chesterfield  lord westbury may have quoted it from chesterfield or hit on it by accident or the old story may have been assigned to him in the same way mr rutherford may have had his dream or the following tale of st augustines also cited by scott may have been attributed to him with the picturesque addition about the piece of portuguese gold  except for the piece of portuguese gold st augustine practically tells the anecdote in his de cura pro mortuis habenda adding the acute reflection which follows 16  of a surety when we were at milan we heard tell of a certain person of whom was demanded payment of a debt with production of his deceased fathers acknowledgment which debt unknown to the son the father had paid whereupon the man began to be very sorrowful and to marvel that his father while dying did not tell him what he owed when he also made his will  then in this exceeding anxiousness of his his said father appeared to him in a dream and made known to him where was the counter acknowledgment by which that acknowledgment was cancelled  which when the young man had found and showed he not only rebutted the wrongful claim of a false debt but also got back his fathers note of hand which the father had not got back when the money was paid  here then the soul of a man is supposed to have had care for his son and to have come to him in his sleep that teaching him what he did not know he might relieve him of a great trouble  but about the very same time as we heard this it chanced at carthage that the rhetorician eulogius who had been my disciple in that art being as he himself after our return to africa told us the story in course of lecturing to his disciples on ciceros rhetorical books as he looked over the portion of reading which he was to deliver on the following day fell upon a certain passage and not being able to understand it was scarce able to sleep for the trouble of his mind in which night as he dreamed i expounded to him that which he did not understand nay not i but my likeness while i was unconscious of the thing and far away beyond sea it might be doing or it might be dreaming some other thing and not in the least caring for his cares  in what way these things come about i know not but in what way soever they come why do we not believe it comes in the same way for a person in a dream to see a dead man as it comes that he sees a living man both no doubt neither knowing nor caring who dreams of their images or where or when  like dreams moreover are some visions of persons awake who have had their senses troubled such as phrenetic persons or those who are mad in any way for they too talk to themselves just as though they were speaking to people verily present and as well with absent men as with present whose images they perceive whether persons living or dead  but just as they who live are unconscious that they are seen of them and talk with them for indeed they are not really themselves present or themselves make speeches but through troubled senses these persons are wrought upon by such like imaginary visions just so they also who have departed this life to persons thus affected appear as present while they be absent and are themselves utterly unconscious whether any man sees them in regard of their image 18  st augustine adds a similar story of a trance  the two curmas  a rustic named curma of tullium near hippo augustines town fell into a catalepsy  on reviving he said  run to the house of curma the smith and see what is going on  curma the smith was found to have died just when the other curma awoke  i knew it said the invalid for i heard it said in that place whence i have returned that not i curma of the curia but curma the smith was wanted  but curma of the curia saw living as well as dead people among others augustine who in his vision baptised him at hippo  curma then in the vision went to paradise where he was told to go and be baptised he said it had been done already and was answered go and be truly baptised for that thou didst but see in vision  so augustine christened him and later hearing of the trance asked him about it when he repeated the tale already familiar to his neighbours augustine thinks it a mere dream and apparently regards the death of curma the smith as a casual coincidence  un esprit fort le saint augustin  if the dead could come in dreams he says my pious mother would no night fail to visit me  far be the thought that she should by a happier life have been made so cruel that when aught vexes my heart she should not even console in a dream the son whom she loved with an only love  not only things once probably known yet forgotten but knowledge never consciously thought out may be revealed in a dramatic dream apparently through the lips of the dead or the never existent  the books of psychology are rich in examples of problems worked out or music or poetry composed in sleep  the following is a more recent and very striking example  the assyrian priest  herr h v hilprecht is professor of assyriology in the university of pennsylvania  that university had despatched an expedition to explore the ruins of babylon and sketches of the objects discovered had been sent home  among these were drawings of two small fragments of agate inscribed with characters  one saturday night in march 1893 professor hilprecht had wearied himself with puzzling over these two fragments which were supposed to be broken pieces of fingerrings he was inclined from the nature of the characters to date them about 17001140 bc and as the first character of the third line of the first fragment seemed to read ku he guessed that it might stand for kurigalzu a king of that name  about midnight the professor went weary and perplexed to bed  then i dreamed the following remarkable dream  a tall thin priest of the old prechristian nippur about forty years of age and clad in a simple abba led me to the treasurechamber of the temple on its southeast side  he went with me into a small lowceiled room without windows in which there was a large wooden chest while scraps of agate and lapis lazuli lay scattered on the floor  here he addressed me as follows  the two fragments which you have published separately upon pages 22 and 26 belong together this amazing assyrian priest spoke american 20  they are not fingerrings and their history is as follows  king kurigalzu about 1300 bc once sent to the temple of bel among other articles of agate and lapis lazuli an inscribed votive cylinder of agate  then the priests suddenly received the command to make for the statue of the god nibib a pair of earrings of agate  we were in great dismay since there was no agate as raw material at hand  in order to execute the command there was nothing for us to do but cut the votive cylinder in three parts thus making three rings each of which contained a portion of the original inscription  the first two rings served as earrings for the statue of the god the two fragments which have given you so much trouble are parts of them  if you will put the two together you will have confirmation of my words but the third ring you have not found yet and you never will find it  the professor awoke bounded out of bed as mrs hilprecht testifies and was heard crying from his study it is so it is so  mrs hilprecht followed her lord and satisfied myself in the midnight hour as to the outcome of his most interesting dream  the professor however says that he awoke told his wife the dream and verified it next day  both statements are correct  there were two sets of drawings one in the study used that night one used next day in the university library  the inscription ran thus the missing fragment being restored by analogy from many similar inscriptions  to the god nibib child of the god bel his lord kurigalzu pontifex of the god bel has presented it  but in the drawings the fragments were of different colours so that a student working on the drawings would not guess them to be parts of one cylinder  professor hilprecht however examined the two actual fragments in the imperial museum at constantinople  they lay in two distinct cases but when put together fitted  when cut asunder of old in babylon the white vein of the stone showed on one fragment the grey surface on the other  professor romaine newbold who publishes this dream explains that the professor had unconsciously reasoned out his facts the difference of colour in the two pieces of agate disappearing in the dream  the professor had heard from dr peters of the expedition that a room had been discovered with fragments of a wooden box and chips of agate and lapis lazuli  the sleeping mind combined its information reasoned rightly from it and threw its own conclusions into a dramatic form receiving the information from the lips of a priest of nippur  probably we do a good deal of reasoning in sleep  professor hilprecht in 188283 was working at a translation of an inscription wherein came nabukudurruusur rendered by professor delitzsch nebo protect my mortarboard  professor hilprecht accepted this but woke one morning with his mind full of the thought that the words should be rendered nebo protect my boundary which sounds a deal likelier and is now accepted  i myself when working at the mss of the exiled stuarts was puzzled by the scorched appearance of the paper on which prince charlies and the kings letters were often written and by the peculiarities of the ink  i woke one morning with a sudden flash of commonsense  sympathetic ink had been used and the papers had been toasted or treated with acids  this i had probably reasoned out in sleep and had i dreamed my mind might have dramatised the idea  old mr edgar the kings secretary might have appeared and given me the explanation  maury publishes tales in which a forgotten fact was revealed to him in a dream from the lips of a dreamcharacter le sommeil et les reves pp 142143  the curious may also consult on all these things the philosophy of mysticism by karl du prel translated by mr massey  the assyrian priest is in proceedings spr vol xii p 14  on the same plane as the dreams which we have been examining is the waking sensation of the deja vu  i have been here before but when or how i cannot tell  most of us know this feeling all the circumstances in which we find ourselves have already occurred we have a prophecy of what will happen next on the tip of our tongues like a halfremembered name and then the impression vanishes  scott complains of suffering through a whole dinnerparty from this sensation but he had written copy for fifty printed pages on that day and his brain was breaking down  of course psychology has explanations  the scene may have really occurred before or may be the result of a malady of perception or one hemisphere of the brain not working in absolute simultaneousness with the other may produce a double impression the first being followed by the second so that we really have had two successive impressions of which one seems much more remote in time than it really was  or we may have dreamed something like the scene and forgotten the dream or we may actually in some not understood manner have had a prevision of what is now actual as when shelley almost fainted on coming to a place near oxford which he had beheld in a dream  of course if this prevision could be verified in detail we should come very near to dreams of the future fulfilled  such a thing verification of a detailled to the conversion of william hone the freethinker and radical of the early century who consequently became a christian and a pessimistic clearsighted tory  this tale of the deja vu therefore leads up to the marvellous narratives of dreams simultaneous with or prophetic of events not capable of being guessed or inferred or of events lost in the historical past but later recovered from documents  of hones affair there are two versions  both may be given as they are short  if they illustrate the deja vu they also illustrate the fond discrepancies of all such narratives 24  the knot in the shutter  it is said that a dream produced a powerful effect on hones mind he dreamt that he was introduced into a room where he was an entire stranger and saw himself seated at a table and on going towards the window his attention was somehow or other attracted to the window shutter and particularly to a knot in the wood which was of singular appearance and on waking the whole scene and especially the knot in the shutter left a most vivid impression on his mind  some time afterwards on going i think into the country he was at some house shown into a chamber where he had never been before and which instantly struck him as being the identical chamber of his dream  he turned directly to the window where the same knot in the shutter caught his eye  this incident to his investigating spirit induced a train of reflection which overthrew his cherished theories of materialism and resulted in conviction that there were spiritual agencies as susceptible of proof as any facts of physical science and this appears to have been one of the links in that mysterious chain of events by which according to the inscrutable purposes of the divine will man is sometimes compelled to bow to an unseen and divine power and ultimately to believe and live  another of the christian friends from whom in his later years william hone received so much kindness has also furnished recollections of him      two or three anecdotes which he related are all i can contribute towards a piece of mental history which if preserved would have been highly interesting  the first in point of time as to his taste of mind was a circumstance which shook his confidence in materialism though it did not lead to his conversion  it was one of those mental phenomena which he saw to be inexplicable by the doctrines he then held  it was as follows  he was called in the course of business into a part of london quite new to him and as he walked along the street he noticed to himself that he had never been there but on being shown into a room in a house where he had to wait some time he immediately fancied that it was all familiar that he had seen it before and if so said he to himself there is a very peculiar knot in this shutter  he opened the shutter and found the knot  now then thought he here is something i cannot explain on my principles  indeed the occurrence is not very explicable on any principles as a detail not visible without search was sought and verified and that by a habitual mocker at anything out of the common way  for example hone published a comic explanation correct or not of the famous stockwell mystery  supposing hones story to be true it naturally conducts us to yet more unfamiliar and therefore less credible dreams in which the unknown past present or future is correctly revealed     chapter ii   veracious dreams  past present and future unknown events revealed theory of mental telegraphy or telepathy fails to meet dreams of the unknowable future  dreams of unrecorded past how alone they can be corroborated  queen marys jewels  story from brierre de boismont  mr williamss dream before mr percevals murder discrepancies of evidence  curious story of bude kirk  mr williamss version  dream of a rattlesnake  discrepancies  dream of the red lamp  illusions hypnagogiques  the scar in the moustache dream of the future  the coral sprigs  anglosaxon indifference  a celtic dream  the satin slippers  waking dreams  the dead shopman dreams in swoons  perhaps nothing not even a ghost is so staggering to the powers of belief as a wellauthenticated dream which strikes the bulls eye of facts not known to the dreamer nor capable of being guessed by him if the events beheld in the dream are far away in space or are remote in time past the puzzle is difficult enough  but if the events are still in the future perhaps no kind of explanation except a mere fluke can even be suggested  say that i dream of an event occurring at a distance and that i record or act on my dream before it is corroborated  suppose too that the event is not one which could be guessed like the death of an invalid or the result of a race or of an election  this would be odd enough but the facts of which i dreamed must have been present in the minds of living people  now if there is such a thing as mental telegraphy or telepathy 28 my mind in dream may have tapped the minds of the people who knew the facts  we may not believe in mental telegraphy but we can imagine it as one of the unknown possibilities of nature  again if i dream of an unchronicled event in the past and if a letter of some historical person is later discovered which confirms the accuracy of my dream we can at least conceive though we need not believe that the intelligence was telegraphed to my dreaming mind from the mind of a dead actor in or witness of the historical scene for the facts are unknown to living man  but even these wild guesses cannot cover a dream which correctly reveals events of the future events necessarily not known to any finite mind of the living or of the dead and too full of detail for an explanation by aid of chance coincidence  in face of these difficulties mankind has gone on believing in dreams of all three classes  dreams revealing the unknown present the unknown past and the unknown future  the judicious reasonably set them all aside as the results of fortuitous coincidence or revived recollection or of the illusions of a false memory or of imposture conscious or unconscious  however the stories continue to be told and our business is with the stories  taking first dreams of the unknown past we find a large modern collection of these attributed to a lady named miss a  they were waking dreams representing obscure incidents of the past and were later corroborated by records in books newspapers and manuscripts but as these books and papers existed and were known to exist before the occurrence of the visions it is obvious that the matter of the visions may have been derived from the books and so forth or at least a sceptic will vastly prefer this explanation  what we need is a dream or vision of the unknown past corroborated by a document not known to exist at the time when the vision took place and was recorded  probably there is no such instance but the following tale picturesque in itself has a kind of shadow of the only satisfactory sort of corroboration  the author responsible for this yarn is dr gregory frs professor of chemistry in the university of edinburgh  after studying for many years the real or alleged phenomena of what has been called mesmerism or electrobiology or hypnotism dr gregory published in 1851 his letters to a candid inquirer on animal magnetism  though a frs and a professor of chemistry the doctor had no more idea of what constitutes evidence than a baby  he actually mixed up the tyrone with the lyttelton ghost story  his legend of queen marys jewels is derived from 1 the notebook or 2 a letter containing or professing to contain extracts from the notebook of a major buckley an angloindian officer  this gentleman used to magnetise or hypnotise people some of whom became clairvoyant as if possessed of eyes acting as doublepatentmillion magnifiers permeated by x rays  what follows is transcribed says the doctor from major buckleys notebook  we abridge the narrative  major buckley hypnotised a young officer who on november 15 1845 fell into a deeper state of trance  thence he awoke into a clairvoyant condition and said  queen marys jewels  i have had a strange dream about your ring a medallion of anthony and cleopatra it is very valuable  major buckley said it was worth 60 pounds and put the ring into his friends hand  it belonged to royalty  in what country  i see mary queen of scots  it was given to her by a man a foreigner with other things from italy  it came from naples  it is not in the old setting  she wore it only once  the person who gave it to her was a musician  the seer then saw the donors signature rizzio  but rizzio spelled his name riccio  the seer now copied on paper a writing which in his trance he saw on vellum  the design here engraved p 32 is only from a rough copy of the seers original drawing which was made by major buckley  picture of vellum as described in the text  imagesrizzogif  here pointing to the middle i see a diamond cross   the smallest stone was above the size of one of four carats  it the cross was worn out of sight by mary  the vellum has been shown in the house of lords 31      the ring was taken off marys finger by a man in anger and jealousy  he threw it into the water  when he took it off she was being carried in a kind of bed with curtains a litter  just before rizzios murder mary was enceinte and might well be carried in a litter though she usually rode  the seer then had a view of sizzles murder which he had probably read about  three weeks later in another trance the seer finished his design of the vellum  the words  a m de la part  probably stand for a marie de la part de  the thistle heads and leaves in gold at the corners were a usual decoration of the period compare the ceiling of the room in edinburgh castle where james vi was born four months after rizzios murder they also occur in documents  dr gregory conjectures that so valuable a present as a diamond cross may have been made not by rizzio but through rizzio by the pope  it did not seem good to the doctor to consult marys lists of jewels nor if he had done so would he have been any the wiser  in 1566 just before the birth of james vi mary had an inventory drawn up and added the names of the persons to whom she bequeathed her treasures in case she died in childbed  but this inventory hidden among a mass of lawpapers in the record office was not discovered till 1854 nine years after the vision of 1845 and three after its publication by dr gregory in 1851  not till 1863 was the inventory of 1566 discovered in 1854 published for the bannatyne club by dr joseph robertson  turning to the inventory we read of a valuable present made by david rizzio to mary a tortoise of rubies which she kept till her death for it appears in a list made after her execution at fotheringay  the murdered david rizzio left a brother joseph  him the queen made her secretary and in her will of 1566 mentions him thus  a josef pour porter a celui qui je luy ay dit une emeraude emaille de blanc  a josef pour porter a celui qui je luy ai dit dont il ranvoir quittance  une bague garnye de vingt cinq diamens tant grands que petis  now the diamond cross seen by the young officer in 1845 was set with diamonds great and small and was in his opinion a gift from or through rizzio  the queen wore it out of sight  here in the inventory we have a bague which may be a cross of diamonds small and great connected with a secret only known to rizzios brother and to the queen  it is to be carried to one whose name the queen has spoken in her new secretarys ear josephs but dare not trust herself to write  it would be idle now to seek to pry into the mystery which was thus anxiously guarded says dr robertson editor of the queens inventories  the doctor knew nothing of the vision which perhaps so nearly pried into the mystery  there is nothing like proof here but there is just a presumption that the diamonds connected with rizzio and secretly worn by the queen seen in the vision of 1845 are possibly the diamonds which had mary died in 1566 were to be carried by joseph rizzio to a person whose name might not safely be written 35a  we now take a dream which apparently reveals a real fact occurring at a distance  it is translated from brierre de boismonts book des hallucinations 35b paris 1845  there are says the learned author authentic dreams which have revealed an event occurring at the moment or later  these he explains by accidental coincidence and then gives the following anecdote as within his own intimate knowledge  the deathbed  miss c a lady of excellent sense religious but not bigoted lived before her marriage in the house of her uncle d a celebrated physician and member of the institute  her mother at this time was seriously ill in the country  one night the girl dreamed that she saw her mother pale and dying and especially grieved at the absence of two of her children  one a cure in spain the otherherselfin paris  next she heard her own christian name called charlotte and in her dream saw the people about her mother bring in her own little niece and godchild charlotte from the next room  the patient intimated by a sign that she did not want this charlotte but her daughter in paris  she displayed the deepest regret her countenance changed she fell back and died  next day the melancholy of mademoiselle c attracted the attention of her uncle  she told him her dream he pressed her to his heart and admitted that her mother was dead  some months later mademoiselle c when her uncle was absent arranged his papers which he did not like any one to touch  among these was a letter containing the story of her mothers death with all the details of her own dream which d had kept concealed lest they should impress her too painfully  boismont is staggered by this circumstance and inclined to account for it by still unknown relations in the moral and physical world mental telegraphy of course would explain all and even chance coincidence is perfectly conceivable  the most commonly known of dreams prior to or simultaneous with an historical occurrence represented in the vision is mr williamss dream of the murder of mr perceval in the lobby of the house of commons may 11 1812  mr williams of scorrier house near redruth in cornwall lived till 1841  he was interested in mines and a man of substance  unluckily the versions of his dream are full of discrepancies  it was first published apparently in the times during the silly season of 1828 august 28  according to the times whose account is very minute mr williams dreamed of the murder thrice before 2 am on the night of may 11  he told mrs williams and was so disturbed that he rose and dressed at two in the morning  he went to falmouth next day may 12 and told the tale to every one he knew  on the evening of the 13th he told it to mr and mrs tucker his married daughter of tremanton castle  mr williams only knew that the chancellor was shot mr tucker said it must be the chancellor of the exchequer  from the description he recognised mr perceval with whom he was at enmity  mr williams had never been inside the house of commons  as they talked mr williams son galloped up from truro with news of the murder got from a traveller by coach  six weeks later mr williams went to town and in the house of commons walked up to and recognised the scene of the various incidents in the murder  so far the times in 1828  but two forms of a version of 1832 exist one in a note to mr walpoles life of perceval 1874 an attested statement drawn up and signed by mr williams in the presence of the rev thomas fisher and mr charles prideaux brune  mr brune gave it to mr walpole  with only verbal differences this variant corresponds to another signed by mr williams and given by him to his grandson who gave it to mr percevals greatniece by whom it was lent to the society for psychical research  these accounts differ toto coelo from that in the times of 1828  the dream is not of may 11 but about may 2 or 3  mr williams is not a stranger to the house of commons it is a place well known to me  he is not ignorant of the name of the victim but understood that it was mr perceval  he thinks of going to town to give warning  we hear nothing of mr tucker  mr williams does not verify his dream in the house but from a drawing  a mr c r fox son of one to whom the dream was told before the event was then a boy of fourteen and sixtyone years later was sure that he himself heard of mr williamss dream before the news of the murder arrived after sixty years however the memory cannot be relied upon  one very curious circumstance in connection with the assassination of mr perceval has never been noticed  a rumour or report of the deed reached bude kirk a village near annan on the night of sunday may 10 a day before the crime was committed  this was stated in the dumfries and galloway courier and copied in the times of may 25  on may 28 the perth courier quotes the dumfries paper and adds that the rev mr yorstoun minister of hoddam ob 1833 has visited bude kirk and has obtained the most satisfactory proof of the rumour having existed on may 10 but the rumour cannot be traced to its source  mr yorstoun authorises the mention of his name  the times of june 2 says that the report is without foundation  if williams talked everywhere of his dream on may 3 some garbled shape of it may conceivably have floated to bude kirk by may 10 and originated the rumour  whoever started it would keep quiet when the real news arrived for fear of being implicated in a conspiracy as accessory before the fact  no trace of mr williamss dream occurs in the contemporary london papers  the best version of the dream to follow is probably that signed by mr williams himself in 1832 39a  it may of course be argued by people who accept mr williamss dream as a revelation of the future that it reached his mind from the purpose conceived in bellinghams mind by way of mental telegraphy 39b  dream of mr  percevals murder  sundhill december 1832  some account of a dream which occurred to john williams esq of scorrier house in the county of cornwall in the year 1812  taken from his own mouth and narrated by him at various times to several of his friends  being desired to write out the particulars of a remarkable dream which i had in the year 1812 before i do so i think it may be proper for me to say that at that time my attention was fully occupied with affairs of my ownthe superintendence of some very extensive mines in cornwall being entrusted to me  thus i had no leisure to pay any attention to political matters and hardly knew at that time who formed the administration of the country  it was therefore scarcely possible that my own interest in the subject should have had any share in suggesting the circumstances which presented themselves to my imagination  it was in truth a subject which never occurred to my waking thoughts  my dream was as follows  about the second or third day of may 1812 i dreamed that i was in the lobby of the house of commons a place well known to me  a small man dressed in a blue coat and a white waistcoat entered and immediately i saw a person whom i had observed on my first entrance dressed in a snuffcoloured coat with metal buttons take a pistol from under his coat and present it at the little man abovementioned the pistol was discharged and the ball entered under the left breast of the person at whom it was directed  i saw the blood issue from the place where the ball had struck him his countenance instantly altered and he fell to the ground  upon inquiry who the sufferer might be i was informed that he was the chancellor  i understood him to be mr perceval who was chancellor of the exchequer  i further saw the murderer laid hold of by several of the gentlemen in the room upon waking i told the particulars above related to my wife she treated the matter lightly and desired me to go to sleep saying it was only a dream  i soon fell asleep again and again the dream presented itself with precisely the same circumstances  after waking a second time and stating the matter again to my wife she only repeated her request that i would compose myself and dismiss the subject from my mind  upon my falling asleep the third time the same dream without any alteration was repeated and i awoke as on the former occasions in great agitation  so much alarmed and impressed was i with the circumstances above related that i felt much doubt whether it was not my duty to take a journey to london and communicate upon the subject with the party principally concerned  upon this point i consulted with some friends whom i met on business at the godolphin mine on the following day  after having stated to them the particulars of the dream itself and what were my own feelings in relation to it they dissuaded me from my purpose saying i might expose myself to contempt and vexation or be taken up as a fanatic upon this i said no more but anxiously watched the newspapers every evening as the post arrived  on the evening of the 13th of may as far as i recollect no account of mr percevals death was in the newspapers but my second son returning from truro came in a hurried manner into the room where i was sitting and exclaimed  o father your dream has come true  mr perceval has been shot in the lobby of the house of commons there is an account come from london to truro written after the newspapers were printed  the fact was mr percival was assassinated on the evening of the 11th  some business soon after called me to london and in one of the printshops i saw a drawing for sale representing the place and the circumstances which attended mr percevals death  i purchased it and upon a careful examination i found it to coincide in all respects with the scene which had passed through my imagination in the dream the colours of the dresses the buttons of the assassins coat the white waistcoat of mr perceval the spot of blood upon it the countenances and attitudes of the parties present were exactly what i had dreamed  the singularity of the case when mentioned among my friends and acquaintances naturally made it the subject of conversation in london and in consequence my friend the late mr rennie was requested by some of the commissioners of the navy that they might be permitted to hear the circumstances from myself  two of them accordingly met me at mr rennies house and to them i detailed at the time the particulars then fresh in my memory which form the subject of the above statement  i forbear to make any comment on the above narrative further than to declare solemnly that it is a faithful account of facts as they actually occurred  signed john williams 42  when we come to dreams of the future great historical examples are scarce indeed that is dreams respectably authenticated  we have to put up with curious trivialities  one has an odd feature  the rattlesnake  dr kinsolving of the church of the epiphany in philadelphia dreamed that he came across a rattlesnake which when killed had two blacklooking rattles and a peculiar projection of bone from the tail while the skin was unusually light in colour  next day while walking with his brother dr kinsolving nearly trod on a rattlesnake the same snake in every particular with the one i had had in my minds eye  this would be very well but dr kinsolvings brother who helped to kill the unlucky serpent says he had a single rattle  the letters of these gentlemen were written without communication to each other  if mr kinsolving is right the real snake with one rattle was not the dream snake with two rattles the brothers were in a snaky country west virginia 43  the following is trivial but good  it is written by mr alfred cooper and attested by the dreamer the duchess of hamilton  the red lamp  mr cooper says  a fortnight before the death of the late earl of l in 1882 i called upon the duke of hamilton in hill street to see him professionally  after i had finished seeing him we went into the drawingroom where the duchess was and the duke said oh cooper how is the earl  the duchess said what earl and on my answering lord l she replied  that is very odd  i have had a most extraordinary vision i went to bed but after being in bed a short time i was not exactly asleep but thought i saw a scene as if from a play before me  the actors in it were lord l as if in a fit with a man standing over him with a red beard  he was by the side of a bath over which a red lamp was distinctly shown  i then said  i am attending lord l at present there is very little the matter with him he is not going to die he will be all right very soon  well he got better for a week and was nearly well but at the end of six or seven days after this i was called to see him suddenly  he had inflammation of both lungs  i called in sir william jenner but in six days he was a dead man there were two male nurses attending on him one had been taken ill but when i saw the other the dream of the duchess was exactly represented  he was standing near a bath over the earl and strange to say his beard was red  there was the bath with the red lamp over it  it is rather rare to find a bath with a red lamp over it and this brought the story to my mind     this account written in 1888 has been revised by the late duke of manchester father of the duchess of hamilton who heard the vision from his daughter on the morning after she had seen it  the duchess only knew the earl by sight and had not heard that he was ill  she knew she was not asleep for she opened her eyes to get rid of the vision and shutting them saw the same thing again 45a  in fact the vision was an illusion hypnagogique  probably most readers know the procession of visions which sometimes crowd on the closed eyes just before sleep 45b  they commonly represent with vivid clearness unknown faces or places occasionally known faces the writer has seen his own in this way and has occasionally opened his eyes to get rid of the appearances  in his opinion the pictures are unconsciously constructed by the halfsleeping mind out of blurs of light or dark seen with closed eyes  mr coopers story would be more complete if he had said whether or not the earl when visited by him was in a chair as in the vision  but beds are not commonly found in bathrooms  the scar in the moustache  this story was told to the writer by his old headmaster the rev dr hodson brother of hodson of hodsons horse a person whom i never heard make any other allusion to such topics  dr hodson was staying with friends in switzerland during the holidays  one morning as he lay awake he seemed to see into a room as if the wall of his bedroom had been cut out  in the room were a lady well known to him and a man whom he did not know  the mans back was turned to the lookeron the scene vanished and grew again  now the man faced dr hodson the face was unfamiliar and had a deep white scar seaming the moustache dr hodson mentioned the circumstance to his friends and thought little of it  he returned home and one day in perth station met the lady at the bookstall  he went up to accost her and was surprised by the uneasiness of her manner  a gentleman now joined them with a deep white scar through his moustache  dr hodson now recalled what had slipped his memory that the lady during his absence from scotland had eloped with an officer the man of the vision and the railway station  he did not say or perhaps know whether the elopement was prior to the kind of dream in switzerland  here is a dream representing a future event with details which could not be guessed beforehand  the coral sprigs  mrs weiss of st louis was in new york in january 1881 attending a daughter mrs c who was about to have a child  she writes  on friday night jan 21 i dreamed that my daughters time came that owing to some cause not clearly defined we failed to get word to mr c who was to bring the doctor that we sent for the nurse who came that as the hours passed and neither mr c nor the doctor came we both got frightened that at last i heard mr c on the stairs and cried to him  oh chan for heavens sake get a doctor  ada may be confined at any moment that he rushed away and i returned to the bedside of my daughter who was in agony of mind and body that suddenly i seemed to know what to do    and that shortly after mr c came bringing a tall young doctor having brown eyes dark hair ruddy brun complexion grey trousers and grey vest and wearing a bright blue cravat picked out with coral sprigs the cravat attracted my attention particularly  the young doctor pronounced mrs c properly attended to and left  mrs weiss at breakfast told the dream to mr c and her daughter none of them attached any importance to it  however as a snowstorm broke the telegraph wires on saturday the day after the dream mrs weiss was uneasy  on tuesday the state of mrs c demanded a doctor mrs weiss sent a telegram for mr c he came at last went out to bring a doctor and was long absent  then mrs weiss suddenly felt a calm certainty that she though inexperienced in such cares could do what was needed  i heard myself say in a peremptory fashion ada dont be afraid i know just what to do all will go well all did go well meanwhile mr c ran to seven doctors houses and at last returned with a young man whom mrs weiss vaguely recognised mrs c whispered look at the doctors cravat  it was blue and coral sprigged and then first did mrs weiss remember her dream of friday night  mrs weisss story is corroborated by mr blanchard who heard the story a few days after the event  mrs c has read mrs weisss statement and in so far as i can remember it is quite correct  mr c remembers nothing about it he declares that he has no recollection of it or of any matters outside his business and knowing him as i do says mrs weiss i do not doubt the assertion  mr c must be an interesting companion  the nurse remembers that after the birth of the baby mrs c called mr cs attention to the doctors necktie and heard her say why i know him by mammas description as the doctor she saw in her dreams 48  the only thing even more extraordinary than the dream is mr cs inability to remember anything whatever outside of his business another witness appears to decline to be called as it would be embarrassing to him in his business  this it is to be anglosaxon  we now turn to a celtic dream in which knowledge supposed to be only known to a dead man was conveyed to his living daughter  the satin slippers  on 1st february 1891 michael conley a farmer living near ionia in chichasow county iowa went to dubuque in iowa to be medically treated  he left at home his son pat and his daughter elizabeth a girl of twentyeight a catholic in good health  on february 3 michael was found dead in an outhouse near his inn  in his pocket were nine dollars seventyfive cents but his clothes including his shirt were thought so dirty and worthless that they were thrown away the body was then dressed in a white shirt black clothes and satin slippers of a new pattern  pat conley was telegraphed for and arrived at dubuque on february 4 accompanied by mr george brown an intelligent and reliable farmer  pat took the corpse home in a coffin and on his arrival elizabeth fell into a swoon which lasted for several hours  her own account of what followed on her recovery may be given in her own words  when they told me that father was dead i felt very sick and bad i did not know anything  then father came to me  he had on a white shirt his own was grey and black clothes and slippers  when i came to i told pat i had seen father  i asked pat if he had brought back fathers old clothes  he said no and asked me why i wanted them  i told him father said he had sewed a roll of bills inside of his grey shirt in a pocket made of a piece of my old red dress  i went to sleep and father came to me again  when i awoke i told pat he must go and get the clothesher fathers old clothes  pat now telephoned to mr hoffman coroner of dubuque who found the old clothes in the back yard of the local morgue  they were wrapped up in a bundle  receiving this news pat went to dubuque on february 9 where mr hoffman opened the bundle in pats presence  inside the old grey shirt was found a pocket of red stuff sewn with a mans long uneven stitches and in the pocket notes for thirtyfive dollars  the girl did not see the body in the coffin but asked about the old clothes because the figure of her father in her dream wore clothes which she did not recognise as his  to dream in a faint is nothing unusual 50  the dead shopman  swooning or slight mental mistiness is not very unusual in ghost seers  the brother of a friend of my own a man of letters and wide erudition was as a boy employed in a shop in a town say wexington the overseer was a dark rather hecticlooking man who died  some months afterwards the boy was sent on an errand  he did his business but like a boy returned by a longer and more interesting route  he stopped as a booksellers shop to stare at the books and pictures and while doing so felt a kind of mental vagueness  it was just before his dinner hour and he may have been hungry  on resuming his way he looked up and found the dead overseer beside him  he had no sense of surprise and walked for some distance conversing on ordinary topics with the appearance  he happened to notice such a minute detail as that the spectres boots were laced in an unusual way  at a crossing something in the street attracted his attention he looked away from his companion and on turning to resume their talk saw no more of him  he then walked to the shop where he mentioned the occurrence to a friend  he has never during a number of years had any such experience again or suffered the preceding sensation of vagueness  this of course is not a ghost story but leads up to the old tale of the wraith of valogne  in this case two boys had made a covenant the first who died was to appear to the other  he did appear before news of his death arrived but after a swoon of his friends whose health like that of elizabeth conley suffered in consequence  note  perceval murder  times 25th may 1812  a dumfries paper states that on the night of sunday the 10th instant twentyfour hours before the fatal deed was perpetrated a report was brought to bude kirk two miles from annan that mr perceval was shot on his way to the house of commons at the door or in the lobby of that house  this the whole inhabitants of the village are ready to attest as the report quickly spread and became the topic of conversation  a clergyman investigated the rumour with the view of tracing it to its source but without success  the times of 2nd june says report without foundation  perth courier 28th may quoting from the dumfries and galloway courier repeats above almost verbatim       the clergyman to whom we have alluded and who allows me to make use of his name is mr yorstoun minister of hoddam  this gentleman went to the spot and carefully investigated the rumour but has not hitherto been successful although he has obtained the most satisfactory proof of its having existed at the time we have mentioned  we forbear to make any comments on this wonderful circumstance but should anything further transpire that may tend to throw light upon it we shall not fail to give the public earliest information  the dumfries and galloway courier i cannot find  it is not in the british museum     chapter iii   transition from dreams to waking hallucinations  popular scepticism about the existence of hallucinations in the sane

crystal vision  st simon the regent dorleans  the deathbed of louis xiv  references for other cases of crystal visions  from dreams in sleep or swoon of a character difficult to believe in we pass by way of hallucinations to ghosts  everybody is ready to admit that dreams do really occur because almost everybody has dreamed  but everybody is not so ready to admit that sane and sensible men and women can have hallucinations just because everybody has not been hallucinated  on this point mr francis galton in his inquiries into human faculty 1833 is very instructive  mr galton drew up a short catechism asking people how clearly or how dimly they saw things in their minds eye  think of your breakfasttable he said is your mental picture of it as clearly illuminated and as complete as your actual view of the scene  mr galton began by questioning friends in the scientific world frss and other savants  the earliest results of my inquiry amazed me     the great majority of the men of science to whom i first applied protested that mental imagery was unknown to them and they looked on me as fanciful and fantastic in supposing that the words mental imagery really expressed what i believed everybody supposed them to mean  one gentleman wrote  it is only by a figure of speech that i can describe my recollection of a scene as a mental image which i can see with my minds eye  i do not see it so he seems to have supposed that nobody else did  when he made inquiries in general society mr galton found plenty of people who saw mental imagery with every degree of brilliance or dimness from quite comparable to the real object to i recollect the table but do not see itmy own position  mr galton was next greatly struck by the frequency of the replies in which my correspondents sane and healthy described themselves as subject to visions  these varied in degree some were so vivid as actually to deceive the judgment  finally a notable proportion of sane persons have had not only visions but actual hallucinations of sight at one or more periods of their life  i have a considerable packet of instances contributed by my personal friends  thus one distinguished authoress saw the principal character of one of her novels glide through the door straight up to her  it was about the size of a large doll  another heard unreal music and opened the door to hear it better  another was plagued by voices which said pray and so forth  thus on scientific evidence sane and healthy people may and in a notable proportion do experience hallucinations  that is to say they see persons or hear them or believe they are touched by them or all their senses are equally affected at once when no such persons are really present  this kind of thing is always going on but when popular opinion is of a matteroffact kind the seers of visions keep quiet they do not like to be thought fanciful or mad and they hide their experiences which only come to light through inquiries such as those that i have been making  we may now proceed to the waking hallucinations of sane and healthy people which mr galton declares to be so far from uncommon  into the causes of these hallucinations which may actually deceive the judgment mr galton does not enter  story of the diplomatist 56a  for example there is a living diplomatist who knows men and cities and has moreover a fine sense of humour  my lord said a famous russian statesman to him you have all the qualities of a diplomatist but you cannot control your smile  this gentleman walking alone in a certain cloister at cambridge met a casual acquaintance a wellknown london clergyman and was just about shaking hands with him when the clergyman vanished  nothing in particular happened to either of them the clergyman was not in the seers mind at the moment  this is a good example of a solitary hallucination in the experience of a very coolheaded observer  the causes of such experiences are still a mystery to science  even people who believe in mental telegraphy say when a distant person at death or in any other crisis impresses himself as present on the senses of a friend cannot account for an experience like that of the diplomatist an experience not very uncommon and little noticed except when it happens to coincide with some remarkable event 56b  nor are such hallucinations of an origin easily detected like those of delirium insanity intoxication grief anxiety or remorse  we can only suppose that a past impression of the aspect of a friend is recalled by some association of ideas so vividly that though we are not consciously thinking of him we conceive the friend to be actually present in the body when he is absent  these hallucinations are casual and unsought  but between these and the dreams of sleep there is a kind of waking hallucinations which some people can purposely evoke  such are the visions of crystal gazing  among the superstitions of almost all ages and countries is the belief that spirits will show themselves usually after magical ceremonies to certain persons commonly children who stare into a crystal ball a cup a mirror a blob of ink in egypt and india a drop of blood among the maoris of new zealand a bowl of water red indian a pond roman and african water in a glass bowl in fez or almost any polished surface  the magical ceremonies which have probably nothing to do with the matter have succeeded in making this old and nearly universal belief seem a mere fantastic superstition  but occasionally a person not superstitious has recorded this experience thus george sand in her histoire de ma vie mentions that as a little girl she used to see wonderful moving landscapes in the polished back of a screen  these were so vivid that she thought they must be visible to others  recent experiments have proved that an unexpected number of people have this faculty  gazing into a ball of crystal or glass a crystal or other smooth ring stone such as a sapphire or ruby or even into a common inkpot they will see visions very brilliant  these are often mere reminiscences of faces or places occasionally of faces or places sunk deep below the ordinary memory  still more frequently they represent fantastic landscapes and romantic scenes as in an historical novel with people in odd costumes coming going and acting  thus i have been present when a lady saw in a glass ball a man in white oriental costume kneeling beside a leaping fountain of fire  presently a hand appeared pointing downwards through the flame the first vision seen pretty often represents an invalid in bed printed words are occasionally read in the glass as also happens in the visions beheld with shut eyes before sleeping  all these kinds of things in fact are common in our visions between sleeping and waking illusions hypnagogiques  the singularity is that they are seen by people wide awake in glass balls and so forth usually the seer is a person whose ordinary mental imagery is particularly vivid  but every visualiser is not a crystal seer  a novelist of my acquaintance can visualise so well that having forgotten an address and lost the letter on which it was written he called up a mental picture of the letter and so discovered the address  but this very popular writer can see no visions in a crystal ball  another very popular novelist can see them little dramas are acted out in the ball for his edification 58  these things are as unfamiliar to men of science as mr galton found ordinary mental imagery pictures in memory to be  psychology may or may not include them in her province they may or may not come to be studied as ordinary dreams are studied  but like dreams these crystal visions enter the domain of the ghostly only when they are veracious and contribute information previously unknown as to past present or future  there are plenty of stories to this effect  to begin with an easy or comparatively easy exercise in belief  under the lamp  i had given a glass ball to a young lady who believed that she could play the willing game successfully without touching the person willed and when the person did not even know that willing was going on  this lady miss baillie had scarcely any success with the ball  she lent it to miss leslie who saw a large square old fashioned red sofa covered with muslin which she found in the next country house she visited  miss baillies brother a young athlete at short odds for the amateur golf championship laughed at these experiments took the ball into the study and came back looking gey gash  he admitted that he had seen a vision somebody he knew under a lamp  he would discover during the week whether he saw right or not  this was at 530 on a sunday afternoon  on tuesday mr baillie was at a dance in a town some forty miles from his home and met a miss preston  on sunday he said about halfpast five you were sitting under a standard lamp in a dress i never saw you wear a blue blouse with lace over the shoulders pouring out tea for a man in blue serge whose back was towards me so that i only saw the tip of his moustache  why the blinds must have been up said miss preston  i was at dulby said mr baillie as he undeniably was 60a  this is not a difficult exercise in belief  miss preston was not unlikely to be at tea at teatime  nor is the following very hard  the cow with the bell  i had given a glass ball to the wife of a friend whose visions proved so startling and on one occasion so unholy that she ceased to make experiments  one day my friends secretary a young student and golfer took up the ball  i see a field i know very well he said but there is a cow in it that i never saw brown with white markings and this is odd in scotland she has a bell hanging from her neck  ill go and look at the field  he went and found the cow as described bell and all 60b  in the spring of 1897 i gave a glass ball to a young lady previously a stranger to me who was entirely unacquainted with crystal gazing even by report  she had however not infrequent experience of spontaneous visions which were fulfilled including a vision of the derby persimmons year which enriched her friends  in using the ball she time after time succeeded in seeing and correctly describing persons and places familiar to people for whom she scried but totally strange to herself  in one case she added a detail quite unknown to the person who consulted her but which was verified on inquiry  these experiments will probably be published elsewhere  four people out of the very small number who tried on these occasions saw fancy pictures in the ball  two were young ladies one a man and one a schoolboy  i must confess that for the first time i was impressed by the belief that the ladys veracious visions however they are to be explained could not possibly be accounted for by chance coincidence  they were too many i was aware of five in a few days too minute and too remote from the range of ingenious guessing  but thought transference tapping the mental wires of another person would have accounted for every case with perhaps the exception of that in which an unknown detail was added this confession will undoubtedly seem weakly credulous but not to make it would be unfair and unsportsmanlike  my statement of course especially without the details is not evidence for other people  the following case is a much harder exercise in belief  it is narrated by the duc de saint simon 62  the events were described to saint simon on the day after their occurrence by the duc dorleans then starting for italy in may 1706  saint simon was very intimate with the duke and they corresponded by private cypher without secretaries  owing to the death of the kings son and grandson not seen in the vision orleans became regent when louis xiv died in 1714  saint simon is a reluctant witness and therefore all the better  the deathbed of louis xiv  here is a strange story that the duc dorleans told me one day in a teteatete at marly he having just run down from paris before he started for italy and it may be observed that all the events predicted came to pass though none of them could have been foreseen at the time  his interest in every kind of art and science was very great and in spite of his keen intellect he was all his life subject to a weakness which had been introduced with other things from italy by catherine de medici and had reigned supreme over the courts of her children  he had exercised every known method of inducing the devil to appear to him in person though as he has himself told me without the smallest success  he had spent much time in investigating matters that touched on the supernatural and dealt with the future  now la sery his mistress had in her house a little girl of eight or nine years of age who had never resided elsewhere since her birth she was to all appearance a very ordinary child and from the way in which she had been brought up was more than commonly ignorant and simple  one day during the visit of m dorleans la sery produced for his edification one of the charlatans with whom the duke had long been familiar who pretended that by means of a glass of water he could see the answer to any question that might be put  for this purpose it was necessary to have as a gobetween some one both young and innocent to gaze into the water and this little girl was at once sent for  they amused themselves by asking what was happening in certain distant places and after the man had murmured some words over the water the child looked in and always managed to see the vision required of her  m le duc dorleans had so often been duped in matters of this kind that he determined to put the watergazer to a severe test  he whispered to one of his attendants to go round to madame de nancres who lived close by and ascertain who was there what they were all doing the position of the room and the way it was furnished and then without exchanging a word with any one to return and let him know the result  this was done speedily and without the slightest suspicion on the part of any person the child remaining in the room all the time  when m le duc dorleans had learned all he wanted to know he bade the child look in the water and tell him who was at madame de nancres and what they were all doing  she repeated word for word the story that had been told by the dukes messenger described minutely the faces dresses and positions of the assembled company those that were playing cards at the various tables those that were sitting those that were standing even the very furniture but to leave nothing in doubt the duke of orleans despatched nancre back to the house to verify a second time the childs account and like the valet he found she had been right in every particular  as a rule he said very little to me about these subjects as he knew i did not approve of them and on this occasion i did not fail to scold him and to point out the folly of being amused by such things especially at a time when his attention should be occupied with more serious matters  oh but i have only told you half he replied that was just the beginning and then he went on to say that encouraged by the exactitude of the little girls description of madame de nancres room he resolved to put to her a more important question namely as to the scene that would occur at the death of the king  the child had never seen any one who was about the court and had never even heard of versailles but she described exactly and at great length the kings bedroom at versailles and all the furniture which was in fact there at the date of his death  she gave every detail as to the bed and cried out on recognising in the arms of madame de ventadour a little child decorated with an order whom she had seen at the house of mademoiselle la sery and again at the sight of m le duc dorleans  from her account madame de maintenon fagon with his odd face madame la duchesse dorleans madame la duchesse madame la princesse de conti besides other princes and nobles and even the valets and servants were all present at the kings deathbed then she paused and m le duc dorleans surprised that she had never mentioned monseigneur monsieur le duc de bourgogne madame la duchesse de bourgogne nor m le duc de berri inquired if she did not see such and such people answering to their description  she persisted that she did not and went over the others for the second time  this astonished m le duc dorleans deeply as well as myself and we were at a loss to explain it but the event proved that the child was perfectly right  this seance took place in 1706  these four members of the royal family were then full of health and strength and they all died before the king  it was the same thing with m le prince m le duc and m le prince de conti whom she likewise did not see though she beheld the children of the two last named m du maine his own orleans and m le comte de toulouse but of course this fact was unknown till eight years after  science may conceivably come to study crystal visions but veracious crystal visions will be treated like veracious dreams  that is to say they will be explained as the results of a chance coincidence between the unknown fact and the vision or of imposture conscious or unconscious or of confusion of memory or the fact of the crystal vision will be simply denied  thus a vast number of well authenticated cases of veracious visions will be required before science could admit that it might be well to investigate hitherto unacknowledged faculties of the human mind  the evidence can never be other than the word of the seer with whatever value may attach to the testimony of those for whom he sees and describes persons and places unknown to himself  the evidence of individuals as to their own subjective experiences is accepted by psychologists in other departments of the study 66     chapter iv   veracious waking hallucinations not recognised by science or explained by coincidence imposture false memory  a veracious hallucination popularly called a wraith or ghost  example of unveracious hallucination  the family coach  ghosts clothes and other properties and practices how explained  case of veracious hallucination  riding home from mess  another case  the bright scar  the vision and the portrait  such stories not usually believed  cases of touch  the restraining hand  of hearing  the benedictines voices the voice in the bathroom  other warnings the maoris  the man at the lift  appearances coincident with death others not coincident with anything  in crystalgazing anybody can make experiments for himself and among such friends as he thinks he can trust  they are hallucinations consciously sought for and as far as possible provoked or induced by taking certain simple measures  unsought spontaneous waking hallucinations according to the result of mr galtons researches though not nearly so common as dreams are as much facts of sane mental experience  now every ghost or wraith is a hallucination  you see your wife in the diningroom when she really is in the drawing room you see your late greatgreatgrandfather anywhere  neither person is really present  the first appearance in popular language is a wraith the second is a ghost in ordinary speech  both are hallucinations  so far mr galton would go but mark what follows  everybody allows the existence of dreams but comparatively few believe in dream stories of veracious dreams  so every scientific man believes in hallucinations 68 but few believe in veracious hallucinations  a veracious hallucination is for our purpose one which communicates as veracious dreams do information not otherwise known or at least not known to the knower to be known  the communication of the knowledge may be done by audible words with or without an actual apparition or with an apparition by words or gestures  again if a hallucination of joness presence tallies with a great crisis in joness life or with his death the hallucination is so far veracious in that at least it does not seem meaningless  or if joness appearance has some unwonted feature not known to the seer but afterwards proved to be correct in fact that is veracious  next if several persons successively in the same place or simultaneously have a similar hallucination not to be accounted for physically that is if not a veracious a curious hallucination  once more if a hallucinatory figure is afterwards recognised in a living person previously unknown or a portrait previously unseen that if the recognition be genuine is a veracious hallucination  the vulgar call it a wraith of the living or a ghost of the dead  here follow two cases  the first the family coach 69a gave no verified intelligence and would be styled a subjective hallucination  the second contributed knowledge of facts not previously known to the witness and so the vulgar would call it a ghost  both appearances were very rich and full of complicated detail  indeed any ghost that wears clothes is a puzzle  nobody but savages thinks that clothes have ghosts but tom sawyer conjectures that ghosts clothes are made of ghost stuff  as a rule not very much is seen of a ghost he is something of a shadowy being  yet we very seldom hear of a ghost stark naked that of sergeant davies murdered in 1749 is one of three or four examples in civilised life 69b  hence arises the old question how are we to account for the clothes of ghosts one obvious reply is that there is no ghost at all only a hallucination  we do not see people naked as a rule in our dreams and hallucinations being waking dreams conform to the same rule  if a ghost opens a door or lifts a curtain in our sight that too is only part of the illusion  the door did not open the curtain was not lifted  nay if the wrist or hand of the seer is burned or withered as in a crowd of stories the ghosts hand did not produce the effect  it was produced in the same way as when a hypnotised patient is told that his hand is burned his fancy then begets real blisters or so we are informed truly or not  the stigmata of st francis and others are explained in the same way 70 how ghosts pull bedclothes off and make objects fly about is another question  in any case the ghosts are not seen in the act  thus the clothes of ghosts their properties and their actions affecting physical objects are not more difficult to explain than a naked ghost would be they are all the stuff that dreams are made of  but occasionally things are carried to a great pitch as when a ghost drives off in a ghostly dogcart with a ghostly horse whip and harness  of this complicated kind we give two examples the first reckons as a subjective the second as a veracious hallucination  the old family coach  a distinguished and accomplished country gentleman and politician of scientific tastes was riding in the new forest some twelve miles from the place where he was residing  in a grassy glade he discovered that he did not very clearly know his way to a country town which he intended to visit  at this moment on the other side of some bushes a carriage drove along and then came into clear view where there was a gap in the bushes  mr hyndford saw it perfectly distinctly it was a slightly antiquated family carriage the sides were in that imitation of wicker work on green panel which was once so common  the coachman was a respectable family servant he drove two horses  two old ladies were in the carriage one of them wore a hat the other a bonnet they passed and then mr hyndford going through the gap in the bushes rode after them to ask his way  there was no carriage in sight the avenue ended in a culdesac of tangled brake and there were no traces of wheels on the grass  mr hyndford rode back to his original point of view and looked for any object which could suggest the illusion of one oldfashioned carriage one coachman two horses and two elderly ladies one in a hat and one in a bonnet  he looked in vainand that is all  nobody in his senses would call this appearance a ghostly one  the name however would be applied to the following tale of  riding home from mess  in 1854 general barter cb was a subaltern in the 75th regiment and was doing duty at the hill station of murree in the punjaub  he lived in a house built recently by a lieutenant b who died as researches at the war office prove at peshawur on 2nd january 1854 the house was on a spur of the hill three or four hundred yards under the only road with which it communicated by a bridle path never used by horsemen  that path ended in a precipice a footpath led into the bridle path from mr barters house  one evening mr barter had a visit from a mr and mrs deane who stayed till near eleven oclock  there was a full moon and mr barter walked to the bridle path with his friends who climbed it to join the road  he loitered with two dogs smoking a cigar and just as he turned to go home he heard a horses hoofs coming down the bridle path  at a bend of the path a tall hat came into view then round the corner the wearer of the hat who rode a pony and was attended by two native grooms  at this time the two dogs came and crouching at my side gave low frightened whimpers  the moon was at the full a tropical moon so bright that you could see to read a newspaper by its light and i saw the party above me advance as plainly as if it were noonday they were above me some eight or ten feet on the bridle road     on the party came    and now i had better describe them  the rider was in full dinner dress with white waistcoat and a tall chimneypot hat and he sat on a powerful hill pony darkbrown with black mane and tail in a listless sort of way the reins hanging loosely from both hands  grooms led the pony and supported the rider  mr barter knowing that there was no place they could go to but his own house cried quon hai who is it adding in english hullo what the devil do you want here  the group halted the rider gathered up the reins with both hands and turning showed mr barter the known features of the late lieutenant b  he was very pale the face was a dead mans face he was stouter than when mr barter knew him and he wore a dark newgate fringe  mr barter dashed up the bank the earth thrown up in making the bridle path crumbled under him he fell scrambled on reached the bridle path where the group had stopped and found nobody  mr barter ran up the path for a hundred yards as nobody could go down it except over a precipice and neither heard nor saw anything  his dogs did not accompany him  next day mr barter gently led his friend deane to talk of lieutenant b who said that the lieutenant grew very bloated before his death and while on the sick list he allowed the fringe to grow in spite of all we could say to him and i believe he was buried with it  mr barter then asked where he got the pony describing it minutely  he bought him at peshawur and killed him one day riding in his reckless fashion down the hill to trete  mr barter and his wife often heard the horses hoofs later though he doubts if any one but b had ever ridden the bridle path  his hindoo bearer he found one day armed with a lattie being determined to waylay the sound which passed him like a typhoon 74  here the appearance gave correct information unknown previously to general barter namely that lieutenant b grew stout and wore a beard before his death also that he had owned a brown pony with black mane and tail  even granting that the ghosts of the pony and lieutenant were present both being dead we are not informed that the grooms were dead also  the hallucination on the theory of mental telegraphy was telegraphed to general barters mind from some one who had seen lieutenant b ride home from mess not very sober or from the mind of the defunct lieutenant or perhaps from that of the deceased pony the message also reached and alarmed general barters dogs  something of the same kind may or may not explain mr hyndfords view of the family coach which gave no traceable information  the following story in which an appearance of the dead conveyed information not known to the seer and so deserving to be called veracious is a little ghastly  the bright scar  in 1867 miss g aged eighteen died suddenly of cholera in st louis  in 1876 a brother f g who was much attached to her had done a good days business in st joseph  he was sending in his orders to his employers he is a commercial traveller and was smoking a cigar when he became conscious that some one was sitting on his left with one arm on the table  it was his dead sister  he sprang up to embrace her for even on meeting a stranger whom we take for a dead friend we never realise the impossibility in the half moment of surprise but she was gone  mr g stood there the ink wet on his pen the cigar lighted in his hand the name of his sister on his lips  he had noted her expression features dress the kindness of her eyes the glow of the complexion and what he had never seen before a bright red scratch on the right side of her face  mr g took the next train home to st louis and told the story to his parents  his father was inclined to ridicule him but his mother nearly fainted  when she could control herself she said that unknown to any one she had accidentally scratched the face of the dead apparently with the pin of her brooch while arranging something about the corpse  she had obliterated the scratch with powder and had kept the fact to herself  she told me she knew at least that i had seen my sister  a few weeks later mrs g died 75  here the information existed in one living mind the mothers and if there is any mental telegraphy may thence have been conveyed to mr f g  another kind of cases which may be called veracious occurs when the ghost seer after seeing the ghost recognises it in a portrait not previously beheld  of course allowance must be made for fancy and for conscious or unconscious hoaxing  you see a spook in castle dangerous  you then recognise the portrait in the hall or elsewhere the temptation to recognise the spook rather more clearly than you really do is considerable just as one is tempted to recognise the features of the stuarts in the royal family of the parents in a baby or in any similar case  nothing is more common in literary ghost stories than for somebody to see a spectre and afterwards recognise him or her in a portrait not before seen  there is an early example in sir walter scotts tapestried chamber which was told to him by miss anna seward another such tale is by theophile gautier  in an essay on illusions by mr james sully a case is given  a lady who corroborated the story to the present author was vexed all night by a spectre in armour  next morning she saw what she had not previously observed a portrait of the spectre in the room  mr sully explains that she had seen the portrait unconsciously and dreamed of it  he adds the curious circumstance that other people have had the same experience in the same room which his explanation does not cover  the following story is published by the society for psychical research attested by the seer and her husband whose real names are known but not published 76  the vision and the portrait  mrs m writes december 15 1891 that before her vision she had heard nothing about hauntings in the house occupied by herself and her husband and nothing about the family sorrows of her predecessors there  one night on retiring to my bedroom about 11 oclock i thought i heard a peculiar moaning sound and some one sobbing as if in great distress of mind  i listened very attentively and still it continued so i raised the gas in my bedroom and then went to the window on the landing drew the blind aside and there on the grass was a very beautiful young girl in a kneeling posture before a soldier in a generals uniform sobbing and clasping her hands together entreating for pardon but alas he only waved her away from him  so much did i feel for the girl that i ran down the staircase to the door opening upon the lawn and begged her to come in and tell me her sorrow  the figures then disappeared gradually as in a dissolving view  not in the least nervous did i feel then went again to my bedroom took a sheet of writingpaper and wrote down what i had seen 77  mrs m whose husband was absent began to feel nervous and went to another ladys room  she later heard of an old disgrace to the youngest daughter of the proud family her predecessors in the house  the poor girl tried in vain to win forgiveness especially from a near relative a soldier sir x y  so vivid was my remembrance of the features of the soldier that some months after the occurrence of the vision when i called with my husband at a house where there was a portrait of him i stepped before it and said why look there is the general  and sure enough it was  mrs m had not heard that the portrait was in the room where she saw it  mr m writes that he took her to the house where he knew it to be without telling her of its existence  mrs m turned pale when she saw it  mr m knew the sad old story but had kept it to himself the family in which the disgrace occurred in 1847 or 1848 were his relations 78  this vision was a veracious hallucination it gave intelligence not otherwise known to mrs m and capable of confirmation therefore the appearances would be called ghosts  the majority of people do not believe in the truth of any such stories of veracious hallucinations just as they do not believe in veracious dreams  mr galton out of all his packets of reports of hallucinations does not even allude to a veracious example whether he has records of such a thing or not such reports however are ghost stories which we now proceed or continue to narrate  the reader will do well to remember that while everything ghostly and not to be explained by known physical facts is in the view of science a hallucination every hallucination is not a ghost for the purposes of storytelling  the hallucination must for storytelling purposes be veracious  following our usual method we naturally begin with the anecdotes least trying to the judicial faculties and most capable of an ordinary explanation  perhaps of all the senses the sense of touch though in some ways the surest is in others the most easily deceived some people who cannot call up a clear mental image of things seen say a saltcellar can readily call up a mental revival of the feeling of touching salt  again a slight accidental throb or leap of a sinew or vein may feel so like a touch that we turn round to see who touched us  these familiar facts go far to make the following tale more or less conceivable  the restraining hand  about twenty years ago writes mrs elliot i received some letters by post one of which contained 15 pounds in bank notes  after reading the letters i went into the kitchen with them in my hands  i was alone at the time     having done with the letters i made an effort to throw them into the fire when i distinctly felt my hand arrested in the act  it was as though another hand were gently laid upon my own pressing it back  much surprised i looked at my hand and then saw it contained not the letters i had intended to destroy but the bank notes and that the letters were in the other hand  i was so surprised that i called out whos here 80a  nobody will call this the touch of a vanished hand  part of mrs elliots mind knew what she was about and started an unreal but veracious feeling to warn her  we shall come to plenty of hands not so readily disposed of  next to touch the sense most apt to be deceived is hearing  every one who has listened anxiously for an approaching carriage has often heard it come before it came  in the summer of 1896 the writer with a lady and another companion were standing on the veranda at the back of a house in dumfriesshire waiting for a cab to take one of them to the station  they heard a cab arrive and draw up went round to the front of the house saw the servant open the door and bring out the luggage but wheeled vehicle there was none in sound or sight  yet all four persons had heard it probably by dint of expectation  to hear articulate voices where there are none is extremely common in madness 80b but not very rare as mr galton shows among the sane when the voices are veracious give unknown information they are in the same case as truthful dreams  i offer a few from the experience reported to me by himself of a man of learning whom i shall call a benedictine monk though that is not his real position in life  the benedictines voices  my friend as a lad was in a strait between the choice of two professions  he prayed for enlightenment and soon afterwards heard an internal voice advising a certain course  did you act on it i asked  no i didnt  i considered that in my circumstances it did not demand attention  later when a man grown he was in his study merely idling over some books on the table when he heard a loud voice from a corner of the room assert that a public event of great importance would occur at a given date  it did occur  about the same time being abroad he was in great anxiety as to a matter involving only himself  of this he never spoke to any one  on his return to england his mother said you were very wretched about so and so  how on earth did you know  i heard s voice telling me  now  had died years before in childhood  in these cases the benedictines own conjecture and his mothers affection probably divined facts which did not present themselves as thoughts in the ordinary way but took the form of unreal voices  there are many examples as of the girl in her bath who heard a voice say open the door four times did so then fainted and only escaped drowning by ringing the bell just before she swooned  of course she might not have swooned if she had not been alarmed by hearing the voices  these tales are dull enough and many voices like dr johnsons mothers when he heard her call his name she being hundreds of miles away lead to nothing and are not veracious when they are veracious as in the case of dreams it may be by sheer accident  in a similar class are warnings conveyed by the eye not by the ear the maoris of new zealand believe that if one sees a body lying across a path or oneself on the opposite side of a river it is wiser to try another path and a different ford  the man at the lift  in the same way in august 1890 a lady in a boston hotel in the dusk rang for the lift walked along the corridor and looked out of a window started to run to the door of the lift saw a man in front of it stopped and when the lighted lift came up found that the door was wide open and that had she run on as she intended she would have fallen down the well  here part of her mind may have known that the door was open and started a ghost for there was no real man there to stop her  pity that these things do not occur more frequently they doin new zealand 82  these are a few examples of useful veracious waking dreams  the sort of which we hear most are wraiths  a when awake meets b who is dead or dying or quite well at a distance  the number of these stories is legion  to these we

living is the highland term for the appearances of people who are alive and wellbut elsewhere  the common highland belief is that they show themselves to secondsighted persons very frequently before the arrival of a stranger or a visitor expected or unexpected  probably many readers have had the experience of meeting an acquaintance in the street  he passes us and within a hundred yards we again meet and talk with our friend  when he is of very marked appearance or has any strong peculiarity the experience is rather perplexing  perhaps a few bits of hallucination are sprinkled over a real object  this ordinary event leads on to what are called arrivals that is when a person is seen heard and perhaps spoken to in a place to which he is travelling but whither he has not yet arrived  mark twain gives an instance in his own experience  at a large crowded reception he saw approaching him in the throng a lady whom he had known and liked many years before  when she was near him he lost sight of her but met her at supper dressed as he had seen her in the levee  at that moment she was travelling by railway to the town in which he was 85a  a large number of these cases have been printed 85b  in one case a gentleman and lady from their window saw his brother and sisterinlaw drive past with a horse which they knew had not been out for some weeks  the seers were presently joined by the visitors daughter who had met the party on the road she having just left them at their house  ten minutes later the real pair arrived horse and all 85c  this last affair is one of several tales of phantom coaches not only heard but seen the coach being a coach of the living  in 1893 the author was staying at a highland castle when one of the ladies observed to her nephew so you and susan did drive in the dogcart i saw you pass my window  no we didnt but we spoke of doing it the lady then mentioned minute details of the dress and attitudes of her relations as they passed her window where the drive turned from the hall door through the park but in fact no such journey had been made  dr hack tuke published the story of the arrival of dr boase at his house a quarter of an hour before he came the people who saw him supposing him to be in paris 86  when a person is seen in arrival cases before he arrives the affair is not so odd if he is expected  undoubtedly expectation does sometimes conjure up phantasms and the author once saw as he supposed a serious accident occur which in fact did not take place though it seemed unavoidable  curiously enough this creation of phantasms by expectant attention seems to be rare where ghosts are expected  the author has slept in several haunted houses but has never seen what he was led to expect in many instances as in the lady in black infra a ghost who is a frequent visitor is never seen when people watch for her  among the many persons who have had delusions as to the presence of the dead very few have been hoping praying for and expecting them  i look for ghosts but none will force    their way to me  tis falsely said that there was ever intercourse    between the living and the dead for surely then i should have sight of him i wait for day and night with love and longings infinite  the affliction of margaret has been the affliction of most of us there are curious historical examples of these appearances of the living  goethe declares that he once met himself at a certain place in a certain dress and several years later found himself there in that costume  shelley was seen by his friends at lerici to pass along a balcony whence there was no exit  however he could not be found there  the story of the wraith of catherine the great is variously narrated  we give it as told by an eyewitness the comte de ribaupierre about 1862 to lady napier and ettrick  the count in 1862 was a very old man and more than thirty years have passed since he gave the tale to lady napier whose memory retains it in the following form  the wraith of the czarina  in the exercise of his duties as one of the pagesinwaiting ribaupierre followed one day his august mistress into the throneroom of the palace  when the empress accompanied by the high officers of her court and the ladies of her household came in sight of the chair of state which she was about to occupy she suddenly stopped and to the horror and astonished awe of her courtiers she pointed to a visionary being seated on the imperial throne  the occupant of the chair was an exact counterpart of herself  all saw it and trembled but none dared to move towards the mysterious presentment of their sovereign  after a moment of dead silence the great catherine raised her voice and ordered her guard to advance and fire on the apparition  the order was obeyed a mirror beside the throne was shattered the vision had disappeared and the empress with no sign of emotion took the chair from which her semblance had passed away  it is a striking barbaric scene  spirits of the living of this kind are common enough  in the highlands second sight generally means a view of an event or accident some time before its occurrence  thus an old man was sitting with a little boy on a felled tree beside a steep track in a quarry at ballachulish  suddenly he jerked the boy to one side and threw himself down on the further side of the tree  while the boy stared the old man slowly rose saying the spirits of the living are strong today  he had seen a mass of rock dashing along killing some quarrymen and tearing down the path  the accident occurred next day it is needless to dwell on second sight which is not peculiar to celts though the highlanders talk more about it than other people  these appearances of the living but absent whether caused by some mental action of the person who appears or not are at least unconscious on his part 88  but a few cases occur in which a living person is said by a voluntary exertion of mind to have made himself visible to a friend at a distance  one case is vouched for by baron von schrencknotzig a german psychologist who himself made the experiment with success  others are narrated by dr gibotteau  a curious tale is told by several persons as follows  an astral body  mr sparks and mr cleave young men of twenty and nineteen were accustomed to mesmerise each other in their dormitory at portsmouth where they were students of naval engineering  mr sparks simply stared into mr cleaves eyes as he lay on his bed till he went off the experiments seemed so curious that witnesses were called mr darley and mr thurgood  on friday 15th january 1886 mr cleave determined to try to see when asleep a young lady at wandsworth to whom he was in the habit of writing every sunday  he also intended if possible to make her see him  on awaking he said that he had seen her in the diningroom of her house that she had seemed to grow restless had looked at him and then had covered her face with her hands  on monday he tried again and he thought he had frightened her as after looking at him for a few minutes she fell back in her chair in a kind of faint  her little brother was in the room with her at the time  on tuesday next the young lady wrote telling mr cleave that she had been startled by seeing him on friday evening this is an error and again on monday evening much clearer when she nearly fainted  all this mr sparks wrote to mr gurney in the same week  he was inviting instructions on hypnotic experiments and launched a letter into space having read something vague about mr gurneys studies in the newspapers  the letter after some adventures arrived and on 15th march mr cleave wrote his account mr darley and mr thurgood corroborating as to their presence during the trance and as to mr cleaves statement when he awoke  mr cleave added that he made experiments for five nights running before seeing the lady  the young ladys letter of 19th january 1886 is also produced postmark portsmouth 20th january  but the lady mentions her first vision of mr cleave as on last tuesday not friday and her second while she was alone with her little brother at supper on monday  i was so frightened that i nearly fainted  these are all young people  it may be said that all five were concerned in a complicated hoax on mr gurney  nor would such a hoax argue any unusual moral obliquity  surtees of mainsforth in other respects an honourable man took in sir walter scott with forged ballads and never undeceived his friend  southey played off a hoax with his book the doctor  hogg lockhart and wilson with allan cunningham and many others were constantly engaged in such mystifications and a ghosthunter might seem a fair butt  but the very discrepancy in miss s letter is a proof of fairness her first vision of mr cleave was on tuesday last  mr cleaves first impression of success was on the friday following  but he had been making the experiment for five nights previous including the tuesday of miss s letter  had the affair been a hoax miss  would either have been requested by him to rewrite her letter putting friday for tuesday or what is simpler mr sparks would have adopted her version and written tuesday in place of friday in his first letter to mr gurney  the young lady naturally requested mr cleave not to try his experiment on her again  a similar case is that of mrs russell who tried successfully when awake and in scotland to appear to one of her family in germany  the sister corroborates and says pray dont come appearing to me again 91a  these spirits of the living lead to the subject of spirits of the dying  no kind of tale is so common as that of dying people appearing at a distance  hundreds have been conscientiously published 91b the belief is prevalent among the maoris of new zealand where the apparition is regarded as a proof of death 91c  now there is nothing in savage philosophy to account for this opinion of the maoris  a mans spirit leaves his body in dreams savages think and as dreaming is infinitely more common than death the maoris should argue that the appearance is that of a mans spirit wandering in his sleep  however they like many europeans associate a mans apparition with his death  not being derived from their philosophy this habit may be deduced from their experience  as there are undeniably many examples of hallucinatory appearances of persons in perfect health and ordinary circumstances the question has been asked whether there are more cases of an apparition coinciding with death than according to the doctrine of chances there ought to be  out of about 18000 answers to questions on this subject has been deduced the conclusion that the deaths do coincide with the apparitions to an extent beyond mere accident  even if we had an empty hallucination for every case coinciding with death we could not set the coincidences down to mere chance  as well might we say that if at the end of an hours rifle practice at longdistance range the record shows that for every shot that has hit the bulls eye another has missed the target therefore the shots that hit the target did so by accident 92  but as empty hallucinations are more likely to be forgotten than those which coincide with a death as exaggeration creeps in as the collectors of evidence are naturally inclined to select and question people whom they know to have a good story to tell the evidence connecting apparitions voices and so on with deaths is not likely to be received with favour  one thing must be remembered as affecting the theory that the coincidence between the wraith and the death is purely an accident everybody dreams and out of the innumerable dreams of mankind a few must hit the mark by a fluke  but hallucinations are not nearly so common as dreams  perhaps roughly speaking one person in ten has had what he believes to be a waking hallucination  therefore so to speak compared with dreams but a small number of shots of this kind are fired  therefore bulls eyes the coincidence between an appearance and a death are infinitely less likely to be due to chance in the case of waking hallucinations than in the case of dreams which all mankind are firing off every night of their lives  stories of these coincidences between appearances and deaths are as common as they are dull  most people come across them in the circle of their friends  they are all very much alike and make tedious reading  we give a few which have some picturesque features  in tavistock place 93  in the latter part of the autumn of 1878 between halfpast three and four in the morning i was leisurely walking home from the house of a sick friend  a middleaged woman apparently a nurse was slowly following going in the same direction  we crossed tavistock square together and emerged simultaneously into tavistock place  the streets and squares were deserted the morning bright and calm my health excellent nor did i suffer from anxiety or fatigue  a man suddenly appeared striding up tavistock place coming towards me and going in a direction opposite to mine  when first seen he was standing exactly in front of my own door 5 tavistock place  young and ghastly pale he was dressed in evening clothes evidently made by a foreign tailor  tall and slim he walked with long measured strides noiselessly  a tall white hat covered thickly with black crape and an eyeglass completed the costume of this strange form  the moonbeams falling on the corpselike features revealed a face well known to me that of a friend and relative  the sole and only person in the street beyond myself and this being was the woman already alluded to  she stopped abruptly as if spellbound then rushing towards the man she gazed intently and with horror unmistakable on his face which was now upturned to the heavens and smiling ghastly she indulged in her strange contemplation but during very few seconds then with extraordinary and unexpected speed for her weight and age she ran away with a terrific shriek and yell  this woman never have i seen or heard of since and but for her presence i could have explained the incident  called it say subjection of the mental powers to the domination of physical reflex action and the mans presence could have been termed a false impression on the retina  a week after this event news of this very friends death reached me it occurred on the morning in question  from the family i learned that according to the rites of the greek church and the custom of the country he resided in he was buried in his evening clothes made abroad by a foreign tailor and strange to say he wore goloshes over his boots according also to the custom of the country he died in     when in england he lived in tavistock place and occupied my rooms during my absence 95a  the wynyard wraith 95b  in the month of november 1785 or 1786 sir john sherbrooke and colonel wynyard were sitting before dinner in their barrack room at sydney cove in america  it was duskish and a candle was placed on a table at a little distance  a figure dressed in plain clothes and a good round hat passed gently between the above people and the fire while passing sir j sherbrooke exclaimed god bless my soul whos that  almost at the same moment colonel w said thats my brother john wynyard and i am sure he is dead  colonel w was much agitated and cried and sobbed a great deal  sir john said the fellow has a devilish good hat i wish i had it  hats were not to be got there and theirs were worn out  they immediately got up sir john was on crutches having broken his leg took a candle and went into the bedroom into which the figure had entered  they searched the bed and every corner of the room to no effect the windows were fastened up with mortar     they received no communication from england for about five months when a letter from mr rush the surgeon coldstream guards announced the death of john wynyard at the moment as near as could be ascertained when the figure appeared  in addition to this extraordinary circumstance sir john told me that two years and a half afterwards he was walking with lilly wynyard a brother of colonel w in london and seeing somebody on the other side of the way he recognised he thought the person who had appeared to him and colonel wynyard in america  lilly wynyard said that the person pointed out was a mr eyre hay that he and john wynyard were frequently mistaken for each other and that money had actually been paid to this mr eyre in mistake  a famous tale of an appearance is lord broughams  his lordship was not reckoned precisely a veracious man on the other hand this was not the kind of fable he was likely to tell  he was brought up under the regime of commonsense  on all such subjects my father was very sceptical he says  to disbelieve lord brougham we must suppose either that he wilfully made a false entry in his diary in 1799 or that in preparing his autobiography in 1862 he deliberately added a falsehoodand then explained his own marvel away  lord broughams story  december 19 1799      at one in the morning arriving at a decent inn in sweden we decided to stop for the night and found a couple of comfortable rooms  tired with the cold of yesterday i was glad to take advantage of a hot bath before i turned in  and here a most remarkable thing happened to meso remarkable that i must tell the story from the beginning  after i left the high school i went with g my most intimate friend to attend the classes in the university     we actually committed the folly of drawing up an agreement written with our blood to the effect that whichever of us died the first should appear to the other and thus solve any doubts we had entertained of the life after death  g went to india years passed and says lord brougham i had nearly forgotten his existence  i had taken as i have said a warm bath and while lying in it and enjoying the comfort of the heat i turned my head round looking towards the chair on which i had deposited my clothes as i was about to get out of the bath  on the chair sat g looking calmly at me  how i got out of the bath i know not but on recovering my senses i found myself sprawling on the floor  the apparition or whatever it was that had taken the likeness of g had disappeared     so strongly was i affected by it that i have here written down the whole history with the date 19th december and all the particulars as they are now fresh before me  no doubt i had fallen asleep he has just said that he was awake and on the point of leaving the bath and that the appearance presented so distinctly to my eyes was a dream i cannot for a moment doubt     on 16th october 1862 lord brougham copied this extract for his autobiography and says that on his arrival in edinburgh he received a letter from india announcing that g had died on 19th december  he remarks singular coincidence and adds that considering the vast number of dreams the number of coincidences is perhaps fewer than a fair calculation of chances would warrant us to expect  this is a concession to commonsense and argues an ignorance of the fact that sane and apparently waking men may have hallucinations on the theory that we may have inappreciable moments of sleep when we think ourselves awake it is not an ordinary but an extraordinary coincidence that brougham should have had that peculiar moment of the dream of g on the day or night of gs death while the circumstance that he had made a compact with g multiplies the odds against accident in a ratio which mathematicians may calculate brougham was used to dreams like other people he was not shocked by them  this dream produced such a shock that i had no inclination to talk about it  even on broughams showing then this dream was a thing unique in his experience and not one of the swarm of visions of sleep  thus his including it among these while his whole language shows that he himself did not really reckon it among these is an example of the fallacies of commonsense  he completes his fallacy by saying it is not much more wonderful than that a person whom we had no reason to expect should appear to us at the very moment we had been thinking or speaking of him  but lord brougham had not been speaking or thinking of g there had been nothing to call him to my recollection he says  to give his logic any value he should constantly when as far as he knew awake have had dreams that shocked him  then one coincidence would have had no assignable cause save ordinary accident  if lord brougham fabled in 1799 or in 1862 he did so to make a sensation  and then he tried to undo it by arguing that his experience was a thoroughly commonplace affair  we now give a very old story the dying mother  if the reader will compare it with mr cleaves case an astral body in this chapter he will be struck by the resemblance  mr cleave and mrs goffe were both in a trance  both wished to see persons at a distance  both saw and each was seen mrs goffe by her childrens nurse mr cleave by the person whom he wished to see but not by a small boy also present  the dying mother 101  mary the wife of john goffe of rochester being afflicted with a long illness removed to her fathers house at west mulling about nine miles from her own  there she died on 4th june this present year 1691  the day before her departure death she grew very impatiently desirous to see her two children whom she had left at home to the care of a nurse  she prayed her husband to hire a horse for she must go home and die with the children  she was too ill to be moved but a minister who lives in the town was with her at ten oclock that night to whom she expressed good hopes in the mercies of god and a willingness to die  but said she it is my misery that i cannot see my children  between one and two oclock in the morning she fell into a trance one widow turner who watched with her that night says that her eyes were open and fixed and her jaw fallen  mrs turner put her hand upon her mouth and nostrils but could perceive no breath  she thought her to be in a fit and doubted whether she were dead or alive  the next morning the dying woman told her mother that she had been at home with her children    i was with them last night when i was asleep  the nurse at rochester widow alexander by name affirms and says she will take her oath ont before a magistrate and receive the sacrament upon it that a little before two oclock that morning she saw the likeness of the said mary goffe come out of the next chamber where the elder child lay in a bed by itself the door being left open and stood by her bedside for about a quarter of an hour the younger child was there lying by her  her eyes moved and her mouth went but she said nothing  the nurse moreover says that she was perfectly awake it was then daylight being one of the longest days in the year  she sat up in bed and looked steadfastly on the apparition  in that time she heard the bridge clock strike two and a while after said in the name of the father son and holy ghost what art thou  thereupon the apparition removed and went away she slipped on her clothes and followed but what became ont she cannot tell  mrs alexander then walked out of doors till six when she persuaded some neighbours to let her in  she told her adventure they failed to persuade her that she had dreamed it  on the same day the neighbours wife mrs sweet went to west mulling saw mrs goffe before her death and heard from mrs goffes mother the story of the daughters dream of her children mrs sweet not having mentioned the nurses story of the apparition  that poor mrs goffe walked to rochester and returned undetected a distance of eighteen miles is difficult to believe  goethe has an obiter dictum on the possibility of intercommunion without the aid of the ordinary senses between the souls of lovers something of the kind is indicated in anecdotes of dreams dreamed in common by husband and wife but in such cases it may be urged that the same circumstance or the same noise or other disturbing cause may beget the same dream in both  a better instance is  the vision of the bride  colonel meadows taylor writes in the story of my life vol ii p 32  the determination to live unmarried was the result of a very curious and strange incident that befel me during one of my marches to hyderabad  i have never forgotten it and it returns to this day to my memory with a strangely vivid effect that i can neither repel nor explain  i purposely withhold the date of the year  in my very early life i had been deeply and devotedly attached to one in england and only relinquished the hope of one day winning her when the terrible order came out that no furlough to europe would be granted  one evening i was at the village of dewas kudea after a very long afternoon and evening march from muktul and i lay down very weary but the barking of village dogs the baying of jackals and over fatigue and heat prevented sleep and i was wide awake and restless suddenly for my tent door was wide open i saw the face and figure so familiar to me but looking older and with a sad and troubled expression the dress was white and seemed covered with a profusion of lace and glistened in the bright moonlight  the arms were stretched out and a low plaintive cry of do not let me go  do not let me go reached me  i sprang forward but the figure receded growing fainter and fainter till i could see it no more but the low plaintive tones still sounded  i had run barefooted across the open space where my tents were pitched very much to the astonishment of the sentry on guard but i returned to my tent without speaking to him  i wrote to my father  i wished to know whether there were any hope for me  he wrote back to me these words  too late my dear sonon the very day of the vision you describe to me a was married  the colonel did not keep his determination not to marry for his life is edited by his daughter who often heard her father mention the incident precisely in the same manner and exactly as it is in the book 103  if thinking of friends and lovers lost or dead could bring their forms and voices before the eye and ear of flesh there would be a world of hallucinations around us  but it wants heavensent moments for this skill and few bridal nights send a vision and a voice to the bed of a wakeful lover far away  stories of this kind appearances of the living or dying really at a distance might be multiplied to any extent  they are all capable of explanation if we admit the theory of telepathy of a message sent by an unknown process from one living mans mind to another  where more than one person shares the vision we may suppose that the influence comes directly from a to b c and d or comes from a to b and is by him unconsciously wired on to b and c or is suggested to them by bs conduct or words  in that case animals may be equally affected thus if b seems alarmed that may frighten his dog or the alarm of a dog caused by some noise or smell heard or smelt by him may frighten b c and d and make one or all of them see a ghost  popular opinion is strongly in favour of beasts seeing ghosts  the people of st kilda according to martin held that cows shared the visions of secondsighted milkmaids  horses are said to shy on the scene of murders  scotts horse ran away home when sir walter saw the bogle near ashiestiel  in a case given later the dog shut up in a room full of unexplained noises yelled and whined  the same dog an intimate friend of my own bristled up his hair and growled before his master saw the grey lady  the rev j g wood gives a case of a cat which nearly went mad when his mistress saw an apparition  jeremy taylor tells of a dog which got quite used to a ghost that often appeared to his master and used to follow it  in the lady in black a dog would jump up and fawn on the ghost and then run away in a fright  mr wesleys mastiff was much alarmed by the family ghost not to multiply cases dogs and other animals are easily affected by whatever it is that makes people think a ghost is present or by the conduct of the human beings on these occasions  absurd as the subject appears there are stories of the ghosts of animals  these may be discussed later meanwhile we pass from appearances of the living or dying to stories of appearances of the dead      chapter vi   transition to appearances of the dead  obvious scientific difficulties  purposeless

inconceivable that living minds may communicate by some other channel than that of the recognised senses science now admits the fact of hypnotic influence though sixty years ago braid was not allowed to read a paper on it before the british association  even now the topic is not welcome  but perhaps only one eminent man of science declares that hypnotism is all imposture and malobservation  thus it is not wholly beyond the scope of fancy to imagine that some day official science may glance at the evidence for telepathy  but the stories we have been telling deal with living men supposed to be influencing living men  when the dead are alleged to exercise a similar power we have to suppose that some consciousness survives the grave and manifests itself by causing hallucinations among the living  instances of this have already been given in the ghost and the portrait the bright scar and riding home after mess  these were adduced as examples of veracity in hallucinations  each appearance gave information to the seer which he did not previously possess  in the first case the lady who saw the soldier and the suppliant did not know of their previous existence and melancholy adventure  in the second the brother did not know that his dead sisters face had been scratched  in the third the observer did not know that lieutenant b had grown a beard and acquired a bay pony with black mane and tail  but though the appearances were veracious they were purposeless and again as in each case the information existed in living minds it may have been wired on from them  thus the doctrine of telepathy puts a ghost of the dead in a great quandary  if he communicates no verifiable information he may be explained as a mere empty illusion  if he does yield fresh information and if that is known to any living mind he and his intelligence may have been wired on from that mind  his only chance is to communicate facts which are proved to be true facts which nobody living knew before  now it is next to impossible to demonstrate that the facts communicated were absolutely unknown to everybody  far however from conveying unknown intelligence most ghosts convey none at all and appear to have no purpose whatever  it will be observed that there was no traceable reason why the girl with a scar should appear to mr g or the soldier and suppliant to mrs m or lieutenant b to general barker  the appearances came in a vague casual aimless way just as the living and healthy clergyman appeared to the diplomatist  on st augustines theory the dead persons who appeared may have known no more about the matter than did the living clergyman  it is not even necessary to suppose that the dead man was dreaming about the living person to whom or about the place in which he appeared  but on the analogy of the tales in which a dream or thought of the living seems to produce a hallucination of their presence in the minds of other and distant living people so a dream of the dead may it is urged have a similar effect if in that sleep of death such dreams may come  the idea occurred to shakespeare  in any case the ghosts of our stories hitherto have been so aimless and purposeless as to resemble what we might imagine a dead mans dream to be  this view of the case that a ghost may be a reflection of a dead mans dream will become less difficult to understand if we ask ourselves what natural thing most resembles the common idea of a ghost  you are reading alone at night let us say the door opens and a human figure glides into the room  to you it pays no manner of attention it does not answer if you speak it may trifle with some object in the chamber and then steal quietly out again  it is the housemaid walking in her sleep  this perfectly accountable appearance in its aimlessness its unconsciousness its irresponsiveness is undeniably just like the common notion of a ghost  now if ordinary ghosts are not of flesh and blood like the sleepwalking housemaid yet are as irresponsive as unconscious and as vaguely wandering as she then if the dead are somewhat a ghost may be a hallucination produced in the living by the unconscious action of the mind of the dreaming dead  the conception is at least conceivable  if adopted merely for arguments sake it would first explain the purposeless behaviour of ghosts and secondly relieve people who see ghosts of the impression that they see spirits  in the scotch phrase the ghost obviously is not all there any more than the sleep walker is intellectually all there this incomplete incoherent presence is just what might be expected if a dreaming disembodied mind could affect an embodied mind with a hallucination  but the good oldfashioned ghost stories are usually of another type the robust and earnest ghosts of our ancestors had their own purpose sunclear before them as mr carlyle would have said  they knew what they wanted asked for it and saw that they got it  as a rule their bodies were unburied and so they demanded sepulture or they had committed a wrong and wished to make restitution or they had left debts which they were anxious to pay or they had advice or warnings or threats to communicate or they had been murdered and were determined to bring their assassins to the gibbet  why we may ask were the old ghost stories so different from the new well first they were not all different  again probably only the more dramatic tales were as a rule recorded  thirdly many of the stories may have been either embellisheda fancied purpose being attributed to a purposeless ghostor they may even have been invented to protect witnesses who gave information against murderers  who could disobey a ghost  in any case the old ghost stories are much more dramatic than the new to them we turn beginning with the appearances of mr and mrs furze at spraiton in devonshire in 1682  our author is mr richard bovet in his pandaemonium or the devils cloister opened 1683  the motive of the late mr furze was to have some small debts paid his wifes spectre was influenced by a jealousy of mr furzes spectres relations with another lady  the daemon of spraiton in devon 111 anno 1682  about the month of november in the year 1682 in the parish of spraiton in the county of devon one francis fey servant to mr philip furze being in a field near the dwellinghouse of his said master there appeared unto him the resemblance of an aged gentleman like his masters father with a pole or staff in his hand resembling that he was wont to carry when living to kill the moles withal  the spectrum approached near the young man whom you may imagin not a little surprized at the appearance of one that he knew to be dead but the spectrum bid him not be afraid of him but tell his master who was his son that several legacies which by his testament he had bequeathed were unpaid naming ten shillings to one and ten shillings to another both which persons he named to the young man who replyed that the party he last named was dead and so it could not be paid to him  the ghost answered he knew that but it must be paid to the next relation whom he also named  the spectrum likewise ordered him to carry twenty shillings to a gentlewoman sister to the deceased living near totness in the said county and promised if these things were performed to trouble him no further but at the same time the spectrum speaking of his second wife who was also dead called her wicked woman though the gentleman who writ the letter knew her and esteemed her a very good woman  and having thus related him his mind the spectrum left the young man who according to the direction of the spirit took care to see the small legacies satisfied and carried the twenty shillings that was appointed to be paid the gentlewoman near totness but she utterly refused to receive it being sent her as she said from the devil the same night the young man lodging at her house the aforesaid spectrum appeared to him again whereupon the young man challenged his promise not to trouble him any more saying he had performed all according to his appointment but that the gentlewoman his sister would not receive the money  to which the spectrum replied that was true indeed but withal directed the young man to ride to totness and buy for her a ring of that value which the spirit said she would accept of which being provided accordingly she received  since the performance of which the ghost or apparition of the old gentleman hath seemed to be at rest having never given the young man any further trouble  but the next day after having delivered the ring the young man was riding home to his masters house accompanyed by a servant of the gentlewomans near totness and near about the time of their entrance or a little before they came into the parish of spraiton aforesaid there appeared to be upon the horse behind the young man the resemblance of the second wife of the old gentleman spoken of before  this daemon often threw the young man off his horse and cast him with such violence to the ground as was great astonishment not only to the gentlewomans servant with him but to divers others who were spectators of the frightful action the ground resounding with great noise by reason of the incredible force with which he was cast upon it  at his coming into his masters yard the horse which he rid though very poor and out of case leaped at one spring twentyfive foot to the amazement of all that saw it  soon after the shespectre shewed herself to divers in the house viz the aforesaid young man mistress thomasin gidly ann langdon born in that parish and a little child which by reason of the troublesomeness of the spirit they were fain to remove from that house  she appeared sometimes in her own shape sometimes in forms very horrid now and then like a monstrous dog belching out fire at another time it flew out at the window in the shape of a horse carrying with it only one pane of glass and a small piece of iron  one time the young mans head was thrust into a very strait place betwixt a beds head and a wall and forced by the strength of divers men to be removed thence and that not without being much hurt and bruised so that much blood appeared about it  upon this it was advised he should be bleeded to prevent any ill accident that might come of the bruise after bleeding the ligature or binder of his arm was removed from thence and conveyed about his middle where it was strained with such violence that the girding had almost stoppd his breath and killd him and being cut asunder it made a strange and dismal noise so that the standers by were affrighted at it  at divers other times he hath been in danger to be strangled with cravats and handkerchiefs that he hath worn about his neck which have been drawn so close that with the sudden violence he hath near been choaked and hardly escaped death  the spectre hath shewed great offence at the perriwigs which the young man used to wear for they are often torn from his head after a very strange manner one that he esteemed above the rest he put in a small box and that box he placed in another which he set against the wall of his chamber placing a jointstool with other weight a top of it but in short time the boxes were broken in sunder and the perriwig rended into many small parts and tatters  another time lying in his masters chamber with his perriwig on his head to secure it from danger within a little time it was torn from him and reduced into very small fragments  at another time one of his shoestrings was observed without the assistance of any hand to come of its own accord out of its shoe and fling itself to the other side of the room the other was crawling after it but a maid espying that with her hand drew it out and it strangely claspd and curld about her hand like a living eel or serpent this is testified by a lady of considerable quality too great for exception who was an eyewitness the same lady shewed mr c one of the young mans gloves which was torn in his pocket while she was by which is so dexterously tatterd and so artificially torn that it is conceived a cutler could not have contrived an instrument to have laid it abroad so accurately and all this was done in the pocket in the compass of one minute  it is further observable that if the aforesaid young man or another person who is a servant maid in the house do wear their own clothes they are certainly torn in pieces on their backs but if the clothes belong to any other they are not injured after that manner  many other strange and fantastical freaks have been done by the said daemon or spirit in the view of divers persons a barrel of salt of considerable quantity hath been observed to march from room to room without any human assistance  an handiron hath seemed to lay itself cross overthwart a pan of milk that hath been scalding over the fire and two flitches of bacon have of their own accord descended from the chimney where they were hung and placed themselves upon the handiron  when the spectre appears in resemblance of her own person she seems to be habited in the same cloaths and dress which the gentlewoman of the house her daughterinlaw hath on at the same time  divers times the feet and legs of the young man aforesaid have been so entangled about his neck that he hath been loosed with great difficulty sometimes they have been so twisted about the frames of chairs and stools that they have hardly been set at liberty  but one of the most considerable instances of the malice of the spirit against the young man happened on easter eve when mrs c the relator was passing by the door of the house and it was thus  when the young man was returning from his labour he was taken up by the skirt of his doublet by this female daemon and carried a height into the air  he was soon missed by his master and some other servants that had been at labour with him and after diligent enquiry no news could be heard of him until at length near half an hour after he was heard singing and whistling in a bog or quagmire where they found him in a kind of trance or extatick fit to which he hath sometimes been accustomed but whether before the affliction he met with from this spirit i am not certain  he was affected much after such sort as at the time of those fits so that the people did not give that attention and regard to what he said as at other times but when he returned again to himself which was about an hour after he solemnly protested to them that the daemon had carried him so high that his masters house seemed to him to be but as a haycock and that during all that time he was in perfect sense and prayed to almighty god not to suffer the devil to destroy him and that he was suddenly set down in that quagmire  the workmen found one shoe on one side of his masters house and the other on the other side and in the morning espied his perriwig hanging on the top of a tree by which it appears he had been carried a considerable height and that what he told them was not a fiction  after this it was observed that that part of the young mans body which had been on the mud in the quagmire was somewhat benummbed and seemingly deader than the other whereupon the following saturday which was the day before low sunday he was carried to crediton alias kirton to be bleeded which being done accordingly and the company having left him for some little space at their return they found him in one of his fits with his forehead much bruised and swoln to a great bigness none being able to guess how it happened until his recovery from that fit when upon enquiry he gave them this account of it  that a bird had with great swiftness and force flown in at the window with a stone in its beak which it had dashed against his forehead which had occasioned the swelling which they saw  the people much wondering at the strangeness of the accident diligently sought the stone and under the place where he sat they found not such a stone as they expected but a weight of brass or copper which it seems the daemon had made use of on that occasion to give the poor young man that hurt in his forehead  the persons present were at the trouble to break it to pieces every one taking a part and preserving it in memory of so strange an accident  after this the spirit continued to molest the young man in a very severe and rugged manner often handling him with great extremity and whether it hath yet left its violences to him or whether the young man be yet alive i can have no certain account  i leave the reader to consider of the extraordinary strangeness of the relation  the reader considering the exceeding strangeness of the relation will observe that we have now reached great swingeing falsehoods even if that opinion had not hitherto occurred to his mind  but if he thinks that such stories are no longer told and even sworn to on bible oath he greatly deceives himself  in the chapter on haunted houses he will find statements just as hard narrated of the years 1870 and 1882  in these however the ghosts had no purpose but mischief 118  we take another ghost with a purpose  sir george villiers ghost  the variations in the narratives of sir george villiers appearance to an old servant of his or old protege and the warning communicated by this man to villiers son the famous duke of buckingham are curious and instructive  the tale is first told in print by william lilly the astrologer in the second part of a large tract called monarchy or no monarchy in england london 1651 twentythree years after buckinghams murder  but while prior in publication lillys story was probably written after though independent of lord clarendons in the first book of his history of the rebellion begun on 18th march 1646 that is within eighteen years of the events  clarendon of course was in a position to know what was talked of at the time next we have a letter of mr douch to glanvil undated but written after the restoration and finally an original manuscript of 1652  douch makes the warning arrive some few days before the murder of buckingham and says that the ghost of sir george in his morning gown bade one parker tell buckingham to abandon the expedition to la rochelle or expect to be murdered  on the third time of appearing the vision pulled a long knife from under his gown as a sign of the death awaiting buckingham  he also communicated a private token to parker the percipient sir georges old servant  on each occasion of the appearance parker was reading at midnight  parker after the murder told one ceeley who told it to a clergyman who told douch who told glanvil  in lillys version the ghost had a habit of walking in parkers room and finally bade him tell buckingham to abstain from certain company or else he will come to destruction and that suddenly  parker thinking he had dreamed did nothing the ghost reappeared and communicated a secret which he buckingham knows that none in the world ever knew but myself and he  the duke on hearing the story from parker backed by the secret was amazed but did not alter his conduct  on the third time the spectre produced the knife but at this information the duke only laughed  six weeks later he was stabbed  douch makes the whole affair pass immediately before the assassination  and mr parker died soon after as the ghost had foretold to him  finally clarendon makes the appearances set in six months before felton slew the duke  the percipient unnamed was in bed  the narrative now develops new features the token given on the ghosts third coming obviously concerns buckinghams mother the countess the one person more who knew the secret communicated  the ghost produces no knife from under his gown no warning of buckinghams death by violence is mentioned  a note in the ms avers that clarendon himself had papers bearing on the subject and that he got his information from sir ralph freeman who introduced the unnamed percipient to the duke and from some of buckinghams servants who were informed of much of it before the murder of the duke  clarendon adds that in general no man looked on relations of that sort with less reverence and consideration than he did  this anecdote he selects out of many stories scattered abroad at the time as upon a better foundation of credit  the percipient was an officer in the kings wardrobe at windsor of a good reputation for honesty and discretion and aged about fifty  he was bred at a school in sir georges parish and as a boy was kindly treated by sir george whom afterwards he never saw  on first beholding the spectre in his room the seer recognised sir georges costume then antiquated  at last the seer went to sir ralph freeman who introduced him to the duke on a hunting morning at lambeth bridge  they talked earnestly apart observed by sir ralph clarendons informant  the duke seemed abstracted all day left the field early sought his mother and after a heated conference of which the sounds reached the anteroom went forth in visible trouble and anger a thing never before seen in him after talk with his mother  she was found overwhelmed with tears and in the highest agony imaginable  it is a notorious truth that when told of his murder she seemed not in the least degree surprised  the following curious manuscript account of the affair is after the prefatory matter the copy of a letter dated 1652  there is nothing said of a ghostly knife the name of the seer is not parker and in its whole effect the story tallies with clarendons version though the narrator knows nothing of the scene with the countess of buckingham  cavalier version 121  1627  since william lilly the rebells jugler and mountebank in his malicious and blaspheamous discourse concerning our late martyred soveraigne of ever blessed memory amongst other lyes and falsehoods imprinted a relation concerning an aparition which foretold several events which should happen to the duke of buckingham wherein he falsifies boeth the person to whom it appeared and ye circumstances i thought it not amis to enter here that it may be preserved the true account of that aparition as i have receaved it from the hande and under the hande of mr edmund wyndham of kellefford in the county of somersett  i shall sett it downe ipsissimis verbis as he delivered it to me at my request written with his own hande  wyndhams letter  sr  according to your desire and my promise i have written down what i remember divers things being slipt out of my memory of the relation made me by mr nicholas towse concerning the aparition wch visited him  about ye yeare 1627 122 i and my wife upon an occasion being in london lay att my brother pynes house without bishopsgate wch was ye next house unto mr nicholas towses who was my kinsman and familiar acquaintance in consideration of whose society and friendship he tooke a house in that place ye said towse being a very fine musician and very good company and for ought i ever saw or heard a vurtuous religious and wel disposed gentleman  about that time ye said mr towse tould me that one night being in bed and perfectly waking and a candle burning by him as he usually had there came into his chamber and stood by his bed side an olde gentleman in such an habitt as was in fashion in q  elizebeths tyme at whose first appearance mr towse was very much troubled but after a little tyme recollecting himselfe he demanded of him in ye name of god what he was whether he were a man  and ye aparition replyed no then he asked him if he were a divell  and ye answer was no  then mr towse said in ye name of god what art thou then  and as i remember mr towse told me that ye apparition answered him that he was ye ghost of sir george villiers father to ye then duke of buckingham whom he might very well remember synce he went to schoole at such a place in leicestershire naming ye place which i have forgotten  and mr towse tould me that ye apparition had perfectly ye resemblance of ye said sr george villiers in all respects and in ye same habitt that he had often seene him weare in his lifetime  the said apparition then tould mr towse that he could not but remember ye much kindness that he ye said sr george villiers had expressed to him whilst he was a schollar in leicestershire as aforesaid and that as out of that consideration he believed that he loved him and that therefore he made choyce of him ye sayde mr towse to deliver a message to his sonne ye duke of buckingham thereby to prevent such mischiefe as would otherwise befall ye said duke whereby he would be inevitably ruined  and then as i remember mr towse tould me that ye apparition instructed him what message he should deliver unto ye duke  vnto wch mr towse replyed that he should be very unwilling to goe to ye duke of buckingham upon such an errand whereby he should gaine nothing but reproach and contempt and to be esteemed a madman and therefore desired to be exscused from ye employment but ye apparition pressd him wth much earnestness to undertake it telling him that ye circumstances and secret discoveries which he should be able to make to ye duke of such passages in ye course of his life which were known to none but himselfe would make it appeare that ye message was not ye fancy of a distempered brayne but a reality and so ye apparition tooke his leave of him for that night and telling him that he would give him leave to consider till the next night and then he would come to receave his answer wheather he would undertake to deliver his message or no  mr towse past that day wth much trouble and perplexity debating and reasoning wth himselfe wether he should deliver his message or not to ye duke but in ye conclusion he resolved to doe it and ye next night when ye apparition came he gave his answer accordingly and then receaved his full instruction  after which mr towse went and founde out sr thomas bludder and sr ralph freeman by whom he was brought to ye duke of buckingham and had sevarall private and lone audiences of him i my selfe by ye favoure of a freinde sr edward savage was once admitted to see him in private conference with ye duke where although i heard not there discourses i observed much earnestnessse in their actions and gestures  after wch conference mr towse tould me that ye duke would not follow ye advice that was given him which was as i remember that he intimated ye casting of and ye rejecting of some men who had great interest in him which was and as i take it he named bp laud and that ye duke was to doe some popular acts in ye ensuing parliament of which parliament ye duke would have had mr towse to have been a burgesse but he refused it alleadging that unlesse ye duke followed his directions he must doe him hurt if he were of ye parliament  mr towse then toalde that ye duke of buckingham confessed that he had toalde him those things wch no creature knew but himself and that none but god or ye divell could reveale to him  ye duke offered mr towse to have ye king knight him and to have given him preferment as he tould me but that he refused it saying that vnless he would follow his advice he would receave nothing from him  mr towse when he made me this relation he tolde me that ye duke would inevitably be destroyed before such a time wch he then named and accordingly ye dukes death happened before that time  he likewise tolde that he had written downe all ye severall discourses that he had had wth ye apparition and that at last his coming was so familiar that he was as litle troubled with it as if it had beene a friende or acquayntance that had come to visitt him  mr towse told me further that ye archbishop of canterbury then bishop of london dr laud should by his councells be ye authoure of very great troubles to ye kingdome by which it should be reduced to ye extremity of disorder and confusion and that it should seeme to be past all hope of recovery without a miracle but when all people were in dispayre of seeing happy days agayne ye kingdome should suddenly be reduced and resettled agayne in a most happy condition  at this tyme my father pyne was in trouble and comitted to ye gatehouse by ye lords of ye councell about a quarrel betweene him and ye lord powlett upon which one night i saide to my cosin towse by way of jest i pray aske your appairition what shall become of my father pynes business which he promised to doe and ye next day he tolde me that my father pynes enemyes were ashamed of their malicious prosecution and that he would be at liberty within a week or some few days which happened according  mr towse his wife since his death tolde me that her husband and she living at windsor castle where he had an office that sumer that ye duke of buckingham was killed tolde her that very day that the duke was sett upon by ye mutinous mariners att portesmouth saying then that ye next attempt agaynst him would be his death which accordingly happened  and att ye instant ye duke was killed as she vnderstood by ye relation afterwards mr towse was sitting in his chayre out of which he suddenly started vp and sayd wyfe ye duke of buckingham is slayne  mr towse lived not long after that himselfe but tolde his wife ye tyme of his death before itt happened  i never saw him after i had seen some effects of his discourse which before i valued not and therefore was not curious to enquire after more than he voluntaryly tolde me which i then entertayned not wth these serious thoughts which i have synce reflected on in his discourse  this is as much as i can remember on this business which according to youre desire is written by  sr yor c  edmund windham  boulogne 5th august 1652        this version has over all others the merit of being written by an acquaintance of the seer who was with him while the appearances were going on  the narrator was also present at an interview between the seer and buckingham  his mention of sir ralph freeman tallies with clarendons who had the story from freeman  the ghost predicts the restoration and this is recorded before that happy event  of course mr towse may have been interested in buckinghams career and may have invented the ghost after discovering the secret token 127 as an excuse for warning him  the reader can now take his choice among versions of sir george villiers ghost  he must remember that in 1642 sir henry wotton spent some inquiry whether the duke had any ominous presagement before his end but found no evidence  sir henry told izaak walton a story of a dream of an ancestor of his own whereby some robbers of the university chest at oxford were brought to justice  anthony wood consulted the records of the year mentioned and found no trace of any such robbery  we now approach a yet more famous ghost than sir georges  this is lord lytteltons  the ghost had a purpose to warn that bad man of his death but nobody knows whose ghost she was  lord lytteltons ghost  sir said dr johnson it is the most extraordinary thing that has happened in my day  the doctors day included the rising of 1745 and of the wesleyans the seizure of canada the seven years war the american rebellion the cock lane ghost and other singular occurrences but the most extraordinary thing waslord lytteltons ghost  famous as is that spectre nobody knows what it was nor even whether there was any spectre at all  thomas lord lyttelton was born in 1744  in 1768 he entered the house of commons  in 1769 he was unseated for bribery  he then vanishes from public view probably he was playing the prodigal at home and abroad till february 1772 when he returned to his fathers house and married  he then went abroad with a barmaid till 1773 when his father died  in january 1774 he took his seat in the house of lords  in november 1779 lyttelton went into opposition  on thursday 25th november he denounced government in a magnificent speech  as to a sinecure which he held he said perhaps i shall not keep it long  something had happened  on the night before his speech that of wednesday 24th november lyttelton had seen the ghost and had been told that he would die in three days  he mentioned this to rowan hamilton on the friday 129a on the same day or on friday he mentioned it to captain ascough who told a lady who told mrs thrale 129b  on the friday he went to epsom with friends and mentioned the ghost to them among others to mr fortescue 129c  about midnight on 28th november lord lyttelton died suddenly in bed his valet having left him for a moment to fetch a spoon for stirring his medicine  the cause of death was not stated there was no inquest  this literally is all that is known about lord lytteltons ghost it is variously described as  1 a young woman and a robin horace walpole 2 a spirit captain ascough 3 a bird in a dream which changed into a woman in white lord westcotes narrative of 13th february 1780 collected from lord lytteltons guests and servants 4 a bird turning into a woman mrs delany 9th december 1779 5 a dream of a bird followed by a woman mrs amphlett in white pitt place archives after 1789 6 a fluttering noise as of a bird followed by the apparition of a woman who had committed suicide after being seduced by lyttelton lady lyttelton 1828 7 a bird which vanished when a female spirit in white raiment presented herself scots magazine novemberdecember 1779  out of seven versions a bird or a fluttering noise as of a bird a common feature in ghost stories 130a with a woman following or accompanying occurs in six  the phenomena are almost equally ascribed to dreaming and to waking hallucination but the commonsense of the eighteenth century called all ghosts dreams  in the westcote narrative 1780 lyttelton explains the dream by his having lately been in a room with a lady mrs dawson when a robin flew in  yet in the same narrative lyttelton says on saturday morning that he was very well and believed he should bilk the ghost  he was certainly in bed at the time of the experience and probably could not be sure whether he was awake or asleep 130b  considering the remoteness of time the story is very well recorded it is chronicled by mrs thrale before the news of lytteltons death reached her and by lady mary coke two days later by walpole on the day after the peers decease of which he had heard  lord lytteltons health had for some time been bad he had made his will a few weeks before and his nights were horrorhaunted  a little boy his nephew to whom he was kind used to find the wicked lord sitting by his bed at night because he dared not be alone  so lockhart writes to his daughter mrs hope scott 131  he had strange dreams of being in hell with the cruel murderess mrs brownrigg who whipped three female prentices to death and hid them in the coalhole  such a man might have strange fancies and a belief in approaching death might bring its own fulfilment  the hypothesis of a premeditated suicide with the story of the ghost as a last practical joke has no corroboration  it occurred to horace walpole at once but he laid no stress on it  such is a plain dry statistical account of the most extraordinary event that happened in dr johnsons day  however the story does not end here  on the fatal night 27th november 1779 mr andrews mp a friend of lytteltons was awakened by finding lord lyttelton drawing his curtains  suspecting a practical joke he hunted for his lordship both in his house and in the garden  of course he never found him  the event was

charles to cluny from charles in the convent of st joseph to cluny lurking on ben alder  kilt and tartan were worn at the risk of life or liberty in short the embers of the rising were not yet extinct  at this time in the summer of 1749 sergeant arthur davies of guises regiment marched with eight privates from aberdeen to dubrach in braemar while a corporals guard occupied the spital of glenshee some eight miles away  a more waste tract of mountain and bog rocks and ravines without habitations of any kind till you reach glenclunie is scarce to be met with in scotland says sir walter  the sergeants business was the general surveillance of the country side  he was a kindly prosperous man liked in the country fond of children newly married and his wife bore witness that he and she lived together in as great amity and love as any couple could do and that he never was in use to stay away a night from her  the sergeant had saved fifteen guineas and a half he carried the gold in a green silk purse and was not averse to displaying it  he wore a silver watch and two gold rings one with a peculiar knob on the bezel  he had silver buckles to his brogues silver kneebuckles two dozen silver buttons on a striped lutestring waistcoat and he carried a gun a present from an officer in his regiment  his dress on the fatal 28th of september was a blue surtout coat with a striped silk vest and teiken breeches and brown stockings  his hair of a dark mouse colour was worn in a silk ribbon his hat was silver laced and bore his initials cut in the felt  thus attired a pretty man sergeant davies said goodbye to his wife who never saw him again and left his lodgings at michael farquharsons early on 28th september  he took four men with him and went to meet the patrol from glenshee  on the way he met john growar in glenclunie who spoke with him about a tartan coat which the sergeant had observed him to drop and after strictly enjoining him not to use it again dismissed him instead of making him prisoner  this encounter was after davies left his men before meeting the patrol it being his intention to cross the hill and try for a shot at a stag  the sergeant never rejoined his men or met the patrol  he vanished as if the fairies had taken him  his captain searched the hill with a band of men four days after the disappearance but to no avail various rumours ran about the country among others a clatter that davies had been killed by duncan clerk and alexander bain macdonald but the body was undiscovered  in june one alexander macpherson came to donald farquharson son of the man with whom davies had been used to lodge  macpherson who was living in a sheiling or summer hut of shepherds on the hills said that he was greatly troubled by the ghost of sergeant davies who insisted that he should bury his bones and that he having declined to bury them the ghost insisted that he should apply to donald farquharson  farquharson could not believe this till macpherson invited him to come and see the bones  then farquharson went with the other as he thought it might possibly be true and if it was he did not know but the apparition might trouble himself  the bones were found in a peat moss about half a mile from the road taken by the patrols  there too lay the poor sergeants mouse coloured hair with rags of his blue cloth and his brogues without the silver buckles and there did farquharson and macpherson bury them all  alexander macpherson in his evidence at the trial declared that late in may 1750 when he was in bed a vision appeared to him as of a man clothed in blue who said i am sergeant davies  at first macpherson thought the figure was a real living man a brother of donald farquharsons  he therefore rose and followed his visitor to the door where the ghost indicated the position of his bones and said that donald farquharson would help to inter them  macpherson next day found the bones and spoke to growar the man of the tartan coat as growar admitted at the trial  growar said if macpherson did not hold his tongue he himself would inform shaw of daldownie macpherson therefore went straight to daldownie who advised him to bury the bones privily not to give the country a bad name for a rebel district  while macpherson was in doubt and had not yet spoken to farquharson the ghost revisited him at night and repeated his command  he also denounced his murderers clerk and macdonald which he had declined to do on his first appearance  he spoke in gaelic which it seems was a language not known by the sergeant  isobel machardie in whose service macpherson was deponed that one night in summer june 1750 while she lay at one end of the sheiling a hill hut for shepherds or neatherds and macpherson lay at the other she saw something naked come in at the door which frighted her so much that she drew the clothes over her head  that when it appeared it came in in a bowing posture and that next morning she asked macpherson what it was that had troubled them in the night before  to which he answered that she might be easy for it would not trouble them any more  all this was in 1750 but clerk and macdonald were not arrested till september 1753  they were then detained in the tolbooth of edinburgh on various charges as of wearing the kilt till june 1754 when they were tried grant of prestongrange prosecuting aided by haldane home and dundas while lockhart and mackintosh defended  it was proved that clerks wife wore daviess ring that clerk after the murder had suddenly become relatively rich and taken a farm and that the two men armed were on the hill near the scene of the murder on 28th september 1749  moreover angus cameron swore that he saw the murder committed  his account of his position was curious  he and another cameron since dead were skulking near sunset in a little hollow on the hill of galcharn  there he had skulked all day waiting for donald cameron who was afterwards hanged together with some of the said donalds companions from lochaber  no doubt they were all honest men who had been out and they may well have been on clunys business of conveying gold from the loch arkaig hoard to major kennedy for the prince  on seeing clerk and macdonald strike and shoot the man in the silver laced hat cameron and his companion ran away nor did cameron mention the matter till nine months later and then only to donald not he who was hanged  donald advised him to hold his tongue  this donald corroborated at the trial  the case against clerk and macdonald looked very black especially as some witnesses fled and declined to appear  scott who knew macintosh the counsel for the prisoners says that their advocates and agent were convinced of their guilt yet a jury of edinburgh tradesmen moved by macintoshs banter of the apparition acquitted the accused solely as scott believes because of the ghost and its newlylearned gaelic  it is indeed extraordinary that prestongrange the patron of david balfour allowed his witnesses to say what the ghost said which certainly is not evidence  sir walter supposes that macpherson and mrs machardie invented the apparition as an excuse for giving evidence  the ghosts commands according to highland belief were not to be disobeyed  macpherson must have known the facts by ordinary means  we have seen that clerk and macdonald were at once suspected there was a clatter against them  but angus cameron had not yet told his tale of what he saw  then who did tell  here comes in a curious piece of evidence of the year 1896  a friend writes 29th december 1896  dear lang  i enclose a tradition connected with the murder of sergeant davies which my brother picked up lately before he had read the story in your cock lane  he had heard of the event before both in athole and braemar and it was this that made him ask the old lady see next letter about it  he thinks that glenconie of your version p 256 must be glenclunie into which allt chriostaidh falls  he also suggests that the person who was chased by the murderers may have got up the ghost in order to shift the odium of talebearing to other shoulders  the fact of being mixed up in the affair lends some support to the story here related  here follows my friends brothers narrative the name of the witness being suppressed  concerning the murder of sergeant davies  there is at present living in the neighbourhood of  an old lady about seventy years of age  her maiden name is  140 and she is a native of braemar but left that district when about twenty years old and has never been back to it even for a visit  on being asked whether she had ever heard the story of sergeant davies she at first persisted in denying all knowledge of it  the ordinary version was then related to her and she listened quietly until it was finished when she broke out with  that isnt the way of it at all for the men were seen and it was a forbear of my own that saw them  he had gone out to try to get a stag and had his gun and a deerhound with him  he saw the men on the hill doing something and thinking they had got a deer he went towards them  when he got near them the hound began to run on in front of him and at that minute he saw what it was they had  he called to the dog and turned to run away but saw at once that he had made a mistake for he had called their attention to himself and a shot was fired after him which wounded the dog  he then ran home as fast as he could never looking behind him and did not know how far the men followed him  some time afterwards the dog came home and he went to see whether it was much hurt whereupon it flew at him and had to be killed  they thought that it was trying to revenge itself on him for having left it behind  at this point the old lady became conscious that she was telling the story and no more could be got out of her  the name of the lady who keeps a secret of 145 years standing is the name of a witness in the trial  the whole affair is thoroughly characteristic of the highlanders and of scottish jurisprudence after culloden while the verdict of not guilty when not proven would have been stretching a point is evidence to the commonsense of the eighteenth century 141  there are other cases in webster aubrey and glanvil of ghosts who tried more successfully to bring their murderers to justice  but the reports of the trials do not exist or cannot be found and webster lost a letter which he once possessed which would have been proof that ghostly evidence was given and was received at a trial in durham 1631 or 1632  reports of old men present were collected for glanvil but are entirely too vague  the case of fishers ghost which led to evidence being given as to a murder in new south wales cannot be wholly omitted  fisher was a convict settler a man of some wealth  he disappeared from his station and his manager also a convict declared that he had returned to england  later a man returning from market saw fisher sitting on a rail at his approach fisher vanished  black trackers were laid on found human blood on the rail and finally discovered fishers body  the manager was tried was condemned acknowledged his guilt and was hanged  the story is told in household words where sir frederick forbes is said to have acted as judge  no date is given  in botany bay 142 the legend is narrated by mr john lang who was in sydney in 1842 he gives no date of the occurrence and clearly embellishes the tale in 1835 however the story is told by mr montgomery martin in volume iv of his history of the british colonies  he gives the story as a proof of the acuteness of black trackers  beyond saying that he himself was in the colony when the events and the trial occurred he gives no date  i have conscientiously investigated the facts by aid of the sydney newspapers and the notes of the judge sir frederick forbes  fisher disappeared at the end of june 1826 from campbeltown  suspicion fell on his manager worral  a reward was offered late in september  late in october the constables attention was drawn to bloodstains on a rail  starting thence the black trackers found fishers body  worral was condemned and hanged after confession in february 1827  not a word is said about why the constable went to and examined the rail  but mr rusden author of a history of australia knew the medical attendant d farley who saw fishers ghost and pointed out the bloody rail and often discussed it with farley  mr souttar in a work on colonial traditions proves the point that farley told his ghost story before the body of fisher was found  but for fear of prejudicing the jury the ghost was kept out of the trial exactly as in the following case  the gardeners ghost  perhaps the latest ghost in a court of justice except in cases about the letting of haunted houses appeared at the aylesbury petty session on 22nd august 1829  on 25th october 1828 william edden a market gardener was found dead with his ribs broken in the road between aylesbury and thame  one sewell in august 1829 accused a man named tyler and both were examined at the aylesbury petty sessions  mrs edden gave evidence that she sent five or six times for tyler to come and see the corpse     i had some particular reasons for sending for him which i never did divulge     i will tell you my reasons gentlemen if you ask me in the face of tyler even if my life should be in danger for it  the reasons were that on the night of her husbands murder something rushed over me and i thought my husband came by me  i looked up and i thought i heard the voice of my husband come from near my mahogany table     i thought i saw my husbands apparition and the man that had done it and that man was tyler     i ran out and said o dear god my husband is murdered and his ribs are broken  lord nugentwhat made you think your husbands ribs were broken  he held up his hands like this and i saw a hammer or something like a hammer and it came into my mind that his ribs were broken  sewell stated that the murder was accomplished by means of a hammer  the prisoners were discharged on 13th september  on 5th march 1830 they were tried at the buckingham lent assizes were found guilty and were hanged protesting their innocence on 8th march 1830  in the report of mrs eddens evidence at the assizes no mention is made of the vision 144  here end our ghosts in courts of justice the following ghost gave evidence of a murder or rather confessed to one but was beyond the reach of human laws  this tale of 1730 is still current in highland tradition  it has however been improved and made infinitely more picturesque by several generations of narrators  as we try to be faithful to the best sources the contemporary manuscript version is here reprinted from the scottish standardbearer an organ of the scotch episcopalians october and november 1894  the dog o mause  account of an apparition that appeared to william soutar 145a in the mause 1730  this is a copy from that in the handwriting of bishop rattray preserved at craighall and which was found at meikleour a few years ago to the proprietor of which mr mercer it was probably sent by the bishopw w h 3rd august 1846  i have sent you an account of an apparition as remarkable perhaps as anything you ever heard of and which considered in all its circumstances leaves i think no ground of doubt to any man of commonsense  the person to whom it appeared is one william soutar a tenant of balgowans who lives in middle mause within about half a mile from this place on the other side of the river and in view from our windows of craighall house  he is about thirtyseven years of age as he says and has a wife and bairns  the following is an account from his own mouth and because there are some circumstances fit to be taken in as you go along i have given them with reference at the end 145b that i may not interrupt the sense of the account or add anything to it  therefore it begins  in the month of december in the year 1728 about skysetting i and my servant with several others living in the town farmsteading heard a scratching screeching crying and i followed the noise with my servant a little way from the town farmsteading throughout  we both thought we saw what had the appearance to be a fox and hounded the dogs at it but they would not pursue it 146a  about a month after as i was coming from blair 146b alone about the same time of the night a big dog appeared to me of a dark greyish colour between the hilltown and knockhead 146c of mause on a lea rig a little below the road and in passing by it touched me sonsily firmly on the thigh at my haunchbane hipbone upon which i pulled my staff from under my arm and let a stroke at it and i had a notion at the time that i hit it and my haunch was painful all that night  however i had no great thought of its being anything particular or extraordinary but that it might be a mad dog wandering about a year after that to the best of my memory in december month about the same time of the night and in the same place when i was alone it appeared to me again as before and passed by me at some distance and then i began to think it might be something more than ordinary  in the month of december 1730 as i was coming from perth from the claith cloth market a little before skysetting it appeared to me again being alone at the same place and passed by me just as before  i had some suspicion of it then likewise but i began to think that a neighbour of mine in the hilltown having an ox lately dead it might be a dog that had been at the carrion by which i endeavoured to put the suspicion out of my head  on the second monday of december 1730 as i was coming from woodhead a town farm in the ground of drumlochy it appeared to me again in the same place just about skysetting and after it had passed me as it was going out of my sight it spoke with a low voice so that i distinctly heard it these words within eight or ten days do or die and it thereupon disappeared  no more passed at that time  on the morrow i went to my brother who dwells in the nether aird of drumlochy and told him of the last and of all the former appearances which was the first time i ever spoke of it to anybody he and i went to see a sister of ours at glenballow who was dying but she was dead before we came  as we were returning home i desired my brother whose name is james soutar to go forward with me till we should be passed the place where it used to appear to me and just as we had come to it about ten oclock at night it appeared to me again just as formerly and as it was passing over some ice i pointed to it with my finger and asked my brother if he saw it but he said he did not nor did his servant who was with us  it spoke nothing at that time but just disappeared as it passed the ice  on the saturday after as i was at my own sheepcots putting in my sheep it appeared to me again just after daylight betwixt day and skylight and upon saying these words come to the spot of ground within half an hour it just disappeared whereupon i came home to my own house and took up a staff and also a sword off the head of the bed and went straight to the place where it used formerly to appear to me and after i had been there some minutes and had drawn a circle about me with my staff it appeared to me  and i spoke to it saying in the name of god and jesus christ what are you that troubles me and it answered me i am david soutar george soutars brother 148a  i killed a man more than fiveandthirty years ago when you was new born at a bush beeast the road as you go into the isle 148b  and as i was going away i stood again and said david soutar was a man and you appear like a dog whereupon it spoke to me again saying i killed him with a dog and therefore i am made to speak out of the mouth of a dog and tell you you must go and bury these bones upon this i went straight to my brother to his house and told him what had happened to me  my brother having told the minister of blair he and i came to the minister on monday thereafter as he was examining in a neighbours house in the same town where i live  and the minister with my brother and me and two or three more went to the place where the apparition said the bones were buried when rychalzie met us accidentally and the minister told rychalzie the story in the presence of all that were there assembled and desired the liberty from him to break up the ground to search for the bones rychalzie made some scruples to allow us to break up the ground but said he would go along with us to glasclune 149a and if he advised he would allow search to be made  accordingly he went straight along with my brother and me and james chalmers a neighbour who lives in the hilltown of mause to glasclune and told glasclune the story as above narrated and he advised rychalzie to allow the search to be made whereupon he gave his consent to it  the day after being friday we convened about thirty or forty men and went to the isle and broke up the ground in many places searching for the bones but we found nothing  on wednesday the 23rd december about twelve oclock when i was in my bed i heard a voice but saw nothing the voice said come away 149b upon this i rose out of my bed cast on my coat and went to the door but did not see it  and i said in the name of god what do you demand of me now  it answered go take up these bones  i said how shall i get these bones  it answered again at the side of a withered bush 150 and there are but seven or eight of them remaining  i asked was there any more guilty of that action but you  it answered no  i asked again what is the reason you trouble me  it answered because you are the youngest  then said i to it depart from me and give me a sign that i may know the particular spot and give me time  here there is written on the margin in a different hand you will find the bones at the side of a withered bush  there are but eight of them and for a sign you will find the print of a cross impressed on the ground  on the morrow being thursday i went alone to the isle to see if i could find any sign and immediately i saw both the bush which was a small bush the greatest stick in it being about the thickness of a staff and it was withered about halfway down and also the sign which was about a foot from the bush  the sign was an exact cross thus x each of the two lines was about a foot and a half in length and near three inches broad and more than an inch deeper than the rest of the ground as if it had been pressed down for the ground was not cut  on the morrow being friday i went and told my brother of the voice that had spoken to me and that i had gone and seen the bush which it directed me to and the abovementioned sign at it  the next day being saturday my brother and i went together with seven or eight men with us to the isle  about sunrising we all saw the bush and the sign at it and upon breaking up the ground just at the bush we found the bones viz the chaftteeth jawteethmolars in it one of the thigh bones one of the shoulder blades and a small bone which we supposed to be a collar bone which was more consumed than any of the rest and two other small bones which we thought to be bones of the swordarm by the time we had digged up those bones there convened about forty men who also saw them  the minister and rychalzie came to the place and saw them  we immediately sent to the other side of the water to claywhat 151 to a wright that was cutting timber there whom claywhat brought over with him who immediately made a coffin for the bones and my wife brought linen to wrap them in and i wrapped the bones in the linen myself and put them in the coffin before all these people and sent for the mortcloth and buried them in the churchyard of blair that evening  there were near an hundred persons at the burial and it was a little after sunset when they were buried  this above account i have written down as dictated to me by william soutar in the presence of robert graham brother to the laird of balgowan and of my two sons james and john rattray at craighall 30th december 1730  we at craighall heard nothing of this history till after the search was over but it was told us on the morrow by some of the servants who had been with the rest at the search and on saturday glasclunes son came over to craighall and told us that william soutar had given a very distinct account of it to his father  on st andrews day the 1st of december this david soutar the ghost listed himself a soldier being very soon after the time the apparition said the murder was committed and william soutar declares he had no remembrance of him till that apparition named him as brother to george soutar then he said he began to recollect that when he was about ten years of age he had seen him once at his fathers in a soldiers habit after which he went abroad and was never more heard of neither did william ever before hear of his having listed as a soldier neither did william ever before hear of his having killed a man nor indeed was there ever anything heard of it in the country and it is not yet known who the person was that was killed and whose bones are now found  my son john and i went within a few days after to visit glasclune and had the account from him as william had told him over  from thence we went to middle mause to hear it from himself but he being from home his father who also lives in that town gave us the same account of it which glasclune had done and the poor man could not refrain from shedding tears as he told it as glasclune told us his son was under very great concern when he spoke of it to him  we all thought this a very odd story and were under suspense about it because the bones had not been found upon the search  another account that also seems to have been written by the bishop mentions that the murderer on committing the deed went home and on looking in at the window he saw william soutar lying in a cradle hence it was the ghaist always came to him and not to any of the other relations  mr hay newton of newton hall a man of great antiquarian tastes in the last generation wrote the following notes on the matter  widow mlaren aged seventynine a native of braemar but who has resided on the craighall estate for sixty years says that the tradition is that the man was murdered for his money that he was a highland drover on his return journey from the south that he arrived late at night at the mains of mause and wished to get to rychalzie that he stayed at the mains of mause all night but left it early next morning when david soutar with his dog accompanied him to show him the road but that with the assistance of the dog he murdered the drover and took his money at the place mentioned that there was a tailor at work in his fathers house that morning when he returned after committing the murder according to the custom at that date by which tailors went out to make up customers own cloth at their own houses and that his mother being surprised at his strange appearance asked him what he had been about to which inquiry he made no reply that he did not remain long in the country afterwards but went to england and never returned  the last time he was seen he went down by the brae of cockridge  a man of the name of irons a fisherman in blairgowrie says that his father who died a very old man some years ago was present at the getting of the bones  mr small finzyhan when bringing his daughter home from school in edinburgh saw a coffin at the door of a public house near rychalzie where he generally stopped but he did not go in as usual thinking that there was a death in the family  the innkeeper came out and asked him why he was passing the door and told him the coffin contained the bones of the murdered man which had been collected upon which he went into the house  the soutars disliked much to be questioned on the subject of the dog of mause  thomas soutar who was tenant in easter mause formerly named knowhead of mause and died last year upwards of eighty years of age said that the soutars came originally from annandale and that their name was johnston that there were three brothers who fled from that part of the country on account of their having killed a man that they came by soutars hill and having asked the name of the hill were told soutar upon which they said soutar be it then and took that name  one of the brothers went south and the others came north 155a  the appearance of human ghosts in the form of beasts is common enough in shropshire they usually come as bulls  see miss burnes shropshire folklore  they do not usually speak like the dog o mause  m dassier a french darwinian explains that ghosts revert atavistically to lower forms of animal life 155b  we now in accordance with a promise already made give an example of the ghosts of beasts  here an explanation by the theory that the consciousness of the beast survives death and affects with a hallucination the minds of living men and animals will hardly pass current  but if such cases were as common and told on evidence as respectable as that which vouches for appearances of the dead believers in these would either have to shift their ground or to grant that  admitted to that equal sky our faithful dog may bear us company  we omit such things as the dripping death wraith of a drowned cat who appeared to a lady or the illused monkey who died in a chinese house after which he haunted it by rapping secreting objects and in short in the usual way 155c  we adduce  peters ghost  a naval officer visited a friend in the country  several men were sitting round the smokingroom fire when he arrived and a foxterrier was with them  presently the heavy shambling footsteps of an old dog and the metallic shaking sound of his collar were heard coming up stairs  heres old peter said his visitor  peters dead whispered his owner  the sounds passed through the closed door heard by all they pattered into the room the foxterrier bristled up growled and pursued a viewless object across the carpet from the hearthrug sounded a shake a jingle of a collar and the settling weight of a body collapsing into repose 156  this pleasing anecdote rests on what is called nautical evidence which for reasons inexplicable to me was in these matters distrusted by sir walter scott     chapter viii   more ghosts with a purpose  ticonderoga  the beresford ghost sources of evidence  the family version  a new oldfashioned ghost halfpast one oclock  put out the light  the ghost in the following famous tale had a purpose  he was a highland ghost a campbell and desired vengeance on a macniven who murdered him  the ghost practically cried cruachan and tried to rouse the clan  failing in this owing to inverawes loyalty to his oath the ghost uttered a prophecy  the tale is given in the words of miss elspeth campbell who collected it at inverawe from a highland narrator  she adds a curious supplementary tradition in the argyle family  ticonderoga  it was one evening in the summer of the year 1755 that campbell of inverawe 157 was on cruachan hill side  he was startled by seeing a man coming towards him at full speed a man ragged bleeding and evidently suffering agonies of terror  the avengers of blood are on my track oh save me the poor wretch managed to gasp out inverawe filled with pity for the miserable man swore by the word of an inverawe which never failed friend or foe yet to save him  inverawe then led the stranger to the secret cave on cruachan hill side  none knew of this cave but the laird of inverawe himself as the secret was most carefully kept and had been handed down from father to son for many generations  the entrance was small and no one passing would for an instant suspect it to be other than a tods hole 158a but within were fairsized rooms one containing a well of the purest spring water  it is said that wallace and bruce had made use of this cave in earlier days  here inverawe left his guest  the man was so overcome by terror that he clung on to inverawes plaid 158b imploring him not to leave him alone  inverawe was filled with disgust at this cowardly conduct and already almost repented having plighted his word to save such a worthless creature  on inverawes return home he found a man in a state of great excitement waiting to see him  this man informed him of the murder of his inverawes fosterbrother by one macniven  we have said he tracked the murderer to within a short distance of this place and i am here to warn you in case he should seek your protection  inverawe turned pale and remained silent not knowing what answer to give  the man knowing the love that subsisted between the fosterbrothers thought this silence arose from grief alone and left the house to pursue the search for macniven further  the compassion inverawe felt for the trembling man he had left in the cave turned to hate when he thought of his beloved fosterbrother murdered but as he had plighted his word to save him save him he must and would  as soon therefore as night fell he went to the cave with food and promised to return with more the next day  thoroughly worn out as soon as he reached home he retired to rest but sleep he could not  so taking up a book he began to read  a shadow fell across the page  he looked up and saw his fosterbrother standing by the bedside  but oh how changed  his fair hair clotted with blood his face pale and drawn and his garments all gory  he uttered the following words  inverawe shield not the murderer blood must flow for blood and then faded away out of sight  in spite of the spirits commands inverawe remained true to his promise and returned next day to macniven with fresh provisions that night his fosterbrother again appeared to him uttering the same warning  inverawe inverawe shield not the murderer blood must flow for blood  at daybreak inverawe hurried off to the cave and said to macniven  i can shield you no longer you must escape as best you can  inverawe now hoped to receive no further visit from the vengeful spirit  in this he was disappointed for at the usual hour the ghost appeared and in anger said i have warned you once i have warned you twice it is too late now  we shall meet again at ticonderoga  inverawe rose before dawn and went straight to the cave  macniven was gone  inverawe saw no more of the ghost but the adventure left him a gloomy melancholy man  many a time he would wander on cruachan hill side brooding over his vision and people passing him would see the faraway look in his eyes and would say one to the other  the puir laird he is aye thinking on him that is gone  only his dearest friends knew the cause of his melancholy  in 1756 the war between the english and french in america broke out the 42nd regiment embarked and landed at new york in june of that year  campbell of inverawe was a major in the regiment  the lieut colonel was francis grant  from new york the 42nd proceeded to albany where the regiment remained inactive till the spring of 1757 one evening when the 42nd were still quartered at this place inverawe asked the colonel if he had ever heard of a place called ticonderoga 160  colonel grant replied he had never heard the name before  inverawe then told his story  most of the officers were present at the time some were impressed others were inclined to look upon the whole thing as a joke but seeing how very much disturbed inverawe was about it all even the most unbelieving refrained from bantering him  in 1758 an expedition was to be directed against ticonderoga on lake george a fort erected by the french  the highlanders were to form part of this expedition  the force was under majorgeneral abercromby  ticonderoga was called by the french st louis really fort carillon and inverawe knew it by no other name  one of the officers told colonel grant that the indian name of the place was ticonderoga  grant remembering campbells story said  for gods sake dont let campbell know this or harm will come of it  the troops embarked on lake george and landed without opposition near the extremity of the lake early in july  they marched from there through woods upon ticonderoga having had one successful skirmish with the enemy driving them back with considerable loss  lord howe was killed in this engagement  on the 10th of july the assault was directed to be commenced by the picquets 162  the grenadiers were to follow supported by the battalions and reserves  the highlanders and 55th regiment formed the reserve  in vain the troops attempted to force their way through the abbatis they themselves being exposed to a heavy artillery and musket fire from an enemy well under cover  the highlanders could no longer be restrained and rushed forward from the reserve cutting and carving their way through trees and other obstacles with their claymores  the deadly fire still continued from the fort  as no ladders had been provided for scaling the breastwork the soldiers climbed on to one anothers shoulders and made holes for their feet in the face of the work with their swords and bayonets but as soon as a man reached the top he was thrown down  captain john campbell and a few men succeeded at last in forcing their way over the breastworks but were immediately cut down  after a long and desperate struggle lasting in fact nearly four hours general abercromby gave orders for a retreat  the troops could hardly be prevailed upon to retire and it was not till the order had been given for the third time that the highlanders withdrew from the hopeless encounter  the loss sustained by the regiment was as follows  eight officers nine sergeants and 297 men killed seventeen officers ten sergeants and 306 men wounded  inverawe after having fought with the greatest courage received at length his death wound  colonel grant hastened to the dying mans side who looked reproachfully at him and said  you deceived me this is ticonderoga for i have seen him  inverawe never spoke again  inverawes son an officer in the same regiment also lost his life at ticonderoga  on the very day that these events were happening in faraway america two ladies miss campbell of ederein and her sister were walking from kilmalieu to inveraray and had reached the then new bridge over the aray  one of them happened to look up at the sky  she gave a call to her sister to look also  they both of them saw in the sky what looked like a siege going on  they saw the different regiments with their colours and recognised many of their friends among the highlanders they saw inverawe and his son fall and other men whom they knew when they reached inveraray they told all their friends of the vision they had just seen  they also took down the names of those they had seen fall and the time and date of the occurrence  the wellknown danish physician sir william hart was together with an englishman and a servant walking round the castle of inveraray  these men saw the same phenomena and confirmed the statements made by the two ladies  weeks after the gazette corroborated their statements in its account of the attempt made on ticonderoga  every detail was correct in the vision down to the actual number of the killed and wounded  but there was sorrow throughout argyll long before the gazette appeared        we now give the best attainable version of a yet more famous legend the tyrone ghost  the literary history of the tyrone ghost is curious  in 1802 scott used the tale as the foundation of his ballad the eve of st john and referred to the tradition of a noble irish family in a note  in 1858 the subject was discussed in notes and queries  a reference was given to lyons privately printed grand juries of westmeath from 1751 the version from that rare work a version dated dublin august 1802 was published in notes and queries of 24th july 1858  in december 1896 a member of the beresford family published in the nines a journal of the wiltshire regiment the account which follows derived from a ms at curraghmore written by lady betty cobbe granddaughter of the ghostseer lady beresford  the writer in the nines remembers lady betty  the account of 1802 is clearly derived from the curraghmore ms but omits dates calls sir tristram beresford sir marcus  leaves out the visit to gill hall where the ghost appeared and substitutes blanks for the names of persons concerned  otherwise the differences in the two versions are mainly verbal  the beresford ghost  there is at curraghmore the seat of lord waterford in ireland a manuscript account of the tale such as it was originally received and implicitly believed in by the children and grandchildren of the lady to whom lord tyrone is supposed to have made the supernatural appearance after death  the account was written by lady betty cobbe the youngest daughter of marcus earl of tyrone and granddaughter of nicola s lady beresford  she lived to a good old age in full use of all her faculties both of body and mind  i can myself remember her for when a boy i passed through bath on a journey with my mother and we went to her house there and had luncheon  she appeared to my juvenile imagination a very appropriate person to revise and transmit such a tale and fully adapted to do ample justice to her subject matter  it never has been doubted in the family that she received the full particulars in early life and that she heard the circumstances such as they were believed to have occurred from the nearest relatives of the two persons the supposed actors in this mysterious interview viz from her own father lord tyrone who died in 1763 and from her aunt lady riverston who died in 1763 also  these two were both with their mother lady beresford on the day of her decease and they without assistance or witness took off from their parents wrist the black bandage which she had always worn on all occasions and times even at court as some very old persons who lived well into the eighteenth century testified having received their information from eyewitnesses of the fact  there was an oil painting of this lady in tyrone house dublin representing her with a black ribbon bound round her wrist  this portrait disappeared in an unaccountable manner  it used to hang in one of the drawingrooms in that mansion with other family pictures  when henry marquis of waterford sold the old town residence of the family and its grounds to the government as the site of the education board he directed mr watkins a dealer in pictures and a man of considerable knowledge in works of art and vertu to collect the pictures etc etc which were best adapted for removal to curraghmore  mr watkins especially picked out this portrait not only as a good work of art but as one which from its associations deserved particular care and notice when however the lot arrived at curraghmore and was unpacked no such picture was found and though mr watkins took great pains and exerted himself to the utmost to trace what had become of it to this day nearly forty years not a hint of its existence has been received or heard of  john le poer lord decies was the eldest son of richard earl of tyrone and of lady dorothy annesley daughter of arthur earl of anglesey  he was born 1665 succeeded his father 1690 and died 14th october 1693  he became lord tyrone at his fathers death and is the ghost of the story  nicola sophie hamilton was the second and youngest daughter and co heiress of hugh lord glenawley who was also baron lunge in sweden being a zealous royalist he had together with his father migrated to that country in 1643 and returned from it at the restoration  he was of a good old family and held considerable landed property in the county tyrone near ballygawley  he died there in 1679  his eldest daughter and coheiress arabella susanna married in 1683 sir john macgill of gill hall in the county down  nicola s the second daughter was born in 1666 and married sir tristram beresford in 1687  between that and 1693 two daughters were born but no son to inherit the ample landed estates of his father who most anxiously wished and hoped for an heir  it was under these circumstances and at this period that the manuscripts state that lord tyrone made his appearance after death and all the versions of the story without variation attribute the same cause and reason viz a solemn promise mutually interchanged in early life between john le poer then lord decies afterwards lord tyrone and nicola s hamilton that whichever of the two died the first should if permitted appear to the survivor for the object of declaring the approval or rejection by the deity of the revealed religion as generally acknowledged  of which the departed one must be fully cognisant but of which they both had in their youth entertained unfortunate doubts  in the month of october 1693 sir tristram and lady beresford went on a visit to her sister lady macgill at gill hall now the seat of lord clanwilliam whose grandmother was eventually the heiress of sir j macgills property  one morning sir tristram rose early leaving lady beresford asleep and went out for a walk before breakfast  when his wife joined the table very late her appearance and the embarrassment of her manner attracted general attention especially that of her husband  he made anxious inquiries as to her health and asked her apart what had occurred to her wrist which was tied up with black ribbon tightly bound round it  she earnestly entreated him not to inquire more then or thereafter as to the cause of her wearing or continuing afterwards to wear that ribbon for she added you will never see me without it  he replied since you urge it so vehemently i promise you not to inquire more about it  after completing her hurried breakfast she made anxious inquiries as to whether the post had yet arrived  it had not yet come in and sir tristram asked  why are you so particularly eager about letters to day  because i expect to hear of lord tyrones death which took place on tuesday  well remarked sir tristram i never should have put you down for a superstitious person but i suppose that some idle dream has disturbed you  shortly after the servant brought in the letters one was sealed with black wax  it is as i expected she cries he is dead  the letter was from lord tyrones steward to inform them that his master had died in dublin on tuesday 14th october at 4 pm  sir tristram endeavoured to console her and begged her to restrain her grief when she assured him that she felt relieved and easier now that she knew the actual fact  she added i can now give you a most satisfactory piece of intelligence viz that i am with child and that it will be a boy  a son was born in the following july  sir tristram survived its birth little more than six years  after his death lady beresford continued to reside with her young family at his place in the county of derry and seldom went from home  she hardly mingled with any neighbours or friends excepting with mr and mrs jackson of coleraine  he was the principal personage in that town and was by his mother a near relative of sir tristram  his wife was the daughter of robert gorges lld a gentleman of good old english family and possessed of a considerable estate in the county meath by jane loftus daughter of sir adam loftus of rathfarnham and sister of lord lisburn  they had an only son richard gorges who was in the army and became a general officer very early in life  with the jacksons lady beresford maintained a constant communication and lived on the most intimate terms while she seemed determined to eschew all other society and to remain in her chosen retirement  at the conclusion of three years thus passed one luckless day young gorges most vehemently professed his passion for her and solicited her hand urging his suit in a most passionate appeal which was evidently not displeasing to the fair widow and which unfortunately for her was successful  they were married in 1704  one son and two daughters were born to them when his abandoned and dissolute conduct forced her to seek and to obtain a separation  after this had continued for four years general gorges pretended extreme penitence for his past misdeeds and with the most solemn promises of amendment induced his wife to live with him again and she became the mother of a second son  the day month after her confinement happened to be her birthday and having recovered and feeling herself equal to some exertion she sent for her son sir marcus beresford then twenty years old and her married daughter lady riverston  she also invited dr king the archbishop of dublin who was an intimate friend and an old clergyman who had christened her and who had always kept up a most kindly intercourse with her during her whole life to make up a small party to celebrate the day  in the early part of it lady beresford was engaged in a kindly conversation with her old friend the clergyman and in the course of it said  you know that i am fortyeight this day  no indeed he replied you are only fortyseven for your mother had a dispute with me once on the very subject of your age and i in consequence sent and consulted the registry and can most confidently assert that you are only fortyseven this day  you have signed my deathwarrant then she cried leave me i pray for i have not much longer to live but have many things of grave importance to settle before i die  send my son and my daughter to me immediately  the clergyman did as he was bidden  he directed sir marcus and his sister to go instantly to their mother and he sent to the archbishop and a few other friends to put them off from joining the birthday party  when her two children repaired to lady beresford she thus addressed them  i have something of deep importance to communicate to you my dear children before i die  you are no strangers to the intimacy and the affection which subsisted in early life between lord tyrone and myself  we were educated together when young under the same roof in the pernicious principles of deism  our real friends afterwards took every opportunity to convince us of our error but their arguments were insufficient to overpower and uproot our infidelity though they had the effect of shaking our confidence in it and thus leaving us wavering between the two opinions  in this perplexing state of doubt we made a solemn promise one to the other that whichever died first should if permitted appear to the other for the purpose of declaring what religion was the one acceptable to the almighty  one night years after this interchange of promises i was sleeping with your father at gill hall when i suddenly awoke and discovered lord tyrone sitting visibly by the side of the bed  i screamed out and vainly endeavoured to rouse sir tristram  tell me i said lord tyrone why and wherefore are you here at this time of the night  have you then forgotten our promise to each other pledged in early life  i died on tuesday at four oclock  i have been permitted thus to appear in order to assure you that the revealed religion is the true and only one by which we can be saved  i am also suffered to inform you that you are with child and will produce a son who will marry my heiress that sir tristram will not live long when you will marry again and you will die from the effects of childbirth in your forty seventh year  i begged from him some convincing sign or proof so that when the morning came i might rely upon it and feel satisfied that his appearance had been real and that it was not the phantom of my imagination  he caused the hangings of the bed to be drawn in an unusual way and impossible manner through an iron hook  i still was not satisfied when he wrote his signature in my pocketbook  i wanted however more substantial proof of his visit when he laid his hand which was cold as marble on my wrist the sinews shrunk up the nerves withered at the touch  now he said let no mortal eye while you live ever see that wrist and vanished  while i was conversing with him my thoughts were calm but as soon as he disappeared i felt chilled with horror and dismay a cold sweat came over me and i again endeavoured but vainly to awaken sir tristram a flood of tears came to my relief and i fell asleep  in the morning your father got up without disturbing me he had not noticed anything extraordinary about me or the bedhangings  when i did arise i found a long broom in the gallery outside the bedroom door and with great difficulty i unhooded the curtain fearing that the position of it might excite surprise and cause inquiry  i bound up my wrist with black ribbon before i went down to breakfast where the agitation of my mind was too visible not to attract attention sir tristram made many anxious inquiries as to my health especially as to my sprained wrist as he conceived mine to be  i begged him to drop all questions as to the bandage even if i continued to adopt it for any length of time  he kindly promised me not to speak of it any more and he kept his promise faithfully  you my son came into the world as predicted and your father died six years after  i then determined to abandon society and its pleasures and not mingle again with the world hoping to avoid the dreadful predictions as to my second marriage but alas in the one family with which i held constant and friendly intercourse i met the man whom i did not regard with perfect indifference  though i struggled to conquer by every means the passion i at length yielded to his solicitations and in a fatal moment for my own peace i became his wife  in a few years his conduct fully justified my demand for a separation and i fondly hoped to escape the fatal prophecy  under the delusion that i had passed my fortyseventh birthday i was prevailed upon to believe in his amendment and to pardon him  i have however heard from undoubted authority that i am only fortyseven this day and i know that i am about to die  i die however without the dread of death fortified as i am by the sacred precepts of christianity and upheld by its promises  when i am gone i wish that you my children should unbind this black ribbon and alone behold my wrist before i am consigned to the grave  she then requested to be left that she might lie down and compose herself and her children quitted the apartment having desired her attendant to watch her and if any change came on to summon them to her bedside  in an hour the bell rang and they hastened to the call but all was over  the two children having ordered every one to retire knelt down by the side of the bed when lady riverston unbound the black ribbon and found the wrist exactly as lady beresford had described itevery nerve withered every sinew shrunk  her friend the archbishop had had her buried in the cathedral of st patrick in dublin in the earl of corks tomb where she now lies        the writer now professes his disbelief in any spiritual presence and explains his theory that lady beresfords anxiety about lord tyrone deluded her by a vivid dream during which she hurt her wrist  of all ghost stories the tyrone or beresford ghost has most variants  following monsieur haureau in the journal des savants i have tracked the tale the death compact and the wound inflicted by the ghost on the hand or wrist or brow of the seer through henry more and melanchthon and a mediaeval sermon by eudes de shirton to william of malmesbury a range of 700 years  mrs grant of laggan has a rather recent case and i have heard of another in the last ten years  calmet has a case in 1625 the spectre leaves  the sable score of fingers four  on a board of wood  now for a modern instance of a gang of ghosts with a purpose  when i narrated the story which follows to an eminent moral philosopher he remarked at a given point oh the ghost spoke did she and displayed scepticism  the evidence however left him as it leaves me at a standstill not convinced but agreeably perplexed  the ghosts here are truly oldfashioned  my story is and must probably remain entirely devoid of proof as far as any kind of ghostly influence is concerned  we find ghosts appearing and imposing a certain course of action on a living witness for definite purposes of their own  the course of action prescribed was undeniably pursued and apparently the purpose of the ghosts was fulfilled but what that purpose was their agent declines to state and conjecture is hopelessly baffled  the documents in the affair have been published by the society for psychical research proceedings vol xi p 547 and are here used for reference  but i think the matter will be more intelligible if i narrate it exactly as it came under my own observation  the names of persons and places are all fictitious and are the same as those used in the documents published by the spr  halfpast one oclock  in october 1893 i was staying at a town which we shall call rapingham  one night i and some kinsfolk dined with another old friend of all of us a dr ferrier  in the course of dinner he asked a propos de bottes  have you heard of the ghost in blake street a sunny pleasant street of respectable but uninteresting antiquity in rapingham  we had none of us heard of the ghost and begged the doctor to enlighten our ignorance  his story ran thusi have it in his own writing as far as its essence goes  the house he said belongs to my friends the applebys who let it as they live elsewhere  a quiet couple took it and lived in it for five years when the husband died and the widow went away  they made no complaint while tenants  the house stood empty for some time and all i know personally about the matter is that i my wife and the children were in the diningroom one sunday when we heard unusual noises in the drawingroom overhead  we went through the rooms but could find no cause or explanation of the disturbance and thought no more about it  about six or seven years ago i let the house to a mr buckley who is still the tenant  he was unmarried and his family consisted of his mother and sisters  they preceded him to put the place in order and before his arrival came to me in some irritation complaining that i had let them a haunted house  they insisted that there were strange noises as if heavy weights were being dragged about or heavy footsteps pacing in the rooms and on the stairs  i said that i knew nothing about the matter  the stairs are of stone water is only carried up to the first floor there is an unused system of hot air pipes 177a  something went wrong with the watermain in the area once but the noises lasted after it was mended  i think mr buckley when he arrived never heard anything unusual but one evening as he walked upstairs carrying an inkbottle he found his hand full of some liquid  thinking that he had spilt the ink he went to a window where he found his hand full of water to account for which there was no stain on the ceiling or anything else that he could discover  on another occasion one of the young ladies was kneeling by a trunk in an attic alone when water was switched over her face as if from a wet brush 177b  there was a small pool of water on the floor and the wall beyond her was sprinkled  time went on and the disturbances were very rare  in fact ceased for two years till the present week when mrs claughton a widow accompanied by two of her children came to stay with the buckleys 177c  she had heard of the disturbances and the theory of hauntings i dont know if these things interested her or not  early on monday 9th october mrs claughton came to consult me  her story was this  about a quarter past one on sunday night or monday morning she was in bed with one of her children the other sleeping in the room  she was awakened by footsteps on the stair and supposed that a servant was coming to call her to miss buckley who was ill the steps stopped at the door then the noise was repeated  mrs claughton lit her bedroom candle opened the door and listened  there was no one there  the clock on the landing pointed to twenty minutes past one  mrs claughton went back to bed read a book fell asleep and woke to find the candle still lit but low in the socket  she heard a sigh and saw a lady unknown to her her head swathed in a soft white shawl her expression gentle and refined her features much emaciated  the appearance said follow me and mrs claughton taking the bedroom candle rose and followed out on to the landing and so into the adjacent drawingroom  she cannot remember opening the door which the housemaid had locked outside and she owns that this passage is dreamlike in her memory  seeing that her candle was flickering out she substituted for it a pink one taken from a chiffonier  the figure walked nearly to the window turned threequarters round said tomorrow and was no more seen  mrs claughton went back to her room where her eldest child asked  who is the lady in white  only me mother go to sleep she thinks she answered  after lying awake for two hours with gas burning she fell asleep  the pink candle from the drawingroom chiffonier was in her candlestick in the morning  after hearing the ladys narrative i told her to try change of air which she declined as cowardly  so as she would stay on at mr buckleys i suggested that an electric alarm communicating with miss buckleys room should be rigged up and this was done  here the doctor paused and as the events had happened within the week we felt that we were at last on the track of a recent ghost  next morning about one the buckleys were aroused by a tremendous peal of the alarm mrs claughton they found in a faint  next morning 179 she consulted me as to the whereabouts of a certain place let me call it meresby  i suggested the use of a postal directory we found meresby a place extremely unknown to fame in an agricultural district about five hours from london in the opposite direction from rapingham  to this place mrs claughton said she must go in the interest and by the order of certain ghosts whom she saw on monday night and whose injunctions she had taken down in a notebook  she has left rapingham for london and there said the doctor my story ends for the present  we expected it to end for good and all but in the course of the week came a communication to the doctor in writing from mrs claughtons governess  this lady on mrs claughtons arrival at her london house friday 13th october passed a night perturbed by sounds of weeping loud moans and a very odd noise overhead like some electric battery gone wrong in fact much like the warning of a jack running down which old jeffrey used to give at the wesleys house in epworth  there were also heavy footsteps and thuds as of moving weighty bodies  so far the governess  this curious communication i read at rapingham on saturday 14th october or sunday 15th october  on monday i went to town  in the course of the week i received a letter from my kinsman in rapingham saying that mrs claughton had written to dr ferrier telling him that she had gone to meresby on saturday had accomplished the bidding of the ghosts and had lodged with one joseph wright the parish clerk  her duty had been to examine the meresby parish registers and to compare certain entries with information given by the ghosts and written by her in her notebook  if the entries in the parish register tallied with her notes she was to pass the time between one oclock and halfpast one alone in meresby church and receive a communication from the spectres  all this she said that she had done and in evidence of her journey enclosed her half ticket to meresby which a dream had warned her would not be taken on her arrival  she also sent a white rose from a grave to dr ferrier a gentleman in no sympathy with the jacobite cause which indeed has no connection whatever with the matter in hand  on hearing of this letter from mrs claughton i confess that not knowing the lady i remained purely sceptical  the railway company however vouched for the ticket  the rector of meresby being appealed to knew nothing of the matter  he therefore sent for his curate and parish clerk  did a lady pass part of sunday night in the church  the clerk and the curate admitted that this unusual event had occurred  a lady had arrived from london on saturday evening had lodged with wright the parish clerk had asked for the parish registers had compared them with her notebook after morning service on sunday and had begged leave to pass part of the night in the church  the curate in vain tried to dissuade her and finally washing his hands of it had left her to wright the clerk  to him she described a mr george howard deceased one of the ghosts  he recognised the description and he accompanied her to the church on a dark night starting at one oclock  she stayed alone without a light in the lockedup church from 120 to 145 when he let her out  there now remained no doubt that mrs claughton had really gone to meresby a long and disagreeable journey and had been locked up in the church alone at a witching hour  beyond this point we have only the statements of mrs claughton made to lord bute mr myers and others and published by the society for psychical research  she says that after arranging the alarm bell on monday night october 910 she fell asleep reading in her dressing gown lying outside her bed  she wakened and found the lady of the white shawl bending over her  mrs claughton said  am i dreaming or is it true  the figure gave as testimony to character a piece of information  next mrs claughton saw a male ghost tall dark healthy sixty years old who named himself as george howard buried in meresby churchyard meresby being a place of which mrs claughton like most people now heard for the first time  he gave the dates of his marriage and death which are correct and have been seen by mr myers in mrs claughtons notebook  he bade her verify these dates at meresby and wait at 115 in the morning at the grave of richard harte a person like all of them unknown to mrs claughton at the southwest corner of the south aisle in meresby church  this mr harte died on 15th may 1745 and missed many events of interest by doing so  mr howard also named and described joseph wright of meresby as a man who would help her and he gave minute local information  next came a phantom of a man whose name mrs claughton is not free to give 182 he seemed to be in great trouble at first covering his face with his hands but later removing them  these three spectres were to meet mrs claughton in meresby church and give her information of importance on a matter concerning apparently the third and only unhappy appearance  after these promises and injunctions the phantoms left and mrs claughton went to the door to look at the clock  feeling faint she rang the alarum when her friends came and found her in a swoon on the floor  the hour was 120  what mrs claughtons children were doing all this time and whether they were in the room or not does not appear  on thursday mrs claughton went to town and her governess was perturbed as we have seen  on friday night mrs claughton dreamed a number of things connected with her journey a page of the notes made from this dream was shown to mr myers  thus her half ticket was not to be taken she was to find a mr francis concerned in the private affairs of the ghosts which needed rectifying and so forth  these premonitions with others were all fulfilled  mrs claughton in the church at night continued her conversation with the ghosts whose acquaintance she had made at rapingham  she obtained it seems all the information needful to settling the mysterious matters which disturbed the male ghost who hid his face and on monday morning she visited the daughter of mr howard in her country house in a park recognised the strong likeness to her father and carried out all things desired by the dead to the full as had been requested     the wishes expressed to her were perfectly rational reasonable and of natural importance  the clerk wright attests the accuracy of mrs claughtons description of mr howard whom he knew and the correspondence of her dates with those in the parish register and on the graves which he found for her at her request  mr myers from a very partial knowledge of what the meresby ghosts business was thinks the reasons for not revealing this matter entirely sufficient  the ghosts messages to survivors effected the intended results says mrs claughton        of this story the only conceivable natural explanation is that mrs claughton to serve her private ends paid secret preliminary visits to meresby got up there a number of minute facts chose a haunted house at the other end of england as a first scene in her little drama and made the rest of the troublesome journeys not to mention the uncomfortable visit to a dark church at midnight and did all this from a hysterical love of notoriety  this desirable boon she would probably never have obtained even as far as it is consistent with a pseudonym if i had not chanced to dine with dr ferrier while the adventure was only beginning  as there seemed to be a chance of taking a ghost on the half volley i at once communicated the first part of the tale to the psychical society using pseudonyms as here throughout and two years later mrs claughton consented to tell the society as much as she thinks it fair to reveal  this it will be confessed is a roundabout way of obtaining fame and an ordinary person in mrs claughtons position would have gone to the psychical society at once as mark twain meant to do when he saw the ghost which turned out to be a very ordinary person  there i leave these ghosts my mind being in a just balance of agnosticism  if ghosts at all they were ghosts with a purpose  the species is now very rare  the purpose of the ghost in the following instance was trivial but was successfully accomplished  in place of asking people to do what it wanted the ghost did the thing itself  now the modern theory of ghosts namely that they are delusions of the senses of the seers caused somehow by the mental action of dead or distant people does not seem to apply in this case  the ghost produced an effect on a material object  put out the light  the rev d w g gwynne md was a physician in holy orders  in 1853 he lived at p house near taunton where both he and his wife were made uncomfortable by auditory experiences to which they could find no clue or in common english they heard mysterious noises during the night writes dr gwynne i became aware of a draped figure passing across the foot of the bed towards the fireplace  i had the impression that the arm was raised pointing with the hand towards the mantelpiece on which a nightlight was burning  mrs gwynne at the same moment seized my arm and the light was extinguished  notwithstanding i distinctly saw the figure returning towards the door and being under the impression that one of the servants had found her way into our room i leaped out of bed to intercept the intruder but found and saw nothing  i rushed to the door and endeavoured to follow the supposed intruder and it was not until i found the door locked as usual that i was painfully impressed  i need hardly say that mrs gwynne was in a very nervous state  she asked me what i had seen and i told her  she had seen the same figure but writes mrs gwynne i distinctly saw the hand of the figure placed over the nightlight which was at once extinguished  mrs gwynne also heard the rustle of the tall man like figures garments  in addition to the nightlight there was moonlight in the room  other people had suffered many things in the same house unknown to dr and mrs gwynne who gave up the place soon afterwards  in plenty of stories we hear of ghosts who draw curtains or open doors and these apparent material effects are usually called part of the seers delusion  but the nightlight certainly went out under the figures hand and was relit by dr gwynne  either the ghost was an actual entity not a mere hallucination of two people or the

blacks possessed only shelters or leansto so in australia the spirits do their rapping on the tree trunks a native illustrated this by whacking a table with a book  the perchedup houses of the dyaks are haunted by noisy routing agencies  we find them in monasteries palaces and crofters cottages all through the middle ages  on an ancient egyptian papyrus we find the husband of the lady onkhari protesting against her habit of haunting his house and exclaiming  what wrong have i done exactly in the spirit of the hymn of donald ban who was sair hadden down by a bodach noisy bogle after culloden 188a  the husband of onkhari does not say how she disturbed him but the manners of egyptian haunters just what they remain at present may be gathered from a magical papyrus written in greek  spirits wail and groan or laugh dreadfully they cause bad dreams terror and madness finally they practice stealthy theft and rap and knock the theft by making objects disappear mysteriously is often illustrated in the following tales as are the groaning and knocking 188b  st augustine speaks of hauntings as familiar occurrences and we have a chain of similar cases from ancient egypt to 1896  several houses in that year were so disturbed that the inhabitants were obliged to leave them  the newspapers were full of correspondence on the subject  the usual annoyances are apparitions rare flying about of objects not very common noises of every kind extremely frequent groans screams footsteps and fireraising  imposture has either been proved or made very probable in ten out of eleven cases of volatile objects between 1883 and 1895 188c  moreover it is certain that the noises of haunted houses are not equally audible by all persons present even when the sounds are at their loudest  thus lord st vincent the great admiral heard nothing during his stay at the house of his sister mrs ricketts while that lady endured terrible things  after his departure she was obliged to recall him  he arrived and slept peacefully  next day his sister told him about the disturbances after which he heard them as much as his neighbours and was as unsuccessful in discovering their cause 189  of course this looks as if these noises were unreal children of the imagination  noises being the staple of haunted houses a few words may be devoted to them  they are usually the froufrou or rustling sweep of a gown footsteps raps thumps groans a sound as if all the heavy furniture was being knocked about crashing of crockery and jingling of money  of course as to footsteps people may be walking about and most of the other noises are either easily imitated or easily produced by rats water pipes cracks in furniture which the aztecs thought ominous of death and other natural causes the explanation is rather more difficult when the steps pace a gallery passing and repassing among curious inquirers or in this instance  the creaking stair  a lady very well known to myself and in literary society lived as a girl with an antiquarian father in an old house dear to an antiquary it was haunted among other things by footsteps  the old oak staircase had two creaking steps numbers seventeen and eighteen from the top  the girl would sit on the stair stretching out her arms and count the steps as they passed her one two three and so on to seventeen and eighteen which always creaked 190   in this case rats and similar causes were excluded though we may allow for expectant attention  but this does not generally work  when people sit up on purpose to look out for the ghost he rarely comes in the case of the lady in black which we give later when purposely waited for she was never seen at all  discounting imposture which is sometimes found and sometimes merely fabled as in the tedworth story there remains one curious circumstance  specially ghostly noises are attributed to the living but absent  the grocers cough  a man of letters was born in a small scotch town where his father was the intimate friend of a tradesman whom we shall call the grocer almost every day the grocer would come to have a chat with mr mackay and the visitor alone of the natives had the habit of knocking at the door before entering  one day mr mackay said to his daughter theres mr macwilliams knock  open the door  but there was no mr macwilliam  he was just leaving his house at the other end of the street  from that day mr mackay always heard the grocers knock a little previous accompanied by the grocers cough which was peculiar  then all the family heard it including the son who later became learned  he when he had left his village for glasgow reasoned himself out of the opinion that the grocers knock did herald and precede the grocer  but when he went home for a visit he found that he heard it just as of old  possibly some local sentimental tommy watched for the grocer played the trick and ran away  this explanation presents no difficulty but the boy was never detected 191  such anecdotes somehow do not commend themselves to the belief even of people who can believe a good deal  but the spirits of the living as the highlanders say have surely as good a chance to knock or appear at a distance as the spirits of the dead  to be sure the living do not know unless they are making a scientific experiment what trouble they are giving on these occasions but one can only infer like st augustine that probably the dead dont know it either  thus  my gillies fathers story  fishing in sutherland i had a charming companion in the gillie  he was well educated a great reader the best of salmon fishers and i never heard a man curse william duke of cumberland with more enthusiasm  his father still alive was secondsighted and so to a moderate extent and without theory was my friend  among other anecdotes confirmed in writing by the old gentleman was this  the father had a friend who died in the house which they both occupied  the clothes of the deceased hung on pegs in the bedroom one night the father awoke and saw a stranger examining and handling the clothes of the defunct  then came a letter from the dead mans brother inquiring about the effects  he followed later and was the stranger seen by my gillies father  thus the living but absent may haunt a house both noisily and by actual appearance  the learned even think for very exquisite reasons that silverton abbey 192 is haunted noisily by a spirit of the living  here is a case  the dream that knocked at the door  the following is an old but good story  the rev joseph wilkins died an aged man in 1800  he left this narrative often printed the date of the adventure is 1754 when mr wilkins aged twentythree was a schoolmaster in devonshire  the dream was an ordinary dream and did not announce death or anything but a journey  mr wilkins dreamed in devonshire that he was going to london  he thought he would go by gloucestershire and see his people  so he started arrived at his fathers house found the front door locked went in by the back door went to his parents room saw his father asleep in bed and his mother awake  he said  mother i am going a long journey and have come to bid you goodbye  she answered in a fright oh dear son thou art dead  mr wilkins wakened and thought nothing of it  as early as a letter could come one arrived from his father addressing him as if he were dead and desiring him if by accident alive or any one into whose hands the letter might fall to write at once  the father then gave his reasons for alarm  mrs wilkins being awake one night heard some one try the front door enter by the back then saw her son come into her room and say he was going on a long journey with the rest of the dialogue  she then woke her husband who said she had been dreaming but who was alarmed enough to write the letter  no harm came of it to anybody  the story would be better if mr wilkins junior like laud had kept a nocturnal of his dreams and published his fathers letter with postmarks  the story of the lady who often dreamed of a house and when by chance she found and rented it was recognised as the ghost who had recently haunted it is good but is an invention  a somewhat similar instance is that of the uproar of moving heavy objects heard by scott in abbotsford on the night preceding and the night of the death of his furnisher mr bullock in london  the story is given in lockharts life of scott and is too familiar for repetition  on the whole accepting one kind of story on the same level as the other kind the living and absent may unconsciously produce the phenomena of haunted houses just as well as the dead to whose alleged performances we now advance  actual appearances as we have said are not common and just as all persons do not hear the sounds so many do not see the appearance even when it is visible to others in the same room  as an example take a very mild and ladylike case of haunting  the girl in pink  the following anecdote was told to myself a few months after the curious event by the three witnesses in the case  they were connections of my own the father was a clergyman of the anglican church he his wife and their daughter a girl of twenty were the percipients  all are cheerful sagacious people and all though they absolutely agreed as to the facts in their experience professed an utter disbelief in ghosts which the occurrence has not affected in any way  they usually reside in a foreign city where there is a good deal of english society  one day they left the town to lunch with a young fellowcountryman who lived in a villa in the neighbourhood  there he was attempting to farm a small estate with what measure of success the story does not say  his house was kept by his sister who was present of course at the little luncheon party during the meal some question was asked or some remark was made to which the clerical guest replied in english by a reference to the maidservant in pink  there is no maid in pink said the host and he asked both his other guests to corroborate him  both ladies mother and daughter were obliged to say that unless their eyes deceived them they certainly had seen a girl in pink attending on them or at least moving about in the room  to this their entertainers earnestly replied that no such person was in their establishment that they had no woman servant but the elderly cook and housekeeper then present who was neither a girl nor in pink  after luncheon the guests were taken all over the house to convince them of the absence of the young woman whom they had seen and assuredly there was no trace of her  on returning to the town where they reside they casually mentioned the circumstance as a curious illusion  the person to whom they spoke said with some interest dont you know that a girl is said to have been murdered in that house before your friends took it and that she is reported to be occasionally seen dressed in pink  they had heard of no such matter but the story seemed to be pretty generally known though naturally disliked by the occupant of the house  as for the percipients they each and all remain firm in the belief that till convinced of the impossibility of her presence they were certain they had seen a girl in pink and rather a pretty girl whose appearance suggested nothing out of the common  an obvious hypothesis is discounted of course by the presence of the sister of the young gentleman who farmed the estate and occupied the house  here is another case mild but pertinacious  the dog in the haunted room  the authors friend mr rokeby lives and has lived for some twenty years in an old house at hammersmith  it is surrounded by a large garden the drawingroom and diningroom are on the right and left of the entrance from the garden on the ground floor  my friends had never been troubled by any phenomena before and never expected to be however they found the house noisy the windows were apt to be violently shaken at night and steps used to be heard where no steps should be  deep long sighs were audible at all times of day  as mrs rokeby approached a door the handle would turn and the door fly open 196  sounds of stitching a hard material and of dragging a heavy weight occurred in mrs rokebys room and her hair used to be pulled in a manner for which she could not account  these sorts of things went on for about five years when in october 1875 about three oclock in the afternoon i was sitting says mrs rokeby with three of my children in the diningroom reading to them  i rang the bell for the parlourmaid when the door opened and on looking up i saw the figure of a woman come in and walk up to the side of the table stand there a second or two and then turn to go out again but before reaching the door she seemed to dissolve away  she was a grey shortlooking woman apparently dressed in grey muslin  i hardly saw the face which seemed scarcely to be defined at all  none of the children saw her and mrs rokeby only mentioned the affair at the time to her husband  two servants in the next two months saw the same figure alike in dress at least in other rooms both by daylight and candle light they had not heard of mrs rokebys experience were accustomed to the noises and were in good health  one of them was frightened and left her place  a brilliant light in a dark room an icy wind and a feeling of being watched were other discomforts in mrs rokebys lot  after 1876 only occasional rappings were heard till mr rokeby being absent one night in 1883 the noises broke out banging thumping the whole place shaking  the library was the centre of these exercises and the dog a fine collie was shut up in the library  mrs rokeby left her room for her daughters while the dog whined in terror and the noises increased in violence  next day the dog when let out rushed forth with enthusiasm but crouched with his tail between his legs when invited to reenter  this was in 1883  several years after mr rokeby was smoking alone in the diningroom early in the evening when the dog began to bristle up his hair and bark  mr rokeby looked up and saw the woman in grey with about half her figure passed through the slightly open door  he ran to the door but she was gone and the servants were engaged in their usual business 198a  our next ghost offered many opportunities to observers  the lady in black  a ghost in a haunted house is seldom observed with anything like scientific precision  the spectre in the following narrative could not be photographed attempts being usually made in a light which required prolonged exposure  efforts to touch it were failures nor did it speak  on the other hand it did lend itself perhaps unconsciously to one scientific experiment  the story is unromantic the names are fictitious 198b  bognor house an eligible family residence near a large town was built in 1860 and occupied till his death in 1876 by mr s  he was twice married and was not of temperate ways  his second wife adopted his habits left him shortly before his death and died at clifton in 1878  the pair used to quarrel about some jewels which mr s concealed in the flooring of a room where the ghost was never seen  a mr l now took the house but died six months later  bognor house stood empty for four years during which there was vague talk of hauntings  in april 1882 the house was taken by captain morton this was in april in june miss rose morton a lady of nineteen studying medicine and wearing spectacles saw the first appearance miss morton did not mention her experiences to her family her mother being an invalid and her brothers and sisters very young but she transmitted accounts to a friend a lady in a kind of diary letters these are extant and are quoted  phenomena of this kind usually begin with noises and go on to apparitions  miss morton one night while preparing to go to bed heard a noise outside thought it was her mother opened the door saw a tall lady in black holding a handkerchief to her face and followed the figure till her candle burned out  a widows white cuff was visible on each wrist the whole of the face was never seen  in 1882 84 miss morton saw the figure about six times it was thrice seen once through the window from outside by other persons who took it for a living being  two boys playing in the garden ran in to ask who was the weeping lady in black  on 29th january 1884 miss morton spoke to her inmate as the lady in black stood beside a sofa  she only gave a slight gasp and moved towards the door  just by the door i spoke to her again but she seemed as if she were quite unable to speak 199  in may and june miss morton fastened strings at different heights from the stair railings to the wall where she attached them with glue but she twice saw the lady pass through the cords leaving them untouched  when miss morton cornered the figure and tried to touch her or pounce on her she dodged or disappeared  but by a curious contradiction her steps were often heard by several of the family and when she heard the steps miss morton used to go out and follow the figure  there is really no more to tell  miss mortons father never saw the lady even when she sat on a sofa for half an hour miss morton watching her other people saw her in the garden crying and sent messages to ask what was the matter and who was the lady in distress  many members of the family boys girls married ladies servants and others often saw the lady in black  in 1885 loud noises bumps and turning of door handles were common and though the servants were told that the lady was quite harmless they did not always stay  the whole establishment of servants was gradually changed but the lady still walked  she appeared more seldom in 18871889 and by 1892 even the light footsteps ceased  two dogs a retriever and a skye terrier showed much alarm  twice says miss morton i saw the terrier suddenly run up to the mat at the foot of the stairs in the hall wagging its tail and moving its back in the way dogs do when they expect to be caressed  it jumped up fawning as it would do if a person had been standing there but suddenly slunk away with its tail between its legs and retreated trembling under a sofa  miss mortons own emotion at first was a feeling of awe at something unknown mixed with a strong desire to know more about it 200  this is a pretty tame case of haunting as was conjectured by an unhappy revenant the returned spirit of the second mrs s  here it may be remarked that apparitions in haunted houses are very seldom recognised as those of dead persons and when recognised the recognition is usually dubious  thus in february 1897 lieutenant carr glyn of the grenadiers while reading in the outer room of the queens library in windsor saw a lady in black in a kind of mantilla of black lace pass from the inner room into a corner where she was lost to view  he supposed that she had gone out by a door there and asked an attendant later who she was  there was no door round the corner and in the opinion of some the lady was queen elizabeth she has a traditional habit it seems of haunting the library  but surely of all people in dress and aspect queen elizabeth is most easily recognised  the seer did not recognise her and she was probably a mere casual hallucination  in old houses such traditions are common but vague  in this connection glamis is usually mentioned  every one has heard of the secret chamber with its mystery and the story was known to scott who introduces it in the betrothed  but we know when the secret chamber was built under the restoration who built it what he paid the masons and where it is under the charter room 201  these cold facts rather take the weird effect off the glamis legend  the usual process is given an old house first a noise then a hallucination actual or pretended then a myth to account for the hallucination  there is a castle on the border which has at least seven or eight distinct ghosts  one is the famous radiant boy  he has been evicted by turning his tapestried chamber into the smoking room  for many years not one ghost has been seen except the lady with the candle viewed by myself but being ignorant of the story i thought she was one of the maids  perhaps she was but she went into an empty set of rooms and did not come out again  footsteps are apt to approach the doors of these rooms in mirk midnight the door handle turns and that is all  so much for supposed hauntings by spirits of the dead  at the opposite pole are hauntings by agencies whom nobody supposes to be ghosts of inmates of the house  the following is an extreme example as the haunter proceeded to arson  this is not so very unusual and if managed by an impostor shows insane malevolence 202  the dancing devil  on 16th november 1870 mr shchapoff a russian squire the narrator came home from a visit to a country town iletski and found his family in some disarray  there lived with him his mother and his wifes mother ladies of about sixtynine his wife aged twenty and his baby daughter  the ladies had been a good deal disturbed  on the night of the 14th the baby was fractious and the cook maria danced and played the harmonica to divert her  the baby fell asleep the wife and mr shchapoffs millers lady were engaged in conversation when a shadow crossed the blind on the outside  they were about to go out and see who was passing when they heard a double shuffle being executed with energy in the loft overhead  they thought maria the cook was making a night of it but found her asleep in the kitchen the dancing went on but nobody could be found in the loft  then raps began on the window panes and so the miller and gardener patrolled outside  nobody  raps and dancing lasted through most of the night and began again at ten in the morning  the ladies were incommoded and complained of broken sleep  mr shchapoff hearing all this examined the miller who admitted the facts but attributed them to a pigeons nest which he had found under the cornice  satisfied with this rather elementary hypothesis mr shchapoff sat down to read livingstones african travels  presently the double shuffle sounded in the loft  mrs shchapoff was asleep in her bedroom but was awakened by loud raps the window was tapped at deafening thumps were dealt at the outer wall and the whole house thrilled  mr shchapoff rushed out with dogs and a gun there were no footsteps in the snow the air was still the full moon rode in a serene sky  mr shchapoff came back and the double shuffle was sounding merrily in the empty loft  next day was no better but the noises abated and ceased gradually  alas mr shchapoff could not leave well alone  on 20th december to amuse a friend he asked maria to dance and play  raps in tune began on the window panes  next night they returned while boots slippers and other objects flew about with a hissing noise  a piece of stuff would fly up and fall with a heavy hard thud while hard bodies fell soundless as a feather  the performances slowly died away  on old years night maria danced to please them raps began people watching on either side of a wall heard the raps on the other side on 8th january mrs shchapoff fainted when a large luminous ball floated increasing in size from under her bed  the raps now followed her about by day as in the case of john wesleys sisters on these occasions she felt weak and somnolent  finally mr shchapoff carried his family to his town house for muchneeded change of air  science in the form of dr shustoff now hinted that electricity or magnetic force was at the bottom of the annoyances a great comfort to the household who conceived that the devil was concerned  the doctor accompanied his friends to their country house for a night maria was invited to oblige with a dance and only a few taps on windows followed  the family returned to town till 21st january  no sooner was mrs shchapoff in bed than knives and forks came out of a closed cupboard and flew about occasionally sticking in the walls  on 24th january the doctor abandoned the hypothesis of electricity because the noises kept time to profane but not to sacred music  a tartar hymn by a tartar servant an islamite had no accompaniment but the freischutz was warmly encored  this went beyond the most intelligent spontaneous exercises of electricity  questions were asked of the agencies and to the interrogation are you a devil a most deafening knock replied  we all jumped backwards  now comes a curious point  in the wesley and tedworth cases the masters of the houses like the cure of cideville 1851 were at odds with local cunning men  mr shchapoffs fiend now averred that he was set on by the servant of a neighbouring miller with whom mr shchapoff had a dispute about a mill pond  this man had previously said it will be worse they will drag you by the hair  and indeed mrs shchapoff was found in tears because her hair had been pulled 205  science again intervened  a section of the imperial geographical society sent dr shustoff mr akutin a government civil engineer and a literary gentleman as a committee of inquiry appointed by the governor of the province  they made a number of experiments with leyden jars magnets and so forth with only negative results things flew about both from and towards mrs shchapoff  nothing volatile was ever seen to begin its motion though in march 1883 objects were seen by a policeman and six other witnesses to fly up from a bin and out of a closed cupboard in a house at worksop 206 mr akutin in mrs shchapoffs bedroom found the noises answer questions in french and german on contemporary politics of which the lady of the house knew nothing  lassalle was said to be alive mr shchapoff remarked what nonsense but mr akutin corrected him the bogey was better informed  the success of the french in the great war was predicted  the family now moved to their town house and the inquest continued though the raps were only heard near the lady  a dr dubinsky vowed that she made them herself with her tongue then with her pulse the doctor assailed and finally shook the faith of mr akutin who was to furnish a report  he bribed a servant boy to say that his mistress made the sounds herself and then pretended that he had caught her trying to deceive us by throwing things  finally mr akutin reported that the whole affair was a hysterical imposition by mrs shchapoff  dr dubinsky attended her her health and spirits improved and the disturbances ceased  but poor mr shchapoff received an official warning not to do it again from the governor of his province  that way lies siberia  imagine then exclaims mr shchapoff our horror when on our return to the country in march the unknown force at once set to work again  and now even my wifes presence was not essential  thus one day i saw with my own eyes a heavy sofa jump off all four legs three or four times in fact and this when my aged mother was lying on it the same thing occurred to nancy wesleys bed on which she was sitting while playing cards in 1717  the picture of a lady of seventy sitting tight to a bucking sofa appeals to the brave  then the fireraising began  a blue spark flew out of a washstand into mrs shchapoffs bedroom  luckily she was absent and her mother rushing forward with a waterjug extinguished a flaming cotton dress  bright red globular meteors now danced in the veranda mr portnoff next takes up the tale as follows mr shchapoff having been absent from home on the occasion described  i was sitting playing the guitar  the miller got up to leave and was followed by mrs shchapoff  hardly had she shut the door when i heard as though from far off a deep drawn wail  the voice seemed familiar to me  overcome with an unaccountable horror i rushed to the door and there in the passage i saw a literal pillar of fire in the middle of which draped in flame stood mrs shchapoff    i rushed to put it out with my hands but i found it burned them badly as if they were sticking to burning pitch  a sort of cracking noise came from beneath the floor which also shook and vibrated violently  mr portnoff and the miller carried off the unconscious victim  mr shchapoff also saw a small pink hand like a childs spring from the floor and play with mrs shchapoffs coverlet in bed  these things were too much the shchapoffs fled to a cottage and took a new country house  they had no more disturbances  mrs shchapoff died in childbed in 1878 a healthy religious quiet affectionate woman      chapter x modern hauntings   the shchapoff story of a peculiar type  demoniacal possession story of wellington mill briefly analysed  authorities for the story letters  a journal  the wesley ghost  given critically and why note on similar stories such as the drummer of tedworth  sir waller scotts scepticism about nautical evidence  lord st vincent  scott asks where are his letters on a ghostly disturbance  the letters are now published  lord st vincents ghost story  reflections  cases like that of mrs shchapoff really belong to a peculiar species of haunted houses  our ancestors like the modern chinese attributed them to diabolical possession not to an ordinary ghost of a dead person  examples are very numerous and have all the same symptoms as coleridge would have said he attributing them to a contagious nervous malady of observation in the spectators  among the most notorious is the story of willington mill told by howitt and borrowed by mrs crowe in the night side of nature  mr procter the occupant a quaker vouched to mrs crowe for the authenticity of howitts version 22nd july 1847  other letters from seers are published and the society of psychical research lately printed mr procters contemporary journal  a man a woman and a monkey were the chief apparitions  there were noises lights beds were heaved about nothing was omitted  a clairvoyante was turned on but could only say that the spectral figures which she described had no brains after the quakers left the house there seems to have been no more trouble  the affair lasted for fifteen years  familiar as it is we now offer the old story of the hauntings at epworth mainly because a full view of the inhabitants the extraordinary family of wesley seems necessary to an understanding of the affair  the famous and excessively superstitious john wesley was not present on the occasion  the wesley ghost  no ghost story is more celebrated than that of old jeffrey the spirit so named by emily wesley which disturbed the rectory at epworth chiefly in the december of 1716 and the spring of 1717  yet the vagueness of the human mind has led many people especially journalists to suppose that the haunted house was that not of samuel wesley but of his son john wesley the founder of the wesleyan methodists  for the better intelligence of the tale we must know who the inmates of the epworth rectory were and the nature of their characters and pursuits  the rector was the rev samuel wesley born in 1662 the son of a clergyman banished from his living on black bartholomew day 1666  though educated among dissenters samuel wesley converted himself to the truth as it is in the church of england became a poor scholar of exeter college in oxford supported himself mainly by hackwork in literature he was one of the editors of a penny paper called the athenian mercury a sort of answers married miss susanna annesley a lady of good family in 169091 and in 1693 was presented to the rectory of epworth in lincolnshire by mary wife of william of orange to whom he had dedicated a poem on the life of christ  the living was poor mr wesleys family multiplied with amazing velocity he was in debt and unpopular  his cattle were maimed in 1705 and in 1703 his house was burned down  the rectory house of which a picture is given in clarkes memoirs of the wesleys 1825 was built anew at his own expense  mr wesley was in politics a strong royalist but having seen james ii shake his lean arm at the fellows of magdalen college and threaten them with the weight of a kings right hand he conceived a prejudice against that monarch and took the side of the prince of orange  his wife a very pious woman and a strict disciplinarian was a jacobite would not say amen to the prayers for the king and was therefore deserted by her husband for a year or more in 17011702  they came together again however on the accession of queen anne  unpopular for his politics hated by the dissenters and at odds with the cunning men or local wizards against whom he had frequently preached mr wesley was certainly apt to have tricks played on him by his neighbours  his house though surrounded by a wall a hedge and its own grounds was within a few yards of the nearest dwelling in the village street  in 1716 when the disturbances began mr wesleys family consisted of his wife his eldest son sam aged about twentythree and then absent at his duties as an usher at westminster john aged twelve a boy at westminster school charles a boy of eight away from home and the girls who were all at the parsonage  they were emily about twentytwo mary nancy and sukey probably about twentyone twenty and nineteen and hetty who may have been anything between nineteen and twelve but who comes after john in dr clarkes list and is apparently reckoned among the children 212  then there was patty who may have been only nine and little keziah  all except patty were very lively young people and hetty afterwards a copious poet was gay and sprightly full of mirth goodhumour and keen wit  she indulged this disposition so much that it was said to have given great uneasiness to her parents  the servants robin brown betty massy and nancy marshall were recent comers but were acquitted by mrs wesley of any share in the mischief  the family though like other people of their date they were inclined to believe in witches and warnings were not especially superstitious and regarded the disturbances first with some apprehension then as a joke and finally as a bore  the authorities for what occurred are first a statement and journal by mr wesley then a series of letters of 1717 to sam at westminster by his mother emily and sukey next a set of written statements made by these and other witnesses to john wesley in 1726 and last and worst a narrative composed many years after by john wesley for the arminian magazine  the earliest document by a few days is the statement of mr wesley written with a brief journal between 21st december 1716 and 1st january 1717  comparing this with mrs wesleys letter to sam of 12th january 1716 and sukeys letter of 24th january we learn that the family for some weeks after 1st december had been in the greatest panic imaginable supposing that sam jack or charlie who must also have been absent from home was dead or by some misfortune killed the reason for these apprehensions was that on the night of 1st december the maid heard at the diningroom door several dreadful groans like a person in extremes  they laughed at her but for the whole of december the groans squeaks tinglings and knockings were frightful enough  the rest of the family mr wesley always excepted heard a strange knocking in divers places chiefly in the green room or nursery where apparently hetty patty and keziah lay  emily heard the noises later than some of her sisters perhaps a week after the original groans  she was locking up the house about ten oclock when a sound came like the smashing and splintering of a huge piece of coal on the kitchen floor  she and sukey went through the rooms on the ground floor but found the dog asleep the cat at the other end of the house and everything in order  from her bedroom emily heard a noise of breaking the empty bottles under the stairs but was going to bed when hetty who had been sitting on the lowest step of the garret stairs beside the nursery door waiting for her father was chased into the nursery by a sound as of a man passing her in a loose trailing gown  sukey and nancy were alarmed by loud knocks on the outside of the diningroom door and overhead  all this time mr wesley heard nothing and was not even told that anything unusual was heard  mrs wesley at first held her peace lest he should think it according to the vulgar opinion a warning against his own death which indeed we all apprehended  mr wesley only smiled when he was informed but by taking care to see all the girls safe in bed sufficiently showed his opinion that the young ladies and their lovers were the ghost  mrs wesley then fell back on the theory of rats and employed a man to blow a horn as a remedy against these vermin  but this measure only aroused the emulation of the sprite whom emily began to call jeffrey  not till 21st december did mr wesley hear anything then came thumpings on his bedroom wall  unable to discover the cause he procured a stout mastiff which soon became demoralised by his experiences  on the morning of the 24th about seven oclock emily led mrs wesley into the nursery where she heard knocks on and under the bedstead these sounds replied when she knocked  something like a badger with no head says emily mrs wesley only says like a badger ran from under the bed  on the night of the 25th there was an appalling vacarme  mr and mrs wesley went on a tour of inspection but only found the mastiff whining in terror  we still heard it rattle and thunder in every room above or behind us locked as well as open except my study where as yet it never came  on the night of the 26th mr wesley seems to have heard of a phenomenon already familiar to emilysomething like the quick winding up of a jack at the corner of the room by my bed head  this was always followed by knocks hollow and loud such as none of us could ever imitate  mr wesley went into the nursery hetty kezzy and patty were asleep  the knocks were loud beneath and in the room so mr wesley went below to the kitchen struck with his stick against the rafters and was answered as often and as loud as i knocked  the peculiar knock which was his own 1234567 was not successfully echoed at that time  mr wesley then returned to the nursery which was as tapageuse as ever  the children three were trembling in their sleep  mr wesley invited the agency to an interview in his study was answered by one knock outside all the rest were within and then came silence  investigations outside produced no result but the latch of the door would rise and fall and the door itself was pushed violently back against investigators  i have been with hetty says emily when it has knocked under her and when she has removed has followed her and it knocked under little kezzy when she stamped with her foot pretending to scare patty  mr wesley had requested an interview in his study especially as the jacobite goblin routed loudly over our heads constantly when we came to the prayers for king george and the prince  in his study the agency pushed mr wesley about bumping him against the corner of his desk and against his door  he would ask for a conversation but heard only two or three feeble squeaks a little louder than the chirping of a bird but not like the noise of rats which i have often heard  mr wesley had meant to leave home for a visit on friday 28th december but the noises of the 27th were so loud that he stayed at home inviting the rev mr hoole of haxey to view the performances the noises were very boisterous and disturbing this night  mr hoole says in 1726 confirmed by mrs wesley 12th january 1717 that there were sounds of feet trailing gowns raps and a noise as of planing boards  the disturbance finally went outside the house and died away  mr wesley seems to have paid his visit on the 30th and notes 1st january 1717  my family have had no disturbance since i went away  to judge by mr wesleys letter to sam of 12th january there was no trouble between the 29th of december and that date  on the 19th of january and the 30th of the same month sam wrote full of curiosity to his father and mother  mrs wesley replied 25th or 27th january saying that no explanation could be discovered but it commonly was nearer hetty than the rest  on 24th january sukey said it is now pretty quiet but still knocks at prayers for the king  on 11th february mr wesley much bored by sams inquiries says we are all now quiet     it would make a glorious penny book for jack dunton his brotherinlaw a publisher of popular literature such as the athenian mercury  emily no date explains the phenomena as the revenge for her fathers recent sermons against consulting those that are called cunning men which our people are given to and it had a particular spite at my father  the disturbances by no means ended in the beginning of january nor at other dates when a brief cessation made the wesleys hope that jeffrey had returned to his own place  thus on 27th march sukey writes to sam remarking that as hetty and emily are also writing so particularly she need not say much  one thing i believe you do not know that is last sunday to my fathers no small amazement his trencher danced upon the table a pretty while without anybodys stirring the table     send me some news for we are excluded from the sight or hearing of any versal thing except jeffery  the last mention of the affair at this time is in a letter from emily of 1st april to a mr berry  tell my brother the sprite was with us last night and heard by many of our family  there are no other contemporary letters preserved but we may note mrs wesleys opinion 25th january that it was beyond the power of any human being to make such strange and various noises  the next evidence is ten years after date the statements taken down by jack wesley in 1726 1720  mrs wesley adds to her former account that she earnestly desired it might not disturb her at her devotions between five and six in the evening and it did not rout in her room at that time  emily added that a screen was knocked at on each side as she went round to the other  sukey mentioned the noise as on one occasion coming gradually from the garret stairs outside the nursery door up to hettys bed who trembled strongly in her sleep  it then removed to the room overhead where it knocked my fathers knock on the ground as if it would beat the house down nancy said that the noise used to follow her or precede her and once a bed on which she sat playing cards was lifted up under her several times to a considerable height  robin the servant gave evidence that he was greatly plagued with all manner of noises and movements of objects  john wesley in his account published many years after date in his arminian magazine attributed the affair of 1716 to his fathers broken vow of deserting his mother till she recognised the prince of orange as king  he adds that the mastiff used to tremble and creep away before the noise began  some other peculiarities may be noted  all persons did not always hear the noises  it was three weeks before mr wesley heard anything john and kitty maw who lived over against us listened several nights in the time of the disturbance but could never hear anything again the first time my mother ever heard any unusual noise at epworth was long before the disturbance of old jeffrey    the door and windows jarred very loud and presently several distinct strokes three by three were struck  from that night it never failed to give notice in much the same manner against any signal misfortune or illness of any belonging to the family writes jack  once more on 10th february 1750 emily now mrs harper wrote to her brother john that wonderful thing called by us jeffery how certainly it calls on me against any extraordinary new affliction  this is practically all the story of old jeffrey  the explanations have been trickery by servants priestley contagious hallucinations coleridge devilry southey and trickery by hetty wesley dr salmon of trinity college dublin  dr salmon points out that there is no evidence from hetty that she was a lively humorous girl and he conceives that she began to frighten the maids and only reluctantly exhibited before her father against whom however jeffrey developed a particular spite  he adds that certain circumstances were peculiar to hetty which in fact is not the case  the present editor has examined dr salmons arguments in the contemporary review and shown reason in the evidence for acquitting hetty wesley who was never suspected by her family  trickery from without by the cunning men is an explanation which at least provides a motive but how the thing could be managed from without remains a mystery  sam wesley the friend of pope and atterbury and lord oxford not unjustly said  wit i fancy might find many interpretations but wisdom none 220  as the wesley tale is a very typical instance of a very large class our study of it may exempt us from printing the wellknown parallel case of the drummer of tedworth  briefly the house of mr mompesson near ludgarshal in wilts was disturbed in the usual way for at least two years from april 1661 to april 1663 or later the noises and copious phenomena of moving objects apparently untouched were attributed to the unholy powers of a wandering drummer deprived by mr mompesson of his drum  a grand jury presented the drummer for trial on a charge of witchcraft but the petty jury would not convict there being a want of evidence to prove threats malum minatum by the drummer  in 1662 the rev joseph glanvil frs visited the house and in the bedroom of mr mompessons little girls the chief sufferers heard and saw much the same phenomena as the elder wesley describes in his own nursery  the little modest girls were aged about seven and eight  charles ii sent some gentlemen to the house for one night when nothing occurred the disturbances being intermittent  glanvil published his narrative at the time and mr pepys found it not very convincing  glanvil in consequence of his book was so vexed by correspondents that i have been haunted almost as bad as mr mompessons house  a report that imposture had been discovered and confessed by mr mompesson was set afloat by john webster in a wellknown work and may still be found in modern books  glanvil denied it till he was quite tired and mompesson gave a formal denial in a letter dated tedworth 8th november 1672  he also with many others swore to the facts on oath in court at the drummers trial 221  in the tedworth case as at epworth and in the curious cideville case of 1851 a quarrel with cunning men preceded the disturbances  in lord st vincents case which follows nothing of the kind is reported  as an almost universal rule children especially girls of about twelve are centres of the trouble in the st vincent story the children alone were exempt from annoyance  lord st vincents ghost story  sir walter scott writing about the disturbances in the house occupied by mrs ricketts sister of the great admiral lord st vincent asks who has seen lord st vincents letters  he adds that the gallant admiral after all was a sailor and implies that what the sailor said if he said anything is not evidence  the fact of unaccountable disturbances which finally drove mrs ricketts out of hinton ampner is absolutely indisputable though the cause of the annoyances may remain as mysterious as ever  the contemporary correspondence including that of lord st vincent then captain jervis exists and has been edited by mrs henley jervis granddaughter of mrs ricketts 222  there is only the very vaguest evidence for hauntings at lady hillsboroughs old house of hinton ampner near alresford before mr ricketts took it in january 1765  he and his wife were then disturbed by footsteps and sounds of doors opening and shutting they put new locks on the doors lest the villagers had procured keys but this proved of no avail  the servants talked of seeing appearances of a gentleman in drab and of a lady in silk which mrs ricketts disregarded  her husband went to jamaica in the autumn of 1769 and in 1771 she was so disturbed that her brother captain jervis a witness of the phenomena insisted on her leaving the house in august  he and mrs ricketts then wrote to mr ricketts about the affair  in july 1772 mrs ricketts wrote a long and solemn description of her sufferings to be given to her children  we shall slightly abridge her statement in which she mentions that when she left hinton she had not one of the servants who came thither in her family which evinces the impossibility of a confederacy her new like her former servants were satisfactory camis her new coachman was of a yeoman house of 400 years standing  it will be observed that mrs ricketts was a good deal annoyed even before 2nd april 1771 the day when she dates the beginning of the worst disturbances  she believed that the agency was humana robber or a practical jokerand but slowly and reluctantly became convinced that the exploded notion of an abnormal force might be correct  we learn that while captain jervis was not informed of the sounds he never heard them and whereas mrs ricketts heard violent noises after he went to bed on the night of his vigil he heard nothing  several instances occurred where very loud noises were heard by one or two persons when those equally near and in the same direction were not sensible of the least impression 223  with this preface mrs ricketts may be allowed to tell her own tale  sometime after mr ricketts left me autumn 1769 ithen lying in the bedroom over the kitchenheard frequently the noise of some one walking in the room within and the rustling as of silk clothes against the door that opened into my room sometimes so loud and of such continuance as to break my rest  instant search being often made we never could discover any appearance of human or brute being repeatedly disturbed in the same manner i made it my constant practice to search the room and closets within and to secure the only door on the inside     yet this precaution did not preclude the disturbance which continued with little interruption  nobody in short could enter this room except by passing through that of mrs ricketts the door of which was always made fast by a drawn bolt  yet somebody kept rustling and walking in the inner room which somebody could never be found when sought for  in summer 1770 mrs ricketts heard someone walk to the foot of her bed in her own room the footsteps as distinct as ever i heard myself perfectly awake and collected  nobody could be discovered in the chamber  mrs ricketts boldly clung to her room and was only now and then disturbed by sounds of harmony and heavy thumps down stairs  after this and early in 1771 she was frequently sensible of a hollow murmuring that seemed to possess the whole house  it was independent of wind being equally heard on the calmest nights and it was a sound i had never been accustomed to hear  on 27th february 1771 a maid was alarmed by groans and fluttering round her bed  she was the sister of an eminent grocer in alresford  on 2nd april mrs ricketts heard people walking in the lobby hunted for burglars traced the sounds to a room whence their was no outlet and found nobody  this kind of thing went on till mrs ricketts despaired of any natural explanation  after midsummer 1771 the trouble increased in broad daylight and a shrill female voice answered by two male voices was added to the afflictions captain jervis came on a visit but was told of nothing and never heard anything  after he went to portsmouth the most deep loud tremendous noise seemed to rush and fall with infinite velocity and force on the lobby floor adjoining my room accompanied by a shrill and dreadful shriek seeming to proceed from under the spot where the rushing noise fell and repeated three or four times  mrs ricketts resolution remained firm but her health was impaired she tried changing her room without results  the disturbances pursued her  her brother now returned  she told him nothing and he heard nothing but next day she unbosomed herself captain jervis therefore sat up with captain luttrell and his own man he was rewarded by noises which he in vain tried to pursue  i should do great injustice to my sister he writes to mr ricketts on 9th august 1771 if i did not acknowledge to have heard what i could not after the most diligent search and serious reflection any way account for  captain jervis during a whole week slept by day and watched armed by night  even by day he was disturbed by a sound as of immense weights falling from the ceiling to the floor of his room he finally obliged his sister to leave the house  what occurred after mrs ricketts abandoned hinton is not very distinct  apparently captain jerviss second stay of a week when he did hear the noises was from 1st august to 8th august  from a statement by mrs ricketts it appears that when her brother joined his ship the alarm 9th august she retired to dame camiss house that of her coachmans mother  thence she went and made another attempt to live at hinton but was soon after assailed by a noise i never before heard very near me and the terror i felt not to be described  she therefore went to the newbolts and thence to the old palace at winton later on mr ricketts return to the parsonage and then to longwood to the old house there near alresford  meanwhile on 18th september lady hillsboroughs agent lay with armed men at hinton and making no discovery offered 50 pounds increased by mr ricketts to 100 pounds for the apprehension of the persons who caused the noises  the reward was never claimed  on 8th march 1772 camis wrote  i am very sorry that we cannot find out the reason of the noise at other dates he mentions sporadic noises heard by his mother and another woman including the murmur  a year after mrs ricketts left a family named lawrence took the house and according to old lucy camis in 1818 mr lawrence very properly threatened to dismiss any servant who spoke of the disturbances  the result of this sensible course was that the lawrences left suddenly at the end of the yearand the house was pulled down  some old political papers of the great rebellion and a monkeys skull not exhibited to any anatomist are said to have been discovered under the floor of the lobby or of one of the rooms  mrs ricketts adds sadly the unbelief of chancellor hoadley went nearest my heart as he had previously a high opinion of her veracity  the bishop of st asaph was incredulous on the ground that such means were unworthy of the deity to employ  probably a modern bishop would say that there were no noises at all that every one who heard the sounds was under the influence of suggestion caused first in mrs ricketts own mind by vague tales of a gentleman in drab seen by the servants  the contagion to be sure also reached two distinguished captains in the navy but not till one of them was told about disturbances which had not previously disturbed him  if this explanation be true it casts an unusual light on the human imagination  physical science has lately invented a new theory  disturbances of this kind are perhaps seismiccaused by earthquakes  see professor milne in the times 21st june 1897      chapter xi   a question for physicians  professor william jamess opinion hysterical disease  little hands  domestic arson  the wem case the saucepan began it  the nursemaid  boots fly off investigation  emmas partial confession  corroborative evidence question of disease repeated  chinese

bocan  donalds hymn  icelandic cases  the devil of hjaltastad  the ghost at garpsdal  more haunted houses  a physician as we have seen got the better of the demon in mrs shchapoffs case at least while the lady was under his care  really these disturbances appear to demand the attention of medical men  if the whole phenomena are caused by imposture the actors or actresses display a wonderful similarity of symptoms and an alarming taste for fireraising  professor william james the wellknown psychologist mentions ten cases whose resemblances suggest a natural type and we ask is it a type of hysterical disease 229  he chooses among others an instance in dr neviuss book on demon possession in china and there is another in peru  he also mentions the great amherst mystery which we give and the rerrick case in scotland 1696 related by telfer who prints on his margins the names of the attesting witnesses of each event lairds clergymen and farmers  at rerrick as in russia the little hand was seen by telfer himself and the fireraising was endless  at amherst too as in a pair of recent russian cases and others there was plenty of fireraising  by a lucky chance an english case occurred at wem in shropshire in november 1883  it began at a farm called the woods some ten miles from shrewsbury  first a saucepan full of eggs jumped off the fire in the kitchen and the teathings leaping from the table were broken  cinders were thrown out of the fire and set some clothes in a blaze  a globe leaped off a lamp  a farmer mr lea saw all the windows of the upper story as it were on fire but it was no such matter  the nursemaid ran out in a fright to a neighbours and her dress spontaneously combusted as she ran  the people attributed these and similar events to something in the coal or in the air or to electricity  when the nursegirl emma davies sat on the lap of the school mistress miss maddox her boots kept flying off like the boot laces in the daemon of spraiton  all this was printed in the london papers and on 15th november the daily telegraph and daily news published emmas confession that she wrought by sleight of hand and foot  on 17th november mr hughes went from cambridge to investigate  for some reason investigation never begins till the fun is over  on the 9th the girl now in a very nervous state no wonder had been put under the care of a dr mackey  this gentleman and miss turner said that things had occurred since emma came for which they could not account  on 13th november however miss turner looking out of a window spotted emma throwing a brick and pretending that the flight of the brick was automatic next day emma confessed to her tricks but steadfastly denied that she had cheated at woods farm and weston lullingfield where she had also been  her evidence to this effect was so far confirmed by mrs hampson of woods farm and her servant priscilla evans when examined by mr hughes  both were quite certain that they saw crockery rise by itself into air off the kitchen table when emma was at a neighbouring farm mr leas  priscilla also saw crockery come out of a cupboard in detachments and fly between her and emma usually in a slanting direction while emma stood by with her arms folded  yet priscilla was not on good terms with emma  unless then mrs hampson and priscilla fabled it is difficult to see how emma could move objects when she was standing at some considerable distance standing in fact in quite another farm  similar evidence was given and signed by miss maddox the schoolmistress and mr and mrs lea  on the other hand mrs hampson and priscilla believed that emma managed the fireraising herself the flames were very high and white and the articles were very little singed  this occurred also at rerrick in 1696 but mr hughes attributes it to emmas use of paraffin which does not apply to the rerrick case  paraffin smells a good dealnothing is said about a smell of paraffin  only one thing is certain  emma was at last caught in a cheat  this discredits her but a man who cheats at cards may hold a good hand by accident  in the same way if such wonders can happen as so much worldwide evidence declares they may have happened at woods farm and emma in a very nervous state may have feigned then or rather did feign them later  the question for the medical faculty is  does a decided taste for wilful fireraising often accompany exhibitions of dancing furniture and crockery gratuitously given by patients of hysterical temperament  this is quite a normal inquiry  is there a nervous malady of which the symptoms are domestic arson and amateur legerde main  the complaint if it exists is of very old standing and wide prevalence including russia scotland new england france iceland germany china and peru  as a proof of the identity of symptoms in this malady we give a chinese case  the chinese as to diabolical possession are precisely of the same opinion as the inspired authors of the gospels  people are possessed and like the woman having a spirit of divination in the acts of the apostles make a good thing out of it  thus mrs ku was approached by a native christian  she became rigid and her demon speaking through her acknowledged the catholic verity and said that if mrs ku were converted he would have to leave  on recovering her everyday consciousness mrs ku asked what tsehwa her demon had said  the christian told her and perhaps she would have deserted her erroneous courses but her fellowvillagers implored her to pay homage to the demon  they were in the habit of resorting to it for medical advice as people do to mrs pipers demon in the united states so mrs ku decided to remain in the business 232  the parallel to the case in the acts is interesting  haunted mrs chang  mr chang of that ilk chang chang tients was a man of fifty seven and a graduate in letters  the ladies of his family having accommodated a demon with a shrine in his house mr chang said he would have none of that nonsense  the spirit then entered into mrs chang and the usual fireraising began all over the place  the furniture and crockery danced in the familiar way and objects took to disappearing mysteriously even when secured under lock and key  mr chang was as unlucky as mr chin  at his house doors would open of their own accord footfalls were heard as of persons walking in the house although no one could be seen  plates bowls and the teapot would suddenly rise from the table into the air 233a  mrs chang now tried the off chance of there being something in christianity stayed with a native christian the narrator and felt much better  she could enjoy her meals and was quite a new woman as her friend could not go home with her mrs fung a native christian resided for a while at mr changs comparative quiet was restored and mrs fung retired to her family  the symptoms returned the native christian was sent for and found mr changs establishment full of buckets of water for extinguishing the sudden fires  mrs changs daughterinlaw was now possessed and drank wine in large quantities though ordinarily she would not touch it  she was staring and tossing her arms wildly a service was held and she soon became her usual self  in the afternoon when the devils went out of the ladies the fowls flew into a state of wild excitement while the swine rushed furiously about and tried to climb a wall  the family have become christians the fires have ceased mr chang is an earnest inquirer but opposed for obvious reasons to any public profession of our religion 233b  in mr nius case strange noises and rappings were frequently heard about the house  the buildings were also set on fire in different places in some mysterious way  the christians tried to convert mr niu but as the devil now possessed his female slave whose success in fortunetelling was extremely lucrative mr niu said that he preferred to leave well alone and remained wedded to his idols 234  we next offer a recent colonial case in which the symptoms as mr pecksniff said were chronic  the great amherst mystery  on 13th february 1888 mr walter hubbell an actor by profession being duly sworn before a notary public in new york testified to the following story  in 1879 he was acting with a strolling company and came to amherst in nova scotia  here he heard of a haunted house known to the local newspapers as the great amherst mystery  having previously succeeded in exposing the frauds of spiritualism mr hubbell determined to investigate the affair of amherst  the haunted house was inhabited by daniel teed the respected foreman in a large shoe factory  under his roof were mrs teed as good a woman as ever lived little willie a baby boy and mrs teeds two sisters jennie a very pretty girl and esther remarkable for large grey eyes pretty little hands and feet and candour of expression  a brother of teeds and a brother of mrs cox made up the family  they were well off and lived comfortably in a detached cottage of two storys  it began when jennie and esther were in bed one night esther jumped up saying that there was a mouse in the bed  next night a green bandbox began to make a rustling noise and then rose a foot in the air several times  on the following night esther felt unwell and was a swelling wisibly before the werry eyes of her alarmed family  reports like thunder peeled through her chamber under a serene sky  next day esther could only eat a small piece of bread and butter and a large green pickle  she recovered slightly in spite of the pickle but four nights later all her and her sisters bedclothes flew off and settled down in a remote corner at jennies screams the family rushed in and found esther fearfully swollen  mrs teed replaced the bedclothes which flew off again the pillow striking john teed in the face  mr teed then left the room observing in a somewhat unscientific spirit that he had had enough of it  the others with a kindness which did them credit sat on the edges of the bed and repressed the desire of the sheets and blankets to fly away  the bed however sent forth peels like thunder when esther suddenly fell into a peaceful sleep  next evening dr carritte arrived and the bolster flew at his head and then went back again under esthers  while paralysed by this phenomenon unprecedented in his practice the doctor heard a metal point scribbling on the wall  examining the place whence the sound proceeded he discovered this inscription  esther cox  you are mine to kill  mr hubbell has verified the inscription and often later recognised the hand in writings which came out of the air and fell at our feet  bits of plaster now gyrated in the room accompanied by peels of local thunder  the doctor admitted that his diagnosis was at fault  next day he visited his patient when potatoes flew at him  he exhibited a powerful sedative but pounding noises began on the roofs and were audible at a distance of 200 yards as the doctor himself told mr hubbell  the clergy now investigated the circumstances which they attributed to electricity  even the most exclusive class frequented mr teeds house till december when esther had an attack of diphtheria  on recovering she went on to visit friends in sackville new brunswick where nothing unusual occurred  on her return the phenomena broke forth afresh and esther heard a voice proclaim that the house would be set on fire  lighted matches then fell from the ceiling but the family extinguished them  the ghost then set a dress on fire apparently as by spontaneous combustion and this kind of thing continued  the heads of the local firebrigade suspected esther of these attempts at arson and dr nathan tupper suggested that she should be flogged  so mr teed removed esther to the house of a mr white  in about a month all as mrs nicklebys lover said was gas and gaiters  the furniture either flew about or broke into flames worse certain pieces of iron placed as an experiment on esthers lap became too hot to be handled with comfort and then flew away  mr hubbell himself now came on the scene and not detecting imposture thought that there was money in it  he determined to run esther as a powerful attraction he lecturing and esther sitting on the platform  it did not pay  the audience hurled things at mr hubbell and these were the only volatile objects  mr hubbell therefore brought esther back to her family at amherst where in esthers absence his umbrella and a large carving knife flew at him with every appearance of malevolence  a great armchair next charged at him like a bull and to say that mr hubbell was awed would indeed seem an inadequate expression of my feelings  the ghosts then thrice undressed little willie in public in derision of his tears and outcries  fireraising followed and that would be a hard heart which could read the tale unmoved  here it is in the simple eloquence of mr hubbell  this was my first experience with bob the demon as a firefiend and i say candidly that until i had had that experience i never fully realised what an awful calamity it was to have an invisible monster somewhere within the atmosphere going from place to place about the house gathering up old newspapers into a bundle and hiding it in the basket of soiled linen or in a closet then go and steal matches out of the matchbox in the kitchen or somebodys pocket as he did out of mine and after kindling a fire in the bundle tell esther that he had started a fire but would not tell where or perhaps not tell her at all in which case the first intimation we would have was the smell of the smoke pouring through the house and then the most intense excitement everybody running with buckets of water  i say it was the most truly awful calamity that could possible befall any family infidel or christian that could be conceived in the mind of man or ghost  and how much more terrible did it seem in this little cottage where all were strict members of church prayed sang hymns and read the bible  poor mrs teed  on mr hubbells remarking that the cat was not tormented she was instantly lifted from the floor to a height of five feet and then dropped on esthers back     i never saw any cat more frightened she ran out into the front yard where she remained for the balance rest of the day  on 27th june a trumpet was heard in the house all day  the rev r a temple now prayed with esther and tried a little amateur exorcism including the use of slips of paper inscribed with habakkuk ii 3  the ghosts cared no more than voltaire for ce coquin dhabacuc  things came to such a pass matches simply raining all round that mr teeds landlord a mr bliss evicted esther  she went to a mr van amburghs and mr teeds cottage was in peace  some weeks later esther was arrested for incendiarism in a barn was sentenced to four months imprisonment but was soon released in deference to public opinion  she married had a family and ceased to be a mystery  this story is narrated with an amiable simplicity and is backed more or less by extracts from amherst and other local newspapers  on making inquiries i found that opinion was divided  some held that esther was a mere impostor and fireraiser from other sources i obtained curious tales of the eccentric flight of objects in her neighbourhood  it is only certain that esthers case is identical with madame shchapoffs and experts in hysteria may tell us whether that malady ever takes the form of setting fire to the patients wardrobe and to things in general 239a  after these modern cases of disturbances we may look at a few old or even ancient examples  it will be observed that the symptoms are always of the same type whatever the date or country  the first is gaelic of last century  donald ban and the bocan 239b  it is fully a hundred years ago since there died in lochaber a man named donald ban sometimes called the son of angus but more frequently known as donald ban of the bocan  this surname was derived from the troubles caused to him by a bocana goblinmany of whose doings are preserved in tradition  donald drew his origin from the honourable house of keppoch and was the last of the hunters of macvicronald  his home was at mounessee and later at inverlaire in glenspean and his wife belonged to the macgregors of rannoch  he went out with the prince and was present at the battle of culloden  he fled from the field and took refuge in a mountain shieling having two guns with him but only one of them was loaded  a company of soldiers came upon him there and although donald escaped by a back window taking the empty gun with him by mistake he was wounded in the leg by a shot from his pursuers  the soldiers took him then and conveyed him to inverness where he was thrown into prison to await his trial  while he was in prison he had a dream he saw himself sitting and drinking with alastair maccholla and donald macronald vor  the latter was the man of whom it was said that he had two hearts he was taken prisoner at falkirk and executed at carlisle  donald was more fortunate than his friend and was finally set free  it was after this that the bocan began to trouble him and although donald never revealed to any man the secret of who the bocan was if indeed he knew it himself yet there were some who professed to know that it was a gillie of donalds who was killed at culloden  their reason for believing this was that on one occasion the man in question had given away more to a poor neighbour than donald was pleased to spare  donald found fault with him and in the quarrel that followed the man said i will be avenged for this alive or dead  it was on the hill that donald first met with the bocan but he soon came to closer quarters and haunted the house in a most annoying fashion  he injured the members of the household and destroyed all the food being especially given to dirtying the butter a thing quite superfluous according to captain burts description of highland butter  on one occasion a certain ronald of aberardair was a guest in donalds house and donalds wife said though i put butter on the table for you tonight it will just be dirtied  i will go with you to the butterkeg said ronald with my dirk in my hand and hold my bonnet over the keg and he will not dirty it this night  so the two went together to fetch the butter but it was dirtied just as usual  things were worse during the night and they could get no sleep for the stones and clods that came flying about the house  the bocan was throwing things out of the walls and they would hear them rattling at the head of donalds bed  the minister came mr john mor macdougall was his name and slept a night or two in the house but the bocan kept away so long as he was there  another visitor angus macalister ban whose grandson told the tale had more experience of the bocans reality  something seized his two big toes and he could not get free any more than if he had been caught by the smiths tongs  it was the bocan but he did nothing more to him  some of the clergy too as well as laymen of every rank were witnesses to the pranks which the spirit carried on but not even donald himself ever saw him in any shape whatever  so famous did the affair become that donald was nearly ruined by entertaining all the curious strangers who came to see the facts for themselves  in the end donald resolved to change his abode to see whether he could in that way escape from the visitations  he took all his possessions with him except a harrow which was left beside the wall of the house but before the party had gone far on the road the harrow was seen coming after them  stop stop said donald if the harrow is coming after us we may just as well go back again  the mystery of the harrow is not explained but donald did return to his home and made no further attempt to escape from his troubles in this way  if the bocan had a spite at donald he was still worse disposed towards his wife the macgregor woman  on the night on which he last made his presence felt he went on the roof of the house and cried are you asleep donald ban  not just now said donald  put out that long grey tether the macgregor wife said he  i dont think ill do that tonight said donald  come out yourself then said the bocan and leave your bonnet  the goodwife thinking that the bocan was outside and would not hear her whispered in donalds ear as he was rising wont you ask him when the prince will come  the words however were hardly out of her mouth when the bocan answered her with didnt you get enough of him before you grey tether  another account says that at this last visit of the bocan he was saying that various other spirits were along with him  donalds wife said to her husband  i should think that if they were along with him they would speak to us but the bocan answered they are no more able to speak than the sole of your foot  he then summoned donald outside as above  i will come said donald and thanks be to the good being that you have asked me  donald was taking his dirk with him as he went out but the bocan said leave your dirk inside donald and your knife as well  donald then went outside and the bocan led him on through rivers and a birchwood for about three miles till they came to the river fert there the bocan pointed out to donald a hole in which he had hidden some ploughirons while he was alive  donald proceeded to take them out and while doing so the two eyes of the bocan were causing him greater fear than anything else he ever heard or saw  when he had got the irons out of the hole they went back to mounessie together and parted that night at the house of donald ban  donald whether naturally or by reason of his ghostly visitant was a religious man and commemorated his troubles in some verses which bear the name of the hymn of donald ban of the bocan  in these he speaks of the common belief that he had done something to deserve all this annoyance and makes mention of the stones and clods which flew about his house in the night time  otherwise the hymn is mainly composed of religious sentiments but its connection with the story makes it interesting and the following is a literal translation of it  the hymn of donald ban  o god that created me so helpless strengthen my belief and make it firm command an angel to come from paradise and take up his abode in my dwelling to protect me from every trouble that wicked folks are putting in my way jesus that didst suffer thy crucifixion restrain their doings and be with me thyself  little wonder though i am thoughtful always at the time when i go to bed the stones and the clods will arise how could a saint get sleep there i am without peace or rest without repose or sleep till the morning o thou that art in the throne of grace behold my treatment and be a guard to me  little wonder though i am troubled so many stories about me in every place some that are unjust will be saying it is all owing to himself that affair judge not except as you know though the son of god were awaking you no one knows if i have deserved more than a rich man that is without care  although i am in trouble at this time verily i shall be doubly repaid when the call comes to me from my saviour i shall receive mercy and new grace i fear no more vexation when i ascend to be with thy saints o thou that sittest on the throne assist my speaking and accept my prayer  o god make me mindful night and day to be praying seeking pardon richly for what i have done on my knees stir with the spirit of truth true repentance in my bosom that when thou sendest death to seek me christ may take care of me  the bocan was not the only inhabitant of the spiritworld that donald ban encountered during his lifetime  a cousin of his mother was said to have been carried off by the fairies and one night donald saw him among them dancing away with all his might  donald was also out hunting in the year of the great snow and at nightfall he saw a man mounted on the back of a deer ascending a great rock  he heard the man saying home donald ban and fortunately he took the advice for that night there fell eleven feet of snow in the very spot where he had intended to stay  we now take two modern icelandic cases for the purpose of leading up to the famous icelandic legend of grettir and glam the vampire from the grettis saga  it is plain that such incidents as those in the two modern icelandic cases however the effects were produced might easily be swollen into the prodigious tale of glam in the course of two or three centuries between grettirs time and the complete formation of his saga  the devil of hjaltastad 246  the sheriff writes  the devil at hjaltastad was outspoken enough this past winter although no one saw him  i along with others had the dishonour to hear him talking for nearly two days during which he addressed myself and the minister sir grim with words the like of which eye hath not seen nor ear heard  as soon as we reached the front of the house there was heard in the door an iron voice saying so hans from eyrar is come now and wishes to talk with me the  idiot  compared with other names that he gave me this might be considered as flattering  when i inquired who it was that addressed me with such words he answered in a fierce voice i was called lucifer at first but now i am called devil and enemy  he threw at us both stones and pieces of wood as well as other things and broke two windows in the ministers room  he spoke so close to us that he seemed to be just at our side  there was an old woman there of the name of opia whom he called his wife and a heavenly blessed soul and asked sir grim to marry them with various other remarks of this kind which i will not recount  i have little liking to write about his ongoings which were all disgraceful and shameful in accordance with the nature of the actor he repeated the pater noster three times answered questions from the catechism and the bible said that the devils held service in hell and told what texts and psalms they had for various occasions he asked us to give him some of the food we had and a drink of tea etc  i asked the fellow whether god was good  he said yes whether he was truthful  he answered not one of his words can be doubted  sir grim asked him whether the devil was goodlooking  he answered  he is far betterlooking than you you  ugly snout  i asked him whether the devils agreed well with each other  he answered in a kind of sobbing voice  it is painful to know that they never have peace  i bade him say something to me in german and said to him lass uns teusc redre sic but he answered as if he had misunderstood me  when we went to bed in the evening he shouted fiercely in the middle of the floor on this night i shall snatch you off to hell and you shall not rise up out of bed as you lay down  during the evening he wished the ministers wife goodnight  the minister and i continued to talk with him during the night among other things we asked him what kind of weather it was outside  he answered  it is cold with a north wind  we asked if he was cold  he answered  i think i am both hot and cold  i asked him how loud he could shout  he said so loud that the roof would go off the house and you would all fall into a dead faint  i told him to try it  he answered  do you think i am come to amuse you you  idiot  i asked him to show us a little specimen  he said he would do so and gave three shouts the last of which was so fearful that i have never heard anything worse and doubt whether i ever shall  towards daybreak after he had parted from us with the usual compliments we fell asleep  next morning he came in again and began to waken up people he named each one by name not forgetting to add some nickname and asking whether soandso was awake  when he saw they were all awake he said he was going to play with the door now and with that he threw the door off its hinges with a sudden jerk and sent it far in upon the floor  the strangest thing was that when he threw anything it went down at once and then went back to its place again so it was evident that he either went inside it or moved about with it  the previous evening he challenged me twice to come out into the darkness to him and this in an angry voice saying that he would tear me limb from limb  i went out and told him to come on but nothing happened  when i went back to my place and asked him why he had not fulfilled his promise he said i had no orders for it from my master  he asked us whether we had ever heard the like before and when we said yes he answered that is not true  the like has never been heard at any time  he had sung the memory of jesus after i arrived there and talked frequently while the word of god was being read  he said that he did not mind this but that he did not like the crossschool psalms and said it must have been a great idiot who composed them  this enemy came like a devil departed as such and behaved himself as such while he was present nor would it befit any one but the devil to declare all that he said  at the same time it must be added that i am not quite convinced that it was a spirit but my opinions on this i cannot give here for lack of time  in another work 249 where the sheriffs letter is given with some variations and additions an attempt is made to explain the story the phenomena were said to have been caused by a young man who had learned ventriloquism abroad  even if this art could have been practised so successfully as to puzzle the sheriff and others it could hardly have taken the door off its hinges and thrown it into the room  it is curious that while jon espolin in his annals entirely discredits the sheriffs letter he yet gives a very similar account of the spirits proceedings  a later story of the same kind also printed by jon arnason i 311 is that of the ghost at garpsdal as related by the minister there sir saemund and written down by another minister on 7th june 1808  the narrative is as follows  the ghost at garpsdal  in autumn 1807 there was a disturbance by night in the outer room at garpsdal the door being smashed  there slept in this room the ministers menservants thorsteinn gudmundsson magnus jonsson and a child named thorstein  later on 16th november a boat which the minister had lying at the seaside was broken in broad daylight and although the blows were heard at the homestead yet no human form was visible that could have done this  all the folks at garpsdal were at home and the young fellow magnus jonsson was engaged either at the sheephouses or about the homestead the spirit often appeared to him in the likeness of a woman  on the 18th of the same month four doors of the sheephouses were broken in broad daylight while the minister was marrying a couple in the church most of his people were present in the church magnus being among them  that same day in the evening this woman was noticed in the sheephouses she said that she wished to get a ewe to roast but as soon as an old woman who lived at garpsdal and was both skilled and wise gudrun jonsdottir by name had handled the ewe its struggles ceased and it recovered again while gudrun was handling the ewe magnus was standing in the door of the house with that one of the rafters was broken and the pieces were thrown in his face  he said that the woman went away just then the ministers horses were close by and at that moment became so scared that they ran straight over smooth ice as though it had been earth and suffered no harm  on the evening of the 20th there were great disturbances panelling and doors being broken down in various rooms  the minister was standing in the house door along with magnus and two or three girls when magnus said to him that the spirit had gone into the sitting room  the minister went and stood at the door of the room and after he had been there a little while talking to the others a pane of glass in one of the room windows was broken  magnus was standing beside the minister talking to him and when the pane broke he said that the spirit had gone out by that  the minister went to the window and saw that the pane was all broken into little pieces  the following evening the 21st the spirit also made its presence known by bangings thumpings and loud noises  on the 28th the ongoings of the spirit surpassed themselves  in the evening a great blow was given on the roof of the sittingroom  the minister was inside at the time but magnus with two girls was out in the barn  at the same moment the partition between the weavingshop and the sittingroom was broken down and then three windows of the room itselfone above the ministers bed another above his writing table and the third in front of the closet door  a piece of a table was thrown in at one of these and a spade at another  at this the household ran out of that room into the loft but the minister sprang downstairs and out the old woman gudrun who was named before went with him and there also came magnus and some of the others  just then a vessel of wash which had been standing in the kitchen was thrown at gudruns head  the minister then ran in along with magnus and the girls and now everything that was loose was flying about both doors and splinters of wood  the minister opened a room near the outer door intending to go in there but just then a sledge hammer which lay at the door was thrown at him but it only touched him on the side and hip and did him no harm  from there the minister and the others went back to the sittingroom where everything was dancing about and where they were met with a perfect volley of splinters of deal from the partitions  the minister then fled and took his wife and child to muli the next farm and left them there as she was frightened to death with all this  he himself returned next day  on the 8th of december the woman again made her appearance in broad daylight  on this occasion she broke the shelves and panelling in the pantry in presence of the minister magnus and others  according to magnus the spirit then went out through the wall at the ministers words and made its way to the byrelane  magnus and gudrun went after it but were received with throwings of mud and dirt  a stone was also hurled at magnus as large as any man could lift while gudrun received a blow on the arm that confined her to her bed for three weeks  on the 26th of the month the shepherd einar jonsson a hardy and resolute fellow commanded the spirit to show itself to him thereupon there came over him such a madness and frenzy that he had to be closely guarded to prevent him from doing harm to himself  he was taken to the house and kept in his bed a watch being held over him  when he recovered his wits he said that this girl had come above his head and assailed him  when he had completely got over this he went away from garpsdal altogether  later than this the ministers horse was found dead in the stable at muli and the folks there said that it was all black and swollen  these are the most remarkable doings of the ghost at garpsdal according to the evidence of sir saemund magnus gudrun and all the household at garpsdal all of whom will confirm their witness with an oath and aver that no human being could have been so invisible there by day and night but rather that it was some kind of spirit that did the mischief  from the story itself it may be seen that neither magnus nor any other person could have accomplished the like and all the folk will confirm this and clear all persons in the matter so far as they know  in this form the story was told to me the subscriber to samuel egilsson and bjarni oddsson by the minister himself and his household at garpsdal 28th may 1808  that this is correctly set down after what the minister sir saemund related to me i witness here at stad on reykjanes 7th june 1808  gisli olafsson        notwithstanding this declaration the troubles at garpsdal were attributed by others to magnus and the name of the garpsdale ghost stuck to him throughout his life  he was alive in 1862 when jon arnasons volume was published  these modern instances lead up to the best story in the world the old icelandic tale of glam      chapter xii the story of glam  the foul fords   the story of glam  there was a man named thorhall who lived at thorhallstead in forsaeladala which lies in the north of iceland  he was a fairly wealthy man especially in cattle so that no one round about had so much livestock as he had  he was not a chief however but an honest and worthy yeoman  now this mans place was greatly haunted so that he could scarcely get a shepherd to stay with him and although he asked the opinion of many as to what he ought to do he could find none to give him advice of any worth  one summer at the althing or yearly assembly of the people thorhall went to the booth of skafti the law man who was the wisest of men and gave good counsel when his opinion was asked  he received thorhall in a friendly way because he knew he was a man of means and asked him what news he had  i would have some good advice from you said thorhall  i am little able to give that said skafti but what is the matter  this is the way of it said thorhall i have had very bad luck with my shepherds of late  some of them get injured and others will not serve out their time and now no one that knows how the case stands will take the place at all  then there must be some evil spirit there said skafti when men are less willing to herd your sheep than those of others  now since you have asked my advice i will get a shepherd for you  glam is his name he belongs to sweden and came out here last summer  he is big and strong but not very well liked by most people  thorhall said that he did not mind that if he looked well after the sheep  skafti answered that there was no hope of other men doing it if glam could not seeing he was so strong and stouthearted  their talk ended there and thorhall left the booth  this took place just at the breaking up of the assembly  thorhall missed two of his horses and went to look for them in person from which it may be seen that he was no proud man  he went up to the mountain ridge and south along the fell that is called armanns fell there he saw a man coming down from the wood leading a horse laden with bundles of brushwood  they soon met each other and thorhall asked his name  he said he was called glam  he was tall of body and of strange appearance his eyes were blue and staring and his hair wolfgrey in colour  thorhall was a little startled when he saw him and was certain that this was the man he had been told about  what work are you best fitted for he asked  glam said that he was good at keeping sheep in winter  will you look after my sheep said thorhall  skafti has put you into my hands  on this condition only will i take service with you said glam that i have my own free will for i am illtempered if anything does not please me  that will not harm me said thorhall and i should like you to come to me  i will do so said glam but is there any trouble at your place  it is believed to be haunted said thorhall  i am not afraid of such bugbears said glam and think that it will be all the livelier for that  you will need all your boldness said thorhall it is best not to be too frightened for ones self there  after this they made a bargain between them and glam was to come when the winter nights began  then they parted and thorhall found his horses where he had just newly looked for them and rode home after thanking skafti for his kindness  the summer passed and thorhall heard nothing of the shepherd nor did any one know the least about him but at the time appointed he came to thorhallstead  the yeoman received him well but the others did not like him and the goodwife least of all  he began his work among the sheep which gave him little trouble for he had a loud hoarse voice and the flock all ran together whenever he shouted there was a church at thorhallstead but glam would never go to it nor join in the service  he was unbelieving surly and difficult to deal with and ever one felt a dislike towards him  so time went on till it came to christmas eve  on that morning glam rose early and called for his food  the goodwife answered  it is not the custom of christian people to eat on this day for tomorrow is the first day of christmas and we ought to fast today  glam replied  you have many foolish fashions that i see no good in  i cannot see that men are any better off now than they were when they never troubled themselves about such things  i think it was a far better life when men were heathens and now i want my food and no nonsense  the goodwife answered  i am sure you will come to sorrow today if you act thus perversely  glam bade her bring his food at once or it would be the worse for her  she was afraid to refuse and after he had eaten he went out in a great rage  the weather was very bad  it was dark and gloomy all round snowflakes fluttered about loud noises were heard in the air and it grew worse and worse as the day wore on  they heard the shepherds voice during the forenoon but less of him as the day passed  then the snow began to drift and by evening there was a violent storm people came to the service in church and the day wore on to evening but still glam did not come home  there was some talk among them of going to look for him but no search was made on account of the storm and the darkness  all christmas eve glam did not return and in the morning men went to look for him  they found the sheep scattered in the fens beaten down by the storm or up on the hills  thereafter they came to a place in the valley where the snow was all trampled as if there had been a terrible struggle there for stones and frozen earth were torn up all round about  they looked carefully round the place and found glam lying a short distance off quite dead  he was black in colour and swollen up as big as an ox  they were horrified at the sight and shuddered in their hearts  however they tried to carry him to the church but could get him no further than to the edge of a cleft a little lower down so they left him there and went home and told their master what had happened  thorhall asked them what had been the cause of glams death  they said that they had traced footprints as large as though the bottom of a cask had been set down in the snow leading from where the trampled place was up to the cliffs at the head of the valley and all along the track there were huge bloodstains  from this they guessed that the evil spirit which lived there must have killed glam but had received so much hurt that it had died for nothing was ever seen of it after  the second day of christmas they tried again to bring glam to the church  they yoked horses to him but after they had come down the slope and reached level ground they could drag him no further and he had to be left there  on the third day a priest went with them but glam was not be found although they searched for him all day  the priest refused to go a second time and the shepherd was found at once when the priest was not present  so they gave over their attempts to take him to the church and buried him on the spot  soon after this they became aware that glam was not lying quiet and great damage was done by him for many that saw him fell into a swoon or lost their reason  immediately after yule men believed that they saw him about the farm itself and grew terribly frightened so that many of them ran away  after this glam began to ride on the housetop by night 259 and nearly shook it to pieces and then he walked about almost night and day  men hardly dared to go up into the valley even although they had urgent business there and every one in the district thought great harm of the matter  in spring thorhall got new men and started the farm again while glams walkings began to grow less frequent as the days grew longer so time went on until it was midsummer  that summer a ship from norway came into hunawater a firth to the north of thorhallstead and had on board a man called thorgaut  he was foreign by birth big of body and as strong as any two men  he was unhired and unmarried and was looking for some employment as he was penniless  thorhall rode to the ship and found thorgaut there  he asked him whether he would enter his service  thorgaut answered that he might well do so and that he did not care much what work he did  you must know however said thorhall that it is not good for any fainthearted man to live at my place on account of the hauntings that have been of late and i do not wish to deceive you in any way  i do not think myself utterly lost although i see some wretched ghosts said thorgaut  it will be no light matter for others if i am scared and i will not throw up the place on that account  their bargain was quickly made and thorgaut was to have charge of the sheep during the winter  the summer went past and thorgaut began his duties with the winter nights and was well liked by every one glam began to come again and rode on the housetop which thorgaut thought great sport and said that the thrall would have to come to close quarters before he would be afraid of him  thorhall bade him not say too much about it  it will be better for you said he if you have no trial of each other  your courage has indeed been shaken out of you said thorgaut but i am not going to fall dead for such talk  the winter went on till christmas came again and on christmas eve the shepherd went out to his sheep  i trust said the goodwife that things will not go after the old fashion  have no fear of that goodwife said thorgaut there will be something worth talking about if i dont come back  the weather was very cold and a heavy drift blowing  thorgaut was in the habit of coming home when it was halfdark but on this occasion he did not return at his usual time  people came to church and they now began to think that things were not unlikely to fall out as they had done before  thorhall wished to make search for the shepherd but the churchgoers refused saying that they would not risk themselves in the hands of evil demons by night and so no search was made  after their morning meal on christmas day they went out to look for the shepherd  they first made their way to glams cairn guessing that he was the cause of the mans disappearance  on coming near to this they saw great tidings for there they found the shepherd with his neck broken and every bone in his body smashed in pieces  they carried him to the church and he did no harm to any man thereafter but glam began to gather strength anew and now went so far in his mischief that every one fled from thorhallstead except the yeoman and his wife  the same cattleman however had been there for a long time and thorhall would not let him leave because he was so faithful and so careful  he was very old and did not want to go away either for he saw that everything his master had would go to wreck and ruin if there was no one to look after it  one morning after the middle of winter the goodwife went out to the byre to milk the cows  it was broad daylight by this time for no one ventured to be outside earlier than that except the cattleman who always went out when it began to grow clear  she heard a great noise and fearful bellowing in the byre and ran into the house again crying out and saying that some awful thing was going on there thorhall went out to the cattle and found them goring each other with their horns  to get out of their way he went through into the barn and in doing this he saw the cattleman lying on his back with his head in one stall and his feet in another  he went up to him and felt him and soon found that he was dead with his back broken over the upright stone between two of the stalls  the yeoman thought it high time to leave the place now and fled from his farm with all that he could remove  all the livestock that he left behind was killed by glam who then went through the whole glen and laid waste all the farms up from tongue  thorhall spent the rest of the winter with various friends  no one could go up into the glen with horse or dog for these were killed at once but when spring came again and the days began to lengthen glams walkings grew less frequent and thorhall determined to return to his homestead  he had difficulty in getting servants but managed to set up his home again at thorhallstead  things went just as before  when autumn came the hauntings began again and now it was the yeomans daughter who was most assailed till in the end she died of fright  many plans were tried but all to no effect and it seemed as if all waterdale would be laid waste unless some remedy could be found  all this befell in the days of grettir the son of asmund who was the strongest man of his day in iceland  he had been abroad at this time outlawed for three years and was only eighteen years of age when he returned  he had been at home all through the autumn but when the winter nights were well advanced he rode north to water dale and came to tongue where lived his uncle jokull  his uncle received him heartily and he stayed there for three nights  at this time there was so much talk about glams walkings that nothing was so largely spoken of as these  grettir inquired closely about all that had happened and jokull said that the stories told no more than had indeed taken place but are you intending to go there kinsman said he  grettir answered that he was  jokull bade him not do so for it is a dangerous undertaking and a great risk for your friends to lose you for in our opinion there is not another like you among the young men and ill will come of ill where glam is  far better it is to deal with mortal men than with such evil spirits  grettir however said that he had a mind to fare to thorhallstead and see how things had been going on there  jokull replied  i see now that it is of no use to hold you back but the saying is true that good luck and good heart are not the same  grettir answered woe stands at one mans door when it has entered anothers house think how it may go with yourself before the end  it may be said jokull that both of us see some way into the future and yet neither of us can do anything to prevent it  after this they parted and neither liked the others forebodings  grettir rode to thorhallstead and the yeoman received him heartily he asked grettir where he was going who said that he wished to stay there all night if he would allow him  thorhall said that he would be very glad if he would stay but few men count it a gain to be guests here for long  you must have heard how matters stand and i shall be very unwilling for you to come to any harm on my account  and even although you yourself escape safe and sound i know for certain that you will lose your horse for no man that comes here can keep that uninjured  grettir answered that there were horses enough to be got whatever might happen to this one  thorhall was delighted that he was willing to stay and gave him the heartiest reception  the horse was strongly secured in an outhouse then they went to sleep and that night passed without glam appearing  your coming here said thorhall has made a happy change for glam is in the habit of riding the house every night or breaking up the doors as you may see for yourself  then one of two things will happen said grettir either he will not restrain himself for long or the hauntings will cease for more than one night  i shall stay for another night and see how things go  after this they went to look at grettirs horse and found that he had not been meddled with so the yeoman thought that everything was going on well grettir stayed another night and still the thrall did not come about them  thorhall thought that things were looking brighter but when he went to look to grettirs horse he found the outhouse broken up the horse dragged outside and every bone in it broken  he told grettir what had happened and advised him to secure his own safety for your death is certain if you wait for glam  grettir answered  the least i can get for my horse is to see the thrall  thorhall replied that it would do him no good to see him for he is unlike anything in human shape but i am fain of every hour that you are willing to stay here  the day wore on and when it was bedtime grettir would not take off his clothes but lay down on the floor over against thorhalls bed closet  he put a thick cloak above himself buttoning one end beneath his feet and doubling the other under his head while he looked out at the hole for the neck  there was a strong plank in front of the floored space and against this he pressed his feet  the door fittings were all broken off from the outer door but there was a hurdle set up instead and roughly secured  the wainscot that had once stretched across the hall was all broken down both above and below the crossbeam  the beds were all pulled out of their places and everything was in confusion  a light was left burning in the hall and when the third part of the night was past grettir heard loud noises outside  then something went up on top of the house and rode above the hall beating the roof with its heels till every beam cracked  this went on for a long time then it came down off the house and went to the door  when this was opened grettir saw the thrall thrust in his head ghastly big he seemed and wonderfully huge of feature  glam came in slowly and raised himself up when he was inside the doorway till he loomed up against the roof then he turned his face down the hall laid his arms on the cross beam and glared all over the place  thorhall gave no sign during all this for he thought it bad enough to hear what was going on outside  grettir lay still and never moved  glam saw that there was a bundle lying on the floor and moved further up the hall and grasped the cloak firmly  grettir placed his feet against the plank and yielded not the least  glam tugged a second time much harder than before but still the cloak did not move  a third time he pulled with both his hands so hard that he raised grettir up from the floor and now they wrenched the cloak asunder between them  glam stood staring at the piece which he held in his hands and wondering greatly who could have pulled so hard against him  at that moment grettir sprang in under the monsters hands and threw his arms around his waist intending to make him fall backwards  glam however bore down upon him so strongly that grettir was forced to give way before him  he then tried to stay himself against the seatboards but these gave way with him and everything that came in their path was broken  glam wanted to get him outside and although grettir set his feet against everything that he could yet glam succeeded in dragging him out into the porch  there they had a fierce struggle for the thrall meant to have him out of doors while grettir saw that bad as it was to deal with glam inside the house it would be worse outside and therefore strove with all his might against being carried out  when they came into the porch glam put forth all his strength and pulled grettir close to him  when grettir saw that he could not stay himself he suddenly changed his plan and threw himself as hard as he could against the monsters breast setting both his feet against an earth fast stone that lay in the doorway  glam was not prepared for this being then in the act of pulling grettir towards him so he fell backwards and went crashing out through the door his shoulders catching the lintel as he fell  the roof of the porch was wrenched in two both rafters and frozen thatch and backwards out of the house went glam with grettir above him  outside there was bright moonshine and broken clouds which sometimes drifted over the moon and sometimes left it clear  at the moment when glam fell the cloud passed off the moon and he cast up his eyes sharply towards it and grettir himself said that this was the only sight he ever saw that terrified him  then grettir grew so helpless both by reason of his weariness and at seeing glam roll his eyes so horribly that he was unable to draw his dagger and lay wellnigh between life and death  but in this was glams might more fiendish than that of most other ghosts that he spoke in this fashion  great eagerness have you shown to meet me grettir and little wonder will it be though you get no great good fortune from me but this i may tell you that you have now received only half of the strength and vigour that was destined for you if you had not met with me  i cannot now take from you the strength you have already gained but this i can see to that you will never be stronger than you are now and yet you are strong enough as many a man shall feel  hitherto you have been famous for your deeds but henceforth you shall be a manslayer and an outlaw and most of your deeds will turn to your own hurt and misfortune  outlawed you shall be and ever have a solitary life for your lot and this too i lay upon you ever to see these eyes of mine before your own and then you will think it hard to be alone and that will bring you to your death  when glam had said this the faintness passed off grettir and he then drew his dagger cut off glams head and laid it beside his thigh thorhall then came out having put on his clothes while glam was talking but never venturing to come near until he had fallen  he praised god and thanked grettir for overcoming the unclean spirit then they set to work and burned glam to ashes which they placed in a sack and buried where cattle were least likely to pasture or men to tread  when this was done they went home again and it was now near daybreak  thorhall sent to the next farm for the men there and told them what had taken place  all thought highly of the exploit that heard of it and it was the common talk that in all iceland there was no man like grettir asnundarson for strength and courage and all kinds of bodily feats  thorhall gave him a good horse when he went away as well as a fine suit of clothes for the ones he had been wearing were all torn to pieces  the two then parted with the utmost friendship  thence grettir rode to the ridge in waterdale where his kinsman thorvald received him heartily and asked closely concerning his encounter with glam  grettir told him how he had fared and said that his strength was never put to harder proof so long did the struggle between them last  thorvald bade him be quiet and gentle in his conduct and things would go well with him otherwise his troubles would be many  grettir answered that his temper was not improved he was more easily roused than ever and less able to bear opposition in this too he felt a great change that he had become so much afraid of the dark that he dared not go anywhere alone after night began to fall for then he saw phantoms and monsters of every kind so it has become a saying ever since then when folk see things very different from what they are that glam lends them his eyes or gives them glamsight  this fear of solitude brought grettir at last to his end  ghosts being seldom dangerous to human life we follow up the homicidal glam with a scottish traditional story of malevolent and murderous sprites  the foul fords or the longformacus farrier  about 1820 there lived a farrier of the name of keane in the village of longformacus in lammermoor  he was a rough passionate man much addicted to swearing  for many years he was farrier to the eagle or spottiswood troop of yeomanry  one day he went to greenlaw to attend the funeral of his sister intending to be home early in the afternoon  his wife and family were surprised when he did not appear as they expected and they sat up watching for him  about two oclock in the morning a heavy weight was heard to fall against the door of the house and on opening it to see what was the matter old keane was discovered lying in a fainting fit on the threshold  he was put to bed and means used for his recovery but when he came out of the fit he was raving mad and talked of such frightful things that his family were quite terrified  he continued till next day in the same state but at length his senses returned and he desired to see the minister alone  after a long conversation with him he called all his family round his bed and required from each of his children and his wife a solemn promise that they would none of them ever pass over a particular spot in the moor between longformacus and greenlaw known by the name of the foul fords it is the ford over a little watercourse just east of castle shields  he assigned no reason to them for this demand but the promise was given and he spoke no more and died that evening  about ten years after his death his eldest son henry keane had to go to greenlaw on business and in the afternoon he prepared to return home  the last person who saw him as he was leaving the town was the blacksmith of spottiswood john michie  he tried to persuade michie to accompany him home which he refused to do as it would take him several miles out of his way  keane begged him most earnestly to go with him as he said he must pass the foul fords that night and he would rather go through hellfire than do so  michie asked him why he said he must pass the foul fords as by going a few yards on either side of them he might avoid them entirely  he persisted that he must pass them and michie at last left him a good deal surprised that he should talk of going over the foul fords when every one knew that he and his whole family were bound by a promise to their dead father never to go by the place  next morning a labouring man from castle shields by name adam redpath was going to his work digging sheepdrains on the moor when on the foul fords he met henry keane lying stone dead and with no mark of violence on his body  his hat coat waistcoat shoes and stockings were lying at about 100 yards distance from him on the greenlaw side of the fords and while his flannel drawers were off and lying with the rest of his clothes his trousers were on  mr ord the minister of longformacus told one or two persons what john keane the father had said to him on his deathbed and by degrees the story got abroad  it was this  keane said that he was returning home slowly after his sisters funeral looking on the ground when he was suddenly roused by hearing the tramping of horses and on looking up he saw a large troop of riders coming towards him two and two  what was his horror when he saw that one of the two foremost was the sister whom he had that day seen buried at greenlaw  on looking further he saw many relations and friends long before dead but when the two last horses came up to him he saw that one was mounted by a dark man whose face he had never seen before  he led the other horse which though saddled and bridled was riderless and on this horse the whole company wanted to compel keane to get  he struggled violently he said for some time and at last got off by promising that one of his family should go instead of him  there still lives at longformacus his remaining son robert he has the same horror of the foul fords that his brother had and will not speak nor allow any one to speak to him on the subject  three or four years ago a herd of the name of burton was found dead within a short distance of the spot without any apparent cause for his death 272      chapter xiii the marvels at froda   the following tale has all the direct simplicity and truth to human nature which mark the ancient literature of iceland  defoe might have envied the profusion of detail the large chest with a lock and the small box and so on  some of the minor portents such as the disturbances among inanimate objects and the appearance of a glow of mysterious light the fate moon recur in modern tales of haunted houses  the combination of christian exorcism then a novelty in iceland with legal proceedings against the ghosts is especially characteristic  the marvels at froda 273  during that summer in which christianity was adopted by law in iceland 1000 ad it happened that a ship came to land at snowfell ness it was a dublin vessel manned by irish and hebrideans with few norsemen on board  they lay there for a long time during the summer waiting for a favourable wind to sail into the firth and many people from the ness went down to trade with them  there was on board a hebridean woman named thorgunna of whom her shipmates said that she owned some costly things the like of which would be difficult to find in iceland  when thurid the housewife at froda heard of this she was very curious to see the articles for she was a woman that was fond of show and finery  she went to the ship and asked thorgunna whether she had any womans apparel that was finer than the common thorgunna said that she had nothing of the kind to sell but had some good things of her own that she might not be affronted at feasts or other gatherings  thurid begged a sight of these and thorgunna showed her treasures  thurid was much pleased with them and thought them very becoming though not of high value  she offered to buy them but thorgunna would not sell  thurid then invited her to come and stay with her because she knew that thorgunna was well provided and thought that she would get the things from her in course of time  thorgunna answered i am well pleased to go to stay with you but you must know that i have little mind to pay for myself because i am well able to work and have no dislike to it though i will not do any dirty work  i must be allowed to settle what i shall pay for myself out of such property as i have  although thorgunna spoke in this fashion yet thurid would have her to go with her and her things were taken out of the ship these were in a large chest with a lock and a small box and both were taken home to froda  when thorgunna arrived there she asked for her bed to be shown her and was given one in the inner part of the hall  then she opened up the chest and took bedclothes out of it  they were all very beautiful and over the bed she spread english coverlets and a silken quilt  out of the chest she also brought a bedcurtain and all the hangings that belonged to it and the whole outfit was so fine that folk thought they had never seen the like of it  then said thurid the housewife  name the price of all your bed clothes and hangings  thorgunna answered i will not lie among straw for you although you are so stately and bear yourself so proudly  thurid was ill pleased at this and offered no more to buy the things  thorgunna worked at clothmaking every day when there was no hay making but when the weather was dry she worked among the dry hay in the home field and had a rake made for herself which she alone was to use  thorgunna was a big woman both broad and tall and very stout she had dark eyebrows and her eyes were close set her hair brown and in great abundance  she was wellmannered in her daily life and went to church every day before beginning her work but she was not of a light disposition nor of many words  most people thought that thorgunna must be in the sixties yet she was a very active woman  at this time one thorir woodenleg and his wife thorgrima charm cheek were being maintained at froda and there was little love between them and thorgunna  the person that she had most ado with was kjartan the son of the house him she loved much but he was rather cold towards her and this often vexed her  kjartan was then fifteen years old and was both big of body and manly in appearance  the summer that year was very wet but in the autumn there came dry days  by this time the haywork at froda was so far advanced that all the home field was mown and nearly the half of it was quite dry there came then a fine dry day clear and bright with not a cloud to be seen in all the sky  thorodd the yeoman rose early in the morning and arranged the work of each one some began to cart off the hay and some to put it into stalks while the women were set to toss and dry it  thorgunna also had her share assigned to her and the work went on well during the day  when it drew near to three in the afternoon a mass of dark clouds was seen rising in the north which came rapidly across the sky and took its course right above the farm they thought it certain that there was rain in the cloud and thorodd bade his people rake the hay together but thorgunna continued to scatter hers in spite of the orders that were given  the clouds came on quickly and when they were above the homestead at froda there came such darkness with them that the people could see nothing beyond the home field indeed they could scarcely distinguish their own hands out of the cloud came so much rain that all the hay which was lying flat was quite soaked  when the cloud had passed over and the sky cleared again it was seen that blood had fallen amid the rain  in the evening there was a good draught and the blood soon dried off all the hay except that which thorgunna had been working at it did not dry nor did the rake that she had been using  thurid asked thorgunna what she supposed this marvel might portend she said that she did not know but it seems to me most likely that it is an evil omen for some person who is present here  in the evening thorgunna went home and took off her clothes which had been stained with the blood then she lay down in her bed and breathed heavily and it was found that she was taken with sickness  the shower had not fallen anywhere else than at froda  all that evening thorgunna would taste no food  in the morning thorodd came to her and asked about her sickness and what end she thought it would have  she answered that she did not expect to have any more illnesses  then she said  i consider you the wisest person in the homestead here and so i shall tell you what arrangements i wish to make about the property that i leave behind me and about myself for things will go as i tell you though you think there is nothing very remarkable about me  it will do you little good to depart from my instructions for this affair has so begun that it will not pass smoothly off unless strong measures are taken in dealing with it  thorodd answered  there seems to me great likelihood that your forebodings will come true and therefore said he i shall promise to you not to depart from your instructions  these are my arrangements said thorgunna that i will have myself taken to skalholt if i die of this sickness for my mind forbodes me that that place will some time or other be the most glorious spot in this land  i know also that by now there are priests there to sing the funeral service over me  so i ask you to have me carried thither and for that you shall take so much of my property that you suffer no loss in the matter  of my other effects thurid shall have the scarlet cloak that i own and i give it her so that she may readily consent to my disposing of all the rest as i please  i have a gold ring and it shall go to the church with me but as for my bed and bedhangings i will have them burned with fire because they will be of service to no one  i do not say this because i grudge that any one should possess these treasures if i knew that they would be of use to them rather am i so earnest in the matter because i should be sorry for folk to fall into such trouble for me as i know will be the case if my words are not heeded  thorodd promised to do as she asked him and after this thorgunnas sickness increased so that she lay but few days before she died  the body was first taken to the church and thorodd had a coffin made for it  on the following day thorodd had all the bedclothes carried out into the open air and made a pile of wood beside them  then thurid the housewife came up and asked what he was going to do with the bed clothes  he answered that he was to burn them with fire as thorgunna had directed him  i will not have such treasures burned said thurid  thorodd answered  she declared strongly that it would not do to depart from what she said  that was mere jealousy said thurid she grudged any other person the use of them and that was why she gave these orders but nothing terrible will happen though her words are set aside  i doubt said he whether it will be well to do otherwise than as she charged me  then thurid laid her arms round his neck and besought him not to burn the furnishings of the bed and so much did she press him in this that his heart gave way to her and she managed it so that thorodd burned the mattresses and pillows while she took for herself the quilt and coverlets and all the hangings  yet neither of them was well pleased  after this the funeral was made ready trustworthy men were sent with the body and good horses which thorodd owned  the body was wrapped in linen but not sewed up in it and then laid in the coffin  after this they held south over the heath as the paths go and went on until they came to a farm called lower ness which lies in the tongues of stafholt  there they asked leave to stay over night but the farmer would give them no hospitality  however as it was close on nightfall they did not see how they could go on for they thought it would be dangerous to deal with the white river by night  they therefore unloaded their horses and carried the body into an out house after which they went into the sittingroom and took off their outer clothes intending to stay there over night without food  the people of the house were going to bed by daylight and after they were in bed a great noise was heard in the kitchen  some went to see whether thieves had not broken in and when they reached the kitchen they saw there a tall woman  she was quite naked with no clothes whatever upon her and was busy preparing food  those who saw her were so terrified that they dared not go near her at all  when the funeral party heard of this they went thither and saw what the matter wasthorgunna had come there and it seemed advisable to them all not to meddle with her  when she had done all that she wanted she brought the food into the room set the tables and laid the food upon them  then the funeral party said to the farmer  it may happen in the end before we part that you will think it dearly bought that you would show us no hospitality  both the farmer and the housewife answered  we will willingly give you food and do you all other services that you require  as soon as the farmer had offered them this thorgunna passed out of the room into the kitchen and then went outside nor did she show herself again  then a light was kindled in the room and the wet clothes of the guests were taken off and dry ones given them in their place  after this they sat down at table and blessed their food while the farmer had holy water sprinkled over all the house  the guests ate their food and it harmed no man although thorgunna had prepared it  they slept there that night and were treated with great hospitality  in the morning they continued their journey and things went very smoothly with them wherever this affair was heard of most people thought it best to do them all the service that they required and of their journey no more is to be told  when they came to skalholt they handed over the precious things which thorgunna had sent thither  the ring and other articles all of which the priests gladly received thorgunna was buried there while the funeral party returned home which they all reached in safety  at froda there was a large hall with a fireplace in the midde and a bedcloset at the inner end of it as was then the custom  at the outer end were two storeclosets one on each side dried fish were piled in one of these and there was meal in the other  in this hall fires were kindled every evening as was the custom and folk sat round these fires for a long while before they went to supper  on that evening on which the funeral party came home while the folk at froda were sitting round the fires they saw a halfmoon appear on the panelling of the hall and it was visible to all those who were present  it went round the room backwards and against the suns course nor did it disappear so long as they sat by the fires thorodd asked thorir woodenleg what this might portend  it is the moon of fate said thorir and deaths will come after it  this went on all that week that the fatemoon came in every evening  the next tidings that happened at froda were that the shepherd came in and was very silent he spoke little and that in a frenzied manner folk were most inclined to believe that he had been bewitched because he went about by himself and talked to himself  this went on for some time but one evening when two weeks of winter had passed the shepherd came home went to his bed and lay down there  when they went to him in the morning he was dead and was buried at the church  soon after this there began great hauntings  one night thorir wooden leg went outside and was at some distance from the door  when he was about to go in again he saw that the shepherd had come between him and the door  thorir tried to get in but the shepherd would not allow him  then thorir tried to get away from him but the shepherd followed him caught hold of him and threw him down at the door  he received great hurt from this but was able to reach his bed there he turned black as coal took sickness and died  he was also buried at the church there and after this both the shepherd and thorir were seen in company at which all the folk became full of fear as was to be expected  this also followed upon the burial of thorir that one of thorodds men grew ill and lay three nights before he died then one died after another until six of them were gone  by this time the christmas fast had come although the fast was not then kept in iceland  the store closet in which the dried fish were kept was packed so full that the door could not be opened the pile reached nigh up to the rafters and a ladder was required to get the fish off the top of it  one evening while the folk were sitting round the fires the fish were torn but when search was made no living thing could be found there  during the winter a little before christmas thorodd went out to ness for the fish he had there there were six men in all in a tenoared boat and they stayed out there all night  the same evening that thorodd went from home it happened at froda when folk went to sit by the fires that had been made that they saw a seals head rise up out of the fireplace  a maidservant was the first who came forward and saw this marvel she took a washingbat which lay beside the door and struck the seals head with this but it rose up at the blow and gazed at thorgunnas bedhangings  then one of the men went up and beat the seal but it rose higher at every blow until it had come up above the fins then the man fell into a swoon and all those who were present were filled with fear  then the lad kjartan sprang forward took up a large iron sledgehammer and struck at the seals head it was a heavy blow but it only shook its head and looked round  then kjartan gave it stroke after stroke and the seal went down as though he were driving in a stake  kjartan hammered away till the seal went down so far that he beat the floor close again above its head and during the rest of the winter all the portents were most afraid of kjartan  next morning while thorodd and the others were coming in from ness with the fish they were all lost out from enni the boat and the fish drove on shore there but the bodies were never found  when the news of this reached froda kjartan and thurid invited their neighbours to the funeral banquet and the ale prepared for christmas was used for this purpose  the first evening of the feast however after the folk had taken their seats there came into the hall thorodd and his companions all dripping wet  the folk greeted thorodd well thinking this a good omen for at that time it was firmly believed that drowned men who came to their own funeral feast were well received by ran the seagoddess and the old beliefs had as yet suffered little though folk were baptised and called christians  thorodd and his fellows went right along the hall where the folk sat and passed into the one where the fires were answering no mans greeting  those of the household who were in the hall ran out and thorodd and his men sat down beside the fires where they remained till they had fallen into ashes then they went away again  this befel every evening while the banquet lasted and there was much talk about it among those who were present  some thought that it would stop when the feast was ended  when the banquet was over the guests went home leaving the place very dull and dismal  on the evening after they had gone the fires were kindled as usual and after they had burned up there came in thorodd with his company all of them wet  they sat down by the fire and began to wring their clothes and after they had sat down there came in thorir woodenleg and his five companions all covered with earth  they shook their clothes and scattered the earth on thorodd and his fellows  the folk of the household rushed out of the hall as might be expected and all that evening they had no light nor any warmth from the fire  next evening the fires were made in the other hall as the dead men would be less likely to come there but this was not so for everything happened just as it had done on the previous evening and both parties came to sit by the fires  on the third evening kjartan advised that a large fire should be made in the hall and a little fire in another and smaller room  this was done and things then went on in this fashion that thorodd and the others sat beside the big fire while the household contented themselves with the little one and this lasted right through christmastide  by this time there was more and more noise in the pile of fish and the sound of them being torn was heard both by night and day  some time after this it was necessary to take down some of the fish and the man who went up on the pile saw this strange thing that up out of the pile there came a tail in appearance like a singed oxtail  it was black and covered with hair like a seal  the man laid hold of it and pulled and called on the others to come and help him  others then got up on the heap both men and women and pulled at the tail but all to no purpose  it seemed to them that the tail was dead but while they tugged at it it flew out of their hands taking the skin off the palms of those who had been holding it hardest and no more was ever seen of the tail  the fish were then taken up and every one was found to be torn out of the skin yet no living thing was to be found in the pile  following upon this thorgrima charmcheek the wife of thorir wooden leg fell ill and lay only a little while before she died and the same evening that she was buried she was seen in company with her husband thorir  the sickness then began a second time after the tail had been seen and now the women died more than the men  another six persons died in this attack and some fled away on account of the ghosts and the hauntings  in the autumn there had been thirty in the household of whom eighteen were dead and five had run away leaving only seven behind in the spring  when these marvels had reached this pitch it happened one day that kjartan went to helgafell to see his uncle snorri and asked his advice as to what should be done  there had then come to helgafell a priest whom gizurr the white had sent to snorri and this priest snorri sent to froda along with kjartan his son thord and six other men  he also gave them this advice that they should burn all thorgunnas bedhangings and hold a law court at the door and there prosecute all those men who were walking after death  he also bade the priest hold service there consecrate water and confess the people  they summoned men from the nearest farms to accompany them and arrived at froda on the evening before candlemas just at the time when the fires were being kindled  thurid the housewife had then taken the sickness after the same fashion as those who had died kjartan went in at once and saw that thorodd and the others were sitting by the fire as usual  he took down thorgunnas bedhangings went into the hall and carried out a live coal from the fire  then all the bedgear that thorgunna had owned was burned  after this kjartan summoned thorir woodenleg and thord summoned thorodd on the charge of going about the homestead without leave and depriving men of both health and life all those who sat beside the fire were summoned in the same way  then a court was held at the door in which the charges were declared and everything done as in a regular law court opinions were given the case summed up and judgment passed  after sentence had been pronounced on thorir wooden leg he rose up and said  now we have sat as long as we can bear after this he went out by the other door from that at which the court was held  then sentence was passed on the shepherd and when he heard it he stood up and said  now i shall go and i think it would have been better before  when thorgrima heard sentence pronounced on her she rose up and said  now we have stayed while it could be borne then one after another was summoned and each stood up as judgment was given upon him all of them said something as they went out and showed that they were loath to part  finally sentence was passed on thorodd himself and when he heard it he rose and said  little peace i find here and let us all flee now and went out after that then kjartan and the others entered and the priest carried holy water and sacred relics over all the house  later on in the day he held solemn service and after this all the hauntings and ghostwalkings at froda ceased while thurid recovered from her sickness and became well again      chapter xiv   spiritualistic floating hands  hands in haunted houses  jerome cardans tale  the cold hand  the beachcombers tale  the black dogs and the thumbless hand  the pakeha maori and the leprous hand  the hand of the ghost that bit  hands all round  nothing was more common in the seances of home the medium than the appearance of spirit hands  if these were made of white kid gloves stuffed the idea at least was borrowed from ghost stories in which ghostly hands with no visible bodies are not unusual  we see them in the shchapoff case at rerrick and in other haunted houses  here are some tales of hands old or new  the cold hand  jerome cardan the famous physician tells the following anecdote in his de rerum varietate lib x 93  jerome only once heard a rapping himself at the time of the death of a friend at a distance  he was in a terrible fright and dared not leave his room all day  a story which my father used often to tell  i was brought up he said in the house of joannes resta and therein taught latin to his three sons when i left them i supported myself on my own means  it chanced that one of these lads while i was studying medicine fell deadly sick he being now a young man grown and i was called in to be with the youth partly for my knowledge of medicine partly for old friendships sake  the master of the house happened to be absent the patient slept in an upper chamber one of his brothers and i in a lower room the third brother isidore was not at home  each of the rooms was next to a turret turrets being common in that city  when we went to bed on the first night of my visit i heard a constant knocking on the wall of the room  what is that i said  dont be afraid it is only a familiar spirit said my companion they call them follets it is harmless enough and seldom so troublesome as it is now  i dont know what can be the matter with it  the young fellow went to sleep but i was kept awake for a while wondering and observing  after half an hour of stillness i felt a thumb press on my head and a sense of cold  i kept watching the forefinger the middle finger and the rest of the hand were next laid on the little finger nearly reaching my forehead  the hand was like that of a boy of ten to guess by the size and so cold that it was extremely unpleasant  meantime i was chuckling over my luck in such an opportunity of witnessing a wonder and i listened eagerly  the hand stole with the ring finger foremost over my face and down my nose it was slipping into my mouth and two fingertips had entered when i threw it off with my right hand thinking it was uncanny and not relishing it inside my body  silence followed and i lay awake distrusting the spectre more or less  in about half an hour it returned and repeated its former conduct touching me very lightly yet very chilly  when it reached my mouth i again drove it away though my lips were tightly closed i felt an extreme icy cold in my teeth  i now got out of bed thinking this might be a friendly visit from the ghost of the sick lad upstairs who must have died  as i went to the door the thing passed before me rapping on the walls  when i was got to the door it knocked outside when i opened the door it began to knock on the turret  the moon was shining i went on to see what would happen but it beat on the other sides of the tower and as it always evaded me i went up to see how my patient was  he was alive but very weak  as i was speaking to those who stood about his bed we heard a noise as if the house was falling  in rushed my bedfellow the brother of the sick lad half dead with terror  when you got up he said i felt a cold hand on my back  i thought it was you who wanted to waken me and take me to see my brother so i pretended to be asleep and lay quiet supposing that you would go alone when you found me so sound asleep  but when i did not feel you get up and the cold hand grew to be more than i could bear i hit out to push your hand away and felt your place emptybut warm then i remembered the follet and ran upstairs as hard as i could put my feet to the ground  never was i in such a fright  the sick lad died on the following night  here carden the elder stopped and jerome his son philosophised on the subject  miss dendy on the authority of mr elijah cope an itinerant preacher gives this anecdote of similar familiarity with a follet in staffordshire        fairies  i went into a farmhouse to stay a night and in the evening there came a knocking in the room as if some one had struck the table i jumped up  my hostess got up and goodnight says she im off but what was it says i  just a poor old fairy says she old nancy  shes a poor old thing been here ever so long lost her husband and her children its bad to be left like that all alone  i leave a bit o cake on the table for her and sometimes she fetches it and sometimes she dont  the black dog and the thumbless hand  some years ago i published in a volume of tales called the wrong paradise a paper styled my friend the beachcomber  this contained genuine adventures of a kinsman my oldest and most intimate friend who has passed much of his life in the pacific mainly in a foreign colony and in the wild new hebrides  my friend is a man of education an artist and a student of anthropology and ethnology engaged on a work of scientific research he has not committed any of his innumerable adventures warlike or wandering to print  the following yarn he sent to me lately in a letter on some points of native customs  of course the description of the beachcomber in the book referred to is purely fictitious  the yarn of the thumbless hand is here cast in a dialogue but the whole of the strange experience described is given in the words of the narrator  it should be added that though my friend was present at some amateur seances in a remote isle of the sea he is not a spiritualist never was one and has no theory to account for what occurred and no belief in spooks of any description  his faith is plighted to the theories of mr darwin and that is his only superstition  the name of the principal character in the yarn is of course fictitious  the real name is an old but not a noble one in england  have the natives the custom of walking through fire said my friend the beachcomber in answer to a question of mine  not that i know of  in fact the soles of their feet are so thickskinned that they would think nothing of it  then have they any spiritualistic games like the burmans and maories  i have a lot of yarns about them  they are too jolly well frightened of bush spirits to invite them to tea said the beachcomber  i knew a fellow who got a bit of land merely by whistling up and down in it at nightfall 292  they think spirits whistle  no i dont fancy they go in for seances  but we once had some we white men in one of the islands  not the ouiouis native name for the french real white men  and that led to bolters row with me  what about  oh about his young woman  i told her the story it was thoughtless and yet i dont know that i was wrong  after all bolter could not have been a comfortable fellow to marry  in this opinion readers of the beachcombers narrative will probably agree i fancy  bad moral character  not that i know of  queer fish kept queer company  even if she was ever so fond of dogs i dont think a girl would have cared for bolters kennel  not in her bedroom anyway  but she could surely have got him to keep them outside however doggy he was  he was not doggy a bit  i dont know that bolter ever saw the black dogs himself  he certainly never told me so  it is that beastly thumbless hand no woman could have stood it not to mention the chance of catching cold when it pulled the blankets off  what on earth are you talking about  i can understand a man attended by black dogs that nobody sees but himself  the catholics tell it of john knox and of another reformer a fellow called smeaton moreover it is common in delirium tremens  but you say bolter didnt see the dogs  no not so far as he told me but i did and other fellows when with bolter  bolter was asleep he didnt see anything  also the hand which was a good deal worse  i dont know if he ever saw it  but he was jolly nervous and he had heard of it  the habits of the beachcomber are absolutely temperate otherwise my astonishment would have been less and i should have regarded all these phenomena as subjective  tell me about it all old cock i said  im sure i told you last time i was at home  never my memory for yarns is only too good  i hate a chestnut  well here goes  mind you i dont profess to explain the thing only i dont think i did wrong in telling the young woman for however you account for it it was not nice  a good many years ago there came to the island as a clerk un nomme bolter english or jew  his name is not jewish  no and i really dont know about his breed  the most curious thing about his appearance was his eyes  they were large black and had a peculiar dull dead lustre  did they shine in the dark  i knew a fellow at oxford whose eyes did  chairs ran after him  i never noticed i dont remember  psychically as you superstitious muffs call it bolter was still more queer  at that time we were all gone on spiritrapping  bolter turned out a great acquisition medium or what not  mind you im not saying bolter was straight  in the dark hed tell you what you had in your hand exact time of your watch and so on  i didnt take stock in this and one night brought some photographs with me and asked for a description of them  this he gave correctly winding up by saying the one nearest your body is that of   here my friend named a person well known to both of us whose name i prefer not to introduce here  this person i may add had never been in or near the island and was totally unknown to bolter  of course my friend went on the photographs were all the time inside my pocket  now really bolter had some mystic power of seeing in the dark  hyperaesthesia said i  hypercriticism said the beachcomber  what happened next might be hyperaesthesiai suppose you mean abnormal intensity of the sensesbut how could hyperaesthesia see through a tweed coat and lining  well what happened next  bolters firm used to get sheep by every mail from  and send them regularly to their station six miles off  one time they landed late in the afternoon and yet were foolishly sent off bolter in charge i said at the time he would lose half the lot as it would be dark long before he could reach the station  he didnt lose them  next day i met one of the niggers who was sent to lend him a hand and asked results  master said the nigger bolter is a devil  he sees at night when the sheep ran away to right or left in the dark he told us where to follow  he heard them i suppose said i  maybe but you must be sharp to have sharper senses than these niggers  anyhow that was not bolters account of it  when i saw him and spoke to him he said simply yes that when excited or interested to seek or find anything in obscurity the object became covered with a dim glow of light which rendered it visible  but things in a pocket  that also said he  curious isnt it  probably the rontgen rays are implicated therein eh  did you ever read dr gregorys letters on animal magnetism  the cove that invented gregorys mixture  yes  beast he must have been  no i never read him  he says that major buckleys hypnotised subjects saw hidden objects in a blue lightmottoes inside a nut for example  rontgen rays for a fiver  but bolter said nothing about seeing blue light  well after three or four seances bolter used to be very nervous and unwilling to sleep alone so i once went with him to his oneroomed hut  we turned into the same bed  i was awakened later by a noise and movement in the room  found the door open the full moon streaming in making light like day and the place full of great big black dogswell anyhow there were four or five  they were romping about seemingly playing  one jumped on the bed another rubbed his muzzle on mine the bed was low and i slept outside now i never had anything but love for dogs of any kind and asnest ce paslove casts out fear i simply got up turned them all out shut the door and turned in again myself  of course my idea was that they were flesh and blood and i allude to physical fear  i slept but was anew awakened by a ghastly feeling that the blanket was being dragged and creeping off the bed  i pulled it up again but anew began the slow movement of descent  rather surprised i pulled it up afresh and held it and must have dozed off as i suppose  awoke to feel it being pulled again it was slipping slipping and then with a sudden violent jerk it was thrown on the floor  il faut dire that during all this i had glanced several times at bolter who seemed profoundly asleep  but now alarmed i tried to wake him  in vain he slept like the dead his face always a pasty white now like marble in the moonlight  after some hesitation i put the blanket back on the bed and held it fast  the pulling at once began and increased in strength and i by this time thoroughly alarmed put all my strength against it and hung on like grim death  to get a better hold i had taken a turn over my head or perhaps simply to hide when suddenly i felt a pressure outside on my body and a movement like fingersthey gradually approached my head  mad with fear i chucked off the blanket grasped a hand gazed on it for one moment in silent horror and threw it away  no wonder it was attached to no arm or body it was hairy and dark coloured the fingers were short blunt with long clawlike nails and it was minus a thumb  too frightened to get up i had to stop in bed and i suppose fell to sleep again after fresh vain attempts to awaken bolter  next morning i told him about it  he said several men who had thus passed the night with him had seen this hand  but added he its lucky you didnt have the big black dogs also  tableau  i was to have slept again with him next night to look further into the matter but a friend of his came from  that day so i could not renew the experiment as i had fully determined to do  bythebye i was troubled for months after by the same feeling that the clothes were being pulled off the bed  and thats the yarn of the black dogs and the thumbless hand  i think said i that you did no harm in telling bolters young woman  i never thought of it when i told her or of her interest in the kennel but by george she soon broke off her engagement  did you know manning the pakeha maori the fellow who wrote old new zealand  no what about him  he did not put it in his book but he told the same yarn without the dogs as having happened to himself  he saw the whole arm and the hand was leprous  ugh said the beachcomber  next morning he was obliged to view the body of an old maori who had been murdered in his garden the night before  that old mans hand was the hand he saw  i know a room in an old house in england where plucking off the bedclothes goes on every now and then and has gone on as long as the present occupants have been there  but i only heard lately and they only heard from me that the same thing used to occur in the same room and no other in the last generation when another family lived there  anybody see anything  no only footsteps are heard creeping up before the twitches come off  and what do the people do  nothing  we set a camera once to photograph the spook  he did not sit  its rum said the beachcomber  but mind you as to spooks i dont believe a word of it 299  the ghost that bit  the idiot scotch laird in the story would not let the dentist put his fingers into his mouth for im feared yell bite me  the following anecdote proves that a ghost may entertain a better founded alarm on this score  a correspondent of notes and queries 3rd sept 1864 is responsible for the narrative given almost verbatim from the lips of the lady herself a person of tried veracity  emma s one of seven children was sleeping alone with her face towards the west at a large house near c in the staffordshire moorlands  as she had given orders to her maid to call her at an early hour she was not surprised at being awakened between three and four on a fine august morning in 1840 by a sharp tapping at her door when in spite of a thank you i hear to the first and second raps with the third came a rush of wind which caused the curtains to be drawn up in the centre of the bed  she became annoyed and sitting up called out marie what are you about  instead however of her servant she was astonished to see the face of an aunt by marriage peering above and between the curtains and at the same momentwhether unconsciously she threw forward her arms or whether they were drawn forward as it were in a vortex of air she cannot be sureone of her thumbs was sensibly pressed between the teeth of the apparition though no mark afterwards remained on it all this notwithstanding she remained collected and unalarmed but instantly arose dressed and went downstairs where she found not a creature stirring  her father on coming down shortly afterwards naturally asked what had made her rise so early rallied her on the cause and soon afterwards went on to his sisterinlaws house where he found that she had just unexpectedly died  coming back again and not noticing his daughters presence in the room in consequence of her being behind a screen near the fire he suddenly announced the event to his wife as being of so remarkable a character that he could in no way account for it  as may be anticipated emma overhearing this unlookedfor denouement of her dream at once fell to the ground in a fainting condition  on one of the thumbs of the corpse was found a mark as if it had been bitten in the death agony 300  we have now followed the ghostly from its

now called mental telegraphy or telepathy is quite an old idea  bacon calls it sympathy between two distant minds sympathy so strong that one communicates with the other without using the recognised channels of the senses  izaak walton explains in the same way dr donnes vision in paris of his wife and dead child if two lutes are strung to an exact harmony and one is struck the other sounds argues walton  two minds may be as harmoniously attuned and communicate each with each  of course in the case of the lutes there are actual vibrations physical facts  but we know nothing of vibrations in the brain which can traverse space to another brain  many experiments have been made in consciously transferring thoughts or emotions from one mind to another  these are very liable to be vitiated by bad observation collusion and other causes  meanwhile intercommunication between mind and mind without the aid of the recognised sensesa supposed process of telepathyis a current explanation of the dreams in which knowledge is obtained that exists in the mind of another person and of the delusion by virtue of which one person sees another who is perhaps dying or in some other crisis at a distance  the idea is popular  a poor highland woman wrote to her son in glasgow  dont be thinking too much of us or i shall be seeing you some evening in the byre  this is a simple expression of the hypothesis of
