72368458	to be read at dusk     one two three four five  there were five of them  five couriers sitting on a bench outside the convent on the summit of the great st bernard in switzerland looking at the remote heights stained by the setting sun as if a mighty quantity of red wine had been broached upon the mountain top and had not yet had time to sink into the snow  this is not my simile  it was made for the occasion by the stoutest courier who was a german  none of the others took any more notice of it than they took of me sitting on another bench on the other side of the convent door smoking my cigar like them and  also like them  looking at the reddened snow and at the lonely shed hard by where the bodies of belated travellers dug out of it slowly wither away knowing no corruption in that cold region  the wine upon the mountain top soaked in as we looked the mountain became white the sky a very dark blue the wind rose and the air turned piercing cold  the five couriers buttoned their rough coats  there being no safer man to imitate in all such proceedings than a courier i buttoned mine  the mountain in the sunset had stopped the five couriers in a conversation  it is a sublime sight likely to stop conversation the mountain being now out of the sunset they resumed  not that i had heard any part of their previous discourse for indeed i had not then broken away from the american gentleman in the travellers parlour of the convent who sitting with his face to the fire had undertaken to realise to me the whole progress of events which had led to the accumulation by the honourable ananias dodger of one of the largest acquisitions of dollars ever made in our country  my god said the swiss courier speaking in french which i do not hold as some authors appear to do to be such an all sufficient excuse for a naughty word that i have only to write it in that language to make it innocent if you talk of ghosts    but i dont talk of ghosts said the german  of what then asked the swiss  if i knew of what then said the german i should probably know a great deal more  it was a good answer i thought and it made me curious  so i moved my position to that corner of my bench which was nearest to them and leaning my back against the convent wall heard perfectly without appearing to attend  thunder and lightning said the german warming when a certain man is coming to see you unexpectedly and without his own knowledge sends some invisible messenger to put the idea of him into your head all day what do you call that  when you walk along a crowded street  at frankfort milan london paris  and think that a passing stranger is like your friend heinrich and then that another passing stranger is like your friend heinrich and so begin to have a strange foreknowledge that presently youll meet your friend heinrich  which you do though you believed him at trieste  what do you call that  its not uncommon either murmured the swiss and the other three  uncommon said the german  its as common as cherries in the black forest  its as common as maccaroni at naples  and naples reminds me  when the old marchesa senzanima shrieks at a card party on the chiaja  as i heard and saw her for it happened in a bavarian family of mine and i was overlooking the service that evening  i say when the old marchesa starts up at the cardtable white through her rouge and cries my sister in spain is dead  i felt her cold touch on my back  and when that sister is dead at the moment  what do you call that  or when the blood of san gennaro liquefies at the request of the clergy  as all the world knows that it does regularly once ayear in my native city said the neapolitan courier after a pause with a comical look what do you call that  that cried the german  well i think i know a name for that  miracle said the neapolitan with the same sly face  the german merely smoked and laughed and they all smoked and laughed  bah said the german presently  i speak of things that really do happen  when i want to see the conjurer i pay to see a professed one and have my moneys worth  very strange things do happen without ghosts  ghosts  giovanni baptista tell your story of the english bride  theres no ghost in that but something full as strange  will any man tell me what  as there was a silence among them i glanced around  he whom i took to be baptista was lighting a fresh cigar  he presently went on to speak  he was a genoese as i judged  the story of the english bride said he  basta one ought not to call so slight a thing a story  well its all one  but its true  observe me well gentlemen its true  that which glitters is not always gold but what i am going to tell is true  he repeated this more than once   ten years ago i took my credentials to an english gentleman at longs hotel in bond street london who was about to travel  it might be for one year it might be for two  he approved of them likewise of me  he was pleased to make inquiry  the testimony that he received was favourable  he engaged me by the six months and my entertainment was generous  he was young handsome very happy  he was enamoured of a fair young english lady with a sufficient fortune and they were going to be married  it was the weddingtrip in short that we were going to take  for three months rest in the hot weather it was early summer then he had hired an old place on the riviera at an easy distance from my city genoa on the road to nice  did i know that place  yes i told him i knew it well  it was an old palace with great gardens  it was a little bare and it was a little dark and gloomy being close surrounded by trees but it was spacious ancient grand and on the seashore  he said it had been so described to him exactly and he was well pleased that i knew it for its being a little bare of furniture all such places were for its being a little gloomy he had hired it principally for the gardens and he and my mistress would pass the summer weather in their shade  so all goes well baptista said he  indubitably signore very well  we had a travelling chariot for our journey newly built for us and in all respects complete  all we had was complete we wanted for nothing  the marriage took place  they were happy  i was happy seeing all so bright being so well situated going to my own city teaching my language in the rumble to the maid la bella carolina whose heart was gay with laughter  who was young and rosy  the time flew  but i observed  listen to this i pray and here the courier dropped his voice  i observed my mistress sometimes brooding in a manner very strange in a frightened manner in an unhappy manner with a cloudy uncertain alarm upon her  i think that i began to notice this when i was walking up hills by the carriage side and master had gone on in front  at any rate i remember that it impressed itself upon my mind one evening in the south of france when she called to me to call master back and when he came back and walked for a long way talking encouragingly and affectionately to her with his hand upon the open window and hers in it  now and then he laughed in a merry way as if he were bantering her out of something  byandby she laughed and then all went well again  it was curious  i asked la bella carolina the pretty little one was mistress unwell  no  out of spirits  no  fearful of bad roads or brigands  no  and what made it more mysterious was the pretty little one would not look at me in giving answer but would look at the view  but one day she told me the secret  if you must know said carolina i find from what i have overheard that mistress is haunted  how haunted  by a dream  what dream  by a dream of a face  for three nights before her marriage she saw a face in a dream  always the same face and only one  a terrible face  no  the face of a dark remarkablelooking man in black with black hair and a grey moustache  a handsome man except for a reserved and secret air  not a face she ever saw or at all like a face she ever saw  doing nothing in the dream but looking at her fixedly out of darkness  does the dream come back  never  the recollection of it is all her trouble  and why does it trouble her  carolina shook her head  thats masters question said la bella  she dont know  she wonders why herself  but i heard her tell him only last night that if she was to find a picture of that face in our italian house which she is afraid she will she did not know how she could ever bear it  upon my word i was fearful after this said the genoese courier of our coming to the old palazzo lest some such illstarred picture should happen to be there  i knew there were many there and as we got nearer and nearer to the place i wished the whole gallery in the crater of vesuvius  to mend the matter it was a stormy dismal evening when we at last approached that part of the riviera  it thundered and the thunder of my city and its environs rolling among the high hills is very loud  the lizards ran in and out of the chinks in the broken stone wall of the garden as if they were frightened the frogs bubbled and croaked their loudest the seawind moaned and the wet trees dripped and the lightning  body of san lorenzo how it lightened  we all know what an old palace in or near genoa is  how time and the sea air have blotted it  how the drapery painted on the outer walls has peeled off in great flakes of plaster  how the lower windows are darkened with rusty bars of iron  how the courtyard is overgrown with grass  how the outer buildings are dilapidated  how the whole pile seems devoted to ruin  our palazzo was one of the true kind  it had been shut up close for months  months  years  it had an earthy smell like a tomb  the scent of the orange trees on the broad back terrace and of the lemons ripening on the wall and of some shrubs that grew around a broken fountain had got into the house somehow and had never been able to get out again  there was in every room an aged smell grown faint with confinement  it pined in all the cupboards and drawers  in the little rooms of communication between great rooms it was stifling if you turned a picture  to come back to the pictures  there it still was clinging to the wall behind the frame like a sort of bat  the latticeblinds were close shut all over the house  there were two ugly grey old women in the house to take care of it one of them with a spindle who stood winding and mumbling in the doorway and who would as soon have let in the devil as the air  master mistress la bella carolina and i went all through the palazzo i went first though i have named myself last opening the windows and the latticeblinds and shaking down on myself splashes of rain and scraps of mortar and now and then a dozing mosquito or a monstrous fat blotchy genoese spider  when i had let the evening light into a room master mistress and la bella carolina entered  then we looked round at all the pictures and i went forward again into another room  mistress secretly had great fear of meeting with the likeness of that face  we all had but there was no such thing  the madonna and bambino san francisco san sebastiano venus santa caterina angels brigands friars temples at sunset battles white horses forests apostles doges all my old acquaintances many times repeated  yes  dark handsome man in black reserved and secret with black hair and grey moustache looking fixedly at mistress out of darkness  no  at last we got through all the rooms and all the pictures and came out into the gardens  they were pretty well kept being rented by a gardener and were large and shady  in one place there was a rustic theatre open to the sky the stage a green slope the coulisses three entrances upon a side sweetsmelling leafy screens  mistress moved her bright eyes even there as if she looked to see the face come in upon the scene but all was well  now clara master said in a low voice you see that it is nothing  you are happy  mistress was much encouraged  she soon accustomed herself to that grim palazzo and would sing and play the harp and copy the old pictures and stroll with master under the green trees and vines all day  she was beautiful  he was happy  he would laugh and say to me mounting his horse for his morning ride before the heat  all goes well baptista  yes signore thank god very well  we kept no company  i took la bella to the duomo and annunciata to the cafe to the opera to the village festa to the public garden to the day theatre to the marionetti  the pretty little one was charmed with all she saw  she learnt italian  heavens miraculously  was mistress quite forgetful of that dream i asked carolina sometimes  nearly said la bella  almost  it was wearing out  one day master received a letter and called me  baptista  signore  a gentleman who is presented to me will dine here today  he is called the signor dellombra  let me dine like a prince  it was an odd name  i did not know that name  but there had been many noblemen and gentlemen pursued by austria on political suspicions lately and some names had changed  perhaps this was one  altro  dellombra was as good a name to me as another  when the signor dellombra came to dinner said the genoese courier in the low voice into which he had subsided once before i showed him into the receptionroom the great sala of the old palazzo master received him with cordiality and presented him to mistress as she rose her face changed she gave a cry and fell upon the marble floor  then i turned my head to the signor dellombra and saw that he was dressed in black and had a reserved and secret air and was a dark remarkablelooking man with black hair and a grey moustache  master raised mistress in his arms and carried her to her own room where i sent la bella carolina straight  la bella told me afterwards that mistress was nearly terrified to death and that she wandered in her mind about her dream all night  master was vexed and anxious  almost angry and yet full of solicitude  the signor dellombra was a courtly gentleman and spoke with great respect and sympathy of mistresss being so ill the african wind had been blowing for some days they had told him at his hotel of the maltese cross and he knew that it was often hurtful  he hoped the beautiful lady would recover soon  he begged permission to retire and to renew his visit when he should have the happiness of hearing that she was better  master would not allow of this and they dined alone  he withdrew early  next day he called at the gate on horseback to inquire for mistress  he did so two or three times in that week  what i observed myself and what la bella carolina told me united to explain to me that master had now set his mind on curing mistress of her fanciful terror  he was all kindness but he was sensible and firm  he reasoned with her that to encourage such fancies was to invite melancholy if not madness  that it rested with herself to be herself  that if she once resisted her strange weakness so successfully as to receive the signor dellombra as an english lady would receive any other guest it was for ever conquered  to make an end the signore came again and mistress received him without marked distress though with constraint and apprehension still and the evening passed serenely  master was so delighted with this change and so anxious to confirm it that the signor dellombra became a constant guest  he was accomplished in pictures books and music and his society in any grim palazzo would have been welcome  i used to notice many times that mistress was not quite recovered  she would cast down her eyes and droop her head before the signor dellombra or would look at him with a terrified and fascinated glance as if his presence had some evil influence or power upon her  turning from her to him i used to see him in the shaded gardens or the large halflighted sala looking as i might say fixedly upon her out of darkness  but truly i had not forgotten la bella carolinas words describing the face in the dream  after his second visit i heard master say  now see my dear clara its over  dellombra has come and gone and your apprehension is broken like glass  will he  will he ever come again asked mistress  again  why surely over and over again  are you cold she shivered  no dear  but  he terrifies me  are you sure that he need come again  the surer for the question clara replied master cheerfully  but he was very hopeful of her complete recovery now and grew more and more so every day  she was beautiful  he was happy  all goes well baptista he would say to me again  yes signore thank god very well  we were all said the genoese courier constraining himself to speak a little louder we were all at rome for the carnival  i had been out all day with a sicilian a friend of mine and a courier who was there with an english family  as i returned at night to our hotel i met the little carolina who never stirred from home alone running distractedly along the corso  carolina  whats the matter  o baptista  o for the lords sake where is my mistress  mistress carolina  gone since morning  told me when master went out on his days journey not to call her for she was tired with not resting in the night having been in pain and would lie in bed until the evening then get up refreshed  she is gone  she is gone master has come back broken down the door and she is gone  my beautiful my good my innocent mistress  the pretty little one so cried and raved and tore herself that i could not have held her but for her swooning on my arm as if she had been shot  master came up  in manner face or voice no more the master that i knew than i was he  he took me i laid the little one upon her bed in the hotel and left her with the chamberwomen in a carriage furiously through the darkness across the desolate campagna  when it was day and we stopped at a miserable posthouse all the horses had been hired twelve hours ago and sent away in different directions  mark me by the signor dellombra who had passed there in a carriage with a frightened english lady crouching in one corner  i never heard said the genoese courier drawing a long breath that she was ever traced beyond that spot  all i know is that she vanished into infamous oblivion with the dreaded face beside her that she had seen in her dream  what do you call that said the german courier triumphantly ghosts  there are no ghosts there  what do you call this that i am going to tell you  ghosts  there are no ghosts here   i took an engagement once pursued the german courier with an english gentleman elderly and a bachelor to travel through my country my fatherland  he was a merchant who traded with my country and knew the language but who had never been there since he was a boy  as i judge some sixty years before  his name was james and he had a twinbrother john also a bachelor  between these brothers there was a great affection they were in business together at goodmans fields but they did not live together  mr james dwelt in poland street turning out of oxford street london mr john resided by epping forest  mr james and i were to start for germany in about a week  the exact day depended on business  mr john came to poland street where i was staying in the house to pass that week with mr james  but he said to his brother on the second day i dont feel very well james  theres not much the matter with me but i think i am a little gouty  ill go home and put myself under the care of my old housekeeper who understands my ways  if i get quite better ill come back and see you before you go  if i dont feel well enough to resume my visit where i leave it off why you will come and see me before you go  mr james of course said he would and they shook hands  both hands as they always did  and mr john ordered out his oldfashioned chariot and rumbled home  it was on the second night after that  that is to say the fourth in the week  when i was awoke out of my sound sleep by mr james coming into my bedroom in his flannelgown with a lighted candle he sat upon the side of my bed and looking at me said  wilhelm i have reason to think i have got some strange illness upon me  i then perceived that there was a very unusual expression in his face  wilhelm said he i am not afraid or ashamed to tell you what i might be afraid or ashamed to tell another man  you come from a sensible country where mysterious things are inquired into and are not settled to have been weighed and measured  or to have been unweighable and unmeasurable  or in either case to have been completely disposed of for all time  ever so many years ago  i have just now seen the phantom of my brother  i confess said the german courier that it gave me a little tingling of the blood to hear it  i have just now seen mr james repeated looking full at me that i might see how collected he was the phantom of my brother john  i was sitting up in bed unable to sleep when it came into my room in a white dress and regarding me earnestly passed up to the end of the room glanced at some papers on my writingdesk turned and still looking earnestly at me as it passed the bed went out at the door  now i am not in the least mad and am not in the least disposed to invest that phantom with any external existence out of myself  i think it is a warning to me that i am ill and i think i had better be bled  i got out of bed directly said the german courier and began to get on my clothes begging him not to be alarmed and telling him that i would go myself to the doctor  i was just ready when we heard a loud knocking and ringing at the street door  my room being an attic at the back and mr jamess being the secondfloor room in the front we went down to his room and put up the window to see what was the matter  is that mr james said a man below falling back to the opposite side of the way to look up  it is said mr james and you are my brothers man robert  yes sir  i am sorry to say sir that mr john is ill  he is very bad sir  it is even feared that he may be lying at the point of death  he wants to see you sir  i have a chaise here  pray come to him  pray lose no time  mr james and i looked at one another  wilhelm said he this is strange  i wish you to come with me  i helped him to dress partly there and partly in the chaise and no grass grew under the horses iron shoes between poland street and the forest  now mind said the german courier i went with mr james into his brothers room and i saw and heard myself what follows  his brother lay upon his bed at the upper end of a long bed chamber  his old housekeeper was there and others were there  i think three others were there if not four and they had been with him since early in the afternoon  he was in white like the figure  necessarily so because he had his nightdress on  he looked like the figure  necessarily so because he looked earnestly at his brother when he saw him come into the room  but when his brother reached the bedside he slowly raised himself in bed and looking full upon him said these words  james you have seen me before tonight  and you know it  and so died   i waited when the german courier ceased to hear something said of this strange story  the silence was unbroken  i looked round and the five couriers were gone  so noiselessly that the ghostly mountain might have absorbed them into its eternal snows  by this time i was by no means in a mood to sit alone in that awful scene with the chill air coming solemnly upon me  or if i may tell the truth to sit alone anywhere  so i went back into the convent parlour and finding the american gentleman still disposed to relate the biography of the honourable ananias dodger heard it all out
