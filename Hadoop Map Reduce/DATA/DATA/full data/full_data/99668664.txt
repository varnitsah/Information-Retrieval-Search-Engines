99668664	twice bought by rm ballantyne    chapter one  honesty is the best policy tom you may depend on it said a youth to his companion one afternoon as they walked along the margin of one of those brawling rivulets which born amid the snows of the rocky mountain peaks run a wild and plunging course of many miles before finding comparative rest in the celebrated goldfields of oregon  i dont agree with you fred said tom sternly and i dont believe in the proverb you have quoted  the worlds maxims are not all gospel  you are right tom many of them are false nevertheless some are founded on gospel truth  it matters not returned tom angrily  i have made up my mind to get back from that big thief gashford what he has stolen from me for it is certain that he cheated at play though i could not prove it at the time  it is impossible to get it back by fair means and i hold it quite allowable to steal from a thief especially when that which you take is your own  fred westly shook his head but did not reply  many a time had he reasoned with his friend tom brixton about the sin of gambling and urged him to be content with the result of each days digging for gold but his words had no effect  young brixton had resolved to make a fortune rapidly  he laboured each day with pick and shovel with the energy of a hero and the dogged perseverance of a navvy and each night he went to lantrys store to increase his gains by gambling  as a matter of course his luck as he called it varied  sometimes he returned to the tent which he shared with his friend westly depressed out of humour and emptyhanded  at other times he made his appearance flushed with successoccasionally also with drinkand flung down a heavy bag of golden nuggets as the result of his evenings play ultimately when under the influence of drink he staked all that he had in the world except his clothes and tools to a man named gashford who was noted for his size strength of body and utter disregard of god and man  as brixton said gashford had cheated him at play and this had rendered the ruined man unusually savage  the sun was down when the two friends entered their tent and began to pull off their muddy boots while a little man in a blue flannel shirt and a brown wideawake busied himself in the preparation of supper  what have you got for us tonight paddy asked westly  salt pork it is said the little man looking up with a most expressive grin the best o victuals when theres nothin better bein in a luxurious frame o mind when i was up at the store i bought a few splitpays for seasonin but it comes hard on a man to spind his gould on sitch things when his lucks down  youve not done much today i see by the looks of ye  right paddy said tom brixton with a harsh laugh weve done nothingabsolutely nothing  see there is my days work  he pulled three small grains of gold each about the size of a pea from his trousers pocket and flung them contemptuously into a washingpan at his elbow  sure we wont make our fortins fast at that rate said paddy or patrick flinders  this wont help it much said westly with a mingled smile and sigh as he added a small nugget and a little golddust to the pile  ah then havent i forgot the shuggar for the tay but ive not got far to go for to get it  just kape stirrin the pot mister westly ill be back in a minit  tom said westly when their comrade had gone out dont give way to angry feelings  do try like a good fellow to look at things in a philosophical light since you object to a religious one  rightly or wrongly gashford has won your gold  well take heart and dig away you know i have saved a considerable sum the half of which is at your service to  do you suppose interrupted the other sharply that i will consent to become a beggar  no replied westly but there is no reason why you should not consent to accept an offer when it is made to you by an old chum  besides i offer the money on loan the only condition being that you wont gamble it away  fred returned brixton impressively i must gamble with it if i take it  i can no more give up gambling than i can give up drinking im a doomed man my boy doomed to be either a millionaire or a madman  the glittering eyes and wild expression of the youth while he spoke induced his friend to fear that he was already the latter  oh  tom my dear fellow he said god did not doom you  if your doom is fixed you have yourself fixed it  now fred returned the other impatiently dont bore me with your religious notions  religion is all very well in the old country but it wont work at all here at the diggins  my experience has proved the contrary returned westly for religionor rather godhas saved me from drink and gaming  if it be god who has saved you why has he not saved me demanded brixton  because that mysterious and incomprehensible power of free will stands in your way  in the exercise of your free will you have rejected god therefore the responsibility rests with yourself  if you will now call upon him life will by his holy spirit enable you to accept salvation through jesus christ  no use fred no use said tom shaking his head  when you and i left england three years ago i might have believed and trusted as you do but its too late nowtoo late i say so dont worry me with your solemn looks and sermons  my minds made up i tell you  with these three paltry little lumps of gold ill gamble at the store tonight with gashford  ill double the stake every game  if i win wellif not ill  he stopped abruptly because at that moment paddy flinders reentered with the sugar possibly also because he did not wish to reveal all his intentions  that night there was more noise drinking and gambling than usual at lantrys store several of the miners having returned from a prospecting trip into the mountains with a considerable quantity of gold  loudest among the swearers deepest among the drinkers and most reckless among the gamblers was gashford the bully as he was styled he had just challenged any one present to play when brixton entered the room  we will each stake all that we own on a single chance he said looking round  come thats fair aint it for you know ive got lots of dust  there was a general laugh but no one would accept the challengewhich brixton had not heardthough he heard the laugh that followed  many of the diggers especially the poorer ones would have gladly taken him up if they had not been afraid of the consequences if successful  well boys i couldnt make a fairer offerall i possess against all that any other man owns though it should only be half an ounce of gold said the bully tossing off a glass of spirits  done  i accept your challenge cried tom brixton stepping forward  you exclaimed gashford with a look of contempt why youve got nothing to stake  i cleaned you out yesterday  i have this to stake said tom holding out the three little nuggets of gold which he had found that day  it is all that i possess and it is more than half an ounce which you mentioned as the lowest youd play for  well ill stick to what i said growled gashford if it be half an ounce  come lantry get out your scales  the storekeeper promptly produced the little balance which he used for weighing golddust and the diggers crowded round with much interest to watch while lantry with a show of unwonted care dusted the scales and put the three nuggets therein  threequarters of an ounce said the storekeeper when the balance ceased to vibrate  come along then an lets have another glass of grog for luck cried gashford striking his huge fist on the counter  a throw of the dice was to decide the matter  while lantry who was appointed to make the throw rattled the dice in the box the diggers crowded round in eager curiosity for besides the unusual disparity between the stakes there was much probability of a scene of violence as the result brixton having displayed a good deal of temper when he lost to the bully on the previous day  lost exclaimed several voices in disappointed tones when the dice fell on the table  whos lost cried those in the rear of the crowd  tom brixton to be sure answered gashford with a laugh  he always loses but its no great loss this time and i am not much the richer  there was no response to this sally  every one looked at brixton expecting an outburst of rage but the youth stood calmly contemplating the dice with an absent look and a pleasant smile on his lips  yes he said recovering himself luck is indeed against me  but never mind  lets have a drink lantry youll have to give it me on credit this time  lantry professed himself to be quite willing to oblige an old customer to that extent  he could well afford it he said and it was unquestionable truth that he uttered for his charges were exorbitant  that night when the camp was silent in repose and the revellers were either steeped in oblivion or wandering in golden dreams tom brixton sauntered slowly down to the river at a point where it spread out into a lakelet in which the moon was brightly reflected  the overhanging cliffs fringed with underwood and crowned with trees shot reflections of ebony blackness here and there down into the water while beyond through several openings could be seen a varied and beautiful landscape backed and capped by the snowpeaks of the great backbone of america  it was a scene fitted to solemnise and soften but it had no such influence on tom brixton who did not give it even a passing thought though he stood with folded arms and contracted brows gazing at it long and earnestly  after a time he began to mutter to himself in broken sentences  fred is mistakenmust be mistaken  there is no law here  law must be taken into ones own hands  it cannot be wrong to rob a robber  it is not robbery to take back ones own  foul means are admissible when fairyet it is a sneaking thing to do  ha who said it was sneaking  he started and thrust his hands through his hair bah lantry your grog is too fiery  it was the grog that spoke not conscience  pooh  i dont believe in conscience  come tom dont be a fool but go andmother  what has she got to do with it  lantrys firewater didnt bring her to my mind  no it is fred confound him  hes always suggesting what she would say in circumstances which she has never been in and could not possibly understand  and he worries me on the plea that he promised her to stick by me through evil report and good report  i suppose that means through thick and thin  well hes a good fellow is fred but weak  yes ive made up my mind to do it and i will do it  he turned hastily as he spoke and was soon lost in the little belt of woodland that lay between the lake and the miners camp  it pleased gashford to keep his gold in a huge leathern bag which he hid in a hole in the ground within his tent during the day and placed under his pillow during the night  it pleased him also to dwell and work alone partly because he was of an unsociable disposition and partly to prevent men becoming acquainted with his secrets  there did not seem to be much fear of the big miners secrets being discovered for lynch law prevailed in the camp at that time and it was well known that death was the usual punishment for theft  it was also well known that gashford was a splendid shot with the revolver as well as a fierce unscrupulous man  but strong drink revealed that which might have otherwise been safe  when in his cups gashford sometimes became boastful and gave hints now and then which were easily understood  still his gold was safe for apart from the danger of the attempt to rob the bully it would have been impossible to discover the particular part of his tentfloor in which the hole was dug and as to venturing to touch his pillow while his shaggy head rested on it no one was daring enough to contemplate such an act although there were men there capable of doing almost anything  here again however strong drink proved to be the big miners foe occasionally though not often gashford drank so deeply as to become almost helpless and after lying down in his bed sank into a sleep so profound that it seemed as if he could not have been roused even with violence  he was in this condition on the night in which his victim made up his mind to rob him  despair and brandy had united to render brixton utterly reckless so much so that instead of creeping stealthily towards his enemys tent an act which would probably have aroused the suspicion of a light sleeper he walked boldly up entered it raised gashfords unconscious head with one hand pulled out the bag of gold with the other put it on his shoulder and coolly marched out of the camp  the audacity of the deed contributed largely to its success  great was the rage and consternation of gashford when he awoke the following morning and found that his treasure had disappeared  jumping at once to the conclusion that it had been stolen by brixton he ran to that youths tent and demanded to know where the thief had gone to  what do you mean by the thief asked fred westly with misgiving at his heart  i mean your chum tom brixton shouted the enraged miner  how do you know hes a thief asked westly  i didnt come here to be asked questions by you said gashford where has he gone to i say  i dont know  thats a lie roared the miner clenching his fist in a threatening manner  poor tom  i wish i did know where you have gone said fred shaking his head sadly as he gazed on the floor and taking no notice whatever of the threatening action of his visitor  look here now westly said gashford in a low suppressed voice shutting the curtain of the tent and drawing a revolver from his pocket you know something about this matter and you know me  if you dont tell me all you know and where your chum has bolted to ill blow your brains out as sure as theres a god in heaven  i thought said westly quietly and without the slightest symptom of alarm you held the opinion that there is no god and no heaven  come young fellow none o your religious chaff but answer my question  nothing is farther from my thoughts than chaffing you returned westly gently and if the mere mention of gods name is religion then you may claim to be one of the most religious men at the diggings for you are constantly praying him to curse people  i have already answered your question and can only repeat that i dont know where my friend brixton has gone to  but let me ask in turn what has happened to you  there was no resisting the earnest sincerity of freds look and tone to say nothing of his cool courage  gashford felt somewhat abashed in spite of himself  what has happened to me he repeated bitterly  the worst that could happen has happened  my gold has been stolen and your chum is the man who has cribbed it  i know that as well as if i had seen him do it but ill hunt him down and have it out of him with interest with interest mark youif i should have to go to the ends o the arth to find him  without another word gashford thrust the revolver into his pocket flung aside the tent curtain and strode away  meanwhile tom brixton with the gold in a gamebag slung across his shoulder was speeding down the valley or mountain gorge at the head of which the pine tree diggings lay with all the vigour and activity of youthful strength but with none of the exultation that might be supposed to characterise a successful thief  on the contrary a weight like lead seemed to lie on his heart and the faces of his mother and his friend fred westly seemed to flit before him continually gazing at him with sorrowful expression  as the fumes of the liquor which he had drunk began to dissipate the shame and depression of spirit increased and his strength great though it was began to give way  by that time however he had placed many a mile between him and the camp where he had committed the robbery  the valley opened into a wide almost boundless stretch of comparatively level land covered here and there with forests so dense that once concealed in their recesses it would be exceedingly difficult if not impossible for white men to trace him especially men who were so little acquainted with woodcraft as the diggers  besides this the region was undulating in form here and there so that from the tops of many of the eminences he could see over the whole land and observe the approach of enemies without being himself seen  feeling therefore comparatively safe he paused in his mad flight and went down on hands and knees to take a long drink at a bubbling spring rising refreshed with a deep sigh he slowly mounted to the top of a knoll which was bathed at the time in the first beams of the rising sun  from the spot he obtained a view of intermingled forest prairie lake and river so resplendent that even his mind was for a moment diverted from its gloomy introspections and a glance of admiration shot from his eyes and chased the wrinkles from his brow but the frown quickly returned and the glorious landscape was forgotten as the thought of his dreadful condition returned with overwhelming power  up to that day tom brixton with all his faults had kept within the circle of the worlds laws  he had been well trained in boyhood and with the approval of his mother had left england for the oregon goldfields in company with a steady wellprincipled friend who had been a playmate in early childhood and at school  the two friends had experienced during three years the varying fortune of a diggers life sometimes working for long periods successfully and gradually increasing their pile at other times toiling day after day for nothing and living on their capital but on the whole making what men called a good thing of it until tom took to gambling which almost as a matter of course led to drinking  the process of demoralisation had continued until as we have seen the boundary line was at last overstepped and he had become a thief and an outlaw  at that period and in those diggings judge lynchin other words offhand and speedy justice by the community of minerswas the order of the day and as stealing had become exasperatingly common the penalty appointed was death the judges being in most cases the prompt executioners  tom brixton knew well what his fate would be if captured and this unquestionably filled him with anxiety but it was not this thought that caused him as he reclined on the sunny knoll to spurn the bag of gold with his foot  trash he exclaimed bitterly repeating the kick  but the love of gold had taken deep root in the fallen youths heart after a brief rest he arose slung the trash over his shoulder and descending the knoll quickly disappeared in the glades of the forests    chapter two  while brixton was hurrying with a guilty conscience deeper and deeper into the dark woods which covered the spur of the mountains in the neighbourhood of pine tree diggings glancing back nervously from time to time as if he expected the pursuers to be close at his heels an enemy was advancing to meet him in front of whom he little dreamed  a brown bear either enjoying his morning walk or on the lookout for breakfast suddenly met him face to face and stood up on its hind legs as if to have a good look at him  tom was no coward indeed he was gifted with more than an average amount of animal courage  he at once levelled his rifle at the creatures breast and fired  the bear rushed at him nevertheless as if uninjured  drawing his revolver tom discharged two shots before the monster reached him  all three shots had taken effect but bears are noted for tenacity of life and are frequently able to fight a furious battle after being mortally wounded  the rifle ball had touched its heart and the revolver bullets had gone deep into its chest yet it showed little sign of having been hurt  knowing full well the fate that awaited him if he stood to wrestle with a bear the youth turned to run but the bear was too quick for him  it struck him on the back and felled him to the earth  strange to say at that moment tom brixtons illgotten gains stood him in good stead  there can be no question that the bears tremendous claws would have sunk deep into the youths back and probably broken his spine if they had not been arrested by the bag of gold which was slung at his back  although knocked down and slightly stunned brixton was still unwounded and even in the act of falling had presence of mind to draw his long knife and plunge it up to the haft in the creatures side at the same time twisting himself violently round so as to fall on his back and thus face the foe  in this position partly owing to the form of the ground the bear found it difficult to grasp its opponent in its awful embrace but it held him with its claws and seized his left shoulder with its teeth  this rendered the use of the revolver impossible but fortunately brixtons right arm was still free and he drove the keen knife a second time deep into the animals sides  whether mortal or not the wound did not immediately kill  tom felt that his hour was come and a deadly fear came over him as the thought of death his recent life and judgment flashed through his brain  he drew out the knife however to make another desperate thrust  the bears great throat was close over his face  he thought of its jugular vein and made a deadly thrust at the spot where he imagined that to run  instantly a flood of warm blood deluged his face and breast at the same time he felt as if some dreadful weight were pressing him to death then consciousness forsook him  while this desperate fight was going on the miners of pine tree camp were scouring the woods in all directions in search of the fugitive  as we have said great indignation was felt at that time against thieves because some of them had become very daring and cases of theft were multiplying  severe penalties had been imposed on the culprits by the rest of the community without curing the evil  at last death was decided on as the penalty for any act of theft however trifling it might be  that these men were in earnest was proved by the summary execution of the next two offenders who were caught  immediately after that thieving came to an abrupt end insomuch that if you had left a bag of gold on an exposed place men would have gone out of their way to avoid it  one can understand therefore the indignation that was roused in the camp when tom brixton revived the practice in such a cool and impudent manner  it was felt that despite his being a favourite with many of the diggers he must be made an example  pursuit was therefore organised on an extensive scale and in a methodical manner  among others his friend fred westly took part in it  it cost those diggers something thus to give up the exciting work of goldfinding for a chase that promised to occupy time and tax perseverance  some of them even refused to join in it but on the whole the desire for vengeance seemed general  bully gashford as he did not object to be called was in virtue of his size energy and desperate character tacitly appointed leader  indeed he would have assumed that position if it had not been accorded to him for he was made of that stuff which produces either heroes of the highest type or scoundrels of the deepest dye  he arranged that the pursuers should proceed in a body to the mouth of the valley and there dividing into several parties scatter themselves abroad until they should find the thiefs trail and then follow it up  as the miners were not much accustomed to following trails they engaged the services of several indians who chanced to be at the camp at that time  what direction dye think its likely your precious chum has taken asked gashford turning abruptly to fred westly when the different parties were about to start  it is impossible for me to tell  i know that retorted gashford with a scowl and something of a sneer but it aint impossible for you to guess  however it will do as well if you tell me which party you intend to join  i shall join that which goes to the southwest replied westly  well then i will join that which goes to the southeast returned the bully shouldering his rifle  go ahead you red reptile he added giving a sign to the indian at the head of the party he had selected to lead  the indian at once went off at a swinging walk amounting almost to a trot  the others followed suit and the forest soon swallowed them all in its dark embrace  in making this selection gashford had fallen into a mistake not uncommon among scoundrelsthat of judging other men by themselves  he knew that westly was fond of his guilty friend and concluded that he would tell any falsehood or put the pursuers on any false scent that might favour his escape  he also guessedand he was fond of guessingthat fred would answer his question by indicating the direction which he thought it most probable his friend had not taken  in these guesses he was only to a small extent right  westly did indeed earnestly hope that his friend would escape for he deemed the intended punishment of death most unjustly severe and knowing intimately the character and tendencies of tom brixtons mind and tastes he had a pretty shrewd guess as to the direction he had taken but so far from desiring to throw the pursuers off the scent his main anxiety was to join the party which he thought most likely to find the fugitiveif they should find him at allin order that he might be present to defend him from sudden or unnecessary violence  of course paddy flinders went with the same party and we need scarcely add that the little irishman sympathised with fred  dee think its likely well cotch im he asked in a whisper on the evening of that day as they went rapidly through the woods together a little in rear of their party  it is difficult to say answered westly  i earnestly hope not indeed i think not for tom has had a good start but the search is well organised and there are bloodthirsty indignant and persevering men among the various parties who wont be easily baffled  still tom is a splendid runner  we may depend on having a long chase before we come up with him  ah then its glad i am that ye think so sor returned paddy for ive been afeard mister tom hadnt got quite so much go in him since he tuk to gambling and drinkin  look here paddy exclaimed his companion stopping abruptly and pointing to the ground are not these the footprints of one of your friends  sure its a bar said the little man going down on his knees to examine the footprints in question with deep interest  flinders was a remarkably plucky little man and one of his great ambitions was to meet with a bear when alone and slay it singlehanded  his ambition had not up to that time been gratified fortunately for himself for he was a bad shot and exceedingly reckless two qualities which would probably have insured his own destruction if he had had his wish  lets go after it mister westly he said springing to his feet with an excited look  nonsense it is probably miles off by this time besides we should lose our party  niver a taste sor we could soon overhaul them agin  an wont they have to camp at sundown anyhow  moreover if we dont come up wi the bar in a mile or so we can give it up  no no paddy we must not fall behind  at least i must not but you may go after it alone if you choose  well i will sor  sure its not ivery day i git the chance an theres no fear o ye overhaulin mister tom this night  well have to slape over it ill be bound  just tell the boys ill be after them in no time  so saying paddy shouldered his rifle felt knife and axe to make sure of their being safe in his belt and strode away in the track of the bear  he had not gone above a quarter of a mile when he came to the spot where the mortal combat had taken place and found tom brixton and the bear deadas he imaginedon the bloodstained turf  he uttered a mighty cry partly to relieve his feelings and partly to recall his friend  the imprudence of this flashed upon him when too late for others besides fred might have heard him  but tom brixton was not dead  soon after the dying bear had fallen on him he recovered consciousness and shaking himself clear of the carcass with difficulty had arisen but giddiness returning he lay down and while in this position overcome with fatigue had fallen asleep  paddys shout aroused him  with a sense of deadly peril hanging over him he leaped up and sprang on the irishman  hallo paddy he cried checking himself and endeavouring to wipe from his face some of the clotted blood with which he had been deluged you here  are you alone  its wishin that i was replied the little man looking round anxiously  mister fred ll be here drectly soranan i hope thatll be all  but its alive ye are is it  an didnt i take ye for dead  oh  mister brixton theres more blood on an about ye i do belave than yer whole body could howld  before an answer could be returned fred westly having heard paddys shout came running up  oh  tom tom he cried eagerly are you hurt  can you walk  can you run  the whole camp is out after you  indeed replied the fugitive with a frown  it would seem that even my friends have joined in the chase  we have said the other hurriedly but not to captureto save if possible  come tom can you make an effort  are you hurt much  you are so horribly covered with blood  he stopped short for at that moment a shout was heard in the distance it was replied to in another direction nearer at hand  there happened to be a man in the party which westly had joined named crossby  he had suffered much from thieves and had a particular spite against brixton because he had lost to him at play  he had heard paddy flinderss unfortunate shout and immediately ran in the direction whence it came while others of the party having discovered the fugitives track had followed it up  too late groaned fred on hearing crossbys voice  not too late for this growled brixton bitterly as he quickly loaded his rifle  for gods sake dont do that tom cried his friend earnestly as he laid his hand on his arm but tom shook him off and completed the operation just as crossby burst from the bushes and ran towards them seeing the fugitive standing ready with rifle in hand he stopped at once took rapid aim and fired  the ball whistled close past the head of tom who then raised his own rifle took deliberate aim and fired but westly threw up the muzzle and the bullet went high among the treetops  with an exclamation of fury brixton drew his knife while crossby rushed at him with his rifle clubbed  the digger was a strong and fierce man and there would doubtless have been a terrible and fatal encounter if fred had not again interfered he seized his friend from behind and whirling him sharply round received on his own shoulder the blow which was meant for toms head fred fell dragging his friend down with him  flinders who witnessed the unaccountable action of his companion with much surprise now sprang to the rescue but at the moment several of the other pursuers rushed upon the scene and the luckless fugitive was instantly overpowered and secured  now my young buck said crossby stand up  hold him four of you till i fix his hands wi this rope  there its the rope that youll swing by so youll find it hard to break  while tom was being bound he cast a look of fierce anger on westly who still lay prostrate and insensible on the ground despite paddys efforts to rouse him  i hope he is killed muttered tom between his teeth  och no fear of him hes not so aisy kilt said flinders looking up bad luck to ye for wishin it  as if to corroborate paddys opinion westly showed signs of returning consciousness and soon after sat up  did ye kill that bar all by yerself asked one of the men who held the fugitive  but tom would not condescend to reply and in a few minutes crossby gave the word to march back towards pine tree diggings  they set offtwo men marching on either side of the prisoner with loaded rifles and revolvers the rest in front and in rear  a party was left behind to skin the bear and bring away the titbits of the carcass for supper  being too late to return to pine tree camp that night they arranged to bivouac for the night in a hollow where there was a little pond fed by a clear spring which was known as the red mans teacup  here they kindled a large fire the bright sparks from which rising above the treetops soon attracted the attention of the other parties so that ere long the whole band of pursuers was gathered to the spot  gashford was the last to come up  on hearing that the thief had been captured by his former chum westly assisted by flinders and crossby he expressed considerable surprise and cast a long and searching gaze on fred who however being busy with the fire at the time was unconscious of it  whatever the bully thought he kept his opinions to himself  have you tied him up well he said turning to crossby  a wild horse couldnt break his fastenings answered the digger  perhaps not returned gashford with a sneer but you are always too sure by half o yer work  come stand up he added going to where tom lay and stirring his prostrate form with his toe  brixton having now had time to consider his case coolly had made up his mind to submit with a good grace to his fate and if it were so decreed to die like a man  i deserve punishment he reasoned with himself though death is too severe for the offence  however a guilty man cant expect to be the chooser of his reward  i suppose it is fate as the turks say so ill submitlike them  he stood up at once therefore on being ordered to do so and quietly underwent inspection  ha  i thought so exclaimed gashford contemptuously  any man could free himself from that in half an hour  but what better could be expected from a landlubber  crossby made some sharp allusions to a sealubber but he wisely restrained his voice so that only those nearest overheard him  meanwhile gashford undid the rope that bound tom brixtons arms behind him and holding him in his iron grip ordered a smaller cord to be fetched  paddy flinders who had a schoolboy tendency to stuff his various pockets full of all sorts of miscellaneous articles at once stepped forward and handed the leader a piece of strong codline  there ye are sor said he  just the thing paddy  here catch hold of this end of it an haul  yis gineral said the irishman in a tone and with a degree of alacrity that caused a laugh from most of those who were looking on even the gineral observed it and remarked with a sardonic smile  you seem to be pleased to see your old chum in this fix i think  well now gineral returned flinders in an argumentative tone of voice i cant exactly say that sor for im troubled with what ye may call amiable weaknesses  anyhow i might see im in a worse fix  well youre like to see him in a worse fix if you live long enough returned the leader  haul now on this knot  itll puzzle him to undo that  lend me your knife  flinders drew his glittering bowieknife from its sheath and handed it to his leader who cut off the superfluous cordage with it after having bound the prisoners wrists behind his back in a sailorlike manner  in returning the knife to its owner gashford who was fond of a practical joke tossed it high in the air towards him with a here catch  the keen glittering thing came twirling down but to the surprise of all the irishman caught it by the handle as deftly as though he had been a trained juggler  thank your gineralship exclaimed paddy amid a shout of laughter and applause bowing low in mock reverence  as he rose he made a wild flourish with the knife uttered an indian warwhoop and cut a caper  in that flourish he managed to strike the cord that bound the prisoner and severed one turn of it  the barefaced audacity of the act like that of a juggler caused it to pass unobserved  even tom although he felt the touch of the knife was not aware of what had happened for of course a number of uncut turns of the cord still held his wrists painfully tight  now lie down on your back said gashford sternly when the laugh that paddy had raised subsided  either the tone of this command or the pain caused by his bonds roused toms anger for he refused to obey  lie down ye spalpeen whin the gineral bids ye cried flinders suddenly seizing his old friend by the collar and flinging him flat on his back in which act he managed to trip and fall on the top of him  the opportunity was not a good one nevertheless the energetic fellow managed to whisper the ropes cut  lie still in the very act of falling  well done paddy exclaimed several of the laughing men as flinders rose with a pretended look of discomfiture and went towards the fire exclaiming  niver mind boys ill have me supper now  hi whos bin an stole it whin i was out on dooty  oh here it is all right  now then go to work an whin the pipes is lighted ill maybe sing ye a song or tell ye a story about ould ireland    chapter three  obedient to orders tom brixton lay perfectly still on his back just where he had fallen wondering much whether the cord was really cut for he did not feel much relaxation of it or abatement of the pain  he resolved at any rate to give no further cause for rough treatment but to await the issue of events as patiently as he could  true to his promise the irishman after supper sang several songs which if not characterised by sweetness of tone were delivered with a degree of vigour that seemed to make full amends in the estimation of his hearers  after that he told a thrilling ghost story which drew the entire band of men round him  paddy had a natural gift in the way of relating ghost stories for besides the power of rapid and sustained discourse without hesitation or redundancy of words he possessed a vivid imagination a rich fancy a deep bass voice an expressive countenance and a pair of large coalblack eyes which as one of the yankee diggers said would sartinly bore two holes in a blanket if he only looked at it long enough  we do not intend to inflict that ghost story on the reader  it is sufficient to say that paddy began it by exclaiming in a loud voicenow or niver boysnow or niver  thats what the ghost said  whats that you say paddy asked gashford leaving his own separate and private fire which he enjoyed with one or two chosen comrades and approaching that round which the great body of the diggers were already assembled  i was just goin to tell the boys sor a bit of a ghost story  well go on lad id like to hear it too  now or niver repeated the irishman with such startling emphasis that even tom brixton lying bound as he was under the shelter of a spreading tree at some distance from the fire had his curiosity aroused  thats what the ghost said under somewhat pecooliar circumstances an he said it twice so that there might be no mistake at all about it  now or niver now or niver says he an he said it earnestly  i didnt know that ghosts could speak interrupted crossby who when not in a bad humour was rather fond of thrusting bad jokes and blunt witticisms on his comrades  sure im not surprised at that for theres many things ye dont know crossby besides no ghost with the smallest taste of propriety about it would condescind to spake wid you  well boys thats what the ghost said in a muffled vicetheir vices are muffled you know an their virtues too for all i know to the contrairy  its a good sentiment is that now or niver for every wan of yeso ye may putt it in yer pipes an smoke it an those of ye who havent got pipes can make a quid of it an chaw it or subject it to meditation  now or niver  think o that  you see im partikler about it for the whole story turns on that pint as the ghosts life depended on it but yell see an onderstan better whin i come to the end o the story  paddy said this so earnestly that it had the double effect of chaining the attention of his hearers and sending a flash of light into tom brixtons brain  now or never he muttered to himself and turned gently on his side so as to be able to feel the cord that bound his wrists  it was still tight but by moving his fingers he could feel that one of its coils had really been cut and that with a little patience and exertion he might possibly free his hands  slight as the motion was however gashford observed it for the firelight shone brightly on toms recumbent figure  lie still there he cried sternly  tom lay perfectly still and the irishman continued his story  it grew in mystery and in horror as he proceeded and his audience became entranced while some of the more superstitious among them cast occasional glances over their shoulders into the forest behind which ere long was steeped in the blackness of an unusually dark night  a few of those outside the circle rose and drew nearer to the storyteller  at that moment a gleam of light which had already entered brixtons brain flashed into that of fred westly who arose and under pretext of being too far off from the speaker went round to the opposite side of the fire so as to face him  by so doing he placed himself between the fire and his friend tom  two or three of the others followed his example though not from the same motive and thus when the fire burnt low the prisoner found himself lying in deep shadow  by that time he had freed his benumbed hands chafed them into a condition of vitality and was considering whether he should endeavour to creep quietly away or spring up and make a dash for life  now or niver said the ghost in a solemn muffled vice continued paddy  who did he say that to asked gashford who was by that time as much fascinated as the rest of the party  to the thief sor av coorse who was standin tremblin fornint him while the sexton was diggin the grave to putt him in alivein the dark shadow of a big tombstone  the irishman had now almost reached the climax of his story and was intensely graphic in his descriptionsespecially at the horrible parts he was obviously spinning it out and the profound silence around told how completely he had enchained his hearers  it also warned tom brixton that his time was short and that in his case it was indeed now or never  he crept quietly towards the bushes near him  in passing a tree against which several rifles had been placed he could not resist the temptation to take one  laying hold of that which stood nearest and which seemed to be similar in make to the rifle they had taken from himself when he was captured he drew it towards him  unfortunately it formed a prop to several other rifles which fell with a crash and one of them exploded in the fall  the effect on paddys highlystrung audience was tremendous  many of them yelled as if they had received an electric shock  all of them sprang up and turned round just in time to see their captive vanish not unlike a ghost into the thick darkness  that glance however was sufficient to enlighten them  with shouts of rage many of them darted after the fugitive and followed him up like bloodhounds  others who had never been very anxious for his capture or death and had been turned somewhat in his favour by the bold stand he had made against the bear returned to the fire after a short run  if there had been even a glimmering of light tom would certainly have been retaken at once for not a few of his pursuers were quite as active and hardy as himself but the intense darkness favoured him fortunately the forest immediately behind him was not so dense as elsewhere else in his first desperate rush regardless of consequences he would probably have dashed himself against a tree  as it was he went right through a thicket and plunged headlong into a deep hole  he scrambled out of this with the agility of a panther just in time to escape gashford who chanced to plunge into the same hole but not so lightly  heavy though he was however his strength was equal to the shock and he would have scrambled out quickly enough if crossby had not run on the same course and tumbled on the top of him  amid the growling halffight halfscramble that ensued tom crept swiftly away to the left but the pursuers had so scattered themselves that he heard them panting and stumbling about in every direction before on either hand and behind  hurrying blindly on for a few paces he almost ran into the arms of a man whom he could hear though he could not see him and stopped  hallo is that you bill smith demanded the man  ay thats me replied tom promptly mimicking bill smiths voice and gasping violently  i thought you were brixton  hes just passed this way  i saw him  did youwhere  away thereto the left  off went the pursuer as fast as he dared and tom continued his flight with more caution  hallo hi hooroo came at that moment from a long distance to the right in unmistakable tones  here he is down this way  stop you big thief  howld him  dick  have ye got him  there was a general rush and scramble towards the owner of the bass voice and tom who at once perceived the ruse went quietly off in the opposite direction  of course the hunt came to an end in a very few minutes  every one having more or less damaged his head knees elbows and shins came to the natural conclusion that a chase in the dark was absurd as well as hopeless and in a short time all were reassembled round the fire where fred westly still stood for he had not joined in the pursuit  gashford was the last to come up with the exception of paddy flinders  the bully came forward fuming with rage and strode up to fred westly with a threatening look  you were at the bottom of this he cried doubling his huge fist  it was you who cut the rope for no mortal man could have untied it  indeed i did not replied fred with a steady but not defiant look  then it must have bin your little chum flinders  where is he  how could flinders ha done it when he was tellin a ghost story said crossby  gashford turned with a furious look to the speaker and seemed on the point of venting his illhumour upon him when he was arrested by the sound of the irishmans voice shouting in the distance  as he drew nearer the words became intelligible  howld him tight now dye hear  och whereiver have ye gone an lost yersilf  howld him tight till i come an help ye  what is it let him go ye have  ah then its wishin i had the eyes of a cat this night for i cant rightly see the length of my nose  sure yeve niver gone an let him go  dont say so now wound up paddy as issuing from the wood he advanced into the circle of light  whos got hold of him flin asked one of the men as he came up  sorrow wan o me knows returned the irishman wiping the perspiration from his brow dye suppose i can see in the dark like the moles  all i know is that half a dozen of ye have bin shoutin here he is an another halfdozen no hes herethis way an sure i ran this way an then i ran that wayhavin a natral disposition to obey orders acquired in the louth militiaan then i ran my nose flat on a tree bad luck to itthat putt more stars in me hid than youll see in the sky this night  ah ye may laugh but its truth im tellin  see theres a blob on the ind of it as big as a chirry  that blobs always there paddy cried one of the men its a grogblossom  there now peter dont become personal  but tell meyeve got him av coorse  no we havent got him growled crossby  well now youre a purty lot o hunters  sure if  come shut up flinders interrupted gashford swallowing his wrath paddy brought his teeth together with a snap in prompt obedience you know well enough that we havent got him and you know youre not sorry for it but mark my words ill hunt him down yet  wholl go with me  ill go said crossby stepping forward at once  ive a grudge agin the puppy and ill help to make him swing if i can  half a dozen other men who were noted for leading idle and dissipated lives and who would rather have hunted men than nothing also offered to go but the most of the party had had enough of it and resolved to return home in the morning  we cant go just now however said crossby wed only break our legs or necks  the moon will rise in an hour returned gashford we can start then  he flung himself down sulkily on the ground beside the fire and began to fill his pipe  most of the others followed his example and sat chatting about the recent escape while a few rolling themselves in their blankets resigned themselves to sleep  about an hour later as had been predicted the moon rose and gashford with his men set forth  but by that time the fugitive groping his way painfully with many a stumble and fall had managed to put a considerable distance between him and his enemies so that when the first silvery moonbeans tipped the treetops and shed a faint glimmer on the ground which served to make darkness barely visible he had secured a good start and was able to keep well ahead  the pursuers were not long in finding his track however for they had taken a red indian with them to act as guide but the necessity for frequent halts to examine the footprints carefully delayed them much while tom brixton ran straight on without halt or stay  still he felt that his chance of escape was by no means a good one for as he guessed rightly they would not start without a native guide and he knew the power and patience of these red men in following an enemys trail  what made his case more desperate was the sudden diminution of his strength  for it must be borne in mind that he had taken but little rest and no food since his flight from pine tree diggings and the wounds he had received from the bear although not dangerous were painful and exhausting  a feeling of despair crept over the stalwart youth when the old familiar sensation of bodily strength began to forsake him  near daybreak he was on the point of casting himself on the ground to take rest at all hazards when the sound of falling water broke upon his ear  his spirit revived at once for he now knew that in his blind wandering he had come near to a wellknown river or stream where he could slake his burning thirst and by wading down its course for some distance throw additional difficulty in the pursuers way  not that he expected by that course to throw them entirely off the scent he only hoped to delay them  on reaching the rivers brink he fell down on his breast and applying his lips to the bubbling water took a deep refreshing draught  god help me he exclaimed on rising and then feeling the burden of gold which all through his flight had been concealed beneath his shirt packed flat so as to lie close he took it off and flung it down  there he said bitterly for you i have sold myself body and soul and now i fling you away  instead of resting as he had intended he now feeling strengthened looked about for a suitable place to enter the stream and wade down so as to leave no footprints behind  to his surprise and joy he observed the bow of a small indian canoe half hidden among the bushes  it had apparently been dragged there by its owner and left to await his return for the paddles were lying under it  launching this frail bark without a moments delay he found that it was tight pushed off and went rapidly down with the current  either he had forgotten the gold in his haste or the disgust he had expressed was genuine for he left it lying on the bank  he now no longer fled without a purpose  many miles down that same stream there dwelt a golddigger in a lonely hut  his name was paul bevan  he was an eccentric being and a widower with an only child a daughter named elizabethbetter known as betty  one phase of paul bevans eccentricity was exhibited in his selection of a spot in which to search for the precious metal  it was a savage gloomy gorge such as a misanthrope might choose in which to end an unlovely career  but bevan was no misanthrope  on the contrary he was one of those men who are gifted with amiable dispositions high spirits strong frames and unfailing health  he was a favourite with all who knew him and although considerably past middle life possessed much of the fire energy and lightheartedness of youth  there is no accounting for the acts of eccentric men and we make no attempt to explain why it was that paul bevan selected a home which was not only far removed from the abodes of other men but which did not produce much gold  many prospecting parties had visited the region from time to time under the impression that bevan had discovered a rich mine which he was desirous of keeping all to himself but after searching and digging all round the neighbourhood and discovering that gold was to be found in barely paying quantities they had left in search of more prolific fields and spread the report that paul bevan was an eccentric fellow  some said he was a queer chap others more outspoken styled him an ass but all agreed in the opinion that his daughter betty was the finest girl in oregon  perhaps this opinion may account for the fact that many of the miners especially the younger among themreturned again and again to bevans gully to search for gold although the search was not remunerative among those persevering though unsuccessful diggers had been for a considerable time past our hero tom brixton  perhaps the decision with which elizabeth bevan repelled him had had something to do with his late reckless life  but we must guard the reader here from supposing that betty bevan was a beauty  she was not  on the other hand she was by no means plain for her complexion was good her nutbrown hair was soft and wavy and her eyes were tender and true  it was the blending of the graces of body and of soul that rendered betty so attractive  as poor tom brixton once said in a moment of confidence to his friend westly while excusing himself for so frequently going on prospecting expeditions to bevans gully theres no question about it fred shes the sweetest girl in oregonpshaw in the world i should have said  lovingkindness beams in her eyes sympathy ripples on her brow grace dwells in her every motion and honest straightforward simplicity sits enthroned upon her countenance  even crossby the surly digger entertained similar sentiments regarding her though he expressed them in less refined language  shes a buster he said once to a comrade thats what she is an no mistake about it  what with her great eyes glarin affection an her little mouth smilin goodnatur an her figure goin about as graceful as a small cat at playwhy i tell ee what it is mate with such a gal for a wife a feller might snap his fingers at hunger an thirst heat an cold bad luck an all the rest of it  but shes got one fault that dont suit me  shes overly religiousan that dont pay at the diggins  this socalled fault did indeed appear to interfere with betty bevans matrimonial prospects for it kept a large number of dissipated diggers at armslength from her and it made even the more respectable men feel shy in her presence  tom brixton however had not been one of her timid admirers  he had a drop or two of irish blood in his veins which rendered that impossible before falling into dissipated habits he had paid his addresses to her boldly  moreover his suit was approved by bettys father who had taken a great fancy to tom  but as we have said this rose of oregon repelled tom  she did it gently and kindly it is true but decidedly  it was then towards the residence of paul bevan that the fugitive now urged his canoe with a strange turmoil of conflicting emotions however for the last time he had visited the gully he had been at least free from the stain of having broken the laws of man  now he was a fugitive and an outlaw with hopes and aspirations blighted and the last shred of selfrespect gone    chapter four  when tom brixton had descended the river some eight or ten miles he deemed himself pretty safe from his pursuers at least for the time being as his rate of progress with the current far exceeded the pace at which men could travel on foot and besides there was the strong probability that on reaching the spot where the canoe had been entered and the bag of gold left on the bank the pursuers would be partially satisfied as well as baffled and would return home  on reaching a waterfall therefore where the navigable part of the river ended and its broken course through bevans gully began he landed without any show of haste drew the canoe up on the bank where he left it concealed among bushes and began quietly to descend by a narrow footpath with which he had been long familiar  up to that point the unhappy youth had entertained no definite idea as to why he was hurrying towards the hut of paul bevan or what he meant to say for himself on reaching it  but towards noon as he drew near to it the thought of betty in her innocence and purity oppressed him  she rose before his minds eye like a reproving angel  how could he ever face her with the dark stain of a mean theft upon his soul  how could he find courage to confess his guilt to her or supposing that he did not confess it how could he forge the tissue of lies that would be necessary to account for his sudden appearance and in such guisebloodstained wounded haggard and worn out with fatigue and hunger  such thoughts now drove him to the verge of despair  even if betty were to refrain from putting awkward questions there was no chance whatever of paul bevan being so considerate  was he then to attempt to deceive them or was he to reveal all  he shrank from answering the question for he believed that bevan was an honest man and feared that he would have nothing further to do with him when he learned that he had become a common thief  a thief  how the idea burned into his heart now that the influence of strong drink no longer warped his judgment  has it really come to this he muttered gloomily  then as he came suddenly in sight of bevans hut he exclaimed more cheerfully come ill make a clean breast of it  paul bevan had pitched his hut on the top of a steep rocky mound the front of which almost overhung a precipice that descended into a deep gully where the tormented river fell into a black and gurgling pool behind the hut flowed a streamlet which being divided by the mound into a fork ran on either side of it in two deep channels so that the hut could only be reached by a plank bridge thrown across the lower or western fork  the forked streamlet tumbled over the precipice and descended into the dark pool below in the form of two tiny silver threads  at least it would have done so if its two threads had not been dissipated in misty spray long before reaching the bottom of the cliff thus it will be seen that the golddigger occupied an almost impregnable fortress though why he had perched himself in such a position no one could guess and he declined to tell  it was therefore set down like all his other doings to eccentricity  of course there was so far a pretext for his caution in the fact that there were scoundrels in those regions who sometimes banded together and attacked people who were supposed to have golddust about them in large quantities but as such assaults were not common and as every one was equally liable to them there seemed no sufficient ground for bevans excessive care in the selection of his fortress  on reaching it tom found its owner cutting up some firewood near his plankbridge  hallo brixton he cried looking up in some surprise as the young man advanced you seem to have bin in the wars  what have e been fightin wi lad  with a bear paul bevan replied tom sitting down on a log with a longdrawn sigh  youre used up lad an want rest mayhap you want grub also  anyhow you look awful bad  no wounds i hope or bones broken eh  no nothing but a broken heart replied tom with a faint attempt to smile  why thats a queer bit o you for a bar to break  if you had said it was a girl that broke it now i could have  where is betty interrupted the youth quickly with an anxious expression  in the hut lookin arter the grub  youll come in an have some of course  but im coorious to hear about that bar  was it far from here you met him  ay just a short way this side o pine tree diggings  pine tree diggins repeated paul in surprise  why then didnt you go back to pine tree diggins to wash yourself an rest instead o comin all the way here  becausebecause paul bevan said tom with sudden earnestness as he gazed on the others face because im a thief  you might be worse replied bevan while a peculiarly significant smile played for a moment on his rugged features  what do you mean exclaimed tom in amazement  why you might have bin a murderer you know replied bevan with a nod  the youth was so utterly disgusted with this cool indifferent way of regarding the matter that he almost regretted having spoken  he had been condemning himself so severely during the latter part of his journey and the meanness of his conduct as well as its wickedness had been growing so dark in colour that bevans unexpected levity took him aback and for a few seconds he could not speak  listen he said at last seizing his friend by the arm and looking earnestly into his eyes  listen and i will tell you all about it  the man became grave as tom went on with his narrative  yes its a bad business he said at its conclusion an uncommon bad business  got a very ugly look about it  you are right paul said tom bowing his head while a flush of shame covered his face  no one i think can be more fully convinced of the meannessthe sinof my conduct than i am now  oh as to that returned bevan with another of his peculiar smiles i didnt exactly mean that  you were tempted you know pretty bad besides bully gashford is a big rascal an richly deserves what he got  no it wasnt that i meantbut its a bad lookout for you lad if they nab you  i knows the temper o them pine tree men an theyre in such a wax just now that theyll string you up as sure as fate if they catch you  again tom was silent for the lightness with which bevan regarded his act of theft only had the effect of making him condemn himself the more  but i say brixton resumed bevan with an altered expression not a word of all this to betty  you havent much chance with her as it is although i do my best to back you up but if she came to know of this affair youd not have the ghost of a chance at allfor you know the gal is religious mores the pity though i will say it shes a good obedient gal in spite of her religion an a fectionate darter to me but shed never marry a thief you know  you couldnt well expect her to  the dislike with which tom brixton regarded his companion deepened into loathing as he spoke and he felt it difficult to curb his desire to fell the man to the ground but the thought that he was bettys father soon swallowed up all other thoughts and feelings  he resolved in his own mind that come of it what might he would certainly tell all the facts to the girl and then formally give her up for he agreed with bevan at least on one point namely that he could not expect a good religious girl to marry a thief  but you forget paul he said after a few moments thought that betty is sure to hear about this affair the first time you have a visitor from pine tree diggings  thats true lad i did forget that  but you know you can stoutly deny that it was you who did it  say there was some mistake and git up some cockanabull story to confuse her  anyhow say nothing about it just now  tom was still meditating what he should say in reply to this when betty herself appeared calling her father to dinner  now mind not a word about the robbery he whispered as he rose and well make as much as we can of the bar  yes not a word about it thought tom till betty and i are alone and thena clean breast and goodbye to her for ever  during dinner the girl manifested more than usual sympathy with tom brixton  she saw that he was almost worn out with fatigue and listened with intense interest to her fathers embellished narrative of the encounter with the bar which narrative tom was forced to interrupt and correct several times in the course of its delivery  but this sympathy did not throw her off her guard  remembering past visits she took special care that tom should have no opportunity of being alone with her  now you must be off to rest said paul bevan the moment his visitor laid down his knife and fork for let me tell you i may want your help before night  ive got an enemy tom an enemy who has sworn to be the death o me and who will be the death o me i feel sure o that in the longrun  however ill keep him off as long as i can  hed have been under the sod long afore now ladifif it hadnt bin for my betty  shes a queer girl is betty and shes made a queer man of her old father  but who is this enemy and whenwhat explain yourself  well ive no time to explain either when or what just now and you have no time to waste  only i have had a hint from a friend early this morning that my enemy has discovered my whereabouts and is following me up  but im ready for him and right glad to have your stout arm to helpthough you couldnt fight a babby just now  lie down i say an ill call you when youre wanted  ceasing to press the matter tom entered a small room in one corner of which a narrow bed or bunk was fixed  flinging himself on this he was fast asleep in less than two minutes  kind natures sweet restorer held him so fast that for three hours he lay precisely as he fell without the slightest motion save the slow and regular heaving of his broad chest  at the end of that time he was rudely shaken by a strong hand  the guilty are always easily startled  springing from his couch he had seized bevan by the throat before he was quite awake  hist man not quite so fast gasped his host shaking him off  come theyve turned up sooner than i expected  whatwho said brixton looking round  my enemy of coorse an a gang of redskins to help him  they expect to catch us asleep but theyll find out their mistake soon enough that lad there brought me the news and you see he an betty are getting things ready  tom glanced through the slightly opened doorway as he tightened his belt and saw betty and a boy of about fourteen years of age standing at a table busily engaged loading several oldfashioned horsepistols with buckshot  whos the boy asked tom  they call him tolly  i saved the little chap once from a grizzly bar an hes a grateful feller you seehas run a long way to give me warnin in time  come heres a shotgun for you charged wi slugs im not allowed to use ball you must know cause betty thinks that balls kill an slugs only wound  i humour the little gal you see for shes a good darter to me  weve both on us bin lookin forward to this day for we knowed it must come sooner or later an i made her a promise that when it did come id only defend the hut wi slugs  but slugs aint bad shots at a close range when aimed low  the man gave a sly chuckle and a huge wink as he said this and entered the large room of the hut  betty was very pale and silent  she did not even look up from the pistol she was loading when tom entered  the boy tolly however looked at his tall strong figure with evident satisfaction  ha he exclaimed ramming down a charge of slugs with great energy well be able to make a good fight without your services betty  wont we old man  the pertlyput question was addressed to paul bevan between whom and the boy there was evidently strong affection  yes tolly replied bevan with a pleasant nod three men are quite enough for the defence of this here castle  but i say old man continued the boy shaking a powderhorn before his face the powders all done  wherell i git more  a look of anxiety flitted across bevans face  its in the magazine  i got a fresh keg last week an thought it safest to put it there till requiredan havent i gone an forgot to fetch it in  well that dont need to trouble you returned the boy just show me the magazine an ill go an fetch it in  the magazines over the bridge said bevan  i dug it there for safety  come tom the kegs too heavy for the boy  i must fetch it myself and you must guard the bridge while i do it  he went out quickly as he spoke followed by tom and tolly  it was a bright moonlight night and the forks of the little stream glittered like two lines of silver at the bottom of their rugged bed on either side of the hut  the plankbridge had been drawn up on the bank with the aid of his two allies bevan quickly thrust it over the gulf and without a moments hesitation sprang across  while tom stood at the inner end ready with a doublebarrelled gun to cover his friends retreat if necessary he saw bevan lift a trapdoor not thirty yards distant and disappear  a few seconds and he reappeared with a keg on his shoulder  all remained perfectly quiet in the dark woods around  the babbling rivulet alone broke the silence of the night  bevan seemed to glide over the ground he trod so softly  theres another he whispered placing the keg at toms feet and springing back towards the magazine  again he disappeared and as before reissued from the hole with the second keg on his shoulder suddenly a phantom seemed to glide from the bushes and fell him to the earth  he dropped without even a cry and so swift was the act that his friends had not time to move a finger to prevent it  tom however discharged both barrels of his gun at the spot where the phantom seemed to disappear and tolly trevor discharged a horse pistol in the same direction  instantly a rattling volley was fired from the woods and balls whistled all round the defenders of the hut  most men in the circumstances would have sought shelter but tom brixtons spirit was of that utterly reckless character that refuses to count the cost before action  bettys father lay helpless on the ground in the power of his enemies  that was enough for tom  he leaped across the bridge seized the fallen man threw him on his shoulder and had almost regained the bridge when three painted indians uttered a hideous warwhoop and sprang after him  fortunately having just emptied their guns they could not prevent the fugitive from crossing the bridge but they reached it before there was time to draw in the plank and were about to follow when tolly trevor planted himself in front of them with a doublebarrelled horsepistol in each band  we dont want you here youredfacedbaboons he cried pausing between each of the last three words to discharge a shot and emphasising the last word with one of the pistols which he hurled with such precision that it took full effect on the bridge of the nearest red mans nose  all three fell but rose again with a united screech and fled back to the bushes  a few moments more and the bridge was drawn back and paul bevan was borne into the hut amid a scattering fire from the assailants which however did no damage  to the surprise and consternation of tolly who entered first betty was found sitting on a chair with blood trickling from her left arm  a ball entering through the window had grazed her and she sank down partly from the shock coupled with alarm  she recovered however on seeing her father carried in sprang up and ran to him  only stunned betty said tom will be all right soon but we must rouse him for the scoundrels will be upon us in a minute  whatwhats thiswounded  only a scratch  dont mind me  father dear fatherrouse up  they will be hereoh rouse up dear father  but betty shook him in vain  out o the way i know how to stir him up said tolly coming forward with a pail of water and sending the contents violently into his friends facethus drenching him from head to foot  the result was that paul bevan sneezed and sitting up looked astonished  ha  i thought that ud fetch you said the boy with a grin  come youd better look alive if you dont want to lose yer scalp  ho ho exclaimed bevan rising with a sudden look of intelligence and staggering to the door here give me the old sword betty and the blunderbuss  now then  he went out at the door and tom brixton was following when the girl stopped him  oh  mr brixton she said do not kill any one if you can help it  i wont if i can help it  but listen betty said the youth hurriedly seizing the girls hand  i have tried hard to speak with you alone today to tell you that i am guilty and to say goodbye for ever  guilty what do you mean she exclaimed in bewildered surprise  no time to explain  i may be shot you know or taken prisoner though the latters not likely  in any case remember that i confess myself guilty  god bless you dear dear girl  without waiting for a reply he ran to a hollow on the top of the mound where his friend and tolly were already ensconced and whence they could see every part of the clearing around the little fortress  i see the reptiles whispered bevan as tom joined them  they are mustering for an attack on the south side  just what i wish he added with a suppressed chuckle for ive got a pretty little arrangement of codhooks and mantraps in that direction  as he spoke several dark figures were seen gliding among the trees  a moment later and these made a quick silent rush over the clearing to gain the slight shelter of the shrubs that fringed the streamlet  just so remarked bevan in an undertone when a crash of branches told that one of his traps had taken effect an from the row i should guess that two have gone into the hole at the same time  ha thats a fish hooked he added as a short sharp yell of pain mingled with surprise suddenly increased the noise  an there goes another whispered tolly scarcely able to contain himself with delight at such an effective yet comparatively bloodless way of embarrassing their foes  and another added bevan but look out now theyll retreat presently  give em a dose o slug as they go back but take em low ladsabout the feet and ankles  its only a fancy of my dear little gal but i like to humour her fancies  bevan was right  finding that they were not only surrounded by hidden pitfalls but caught by painfully sharp little instruments and entangled among cordage the indians used their scalpingknives to free themselves and rushed back again towards the wood but before gaining its shelter they received the slugdose above referred to and instantly filled the air with shrieks of rage rather than of pain  at that moment a volley was fired from the other side of the fortress and several balls passed close over the defenders heads  surrounded and outnumbered exclaimed bevan with something like a groan  as he spoke another but more distant volley was heard accompanied by shouts of anger and confusion among the men who were assaulting the fortress  the attackers are attacked exclaimed bevan in surprise i wonder who by  he looked round for a reply but only saw the crouching figure of tolly beside him  wheres brixton he asked  bolted into the hut answered the boy  betty exclaimed tom springing into the little parlour or hall where he found the poor girl on her knees you are safe now  i heard the voice of gashford and the indians are flying  but i too must fly  i am guilty as i have said but my crime is not worthy of death yet death is the award and god knows i am not fit to die  once more farewell  he spoke rapidly and was turning to go without even venturing to look at the girl when she said  whatever your crime may be remember that there is a saviour from sin stay  you cannot leap the creek and even if you did you would be caught for i hear voices near us  come with me  she spoke in a tone of decision that compelled obedience  lifting a trapdoor in the floor she bade her lover descend  he did so and found himself in a cellar half full of lumber and with several casks ranged round the walls  the girl followed removed one of the casks and disclosed a hole behind it  it is small she said quickly but you will be able to force yourself through  inside it enlarges at once to a low tunnel along which you will creep for a hundred yards when you will reach open air in a dark rocky dell close to the edge of the precipice above the river  descend to its bed and when free use your freedom to escape from deathbut much more to escape from sin  go quickly  tom brixton would fain have delayed to seize and kiss his preservers hand but the sound of voices overhead warned him to make haste without a word he dropped on hands and knees and thrust himself through the aperture  betty replaced the cask returned to the upper room and closed the trapdoor just a few minutes before her father ushered gashford and his party into the hut    chapter five  when our hero found himself in a hole pitch dark and barely large enough to permit of his creeping on hands and knees he felt a sudden sensation of fearof undefinable dreadcome over him such as one might be supposed to experience on awaking to the discovery that he had been buried alive  his first impulse was to shout for deliverance but his manhood returned to him and he restrained himself  groping his way cautiously along the passage or tunnel which descended at first steeply he came to a part which he could feel was regularly built over with an arch of brickwork or masonry and the sound of running water overhead told him that this was a tunnel under the rivulet  as he advanced the tunnel widened a little and began to ascend  after creeping what he judged to be a hundred yards or so he thought he could see a glimmer of light like a faint star in front of him  it was the opening to which betty had referred  he soon reached it and emerged into the fresh air  as he raised himself and drew a long breath of relief the words of his deliverer seemed to start up before him in letters of fire  use your freedom to escape from deathbut much more to escape from sin  i will so help me god he exclaimed clasping his hands convulsively and looking upward  in the strength of the newborn resolution thus induced by the spirit of god he fell on his knees and tried to pray then he rose and sat down to think strangely forgetful of the urgent need there was for flight  meanwhile gashford and his men proceeded to question paul bevan and his daughter  the party included among others fred westly paddy flinders and crossby  gashford more than suspected the motives of the first two in accompanying him but did not quite see his way to decline their services even if he had possessed the power to do so  he consoled himself however with the reflection that he could keep a sharp eye on their movements  no no bevan he said when the man brought out a casebottle of rum and invited him to drink we have other work on hand just now  we have traced that young thief brixton to this hut and we want to get hold of him  a thief is he returned bevan with a look of feigned surprise well now that is strange news  tom brixton dont look much like a thief do he  appealing to the bystanders  there must be some mistake surely  theres no mistake said gashford with an oath  he stole a bag o gold from my tent  to be sure he dropped it in his flight so ive got it back again but that dont affect his guilt  but surely mister gashford said bevan slowly for having been hurriedly told in a whisper by betty what she had done for tom he was anxious to give his friend as much time as possible to escape surely as youve come by no loss ye can afford to let the poor young feller off this time  no we cant shouted gashford fiercely  these mean pilferers have become a perfect pest at the diggins an we intend to stop their little game we do by stoppin their windpipes when we catch them come dont shillyshally any longer paul bevan  hes here and no mistake so youd better hand him over  besides you owe us something you know for coming to your help agin the redskins in the nick of time  well as to that i am much obliged though after all it wasnt to help me you came  no matter exclaimed the other impatiently you know he is here an youre bound to give him up  but i dont know that hes here an i cant give him up cause why hes escaped  escaped impossible there is only one bridge to this mound and he has not crossed that since we arrived ill be bound  theres a sentry on it now  but an active young feller can jump you know  no he couldnt jump over the creek unless he was a human flea or a rocky mountain goat  come since you wont show us where he is well take the liberty of sarchin your premises  but stay your daughters got the name o bein a religious gal  if theres any truth in that shed be above tellin a lie  come now betty tell us like a good gal is tom brixton here  no he is not here replied the girl  where is he then  i do not know  thats false you do know  but come lads well sarch and heres a cellar to begin with  he laid hold of the iron ring of the trapdoor opened it and seizing a light descended followed by bevan crossby flinders and one or two others  tossing the lumber about he finally rolled aside the barrels ranged beside the wall until the entrance to the subterranean way was discovered  ho ho he cried lowering the light and gazing into it  heres something anyhow  after peering into the dark hole for some time he felt with his hand as far as his arm could reach  mind he dont bite suggested paddy flinders in a tone that drew a laugh from the bystanders  hand me that stick paddy said gashford and keep your jokes to a more convenient season  ah then tis always a convanient season wid me sor replied paddy with a wink at his companions as he handed the stick  does this hole go far in he asked after a fruitless poking about with the stick  ay a long way  moren a hundred yards returned bevan  well ill have a look at it  saying which gashford pushed the light as far in as he could reach and then taking a bowieknife between his teeth attempted to follow  we say attempted because he was successful only in a partial degree it must be remembered that gashford was an unusually large man and that tom brixton had been obliged to use a little force in order to gain an entrance  when therefore the huge bully had thrust himself in about as far as his waist he stuck hard and fast so that he could neither advance nor retreat  he struggled violently and a muffled sound of shouting was heard inside the hole but no one could make out what was said  och the poor cratur exclaimed paddy flinders with a look of overdone commiseration whatll we do for im at all at all  lets try to pull him out suggested crossby  they tried and failed although as many as could manage it laid hold of him  sure he minds me of a stiff cork in a bottle said flinders wiping the perspiration from his forehead an what a most awful crack hell make whin he does come out  lets give another heave boys  they gave another heave but only caused the muffled shouting inside to increase  och the poor craturs stritchin out like a injinrubber man sure hes a fut longer than he used to behim that was a sight too long already said flinders  lets try to shove him through suggested the baffled crossby  failure again followed their united effortsexcept as regards the muffled shouting within which increased in vigour and was accompanied by no small amount of kicking by what of gashford remained in the cellar  im afeared his legsll come off altogether if we try to pull harder than weve done said crossby contemplating the huge and helpless limbs of the victim with a perplexed air  what a chance boys suddenly exclaimed flinders to pay off old scores with a treemendous wallopin  we could do it aisy in five or six minutes an then lave im to think over it for the rest of his life  as no one approved of paddys proposal it was finally resolved to dig the big man out and a pick and shovel were procured for the purpose  contrary to all expectations gashford was calm almost subdued when his friends at last set him free  instead of storming and abusing every one he said quietly but quickly let us search the bush now  he cant be far off yet and theres moonlight enough  leading the way he sprang up the cellar stair out at the hutdoor and across the bridge followed closely by his party  hooroo yelled paddy flinders as if in the irrepressible ardour of the chase but in reality to give brixton intimation of the pursuit if he should chance to be within earshot  the wellmeant signal did indeed take effect but it came too late  it found tom still seated in absorbed meditation  rudely awakened to the consciousness of his danger and his stupidity he leaped up and ran along the path that betty had described to him  at the same moment it chanced that crossby came upon the same path at its riverside extremity and in a few moments each ran violently into the others arms and both rolled upon the ground  the embrace that crossby gave the youth would have been creditable even to a black bear but tom was a match for him in his then condition of savage despair  he rolled the rough digger over on his back half strangled him and bumped his shaggy head against the convenientlysituated root of a tree  but crossby held on with the tenacity of stickingplaster shouting wildly all the time and before either could subdue the other gashford and his men coming up stopped the combat  it were vain attempting to describe the conflict of brixtons feelings as they once more bound his arms securely behind him and led him back to paul bevans hut  the thought of death while fighting with man or beast had never given him much concern but to be done to death by the rope as a petty thief was dreadful to contemplate while to appear before the girl he loved humiliated and bound was in itself a sort of preliminary death  afterwards when confined securely in the cellar and left to himself for the night with a few pine branches as a bed the thought of home and mother came to him with overwhelming power and finally mingled with his dreams  but those dreams however pleasant they might be at first and in some respects invariably ended with the branch of a tree and a rope with a noose dangling at the end thereof and he awoke again and again with a choking sensation under the impression that the noose was already tightening on his throat  the agony endured that night while alone in the dark cellar was terrible for tom knew the temper of the diggers too well to doubt his fate  still hope blessed hope did not utterly desert him  more than once he struggled to his knees and cried to god for mercy in the saviours name  by daybreak next morning he was awakened out of the first dreamless sleep that he had enjoyed and bid get up  a slight breakfast of bread and water was handed to him which he ate by the light of a homemade candle stuck in the neck of a quart bottle  soon afterwards crossby descended and bade him ascend the wooden stair or ladder  he did so and found the party of miners assembled under arms and ready for the road  im sorry i cant help ee said paul bevan drawing the unhappy youth aside and speaking in a low voice  i would if i could for i owe my life to you but they wont listen to reason  i sent betty out o the way lad apurpose  thought it better she shouldnt see you but  come come old man times up interrupted gashford roughly we must be off  now march my young slipperyheels  i neednt tell you not to try to bolt again  youll find it difficult to do that  as they moved off and began their march through the forest on foot tom brixton felt that escape was indeed out of the question for while three men marched in front of him four marched on either side each with rifle on shoulder and the rest of the band brought up the rear but even if his chances had not been so hopeless he would not have made any further effort to save himself for he had given himself thoroughly up to despair  in the midst of this a slight sense of relief mingled with the bitterness of disappointment when he found that betty had been sent out of the way and that he would see her no more for he could not bear the thought of her seeing him thus led away  may i speak with the prisoner for a few minutes said fred westly to gashford as they plodded through the woods  he has been my comrade for several years and i promised his poor mother never to forsake him may i gashford  no was the sharp reply and then as if relenting well yes you may but be brief and no underhand dealing mind for if you attempt to help him you shall be a dead man the next moment as sure as im a living one  an you neednt be too soft westly he added with a cynical smile  your chum haswell its no business o mine  you can go to him  poor tom brixton started as his old friend went up to him and then hung his head  dear tom said fred in a low voice dont give way to despair  with god all things are possible and even if your life is to be forfeited it is not too late to save the soul for jesus is able and willing to save to the uttermost  but i want to comfort you with the assurance that i will spare no effort to save you  many of the diggers are not very anxious that you should bear the extreme punishment of the law and i think gashford may be bought over  if so i need not tell you that my little private store hidden away under the pinetree  there is no such store fred interrupted tom with a haggard look of shame  what do you mean tom  i mean that i gambled it all away unknown to you  oh  fred you do notyou cannot know what a fearful temptation gambling is when given way to especially when backed by drink  no its of no use your trying to comfort me  i do believe now that i deserve to die  whatever you deserve tom it is my business to save you if i can both body and soul and what you now tell me does not alter my intentions or my hopes  by the way does gashford know about this  yes he knows that i have taken your money  and thats the reason said gashford himself coming up at the moment that i advised you not to be too soft on your chum for hes a bad lot altogether  is the man who knows of a crime and connives at it and does not reveal it a much better lot demanded fred with some indignation  perhaps not replied gashford with a short laugh but as i never set up for a good lot you see theres no need to discuss the subject now fall to the rear my young blade  remember that im in command of this party and you know or ought to know that i suffer no insolence in those under me  poor fred fell back at once bitterly regretting that he had spoken out and thus injured to some extent his influence with the only man who had the power to aid his condemned friend  it was near sunset when they reached pine tree diggings  tom brixton was thrust into a strong blockhouse used chiefly as a powder magazine but sometimes as a prison the key of which was kept on that occasion in gashfords pocket while a trusty sentinel paced before the door  that night fred westly sat in his tent the personification of despair true he had not failed all along to lay his friends case before god and up to this point strong hope had sustained him but now the only means by which he had trusted to accomplish his end were gone  the hidden hoard on which he had counted too much had been taken and lost by the very man he wished to save and the weakness of his own faith was revealed by the disappearance of the goldfor he had almost forgotten that the almighty can provide means at any time and in all circumstances  fred would not allow himself for a moment to think that tom had stolen his gold  he only took it for a time with the full intention of refunding it when better times should come  on this point freds style of reasoning was in exact accord with that of his unhappy friend  tom never for a moment regarded the misappropriation of the gold as a theft oh no it was merely an appropriated loana temporary accommodation it would be interesting perhaps appalling to know how many thousands of criminal careers have been begun in this way  now mister westly said flinders entering the tent in haste whats to be done  its quite clear that mister toms not to be hanged for theres two or three of usll commit murder before that happens but ive bin soundin the boys an im afeared theres a lot o the worst wans thatll be glad to see him scragged an theres a lot as wont risk their own necks to save him an what betune the wan an the other them thatll fight for him are a small minorityso again i say whats to be done  patrick flinderss usually jovial face had by that time become almost as long and lugubrious as that of westly  i dont know returned fred shaking his head  my one plan on which i had been founding much hope is upset  listen it was this  i have been saving a good deal of my gold for a long time past and hiding it away secretly so as to have something to fall back upon when poor tom had gambled away all his means  this hoard of mine amounted i should think to something like five hundred pounds  i meant to have offered it to gashford for the key of the prison and for his silence while we enabled tom once more to escape  but this money has without my knowledge been taken away and  stolen you mean exclaimed flinders in surprise  no not stolentaken  i cant explain just now  its enough to know that it is gone and that my plan is thus overturned  dee think gashford would let him out for that asked the irishman anxiously  i think so but after all im almost glad that the moneys gone for i cant help feeling that this way of enticing gashford to do a thing as it were slily is underhand  it is a kind of bribery  faix then its not cruption anyhow for the baste is as crupt as he can be already  an sure wouldnt it just be bribin a blackguard not to commit murther  i dont know pat  it is a horrible position to be placed in  poor poor tom  have ye had supper asked flinders quickly  noi cannot eat  cook it then an dont be selfish  other people can ait though ye cant  itll kape yer mind employedan ill want somethin to cheer me up whin i come back  pat flinders left the tent abruptly and poor fred went about the preparation of supper in a half mechanical way wondering what his comrade meant by his strange conduct  pats meaning was soon made plain that night to a dozen or so of his friends whom he visited personally and induced to accompany him to a sequestered dell in an outoftheway thicket where the moonbeams struggled through the branches and drew a lovely paleblue pattern on the greensward  my frinds he said in a low mysterious voice i know that ivery mothers son of ye is ready to fight for poor tom brixton tomorrow if the wust comes to the wust  now it has occurred to my chum westly an me that it would be better safer and surer to buy him up than to fight for him an as i know some o you fellers has dug up more goold than you knows well what to do wid an youve all got liberal hearts lastewise ye should have if ye haventi propose an second the resolootion that we make up some five hundred pounds betune us an presint it to bully gashford as a mark of our estaimif hell ony give us up the kay o the prison put patrick flinders esquire sintry over it an then go to slape till breakfasttime tomorry mornin  this plan was at once agreed to for five hundred pounds was not a large sum to be made up by men whosome of them at leasthad nearly made their pileby which they meant their fortune while the liberality of heart with which they had been credited was not wanting  having settled a few details this singular meeting broke up and patrick flinders acting as the secretary treasurer and executive committeewent off with a bag of golden nuggets and unbounded selfconfidence to transact the business    chapter six  gashford was not quite so ready to accept flinderss offer as that enthusiast had expected  the bully seemed to be in a strangely unusual mood tooa mood which at first the irishman thought favourable to his cause  sit down said gashford with less gruffness than usual when his visitor entered his hut  what dye want wi me  flinders addressed himself at once to the subject of his mission and became quite eloquent as he touched on the grandeur of the sum offered the liberality of the offerers and the ease with which the whole thing might be accomplished  a very faint smile rested on gashfords face as he proceeded but by no other sign did he betray his thoughts until his petitioner had concluded  so you want to buy him off said gashford the smile expanding to a broad grin  if yer honour had bin born a judge an sot on the bench since iver ye was a small spalpeen ye couldnt have hit it off more nately  thats just what we wantto buy him off  its a purty little commercial transactiona mans life for five hundred pound an sure its a good price to give too consitherin how poor we all are an what a dale o sweatin work weve got to do to git the goold  but suppose i wont sell said gashford what then  fair then ill blow your brains out thought the irishman his fingers tingling with a desire to grasp the loaded revolver that lay in his pocket but he had the wisdom to restrain himself and to say och sor sure yell niver refuse such a natral request  an we dont ask ye to help us  only to hand me the kay o the prison remove the sintry an then go quietly to yer bed wid five hundred pound in goold benathe yar hid to drame on  to add weight to his proposal he drew forth the bag of nuggets from one of his capacious coat pockets and held it up to view  its not enough said gashford with a stern gruffness of tone and look which sank the petitioners hopes below zero  ah then muster gashford said flinders with the deepest pathos its yer own mother would plade wid ye for the poor boys life av she was herethink o that  sure hes young and inexparienced an its the first offince hes iver committed  no not the first interrupted gashford  the first that i knows on returned flinders  tell medoes westly know of this proposal of yours  no sor he doesnt  ah i thought not  with his religious notions it would be difficult for him to join in an attempt to bribe me to stop the course of justice  well sor youre not far wrong for muster westly had bin havin a sort o tussle wid his conscience on that very pint  you must know he had made up his mind to do this very thing an offer you all his savingsa thousand pound more or lessto indooce you to help to save his frind but he found his goold had bin stolen so you see sor he couldnt do it  did he tell you who stole his gold  no sor he didnthe said that some feller had took iton loan like though i calls it stalinbut he didnt say who  and have you had no tussle with your conscience flinders about this business  the irishmans face wrinkled up into an expression of intense amusement at this question  its jokin ye are muster gashford  sure now me conscienceif ive got wandoesnt bother me oftin an if it did on this occasion id send it to the rightabout double quick for its not offerin ye five hundred pound i am to stop the coorse o justice but to save ye from committin murther  give muster brixton what punishment the coort likesfor stailinonly dont hang him  thats all we ask  youll have to pay more for it then returned the bully  thats not enough  sure we havent got a rap more to kape our pots bilin sor returned flinders in a tone of despair  lastewise i can spake for myself for im claned outall but  row much does the all but represent  well sor to tell you the raal truth its about tchwo hundred pound more or less and i brought it wid me for fear you might want it an i havent got a nugget more if it was to save me own life  its the truth im tellin ye sor  there was a tone and look of such intense sincerity about the poor fellow as he slowly drew a second bag of gold from his pocket and placed it beside the first that gashford could not help being convinced  two hundred and five hundred he said meditatively  that makes siven hundred sor said flinders suggestively  the bully did not reply for a few seconds  then taking up the bags of gold he threw them into a corner  thereafter he drew a large key from his pocket and handed it to the irishman who grasped it eagerly  go to the prison said gashford tell the sentry youve come to relieve him and send him to me  mind now the rest of this business must be managed entirely by yourself and see to it that the camp knows nothing about our little commercial transaction for if it does your own days will be numbered  with vows of eternal secrecy and invoking blessings of an elaborate nature on gashfords head the irishman hastened away and went straight to the prison which stood considerably apart from the huts and tents of the miners  who goes there challenged the sentry as he approached for the night was very dark  mesilf av coorse  an who may that be for yer not the only patlander in camp mores the pity  its flinders i am  sure any man wid half an ear might know that ive come to relave ye  but youve got no rifle returned the man with some hesitation  arent revolvers as good as rifles ay an better at close quarters shut up your tatietrap now an be off to muster gashfords hut for he towld me to sind you there widout delay  this seemed to satisfy the man who at once went away leaving flinders on guard  without a moments loss of time paddy made use of the key and entered the prison  is it there ye are avic he said in a hoarse whisper as he advanced with caution and outstretched hands to prevent coming against obstructions  yes who are you replied tom brixton in a stern voice  whist now or yell git me into throuble  sure im yer sintry no less an yer chum pat flinders  indeed paddy  im surprised that they should select you to be my jailer  humph well they didnt let me have the place for nothingoch musha  the last exclamations were caused by the poor man tumbling over a chair and hitting his head on a table  not hurt i hope said brixton his spirit somewhat softened by the incident  not muchonly a new bumpbut its wan among many so it dont matter now listen  time is precious  ive come for to set you freenot exactly at this momint howiver for the boys o the camp havent all gone to bed yet but whin theyre quiet ill come again an help you to escape  ive only come now to let you know  the irishman then proceeded to give tom brixton a minute account of all that had been done in his behalf  he could not see how the news affected him the prison being as dark as erebus but great was his surprise and consternation when the condemned man said in a calm but firm voice thank you flinders for your kind intentions but i dont mean to make a second attempt to escape  ye dont intind to escape exclaimed his friend with a look of blank amazement at the spot where the voice of the other came from  no i dont deserve to live paddy so i shall remain and be hanged  ill be hanged if ye do said paddy with much decision  come now dont be talkin nonsense  its jokin ye are av coorse  im very far from joking my friend returned tom in a tone of deep despondency as you shall find when daylight returns  i am guilty more guilty than you fancyso i shall plead guilty whether tried or not and take the consequences  besides life is not worth having  im tired of it  och but weve bought you an paid for you an youve no manner o right to do what ye like wi yourself returned his exasperated chum but its of no use talkin to ye  theres somethin wrong wi your inside no doubt  when i come back for ye at the right time youll have thought better of it  come now give us your hand  i wish i could flinders but the rascal that tied me has drawn the cord so tight that i feel as if i had no hands at all  ill soon putt that right  where are ye  ah thats it now kape stidy  flinders severed the cord with his bowie knife unwound it and set his friend free  now thin remain where ye are till i come for ye an if any wan should rap at the door an ax wheres the sintinel an the kay just tell him ye dont know an dont care or if ye prefer it tell him to go an ax his grandmother  with this parting piece of advice flinders left the prisoner locked the door put the key in his pocket and went straight to fred westly whom he found seated beside the fire with his face buried in his hands  if tom told you he wouldnt attempt to escape said westly on hearing the details of all that his eccentric friend had done you may be sure that hell stick to it  dye raaly think so muster fred said his companion in deep anxiety  i do  i know tom brixton well and when he is in this mood nothing will move him  but come i must go to the prison and talk with him  freds talk however was not more effective than that of his friend had been  well tom he said as he and flinders were about to quit the blockhouse we will return at the hour when the camp seems fairly settled to sleep probably about midnight and i hope you will then be ready to fly  remember what flinders says is so far trueyour life has been bought and the price paid whether you accept or refuse it  think seriously of that before it be too late  again the prison door closed and tom brixton was left with this thought turning constantly and persistently in his brain  bought and the price paid he repeated to himself for the fiftieth time that night as he sat in his dark prison  tis a strange way to put it to a fellow but that does not alter the circumstances  no i wont be moved by mere sentiment  ill try the turks plan and submit to fate  i fancy this is something of the state of mind that men get into when they commit suicide  and yet i dont feel as if i would kill myself if i were free  bah whats the use of speculating about it anyhow my doom is fixed and poor flinders with his friends will lose their money  my only regret is that that unmitigated villain gashford will get it  it would not be a bad thing now that my hands are free to run amuck amongst em  i feel strength enough in me to rid the camp of a lot of devils before i should be killed  but after all what good would that do me when i couldnt know itcouldnt know it  perhaps i could know it  no no  better to die quietly without the stain of human blood on my soulif i have a soul  escape  easy enough maybe to escape from pine tree diggings but how escape from conscience how escape from factsthe girl i love holding me in contempt my old friend and chum regarding me with pity character gone a life of crime before me and death by rope or bullet or knife sooner or later  better far to die now and have it over at once prevent a deal of sin too as well as misery  bought and the price paid  tis a strange way to put it and there is something like logic in the argument of paddy that ive got no right to do what i like with myself  perhaps a casuist would say it is my duty to escape  perhaps it is  now while tom brixton was revolving this knotty question in his mind and bully gashford was revolving questions quite as knotty and much more complex and fred westly was discussing with flinders the best plan to be pursued in the event of tom refusing to fly there was a party of men assembled under the trees in a mountain gorge not far distant who were discussing a plan of operations which when carried out bade fair to sweep away arrest and overturn other knotty questions and deeplaid plans altogether  it was the band of marauders who had made the abortive attack on bevans fortress  when the attack was made one of the redskins who guided the miners chanced to hear the warwhoop of a personal friend in the ranks of the attacking party  being troubled with no sense of honour worth mentioning this faithless guide deserted at once to the enemy and not only explained all he knew about the thief that he had been tracking but gave in addition such information about the weak points of pine tree diggings that the leader of the band resolved to turn aside for a little from his immediate purposes and make a little hay while the sun shone in that direction  the band was a large onea few on horseback many on foot some being indians and halfcastes others disappointed miners and desperadoes  a fierce villain among the latter was the leader of the band which was held together merely by unity of purpose and interest in regard to robbery and similarity of condition in regard to crime  now lads said the leader who was a tall lanky hugeboned cadaverous fellow with a heavy chin and hawknose named stalker ill tell e what it is  seems to me that the diggers at pine tree camp are a set of outanout blackguardslike most diggersexcept this poor thief of a fellow brixton so i vote for attackin the camp carryin off all the gold we can lay hands on in the hurryskurry an set this gentlemanthis thief brixtonfree  hes a bold chap im told by the redskin an will no doubt be glad to jine us  an we want a few bold men  the reckless robberchief looked round with a mingled expression of humour and contempt as he finished his speech whereat some laughed and a few scowled  but how shall we find brixton asked a man named goff who appeared to be second in command  i know the pine tree camp but i dont know wheres the prison  no matter returned stalker  the redskin helps us out o that difficulty  he tells me the prison is a blockhouse that was once used as a powdermagazine and stands on a height a little apart from the camp  ill go straight to it set the young chap free let him jump up behind me and ride off while you and the rest of the boys are makin the most of your time among the nuggets  we shall all meet again at the red mans teacup  and when shall we go to work captain asked the lieutenant  now  theres no time like the present  strike when the irons hot boys he added looking round at the men by whom he was encircled you know what weve got to do  advance together like cats till were within a yard or two of the camp then a silent rush when you hear my signal the owls hoot  no shouting mind till the first screech comes from the enemy then as concealment will be useless give tongue all of you till your throats split if you like an pick up the gold  now dont trouble yourselves much about fighting  let the bags be the main lookoutof course youll have to defend your own heads though i dont think therell be much occasion for thatan you know if any of them are fools enough to fight for their gold youll have to dispose of them somehow  having delivered this address with much energy the captain of the band put himself at its head and led the way  while this thundercloud was drifting down on the camp fred westly and flinders were preparing for flight  they did not doubt that their friend would at the last be persuaded to escape and had made up their minds to fly with him and share his fortunes  we have nothing to gain you see paddy said fred by remaining here and having parted with all our gold have nothing to lose by going  thrue for ye sor an nothin to carry except ourselves worse luck said the irishman with a deep sigh  howiver we lave no dibts behind us thats wan comfort so we may carry off our weapons an horses wid clear consciences  are ye all ready now sor  almost ready replied fred thrusting a brace of revolvers into his belt and picking up his rifle  go for the horses pat and wait at the stable for me  our neighbours might hear the noise if you brought them round here  now the stable referred to was the most outlying building of the camp in the direction in which the marauders were approaching  it was a small loghut of the rudest description perched on a little knoll which overlooked the camp and from which tom brixtons prison could be clearly seen perched on a neighbouring knoll  paddy flinders ruminated on the dangers and perplexities that might be in store for him that night as he went swiftly and noiselessly up to the hut  to reach the door he had to pass round from the back to the front  as he did so he became aware of voices sounding softly close at hand  a large log lay on the ground  with speed worthy of a redskin he sank down beside it  this way captain ive bin here before an know that you can see the whole camp from itif it wasnt so confoundedly dark  theres a log somewhereah here it is well be able to see better if we mount it  i wish we had more light growled the socalled captain it wont be easy to make off on horseback in suchis this the log  here lend a hand  as he spoke the robberchief put one of his heavy boots on the little finger of pat flinderss left hand and wellnigh broke it in springing on to the log in question  a peculiarly irish howl all but escaped from poor flinderss lips  i see said stalker after a few moments  theres enough of us to attack a camp twice the size  now we must look sharp  ill go round to the prison and set brixton free  when thats done ill hoot three timessoonly a good deal louder  then you an the boys will rush in andyou know the rest  come  descending from the log on the other side the two desperadoes left the spot  then paddy rose and ran as if he had been racing and as if the prize of the race were life  bad luck to you ye murtherin thieves growled the irishman as he ran but ill stop yer game me boys    chapter seven  as straight and almost as swiftly as an arrow flinders ran to his tent burst into the presence of his amazed comrade seized him by both arms and exclaimed in a sharp hoarse voice the import of which there could be no mistaking  whishthowld yer tongue  the campll be attacked in ten minutes  be obadient now an foller me  flinders turned and ran out again taking the path to gashfords hut with the speed of a hunted hare  fred westly followed  bursting in upon the bully who had not yet retired to rest the irishman seized him by both arms and repeated his alarming words with this addition  sind some wan to rouse the campbut silently  no noiseor its all up wid us  there was something in paddys manner and look that commanded respect and constrained obedienceeven in gashford  bill he said turning to a man who acted as his valet and cook rouse the camp  quietlyas you hear  let no man act however till my voice is heard  youll know it when ye hear it  no mistake about that muttered bill as he ran out on his errand  nowfoller cried flinders catching up a bit of rope with one hand and a billet of firewood with the other as he dashed out of the hut and made straight for the prison with gashford and westly close at his heels  gashford meant to ask flinders for an explanation as he ran but the latter rendered this impossible by outrunning him  he reached the prison first and had already entered when the others came up and ran in  he shut the door and locked it on the inside  now then listen all of ye he said panting vehemently an take in what i say for the times short  the campll be attacked in five minitsmore or less  i chanced to overhear the blackguards  their chief comes here to set muster brixton free  thenoch here he comes do as i bid ye ivery wan an howld yer tongues  the latter words were said energetically but in a low whisper for footsteps were heard outside as if approaching stealthily  presently a rubbing sound was heard as of a hand feeling for the door  it touched the handle and then paused a moment after which there came a soft tap  ill spake for ye whispered flinders in brixtons ear  another pause and then another tap at the door  arrah who goes there cried paddy stretching himself as if just awakened out of a sound slumber and giving vent to a mighty yawn  a friend answered the robberchief through the keyhole  a frind echoed pat  sure an thats a big lie if iver there was one  arent ye goin to hang me i the mornin  no indeed i aint one o this camp  but surely you cant be the man thethe thiefnamed brixton for youre an irishman  an why not demanded flinders  sure the brixtons are irish to the backbonean thieves tooroot an branch from adam an eve downwards but go away wid ye  i dont belave that yere a frind  youve only just come to tormint me an spile my slape the night before my funeral fie for shame  go away an lave me in pace  youre wrong brixton ive come to punish the blackguards that would hang you an set you free as ill soon show you  is the door strong  well its not made o cast iron but its pretty tough  stand clear then an ill burst it in wi my foot said stalker  och is it smashin yer bones youll be after  howld fast  are ye a big man  yes pretty big  thats a good job for a little un would only bust hisself agin it for no use  youll have to go at it like a hoydraulic ram  never fear  theres not many doors in these diggins that can remain shut when i want em open said the robber as he retired a few paces to enable him to deliver his blow with greater momentum  howld on a minit me frind said paddy who had quietly turned the key and laid hold of the handle let me git well out o the way and give me warnin before you come  all right  now then look out cried stalker  those inside heard the rapid little run that a man takes before launching himself violently against an object  flinders flung the door wide open in the nick of time  the robbers foot dashed into empty space and the robber himself plunged headlong with a tremendous crash on the floor  at the same instant flinders brought his billet of wood down with all his might on the spot where he guessed the mans head to be  the blow was well aimed and rendered the robber chief incapable of further action for the time being  faix yell not hoot to yer frinds this night anyhow said flinders as they dragged the fallen chief to the doorway to make sure by the faint light that he was helpless  now thin continued paddy well away an lead the boys to battle  you go an muster them sor an ill take ye to the inimy  have you seen their ambush and how many there are asked gashford  niver a wan have i seen and ive only a gineral notion o their whereabouts  how then can you lead us  obey orders an youll see sor  im in command tonight  if ye dont choose to foller yell have to do the best ye can widout me  lead on then cried gashford half amused and half angered by the mans behaviour  flinders led the way straight to gashfords hut where as he anticipated the man named bill had silently collected most of the ablebodied men of the camp all armed to the teeth  he at once desired gashford to put them in fighting order and lead them  when they were ready he went off at a rapid pace towards the stable before mentioned  they should be hereabouts muster gashford he said in a low voice so git yer troops ready for action  what do ye mean growled gashford  to this flinders made no reply but turning to westly and brixton who stood close at his side whispered them to meet him at the stable before the fight was quite over  he then put his hand to his mouth and uttered three hoots like an owl  i believe you are humbugging us said gashford  whisht sorlisten  the breaking of twigs was heard faintly in the distance and a few moments later the tramp apparently of a body of men  presently dark forms were dimly seen to be advancing  nows your time gineral  give it em hot whispered flinders  ready  present  fire said gashford in a deep solemn tone which the profound silence rendered distinctly audible  the marauders halted as if petrified  next moment a sheet of flame burst from the ranks of the miners and horrible yells rent the air high above which like the roar of a lion rose gashfords voice in the single word  charge  but the panicstricken robbers did not await the onset  they turned and fled hotly pursued by the men of pine tree diggings  thatll do cried flinders to brixton theyll not need us any more this night  come wid me now  fred westly who had rushed to the attack with the rest soon pulled up remembering the appointment he returned to the stable where he found tom gazing in silence at flinders who was busily employed saddling their three horses  he at once understood the situation  of course youve made up your mind to go tom he said  nno answered tom  i have not  faix thin youll have to make it up pritty quick now for whin the boys come back the prisoners an wounded menll be sure to tell that their chief came for the express purpose of rescuin that thief brixtonan its hangin thatll be too good for you then  roastin alive is more likely  its my opinion that if they catch us just now muster fred an i will swing for it too  come sor git up  tom hesitated no longer  he vaulted into the saddle  his comrades also mounted and in a few minutes more the three were riding away from pine tree diggings as fast as the nature of the ground and the darkness of the hour would permit  it was not quite midnight when they left the place where they had toiled so long and had met with so many disasters and the morning was not far advanced when they reached the spring of the red mans teacup  as this was a natural and convenient haltingplace to parties leaving those diggings they resolved to rest and refresh themselves and their steeds for a brief space although they knew that the robberchief had appointed that spot as a rendezvous after the attack on the camp  you see its not likely theyll be here for an hour or two said tom brixton as he dismounted and hobbled his horse for it will take some time to collect their scattered forces and they wont have their old leader to spur them on as paddys rap on the head will keep him quiet till the men of the camp find him  troth im not so sure o that sor  the rap was a stiff wan no doubt but men like that are not aisy to kill  besides wont the boys o the camp purshoo them whichll be spur enough an if they finds us here itll matter little whether we fall into the hands o diggers or robbers  so yell make haste av ye take my advice  they made haste accordingly and soon after left and well was it that they did so for little more than an hour later stalkerhis face covered with blood and his head bandagedgalloped up at the head of the mounted men of his party  well camp here for an hour or two he said sharply leaping from his horse which he proceeded to unsaddle  hallo somebodys bin here before us  their fire aint cold yet  well it dont matter  get the grub ready boys an boil the kettle  my head is all but split  if ever i have the luck to come across that irish blackguard brixton ill  he finished the sentence with a deep growl and a grind of his teeth  about daybreak the marauders set out again and it chanced that the direction they took was the same as that taken by fred westly and his comrades  these latter had made up their minds to try their fortune at a recently discovered goldfield which was well reported of though the yield had not been sufficient to cause a rush to the place  it was about three days journey on horseback from the red mans teacup and was named simpsons gully after the man who discovered it  the robbers route lay as we have said in the same direction but only for part of the way for simpsons gully was not their ultimate destination  they happened to be better mounted than the fugitives and travelled faster  thus it came to pass that on the second evening they arrived somewhat late at the campingplace where fred and his friends were spending the night  these latter had encamped earlier that evening  supper was over pipes were out and they were sound asleep when the robber band rode up  flinders was first to observe their approach  he awoke his comrades roughly  och the blackguards have got howld of us  be aisy muster brixton no use fightin  howld yer tongues now an let me spake  yer not half liars enough for the occasion aither of ye  this compliment had barely been paid when they were surrounded and ordered to rise and give an account of themselves  what right have you to demand an account of us asked tom brixton recklessly in a supercilious tone that was meant to irritate  the right of might replied stalker stepping up to tom and grasping him by the throat  tom resisted of course but being seized at the same moment by two men from behind was rendered helpless  his comrades were captured at the same moment and the arms of all bound behind them  now gentlemen said the robber chief perhaps you will answer with more civility  you are wrong for i wont answer at all said tom brixton which i take to be less civility  neither will i said fred who had come to the conclusion that total silence would be the easiest way of getting over the difficulties that filled his mind in regard to deception  patrick flinders however had no such difficulties  to the amazement of his companions he addressed a speech to stalker in language so broken with stuttering and stammering that the marauders around could scarcely avoid laughing though their chief seemed to be in no mood to tolerate mirth  tom and fred did not at first understand though it soon dawned upon them that by this means he escaped being recognised by the man with whom he had so recently conversed through the keyhole of tom brixtons prison door  ssssor said he in a somewhat higher key than he was wont to speak my cccomrades are cccrossggrained critters bboth of em thththough theyre ggood enough in their way for all that  aaax me what ye wwwant to know  cant you speak without so many kkkays an jjgees demanded stalker impatiently  nnno ssor i ccant an the mmore you ttry to make me the wwwus i ggits  well then come to the point an dont say more thans needful  yyyis sor  whats this mans name asked the chief settling the bandages uneasily on his head with one hand and pointing to brixton with the other  mmuster tttom sor  thats his christian name i suppose  wwwell im not sure about his bein a cccchristian  do you spell it tom or thom  ththat depinds on tttaste sor  bah youre a fool  thank yer honour and im also an iiirish mman as sure me names flinders  theres one of your countrymen named brixton said the chief with a scowl whos a scoundrel of the first water and i have a crow to pluck with him some day when we meet  meanwhile i feel halfdisposed to give his countryman a sound thrashing as part payment of the debt in advance  ah sure sor me counthrymanll let ye off the dibt no doubt returned flinders  hallo you seem to have found your tongue all of a sudden  ffaix then its bbekaise of yer not houndin me on  i cccant stand bein hurried ye ssee  bbesides i was havin me little jjjoke an i scarcely spsplutter at all whin im jjjokin  where did you come from demanded the chief sharply  from ppine tree ddiggins  oh indeed  when did you leave the camp  on mmonday mornin sor  then of course you dont know anything about the fight that took place there on monday night  ddont i sor  why dont you answer whether you do or not said stalker beginning to lose temper  shshure yer towld me ththat i dddont know an im too pppurlite to ccontradic yer honour  bah youre a fool  ye tttowld me that before sor  the robber chief took no notice of the reply but led his lieutenant aside and held a whispered conversation with him for a few minutes  now among other blessings flinders possessed a pair of remarkably acute ears so that although he could not make out the purport of the whispered conversation he heard somewhat indistinctly the words bevan and betty  coupling these words with the character of the men around him he jumped to a conclusion and decided on a course of action in one and the same instant  presently stalker returned and addressing himself to tom and fred said  now sirs i know not your circumstances nor your plans but ill take the liberty of letting you know something of mine  men give me and my boys bad names  we call ourselves freeandeasy boys  we work hard for our living  it is our plan to go round the country collecting taxes revenueor whatever you choose to call it and punishing those who object to pay  now we want a few stout fellows to replace the brave men who have fallen at the post of duty  will you join us  certainly not said fred with decision  of course not said tom with contempt  well then my fine fellows you may follow your own inclinations for theres too many willing boys around to make us impress unwilling ones but i shall take the liberty of relieving you of your possessions  i will tax you to the full amount  he turned and gave orders in a low voice to those near him  in a few minutes the horses blankets food arms etcetera of the three friends were collected and themselves unbound  now said the robber chief i mean to spend the night here  you may bid us goodnight  the world lies before yougo  bbbut sor said flinders with a perplexed and pitiful air  ye niver axed me if id jjjine ye  because i dont want you said stalker  ah thin its little ye know ththe jjjewel yere ththrowin away  what can you do asked the robber while a slight smile played on his disfigured face  what ccan i not do ye should ax  wwwhy i can ccccook an fffight an ddance an tttell stories an sssing an  there thatll do  i accept you said stalker turning away while his men burst into a laugh and felt that flinders would be a decided acquisition to the party  are we to go without provisions or weapons asked fred westly before leaving  you may have both answered stalker by joining us  if you go your own wayyou go as you are  please yourselves  you may almost as well kill us as turn us adrift here in the wilderness without food or the means of procuring it remonstrated fred  is it not so tom  tom did not condescend to reply  he had evidently screwed his spirit upor downto the turkish condition of apathy and contempt  youre young both of you and strong answered the robber  the woods are full of game berries roots and fish  if you know anything of woodcraft you cant starve  an shshsure tomlins diggins isnt farfar offstraight fffornint you said flinders going close up to his friends and whispering kape round by bevans gully  youll be  come none of your whisperin together shouted stalker  youre one of us now flinders so say goodbye to your old chums an fall to the rear  yis sor replied the biddable flinders grasping each of his comrades by the hand and wringing it as he said gggoodbye fffoolish bboys bevans gullysharp ffarewell ffor iiiver and covering his face with his hands burst into crocodiles tears while he fell to the rear  he separated two of his fingers however in passing a group of his new comrades in order to bestow on them a wink which produced a burst of subdued laughter  surprised annoyed and puzzled tom brixton thrust both hands into his trousers pockets turned round on his heel and without uttering a word sauntered slowly away  fred westly in a bewildered frame of mind followed his example and the two friends were soon lost to viewswallowed up as it were by the oregon wilderness    chapter eight  after walking through the woods a considerable distance in perfect silencefor the suddenness of the disaster seemed to have bereft the two friends of speechtom brixton turned abruptly and said  well fred were in a nice fix now  what is to be our next move in this interesting little game  fred westly shook his head with an air of profound perplexity but said nothing  ive a good mind continued tom to return to pine tree diggings give myself up and get hanged right off  it would be a good riddance to the world at large and would relieve me of a vast deal of trouble  there is a touch of selfishness in that speech tomdont you think for it would not relieve me of trouble to say nothing of your poor mother  youre right fred  dyou know it strikes me that im a far more selfish and despicable brute than i used to think myself  he looked at his companion with a sad sort of smile nevertheless there was a certain indefinable ring of sincerity in his tone  tom said the other earnestly will you wait for me here for a few minutes while i turn aside to pray  certainly old boy answered tom seating himself on a mossy bank you know i cannot join you  i know you cant tom  it would be mockery to pray to one in whom you dont believe but as i believe in god the bible and prayer youll excuse my detaining you just for  say no more fred  go i shall wait here for you  a slight shiver ran through brixtons frame as he sat down rested his elbows on his knees and clasped his hands  god help me he exclaimed under a sudden impulse ive come down very low god help me  fred soon returned  you prayed for guidance i suppose said tom as his friend sat down beside him  i did  well what is the result  there is no result as yetexcept of course the calmer state of my mind now that i have committed our case into our fathers hands  your fathers you mean  no i mean our for he is your father as well as mine whether you admit it or not  jesus has bought you and paid for you tom with his own blood  you are not your own  not my own bought and paid for thought brixton recalling the scene in which words of somewhat similar import had been addressed to him bought and paid fortwice bought  body and soul  then aloud and what are you going to do now fred  going to discuss the situation with you  and after you have discussed it and acted according to our united wisdom you will say that you have been guided  just so  that is exactly what i will say and believe for he is faithful who has promised  and if you make mistakes and go wrong you will still hold i suppose that you have been guided  undoubtedly i willnot guided indeed into the mistakes but guided to what will be best in the longrun in spite of them  but fred how can you call guidance in the wrong direction right guidance  why tom can you not conceive of a man being guided wrongly as regards some particular end he has in view and yet that same guidance being right because leading him to something far better which perhaps he has not in view  so that said tom with a sceptical laugh whether you go right or go wrong you are sure to come right in the end  just so  all things work together for good to them that love god  does not that savour of jesuitism fred which teaches the detestable doctrine that you may do evil if good is to come of it  not so tom because i did not understand you to use the word wrong in the sense of sinful but in the sense of erroneousmistaken  if i go in a wrong road knowing it to be wrong i sin but if i go in a wrong road mistakenly i still count on guidance though not perhaps to the particular end at which i aimednevertheless guidance to a good end  surely you will admit that no man is perfect  admitted  well then imperfection implies mistaken views and illdirected action more or less in every one so that if we cannot claim to be guided by god except when free from error in thought and act then there is no such thing as divine guidance at all  surely you dont hold that  some have held it  yes the fool hath said in his heart there is no godsome have even gone the length of letting it out of the heart and past the lips with such we cannot argue their case admits only of pity and prayer  i agree with you there fred but if your views are not jesuitical they seem to me to be strongly fatalistic  commit ones way to god you say then shut ones eyes drive ahead anyhow andthe end will be sure to be all right  no i did not say that  with the exception of the first sentence tom that is your way of stating the case not gods way  if you ask in any given difficulty what shall i do  his word replies commit thy way unto the lord  trust also in him and he will bring it to pass  if you ask how am i to know what is best the word again replies hear ye deaf look ye blind that you may see  surely that is the reverse of shutting the eyes isnt it  if you say how shall i act the word answers a good man will guide his affairs with discretion  thats not driving ahead anyhow is it  you may be right returned tom i hope you are  but come what does your wisdom suggest in the present difficulty  the first thing that occurs to me replied the other is what flinders said just before we were ordered off by the robbers  keep round by bevans gully he said in the midst of his seriocomic leavetaking and again he said bevans gullysharp  of course paddy with his jokes and stammering has been acting a part all through this business and i am convinced that he has heard something about bevans gully perhaps an attack on bevan himself which made him wish to tell us to go there  of course how stupid of me not to see that before  lets go at once cried tom starting up in excitement  undoubtedly he meant that  he must have overheard the villains talk of going there and we may not be in time to aid them unless we push on  but in what direction does the gully lie asked fred with a puzzled look  tom returned the look with one of perplexity for they were now a considerable distance both from bevans gully and pine tree diggings in the midst of an almost unknown wilderness  from the latter place either of the friends could have travelled to the former almost blindfold but having by that time lost their exact bearings they could only guess at the direction  i think said fred after looking round and up at the sky for some time considering the time we have been travelling and the position of the sun that the gully lies over yonder  indeed i feel almost sure it does  he pointed as he spoke towards a ridge of rocky ground that cut across the western sky and hid much of the more distant landscape in that direction  nonsense man returned tom sharply it lies in precisely the opposite direction  our adventures have turned your brain i think come dont let us lose time  think of betty that poor girl may be killed if there is another attack  she was slightly wounded last time come  fred looked quickly in his friends face  it was deeply flushed and his eye sparkled with unwonted fire  poor fellow his case is hopeless she will never wed him thought fred but he only said i too would not waste time but it seems to me we shall lose much if we go in that direction  the longer i study the nature of the ground and calculate our rate of travelling since we left the diggings the more am i convinced that our way lies westward  i feel as certain as you do replied tom with some asperity for he began to chafe under the delay  but if you are determined to go that way you must go by yourself old boy for i cant afford to waste time on a wrong road  nay if you are so sure i will give in and follow  lead on returned toms accommodating friend with a feeling of mingled surprise and chagrin  in less than an hour they reached a part of the rocky ridge before mentioned from which they had a magnificent view of the surrounding country  it was wilderness truly but such a wilderness of tree and bush river and lake cascade and pool flowering plant and festooned shrub dense thicket and rolling prairie backed here and there by cloudcapped hills as seldom meets the eye or thrills the heart of traveller except in alpine lands  deep pervading silence marked the hour for the air was perfectly still and though the bear the deer the wolf the fox and a multitude of wild creatures were revelling there in the rich enjoyment of natural life the vast region as it were absorbed and dissipated their voices almost as completely as their persons so that it seemed but a grand untenanted solitude just freshly laid out by the hand of the wonderworking creator  every sheet of water from the pool to the lake reflected an almost cloudless blue excepting towards the west where the sun by that time beginning to descend converted all into sheets of liquid gold  the two friends paused on the top of a knoll more to recover breath than to gaze on the exquisite scene for they both felt that they were speeding on a mission that might involve life or death  freds enthusiastic admiration however would no doubt have found vent in fitting words if he had not at the moment recognised a familiar landmark  i knew it he cried eagerly  look tom that is rangers hill on the horizon away to the left  it is very faint from distance but i could not mistake its form  nonsense fred you never saw it from this point of view before and hills change their shape amazingly from different points of view  come along  no i am too certain to dispute the matter any longer  if you will have it so we must indeed part here  but oh  tom dont be obstinate why what has come over you my dear fellow  dont you see  i see that evening is drawing on and that we shall be too late goodbye  one friendly helping hand will be better to her than none  i know im right  tom hurried away and poor fred after gazing in mingled surprise and grief at his comrade until he disappeared turned with a heavy sigh and went off in the opposite direction  well he muttered to himself as he sped along at a pace that might have made even a red man envious we are both of us young and strong so that we are well able to hold out for a considerable time on such light fare as the shrubs of the wilderness produce and when tom discovers his mistake hell make good use of his long legs to overtake me  i cannot understand his infatuation  but with gods blessing all shall yet be well  comforting himself with the last reflection and offering up a heartfelt prayer as he pressed on fred westly was soon separated from his friend by many a mile of wilderness  meanwhile tom brixton traversed the land with strides not only of tremendous length but unusual rapidity  his infatuation was not without its appropriate cause  the physical exertions and sufferings which the poor fellow had undergone for so long a period coupled with the grief amounting almost to despair which tormented his brain had at last culminated in fever and the flushed face and glittering eyes which his friend had set down to anxiety about bevans pretty daughter were in reality indications of the gathering fires within  so also was the obstinacy  for it must be admitted that the youths natural disposition was tainted with that objectionable quality which when fever drink or any other cause of madness operates in any man is apt to assert itself powerfully  at first he strode over the ground with terrific energy thinking only of betty and her father in imminent danger pausing now and then abruptly to draw his hand across his brow and wonder if he was getting near bevans gully  then as his mind began to wander he could not resist a tendency to shout  what a fool i am he muttered after having done this once or twice i suppose anxiety about that dear girl is almost driving me mad  but she can nevernever be mine  im a thief a thief  ha haaaah  the laugh that followed might have appalled even a red and painted warrior  it did terrify almost into fits all the tree and ground squirrels within a mile of him for these creatures went skurrying off to holes and topmost boughs in wild confusion when they heard it echoing through the woods  when this fit passed off tom took to thinking again  he strode over hillock swamp and plain in silence save when at long intervals he muttered the words think think thinking  always thinking  cant stop think thinking  innumerable wild fowl and many of the smaller animals of the woods met him in his mad career and fled from his path but one of these seemed at last inclined to dispute the path with him  it was a small brown bear which creature although insignificant when compared with the gigantic grizzly is nevertheless far more than a match for the most powerful unarmed man that ever lived  this rugged creature chanced to be rolling sluggishly along as if enjoying an evening saunter at the time when tom approached  the place was dotted with willow bushes so that when the two met there was not more than a hundred yards between them  the bear saw the man instantly and rose on its hind legs to do battle  at that moment tom lifted his eyes throwing up his arms he uttered a wild yell of surprise which culminated in a fit of demoniacal laughter  but there was no laughter apparent on poor toms flushed and fierce visage though it issued from his dry lips  without an instants hesitation he rushed at the bear with clenched fists  the animal did not await the charge  dropping humbly on its forelegs it turned tail and fled at such a pace that it soon left its pursuer far behind  just as it disappeared over a distant ridge tom came in sight of a small pond or lakelet covered with reeds and swarming with ducks and geese besides a host of plover and other aquatic birdsmost of them with outstretched necks wondering no doubt what all the hubbub could be about  tom incontinently bore down on these and dashing in among them was soon up to his neck in water  he remained quiet for a few minutes and deep silence pervaded the scene then the water began to feel chill  the wretched man crept out and remembering his errand resumed his rapid journey  soon the fever burned again with intensified violence and the power of connected thought began to depart from its victim altogether  while in this condition tom brixton wandered aimlessly about sometimes walking smartly for a mile or so at other times sauntering slowly as if he had no particular object in view and occasionally breaking into a run at full speed which usually ended in his falling exhausted on the ground  at last as darkness began to overspread the land he became so wornout that he flung himself down under a tree with a hazy impression on his mind that it was time to encamp for the night  the fever was fierce and rapid in its action  first it bereft him of reason and then left him prostrate without the power to move a limb except with the greatest difficulty  it was about the hour of noon when his reasoning powers returned and strange to say the first conscious act of his mind was to recall the words twice bought showing that the thought had been powerfully impressed on him before delirium set in  what he had said or done during his ravings he knew not for memory was a blank and no human friend had been there to behold or listen  at that time however tom did not think very deeply about these words or indeed about anything else  his prostration was so great that he did not care at first to follow out any line of thought or to move a limb  a sensation of absolute rest and total indifference seemed to enchain all his faculties  he did not even know where he was and did not care but lay perfectly still gazing up through the overhanging branches into the bright blue sky sometimes dozing off into a sleep that almost resembled death from which he awoke gently to wonder perhaps in an idle way what had come over him and then ceasing to wonder before the thought had become well defined  the first thing that roused him from this condition was a passing thought of betty bevan  he experienced something like a slight shock and the blood which had begun to stagnate received a new though feeble impulse at its fountainhead the heart  under the force of it he tried to rise but could not although he strove manfully  at last however he managed to raise himself on one elbow and looked round with dark and awfully large eyes while he drew his left hand tremblingly across his pale brow  he observed the trembling fingers and gazed at them inquiringly  ii must have been ill  so weak too  where am i  the forest everywhere  what can it all mean  there was aa thoughtwhat could itah  bettydear girlthat was it  but what of her  dangeryes in danger  ha now i have it  there came a slight flush on his pale cheeks and struggling again with his weakness he succeeded in getting on his feet but staggered and fell with a crash that rendered him insensible for a time  on recovering his mind was clearer and more capable of continuous thought but this power only served to show him that he was lost and that even if he had known his way to bevans gully his strength was utterly gone so that he could not render aid to the friends who stood in need of it so sorely  in the midst of these depressing thoughts an intense desire for food took possession of him and he gazed around with a sort of wolfish glare but there was no food within his reachnot even a wild berry  i believe that i am dying he said at last with deep solemnity  god forgive me  twice bought  fred said that jesus had bought my soul before the miners bought my life  for some time he lay motionless then rousing himself again began to speak in low disjointed sentences among which were words of prayer  it is terrible to die herealone he murmured recovering from one of his silent fits  oh that mother were here now dear dishonoured but still beloved mother  would that i had a pen to scratch a few words beforestay i have a pencil  he searched his pockets and found the desired implement but he could not find paper  the lining of his cap occurred to him it was soft and unfit for his purpose  looking sadly round he observed that the tree against which he leaned was a silverstemmed birch the inner bark of which he knew would serve his purpose  with great difficulty he tore off a small sheet of it and began to write while a little smile of contentment played on his lips  from time to time weakness compelled him to pause and more than once he fell asleep in the midst of his labour  heavy labour it was too for the nerveless hands almost refused to form the irregular scrawl  still he perseveredtill evening  then a burning thirst assailed him and he looked eagerly round for water but there was none in view  his eyes lighted up however as he listened for the soft tinkling of a tiny rill filled his ear  with a desperate effort he got upon his hands and knees and crept in the direction whence the sound came  he found the rill in a few moments and falling on his breast drank with feelings of intense gratitude in his heart  when satisfied he rose to his knees again and tried to return to his tree but even while making the effort he sank slowly on his breast pillowed his head on the wet green moss and fell into a profound slumber    chapter nine  we left fred hastening through the forest to the help of his friends at bevans gully  at first after parting from his comrade he looked back often and anxiously in the hope that tom might find out his mistake and return to him but as mile after mile was placed between them he felt that this hope was vain and turned all his energies of mind and body to the task that lay before him  this was to outwalk stalkers party of bandits and give timely warning to the bevans for although flinderss hints had been vague enough he readily guessed that the threatened danger was the descent of the robbers on their little homestead and it naturally occurred to his mind that this was probably the same party which had made the previous attack especially as he had observed several indians among them  young sanguine strong and active fred to use a not inapt phrase devoured the ground with his legs  sometimes he ran at other times he walked but more frequently he went along at an easy trot which although it looked slower than quick walking was in reality much faster besides being better suited to the rough ground he had to traverse  night came at last but night could not have arrested him if it had not been intensely dark  this however did not trouble him much for he knew that the same cause would arrest the progress of his foes and besides the moon would rise in an hour  he therefore flung himself on the ground for a short rest and fell asleep while praying that god would not suffer him to sleep too long  his prayer was answered for he awoke with a start an hour afterwards just as the first pale light of the not quite risen moon began to tinge the clear sky  fred felt very hungry and could not resist the tendency to meditate on beefsteaks and savoury cutlets for some time after resuming his journey but after warming to the work and especially after taking a long refreshing draught at a spring that bubbled like silver in the moonlight these longings passed away  hour after hour sped by and still the sturdy youth held on at the same steady pace for he knew well that to push beyond his natural strength in prolonged exertion would only deduct from the end of his journey whatever he might gain at the commencement  day broke at length  as it advanced the intense longing for food returned and to his great anxiety it was accompanied by a slight feeling of faintness  he therefore glanced about for wild fruits as he went along without diverging from his course and was fortunate to fall in with several bushes which afforded him a slight meal of berries  in the strength of these he ran on till noon when the faint feeling returned and he was fain to rest for a little beside a brawling brook  oh  father help me he murmured as he stooped to drink  on rising he continued to mutter to himself if only a tithe of my ordinary strength were left or if i had one good meal and a short rest i could be there in three hours but  whatever freds fears were he did not express them  he arose and recommenced his swinging trot with something like the pertinacity of a bloodhound on the scent  perhaps he was thinking of his previous conversation with tom brixton about being guided by god in all circumstances for the only remark that escaped him afterwards was it is my duty to act and leave results to him  towards the afternoon of that day paul bevan was busy mending a small cart in front of his hut when he observed a man to stagger out of the wood as if he had been drunk and approach the place where his plankbridge usually spanned the brook  it was drawn back however at the time and lay on the fortress side for paul had been rendered somewhat cautious by the recent assault on his premises  hallo betty he cried  yes father replied a sweet musical voice the owner of which issued from the doorway with her pretty arms covered with flour and her face flushed from the exertion of making bread  are the guns loaded lass  yes father replied betty turning her eyes in the direction towards which paul gazed  but i see only one man she added  ay an a drunk man too who couldnt make much of a fight if he wanted to  but lass the drunk man may have any number of men at his back both drunk and sober so its well to be ready  just fetch the revolvers an have em handy while i go down to meet him  father it seems to me i should know that figure  why itsno surely it cannot be young mister westly  no doubt of it girl  your eyes are better than mine but i see him clearer as he comes on  young westlydrunkha haas a hatter ill go help him over  paul chuckled immenselyas sinners are wont to do when they catch those whom they are pleased to call saints trippingbut when he had pushed the plank over and fred plunging across fell at his feet in a state of insensibility his mirth vanished and he stooped to examine him  his first act was to put his nose to the youths mouth and sniff  no smell o drink there he muttered  then he untied freds neckcloth and loosened his belt  then as nothing resulted from these acts he set himself to lift the fallen man in his arms  being a sturdy fellow he succeeded though with considerable difficulty and staggered with his burden towards the hut where he was met by his anxious daughter  why lass hes no more drunk than you are cried paul as he laid fred on his own bed  fetch me the brandyflaskno  well get him a cup of coffee if ye prefer it  it will be better for him father besides it is fortunately ready and hot  while the active girl ran to the outer room or hall of the hut for the desired beverage paul slily forced a teaspoonful of diluted brandy into freds mouth  it had at all events the effect of restoring him to consciousness for he opened his eyes and glanced from side to side with a bewildered air  then he sat up suddenly and said  paul the villains are on your track again  ive hastened ahead to tell you  id have been here soonerbutbut imstarving  eat theneat before you speak mr westly said betty placing food before him  but the matter is urgent cried fred  hold on mr fred said paul did you an the enemywhoever he may be though ive a pretty fair guessstart to come here together  within the same hour i should think  an did you camp for the night  no  at least i rested but one hour  then swallow some grub an make your mind easy  they wont be here for some hours yet for youve come on at a rate that no party of men could beat i see that clear enoughunless they was mounted  but a few of the chief men were mounted paul  pooh thats nothing  chief men wont come on without the ornary men it needs ornary men you know to make chief uns  ha ha  come now if you cant hold your tongue try to speak and eat at the same time  thus encouraged fred set to work on some bread and cheese and coffee with all the gusto of a starving man and at broken intervals blurted out all he knew and thought about the movements of the robber band as well as his own journey and his parting with brixton  tis a pity an strange too that he was so obstinate observed paul  but he thought he was right said betty and then she blushed with vexation at having been led by impulse even to appear to justify her lover  but paul took no notice  it matters not said he for it happens that you have found us almost on the wing westly  i knew full well that this fellow buxley  they call him stalker if you mean the robber chief interrupted fred  pooh  did you ever hear of a robber chief without half a dozen aliases rejoined paul  this buxley havin found out my quarters will never rest till he kills me so as ive no fancy to leave my little betty in an unprotected state yet a while we have packed up our goods and chattelsthey aint much to speak ofand intend to leave the old place this very night  your friend stalker wont attack till nighti know the villain wellbut your news inclines me to set off a little sooner than i intended  so what you have got to do is to lie down an rest while betty and i get the horse an cart ready  weve got a spare horse which youre welcome to  we sent little tolly trevor off to briants gulch to buy a pony for my little lass  he should have been back by this time if he succeeded in gettin it  but where do you mean to go to asked fred  to simpsons gully  why thats where tom and i were bound for when we fell in with stalker and his band  we shall probably meet tom returning  but the road is horribleindeed there is no road at all and i dont think a cart could  oh  i know that interrupted paul and have no intention of smashing up my cart in the woods  we shall go round by the plains lad  it is somewhat longer no doubt but once away we shall be able to laugh at men on foot if they are so foolish as to follow us  come now betty stir your stumps and finish your packing  ill go get the  a peculiar yell rent the air outside at that moment cutting short the sentence and almost petrifying the speaker who sprang up and began frantically to bar the door and windows of the hut at the same time growling theyve come sooner than i expected  whod have thought it bar the small window at the back betty an then fetch all the weapons i was so taken up wi you fred that i forgot to haul back the plank thats how theyve got over  help wi this tablesotheyll have some trouble to batter in the door wi that agin it an ive a flankin battery at the east corner to prevent them settin the place on fire  while the man spoke he acted with violent haste  fred sprang up and assisted him for the shockcoupled no doubt with the hot coffee and bread and cheesehad restored his energies at least for the time almost as effectually as if he had had a rest  they were only just in time for at that moment a man ran with a wild shout against the door  finding it fast he kept thundering against it with his heavy boots and shouting paul bevans name in unusually fierce tones  are ye there he demanded at last and stopped to listen  if youll make less noise mayhap yell find out growled paul  och  paul dear open av ye love me entreated the visitor in a voice there was no mistaking  i do believe its my mate flinders said fred  paul said nothing but proved himself to be of the same opinion by hastily unbarring and opening the door when in burst the irrepressible flinders wet from head to foot splashed all over with mud and blood and panting like a racehorse  is thattay yeve got theremy dear he asked in gasps  no it is coffee  let me give you some  thank ee kindlyfill it upmy dear  heres wishinye all luck  paddy drained the cup to the dregs wiped his mouth on the cuff of his coat and thus delivered himself  now dont all spake at wance  howld yer tongues an listen  av coorse muster freds towld ye when an where an how i jined the blackguards  yell be able now to guess why i did it  soon after i jined em i began to boast o my shootin in a way that would ha shocked me natral modesty av i hadnt done it for a raisin o me own well they boasted back so i defied em to a trial an soon showed em what i could do  there wasnt wan could come near me wi the rifle  so they made me hunterinchief to the band then an there  i wint out at wance an brought in a good supply o game  then as my time was short you see i gave em the slip nixt day an comed on here neck an crop through fire an water like a turkeybuzzard wi the cholera  an so here i am an theyll soon find out ive given em the slip an theyll come after me swearin perhaps an if i was you paul bevan i wouldnt stop to say how dye do to them  no more i will paddyan by good luck were about ready to start only ive got a fear for that poor boy tolly  if he comes back arter were gone an falls into their hands itll be a bad lookout for him  no fear o tolly said flinders hes a cute boy as can look after himself  by the way wheres muster tom  the reason of brixtons absence was explained to him by betty who bustled about the house packing up the few things that could be carried away while her father and fred busied themselves with the cart and horses outside  meanwhile the irishman continued to refresh himself with the bread and cheese  ye see its o no manner o use me tryin to help ye my dear he said apologetically for i niver was much of a hand at packin my exparience up to this time havin run pretty much in the way o havin little or nothin to pack  moreover im knocked up as well as hungry an ye seem such a good hand that it would be a pity to interfere wid ye  is there any chance o little tolly turnin up wi the pony before we start  every chance replied the girl smiling in spite of herself at the mans freeandeasy manner rather than his words  he ought to have been here by this time  we expect him every moment  but these expectations were disappointed for when they had packed the stout little cart harnessed and saddled the horses and were quite ready to start the boy had not appeared  we durstnt delay said paul with a look of intense annoyance an i cant think of how we are to let him know which way weve gone for i didnt think of telling him why we wanted another pony  he can read father  we might leave a note for him on the table and if he arrives before the robbers that would guide him  true betty but if the robbers should arrive before him that would also guide them  but were so sure of his returning almost immediately urged betty  not so sure o that lass  no we durstnt risk it an i cant think of anything else  poor tolly hell stand a bad chance for hes sure to come gallopin up an singin at the top of his voice in his usual reckless way  cudnt we stick up a bit o paper in the way hes bound to pass wid a big wooden finger to point it out and the word notice on it writ big  oh  i know what ill do cried betty  tolly will be sure to search all over the place for us and theres one place a sort of half cave in the cliff where he and i used to read together  hell be quite certain to look there  right lass an we may risk that for the reptiles wont think o sarchin the cliff  go betty write were off to simpsons gully by the plains  follow hard  thatll bring him on if they dont catch himpoor tolly  in a few minutes the note was written and stuck on the wall of the cave referred to then the party set off at a brisk trot paul betty and flinders in the cart while fred rode what its owner styled the spare horse  they had been gone about two hours when stalker alias buxley and his men arrived in an unenviable state of rage for they had discovered flinderss flight had guessed its object and now after hastening to bevans gully at top speed had reached it to find the birds flown  this they knew at once from the fact that the plankbridge quadrupled in width to let the horse and cart pass had been left undrawn as if to give them a mocking invitation to cross  stalker at once accepted the invitation  the astute bevan had however anticipated and prepared for this event by the clever use of a saw just before leaving  when the robberchief gained the middle of the bridge it snapped in two and let him down with a horrible rending of wood into the streamlet whence he emerged like a halfdrowned rat amid the illsuppressed laughter of his men  the damage he received was slight  it was only what flinders would have called a pleasant little way of showing attintion to his inimy before bidding him farewell  of course every nook and corner of the stronghold was examined with the utmost carealso with considerable caution for they knew not how many more traps and snares might have been laid for them  they did not however find those for whom they sought and what was worse in the estimation of some of the band they found nothing worth carrying away only one thing did they discover that was serviceable namely a large cask of gunpowder in the underground magazine formerly mentioned  bevan had thought of blowing this up before leaving for his cart was already too full to take it in but the hope that it might not be discovered and that he might afterwards return to fetch it away induced him to spare it  of course all the flasks and horns of the band were replenished from this store but there was still left a full third of the cask which they could not carry away  with this the leader determined to blow up the hut for he had given up all idea of pursuing the fugitives he and his men being too much exhausted for that  accordingly the cask was placed in the middle of the hut and all the unportable remains of paul bevans furniture were piled above it  then a slow match was made by rubbing gunpowder on some long strips of calico  this was applied and lighted and the robbers retired to a spot close to a spring about half a mile distant where they could watch the result in safety while they cooked some food  but these miscreants were bad judges of slow matches  their match turned out to be very slow  so slow that they began to fear it had gone outso slow that the daylight had time to disappear and the moon to commence her softly solemn journey across the dark skyso slow that stalker began seriously to think of sending a man to stir up the spark though he thought there might be difficulty in finding a volunteer for the dangerous jobso slow that a certain reckless little boy came galloping towards the fortress on a tall horse with a led pony plunging by his sideall before the spark of the match reached its destination and did its work  then at last there came a flush that made the soft moon look suddenly paler and lighted up the world as if the sun had shot a ray right through it from the antipodes  this was followed by a crash and a roar that caused the solid globe itself to vibrate and sent paul bevans fortress into the sky a mass of blackened ruins  one result was that a fiendish cheer arose from the robbers camp filling the night air with discord  another result was that the happygolucky little boy and his horses came to an almost miraculous halt and remained so for some time gazing straight before them in a state of abject amazement    chapter ten  how long tolly trevor remained in a state of horrified surprise no one can tell for he was incapable of observation at the time besides being alone  on returning to consciousness he found himself galloping towards the exploded fortress at full speed and did not draw rein till he approached the bank of the rivulet  reflecting that a thoroughbred hunter could not clear the stream even in daylight he tried to pull up but his horse refused  it had run away with him  although constitutionally brave the boy felt an unpleasant sensation of some sort as he contemplated the inevitable crash that awaited him for even if the horse should perceive his folly and try to stop on reaching the bank the tremendous pace attained would render the attempt futile  stop wont you  wooo cried tolly straining at the reins till the veins of his neck and forehead seemed about to burst  but the horse would neither stop nor wooo  it was otherwise however with the pony  that amiable creature had been trained well and had learned obedience  blessed quality  would that the human raceespecially its juvenile sectionunderstood better the value of that inestimable virtue  the pony began to pull back at the sound of wo  its portion in childhood had probably been woe when it refused to recognise the order  the result was that poor tollys right arm over which was thrown the ponys rein had to bear the strain of conflicting opinions  a bright idea struck his mind at this moment  bright ideas always do strike the mind of genius at critical moments  he grasped both the reins of his steed in his right hand and took a sudden turn of them round his wrist  then he turned aboutnot an instant too soonlooked the pony straight in the face and said wo in a voice of command that was irresistible  the pony stopped at once stuck out its fore legs and was absolutely dragged a short way over the ground  the strain on tollys arm was awful but the arm was a stout one though small  it stood the strain and the obstinate runaway was arrested on the brink of destruction with an almost broken jaw  the boy slipped to the ground and hastily fastened the steeds to a tree even in that hour of supreme anxiety he could not help felicitating himself on the successful application of pony docility to horsey selfwill  but these and all other feelings of humour and satisfaction were speedily put to flight when after crossing the remains of the plank bridge with some difficulty he stood before the hideous wreck of his friends late home where he had spent so many glad hours listening to marvellous adventures from paul bevan or learning how to read and cipher as well as drinking in wisdom generally from the rose of oregon  it was an awful collapse  a yawning gulf had been driven into the earth and the hutoriginally a solid structurehaving been hurled bodily skyward shattered to atoms and inextricably mixed in its parts had come down again into the gulf as into a readymade grave  it would be vain to search for any sort of letter sign or communication from his friends among the debris  tolly felt that at once yet he could not think of leaving without a search  after one deep and prolonged sigh he threw off his lethargy and began a close inspection of the surroundings  you see he muttered to himself as he moved quickly yet stealthily about theyd never have gone off without leavin some scrap of information for me to tell me which way theyd gone even though theyd gone off in a lightnin hurry  but praps they didnt  the reptiles may have comed on em unawares an left em no time to do anything  of course they cant have killed em  nobody ever could catch paul bevan asleepno not the sharpest redskin in the land  thats quite out o the question  though out of the question however the bare thought of such a catastrophe caused little trevors under lip to tremble a mist to obscure his vision and a somethingorother to fill his throat which he had to swallow with a gulp  moreover he went back to the ruined hut and began to pull about the wreck with a fluttering heart lest he should come on some evidence that his friends had been murdered  then he went to the highest part of the rock to rest a little and consider what had best be done next  while seated there gazing on the scene of silent desolation which the pale moonlight rendered more ghastly the poor boys spirit failed him a little  he buried his face in his hands and burst into tears  soon this weakness as he deemed it passed away  he dried his eyes roughly and rose to resume his search and it is more than probable that he would ere long have bethought him of the cave where betty had left her note if his attention had not been suddenly arrested by a faint glimmer of ruddy light in a distant part of the forest  the robbers were stirring up their fires and sending a telltale glow into the sky  oho exclaimed tolly trevor  he said nothing more but there was a depth of meaning in the tone and look accompanying that oho which baffles description  tightening his belt he at once glided down the slope flitted across the rivulet skimmed over the open space and melted into the forest after the most approved method of red indian tactics  the expedition from which he had just returned having been peaceful little trevor carried no warlike weaponsfor the long bowieknife at his side and the little hatchet stuck in his girdle were so to speak merely domestic implements without which he never moved abroad  but as war was not his object the want of rifle and revolver mattered little he soon reached the neighbourhood of the robbers fire and when close enough to render extreme caution necessary threw himself flat on the ground and advanced a la snakeinthegrass  presently he came within earshot and listened attentively though without much interest to a deal of boastful small talk with which the marauders beguiled the time while they fumigated their mouths and noses preparatory to turning in for the night  at last the name of paul bevan smote his ear causing it metaphorically to go on full cock  im sartin sure said one of the speakers that the old screw has gone right away to simpsons gully  if i thought that id follow him up and make a dash at the gully itself said stalker plucking a burning stick from the fire to rekindle his pipe  if you did youd get wopped remarked goff with a touch of sarcasm for the lieutenant of the band was not so respectful to his commander as a welldisciplined man should be  what makes you think so demanded the chief  the fact that the diggers are a sight too many for us returned goff why wed find em three to one if not four  well that coupled with the uncertainty of his having gone to simpsons gully said the chief decides me to make tracks down south to the big woods on the slopes of the sawback hills  there are plenty of parties travelling thereabouts with lots of gold boys and difficulties enough in the way of hunting us out o the stronghold ill leave you there for a short time and make a private excursion to simpsons gully to see if my enemy an the beautiful betty are there  an get yourself shot or stuck for your pains said goff  do you suppose that such a hulking longlegged fellow as you are can creep into a camp like an ornary man without drawin attention  perhaps not returned stalker but are there not such things as disguises  have you not seen me with my shootincoat and botanical box an blue spectacles an my naturally sandy hair  no no captain cried goff with a laugh not sandy say yellow or golden  well golden then if you will  youve seen it dyed black havent you  oh yes  ive seen you in these humblin circumstances before now returned the lieutenant and i must say your own mother wouldnt know you  but whats the use o runnin the risk captain  because i owe bevan a grudge said the chief sternly and mean to be revenged on him  besides i want the sweet betty for a wife and intend to have her whether she will or no  shell make a capital bandits wifeafter a little while when she gets used to the life  so now you know some of my plans and you shall see whether the hulking botanist wont carry all before him  oho muttered the snakeinthegrass very softly and there was something so compound and significant in the tone of that second oho soft though it was that it not only baffles description butreally you know it would be an insult to your understanding good reader to say more in the way of explanation  there was also a heaving of the snakes shoulders which although unaccompanied by sound was eminently suggestive  feeling that he had by that time heard quite enough tolly trevor effected a masterly retreat and returned to the place where he had left the horses  on the way he recalled with satisfaction the fact that paul bevan had once pointed out to him the exact direction of simpsons gully at a time when he meant to send him on an errand thither  youve ony to go over there lad paul had said pointing towards the forest in rear of his hut and hold on for two days straight as the crow flies till you come to it  you cant well miss it  tolly knew that there was also an easier though longer route by the plains but as he was not sure of it he made up his mind to take to the forest  the boy was sufficiently trained in woodcraft to feel pretty confident of finding his way for he knew the north side of trees by their bark and could find out the north star when the sky was clear besides possessing a sort of natural aptitude for holding on in a straight line he mounted the obstinate horse therefore took the rein of the obedient pony on his right arm and casting a last look of profound regret on bevans desolated homestead rode swiftly away  so eager was he that he took no thought for the morrow  he knew that the wallet slung at his saddlebow contained a small supply of foodas much probably as would last three days with care  that was enough to render tolly trevor the most independent and careless youth in oregon  while these events were occurring in the neighbourhood of bevans gully three red men in all the glory of vermilion charcoal and feathers were stalking through the forest in the vicinity of the spot where poor tom brixton had laid him down to die  these children of the wilderness stalked in single filefrom habit we presume for there was ample space for them to have walked abreast if so inclined  they seemed to be unsociable beings for they also stalked in solemn silence  suddenly the first savage came to an abrupt pause and said ho the second savage said he and the third said hi  after which for full a minute they stared at the ground in silent wonder and said nothing  they had seen a footprint  it did not by any means resemble that deep well developed and very solitary footprint at which robinson crusoe is wont to stare in nursery picturebooks  no it was a print which was totally invisible to ordinary eyes and revealed itself to these children of the woods in the form of a turned leaf and a cracked twig  such as it was it revealed a track which the three children followed up until they found tom brixtonor his bodylying on the ground near to the little spring  again these children said ho  he and hi respectively in varying tones according to their varied character  then they commenced a jabber which we are quite unable to translate and turned tom over on his back  the motion awoke him for he sat up and stared  even that effort proved too much for him in his weak state for he fell back and fainted  the indians proved to be men of promptitude  they lifted the white man up one got toms shoulders on his back another put his legs over his shoulders and thus they stalked away with him  when the first child of the wood grew tired the unburdened one stepped in to his relief when the second child grew tired the first one went to his aid when all the children grew tired they laid their burden on the ground and sat down beside it  thus by easy stages was tom brixton conveyed away from the spot where he had given himself up as hopelessly lost  now it could not have been more than six hours after tom had thus been borne away that poor tolly trevor came upon the same scene  we say poor advisedly for he had not only suffered the loss of much fragmentary clothing in his passage through that tangled wood but also most of the food with which he had started and a good deal of skin from his shins elbows knuckles and knees as well as the greater part of his patience  truly he was in a pitiable plight for the forest had turned out to be almost impassable for horses and in his journey he had not only fallen off and been swept out of the saddle by overhanging branches frequently but had to swim swamps cross torrents climb precipitous banks and had stuck in quagmires innumerable  as for the horsestheir previous owner could not have recognised them it is true they were what is styled all there but there was an inexpressible droop of their heads and tails a weary languor in their eyes and an abject waggle about their knees which told of hope deferred and spirit utterly gone  the pony was the better of the two  its sprightly glance of amiability had changed into a gaze of humble resignation whereas the aspect of the obstinate horse was one of impotent illnature  it would have bitten perhaps if strength had permitted but as to its running awayha  well tolly trevor approachedit could hardly be said he rode up to the spring before mentioned where he passed the footprints in stupid blindness  he dismounted however to drink and rest a while  come onyou brute he cried almost savagely dragging the horse to the water  the creature lowered its head and gazed as though to say what liquid is that  as the pony however at once took a long and hearty draught it also condescended to drink while tolly followed suit  afterwards he left the animals to graze and sat down under a neighbouring tree to rest and swallow his last morsel of food  it was sad to see the way in which the poor boy carefully shook out and gathered up the few crumbs in his wallet so that not one of them should be lost and how slowly he ate them as if to prolong the sensation of being gratified  during the two days which he had spent in the forest his face had grown perceptibly thinner and his strength had certainly diminished  even the reckless look of defiant joviality which was one of the boys chief characteristics had given place to a restless anxiety that prevented his seeing humour in anything and induced a feeling of impatience when a joke chanced irresistibly to bubble up in his mind  he was once again reduced almost to the weeping point but his sensations were somewhat different for when he had stood gazing at the wreck of bevans home the nether lip had trembled because of the sorrows of friends whereas now he was sorrowing because of an exhausted nature a weakened heart and a sinking spirit  but the spirit had not yet utterly given way  come he cried starting up  this wont do tolly  be a man  why only thinkyou have got over two days and two nights  that was the time allowed you by paul so your journeys all but donemust be  of course those brutesforgive me pony that brute i meanhas made me go much slower than if i had come on my own legs but notwithstanding it cannot behallo whats that  the exclamation had reference to a small dark object which lay a few yards from the spot on which he sat  he ran and picked it up  it was tom brixtons capwith his name rudely written on the lining  beside it lay a piece of bark on which was pencilwriting  with eager anxious haste the boy began to peruse it but he was unaccustomed to read handwriting and when poor tom had pencilled the lines his hand was weak and his brain confused so that the characters were doubly difficult to decipher  after much and prolonged effort the boy made out the beginning  it ran thus  this is probably the last letter that i tom brixton shall ever write i put down my name now in case i never finish it  o dearest mother  emotion had no doubt rendered the hand less steady at this point for here the words were quite illegibleat least to little trevorwho finally gave up the attempt in despair  the effect of this discovery however was to send the young blood coursing wildly through the veins so that a great measure of strength returned as if by magic  the boys first care was naturally to look for traces of the lost man and he set about this with a dull fear at his heart lest at any moment he should come upon the dead body of his friend  in a few minutes he discovered the track made by the indians which led him to the spot near to the spring where tom had fallen  to his now fullyawakened senses trevor easily read the story as far as signs could tell it  brixton had been all but starved to death  he had lain down under a tree to diethe very tree under which he himself had so recently given way to despair  while lying there hebrixtonhad scrawled his last words on the bit of birchbark  then he had tried to reach the spring but had fainted either before reaching it or after leaving  this he knew because the mark of toms coat part of his waistbelt and the handle of his bowieknife were all impressed on the softish ground with sufficient distinctness to be discerned by a sharp eye  the moccasined footprints told of indians having found brixtonstill alive for they would not have taken the trouble to carry him off if he had been dead the various sizes of the moccasined feet told that the party of indians numbered three and the trail of the red men with its occasional haltingplaces pointed out clearly the direction in which they had gone  happily this was also the direction in which little trevor was going  of course the boy did not read this off as readily as we have written it all down  it cost him upwards of an hours patient research but when at last he did arrive at the result of his studies he wasted no time in idle speculation  his first duty was to reach simpsons gully discover his friend paul bevan and deliver to him the piece of birchbark he had found and the information he had gleaned  by the time tolly had come to this conclusion his horse and pony had obtained both rest and nourishment enough to enable them to raise their drooping heads and tails an inch or two so that when the boy mounted the former with some of his old dash and energy it shook its head gave a short snort and went off at a fair trot  fortunately the ground improved just beyond this point opening out into parklike scenery which in another mile or two ran into level prairie land  this trevor knew from description was close to the mountain range in which lay the gully he was in quest of  the hope which had begun to rise increased and communicating itself probably by sympathetic electricity to the horse produced a shuffling gallop which ere long brought them to a clump of wood  on rounding this they came in sight of the longedfor hills  before nightfall simpsons gully was reached and little trevor was directed to the tent of paul bevan who had arrived there only the day before  its a strange story lad said paul after the boy had run rapidly over the chief points of the news he had to give to which betty fred and flinders sat listening with eager interest  we must be off to search for him without delay said fred westly rising  its right ye are sor cried flinders springing up  off tonight an not a moment to lose  well talk it over first boys said paul  come with me  ive a friend in the camp asll help us  did you not bring the piece of bark asked betty of the boy as the men went out  oh  i forgot  of course i did cried trevor drawing it from his breastpocket  the truth is im so knocked up that i scarce know what im about  lie down here on this deerskin poor boy and rest while i read it  tolly trevor flung himself on the rude but welcome couch and almost instantly fell asleep while betty bevan spreading the piece of birchbark on her knee began to spell out the words and try to make sense of tom brixtons last epistle    chapter eleven  with considerable difficulty betty bevan succeeded in deciphering the tremulous scrawl which tom brixton had written on the piece of birchbark  it ran somewhat as follows  this is probably the last letter that i tom brixton shall ever write i put down my name now in case i never finish it  o dearest mother what would i not now give to unsay all the hard things i have ever said to you and to undo all the evil i have done  but this cannot be twice bought  it is strange how these words run in my mind  i was condemned to death at the goldfieldsmy comrades bought me off freddear fredwho has been true and faithful to the lastreminded me that i had previously been bought with the blood of jesusthat i have been twice bought  i think he put it in this way to fix my obstinate spirit on the idea and he has succeeded  the thought has been burned in upon my soul as with fire  i am very very weakdying i fear in the forest and alone  how my mind seems to wander  i have slept since writing the last sentence and dreamed of food  curious mixing of ideas  i also dreamed of betty bevan  ah sweet girl if this ever meets your eye believe that i loved you sincerely  it is well that i should die perhaps for i have been a thief and would not ask your hand now even if i might  i would not sully it with a touch of mine and i could not expect you to believe in me after i tell you that i not only robbed gashford but also fredmy chum fredand gambled it all away and drank away my reason almost at the same time  i have slept again and dreamed of water this timebright pure crystal water sparkling and gushing in the sunshine  o god how i despised it once and how i long for it now  i am too weak and wandering mother to think about religion now  but why should i  your teaching has not been altogether thrown away it comes back like a great flood while i lie here dreaming and trying to write  the thoughts are confused but the sense comes home  all is easily summed up in the words you once taught me i am a poor sinner and nothing at all but jesus christ is all in all  not sure that i quote rightly  no matter the sense is there also  and yet it seemsit issuch a mean thing to sin away ones life and ask for pardon only at the endthe very end  but the thief on the cross did it why not i  sleepis it sleep may it not be slowlyapproaching deathhas overpowered me again  i have been attempting to read this  i seem to have mixed things somehow  it is sadly confusedor my mind is  a burning thirst consumes meandi think i hear water running  i will  here the letter ended abruptly  no doubt murmured betty as she let the piece of bark fall on the table and clasped her hands over her eyes he rose and tried to reach the water  praise god that there is hope  she sat for a few seconds in profound silence which was broken by paul and his friends reentering the tent  its all arranged betty he said taking down an old rifle which hung above the door old larkins has agreed to look arter my claim and take care of you lass while were away  i shall need no one to take care of me  ah so you think for youre as brave as youre good buti think otherwise  so hell look arter you  indeed he wont father returned betty smiling because i intend that you shall look after me  impossible girl  im going to sarch for tom brixton you see along with mister fred an flinders so i cant stop here with you  but i am going too father  butbut we cant wait for you my good girl returned paul with a perplexed look were all ready to start an there aint a hoss for you except the poor critters that tolly trevor brought wi him an you know they need rest very badly  well well go off father i wont delay you said betty and dont disturb tolly let him sleep he needs it poor boy  i will take care of him and his horses  that tolly required rest was very obvious for he lay sprawling on the deerskin couch just as he had flung himself down buried in the profoundest sleep he perhaps ever experienced since his career in the wilderness began  after the men had gone off betty bevanwho was by that time better known at least among those young diggers whose souls were poetical as the rose of oregon and among the matteroffact ones as the beautiful nuggetconducted herself in a manner that would have increased the admiration of her admirers if they had seen her and awakened their curiosity also  first of all she went out to the halfruined loghut that served her father for a stable and watered fed and rubbed down the horse and pony which tolly had brought in a manner that would have done credit to a regular groom  then returning to the tent she arranged and packed a couple of saddlebags with certain articles of clothing as well as biscuits dried meat and other provisions  next she cleaned and put in order a couple of revolvers a bowieknife and a small hatchet and ultimately having made sundry other mysterious preparations she lifted the curtain which divided the tent into two parts and entered her own private apartment  there after reading her nightly portion of gods word and committing herself and those who were out searching in the wilderness for the lost man to his care she lay down with her clothes on and almost instantly fell into a slumber as profound as that which had already overwhelmed tolly  as for that exhausted little fellow he did not move during the whole night save once when an adventurous insect of the earwig type walked across his ruddy cheek and upper lip and looked up his nose  there are sensitive portions of the human frame which may not be touched with impunity  the sleeper sneezed blew the earwig out of existence rolled over on his back flung his arms wide open and with his mouth in the same condition spent the remainder of the night in motionless repose  the sun was well up next morning and the miners of simpsons gully were all busy up to their knees in mud and gold when betty bevan awoke sprang up ran into the outer apartment of her tent and gazed admiringly at tollys face  a band of audacious and early flies were tickling it and causing the features to twitch but they could not waken the sleeper  betty gazed only for a moment with an amused expression and then shook the boy somewhat vigorously  come tolly rise  oh dont bborrer  but i must bother  wake up i say  fire  at the last word the boy sat up and gazed idiotically  hallo  bettymy dear nuggetis that you  why where am i  your body is here said betty laughing  when your mind comes to the same place ill talk to you  im all here now betty so go ahead said the boy with a hearty yawn as he arose and stretched himself  oh  i remember now all about it  where is your father  i will tell you presently but first let me know what you mean by calling me nugget  why dont you know  its the name the men give you everywhereone of the names at leastthe beautiful nugget  indeed exclaimed the nugget with a laugh and blush very impudent of the men and pray if this is one of the names what may the others be  theres only one other that i know ofthe rose of oregon  but come its not fair of you to screw my secrets out o me when im only half awake and you havent yet told me where paul bevan is  ill tell you that when i see you busy with this pork pie returned the rose  i made it myself so you ought to find it good  be quick for i have work for you to do and there is no time to lose  content yourself with a cold breakfast for once  humph as if i hadnt contented myself with a cold breakfast at any time  well it is a good pie  nowabout paul  he has gone away with mr westly and flinders to search for mr brixton  what without me exclaimed tolly overturning his chair as he started up and pushed his plate from him  yes without you tolly i advised him not to awake you  its the unkindest thing youve ever done to me returned the boy scarcely able to restrain his tears at the disappointment  how can they know where to search for him without me to guide them  why didnt you let them waken me  you forget tolly that my father knows every inch of these woods and plains for at least fifty miles round the old house they have blown up and as to waking you it would have been next to impossible to have done so you were so tired and you would have been quite unable to keep your eyes open  besides i had a little plan of my own which i want you to help me to carry out  go on with your breakfast and ill explain  the boy sat down to his meal again without speaking but with a look of much curiosity on his expressive face  you know without my telling you continued betty that i like my father have a considerable knowledge of this part of the country and of the ways of indians and miners and from what you have told me coupled with what father has said i think it likely that the indians have carried poor tmr brixton i meanthrough the long gap rather than by the plains  so i would have said had they consulted me interrupted the boy with an offended air  well but continued betty they would neither have consulted you nor me for father has a very decided will you know and a belief in his own judgmentwhich is quite right of course only i cannot help differing from him on this occasion  no more can i growled tolly thrusting his fork into the pie at a tempting piece of pork  so you see im going to take the big horse you brought here and ride round by the long gap to see if im right and i want you to go with me on the pony and take care of me  tolly trevor felt his heart swell with gratification at the idea of his being the chosen protector of the rose of oregonthe beautiful nugget selected by herself too  nevertheless his good sense partially subdued his vanity on the point  but i say he remarked looking up with a halfserious expression dyou think that you and i are a sufficient party to make a good fight if we are attacked by redskins  you know your father will hold me responsible for carrying you off into the midst of danger in this fashion  i dont mean to fight at all returned betty with a pleasant laugh and i will free you from all responsibility so have done now and come along  its so good said tolly looking as though he were loath to quit the pork pie but come im your man  only dont you think it would be as well to get up a good fighting party among the young miners to go with us  theyd only be too happy to take service under the beautiful nugget you know  tolly exclaimed the nugget with more than her wonted firmness if you are to take service under me you must learn to obey without question  now go and saddle the horses  the big one for me the pony for yourself  put the saddlebags on the horse and be quick  there was a tone and manner about the usually quiet and gentle girl which surprised and quite overawed little trevor so that he was reduced at once to an obedient and willing slave  indeed he was rather glad than otherwise that betty had declined to listen to his suggestion about the army of young diggerswhich an honest doubt as to his own capacity to fight and conquer all who might chance to come in his way had induced him to makewhile he was by no means unwilling to undertake singlehanded any duties his fair conductor should require of him  in a few minutes therefore the steeds were brought round to the door of the tent where betty already stood equipped for the journey  our fair readers will not we trust be prejudiced against the rose of oregon when we inform them that she had adopted mans attitude in riding  her costume was arranged very much after the pattern of the indian womens dressnamely a closefitting body a short woollen skirt reaching a little below the knees and blue cloth leggings in continuation  these latter were elegantly wrought with coloured silk thread and the pair of moccasins which covered her small feet were similarly ornamented  a little cloth cap in shape resembling that of a cavalry foraging cap but without ornaments graced her head from beneath which her wavy hair tumbled in luxuriant curls on her shoulders and as tolly was wont to remark looked after itself anyhow  such a costume was well adapted to the masculine position on horseback as well as to the conditions of a land in which no roads but much underwood existed  bevans tent having been pitched near the outskirts of simpsons camp the maiden and her gallant protector had no difficulty in quitting it unobserved  riding slowly at first to avoid attracting attention as well as to pick their steps more easily over the somewhat rugged ground near the camp they soon reached the edge of an extensive plain at the extremity of which a thin purple line indicated a range of hills  here tolly trevor unable to restrain his joy at the prospect of adventure before him uttered a warwhoop brought his switch down smartly on the ponys flank and shot away over the plain like a wild creature  the air was bracing the prospect was fair the sunshine was bright  no wonder that the obedient pony forgetting for the moment the fatigues of the past and strong in the enjoyment of the previous nights rest and supper went over the ground at a pace that harmonised with its young riders excitement and no wonder that the obstinate horse was inclined to emulate the pony and stretched its long legs into a wild gallop encouraged thereto by the rose on its back  the gallop was ere long pressed to racing speed and there is no saying when the young pair would have pulled uphad they not met with a sudden check by the pony putting his foot into a badgerhole  the result was frightful to witness though trifling in result  the pony went heels over head upon the plain like a rolling wheel and its rider shot into the air like a stone from a catapult  describing a magnificent curve and coming down head foremost tolly would then and there have ended his career if he had not fortunately dropped into a thick bush which broke his fall instead of his neck and saved him  indeed excepting several ugly scratches he was none the worse for the misadventure  poor horrified betty attempted to pull up but the obstinate horse had got the bit in his teeth and declined so that when tolly had scrambled out of the bush she was barely visible in the far distance heading towards the blue hills  hallo was her protectors anxious remark as he gazed at the flying fair one  then without another word he leaped on the pony and went after her at full speed quite regardless of recent experience  the blue hills had become green hills and the long gap was almost reached before the obstinate horse suffered itself to be reined in probably because it was getting tired  soon afterwards the pony came panting up  youre not hurt i hope said betty anxiously as tolly came alongside  oh no  all right replied the boy but i say what a run you have given me  why didnt you wait for me  ask that of the horse tolly  what  did he bolt with you  truly he did  i never before rode such a stubborn brute  my efforts to check it were useless as it had the bit in its teeth and i did my best for i was terribly anxious about you and cannot imagine how you escaped a broken neck after such a flight  it was the bush that saved me betty  but i say we seem to be nearing a wildish sort of place  yes this is the long gap returned the girl flinging back her curls and looking round  it cuts right through the range here and becomes much wilder and more difficult to traverse on horseback farther on  and what dye mean to do betty inquired the boy as they rode at a footpace towards the opening which seemed like a dark portal to the hills  suppose you discover that the redskins have carried tom brixton off in this direction what then  you and i wont be able to rescue him you know  true tolly  if i find that they have taken him this way i will ride straight to fathers encampmenthe told me before starting where he intends to sleep tonight so i shall easily find himtell him what we have discovered and lead him back here  and suppose you dont find that the redskins have come this way rejoined tolly after a doubtful shake of his head what then  why then i shall return to our tent and leave father and mr westly to hunt them down  and suppose continued tollybut tolly never finished the supposition for at that moment two painted indians sprang from the bushes on either side of the narrow track and almost before the riders could realise what had happened the boy found himself on his back with a savage hand at his throat and the girl found herself on the ground with the hand of a grinning savage on her shoulder  tolly trevor struggled manfully but alas also boyishly for though his spirit was strong his bodily strength was smallat least as compared with that of the savage who held him  yes tolly struggled like a hero he beheld the rose of oregon taken captive and his blood boiled  he bit he kicked he scratched and he hissed with indignationbut it would not do  oh if youd only let me up and give me one chance he gasped  but the red man did not consentindeed he did not understand nevertheless it was obvious that the savage was not vindictive for although tollys teeth and fists and toes and nails had wrought him some damage he neither stabbed nor scalped the boy  he only choked him into a state of semiunconsciousness and then turning him on his face tied his hands behind his back with a deerskin thong  meanwhile the other savage busied himself in examining the saddlebags of the obstinate horse  he did not appear to think it worth while to tie the hands of betty  during the short scuffle between his comrade and the boy he had held her fast because she manifested an intention to run to the rescue  when that was ended he relieved her of the weapons she carried and let her go satisfied no doubt that if she attempted to run away he could easily overtake her and if she were to attempt anything else he could restrain her  when however betty saw that tollys antagonist meant no harm she wisely attempted nothing but sat down on a fallen tree to await the issue  the savages did not keep her long in suspense  tollys foe having bound him lifted him on the back of the pony and then taking the bridle quietly led it away  at the same time the other savage assisted betty to remount the horse and grasping the bridle of that obstinate creature followed his comrade  the whole thing was so sudden so violent and the result so decisive that the boy looked back at betty and burst into a halfhysterical fit of laughter but the girl did not respond  its a serious business tolly she said  so it is betty he replied  then pursing his little mouth and gathering his eyebrows into a frown he gave himself up to meditation while the indians conducted them into the dark recesses of the long gap    chapter twelve  now the indians into whose hands the rose of oregon and our little hero had fallen happened to be part of the tribe to which the three who had discovered tom brixton belonged and although his friends little knew it tom himself was not more than a mile or so distant from them at the time having been carried in the same direction towards the main camp or headquarters of the tribe in the sawback hills  they had not met on the journey because the two bands of the tribe were acting independently of each other  we will leave them at this point and ask the reader to return to another part of the plain over which tolly and betty had galloped so furiously  it is a small hollow at the bottom of which a piece of marshy ground has encouraged the growth of a few willows  paul bevan had selected it as a suitable campingground for the night and while paddy flinders busied himself with the kettle and fryingpan he and fred westly went among the bushes to procure firewood  fred soon returned with small twigs sufficient to kindle the fire his companion went on further in search of larger boughs and logs  while fred was busily engaged on hands and knees blowing the fire into a flame a sharp hallo from his companion caused him to look up  what is it he asked  goliath of gathor his brother said paddy pointing to a little eminence behind which the sun had but recently set  the horseman who had come to a halt on the eminence and was quietly regarding them did indeed look as if he might have claimed kinship with the giant of the philistines for he and his steed looked stupendous no doubt the peculiarity of their position with the bright sky as a glowing background had something to do with the gigantic appearance of horse and man for as they slowly descended the slope towards the fire both of them assumed a more natural size  the rider was a strangelooking as well as a large man for he wore a loose shootingcoat a tall wideawake with a broad brim blue spectacles with sidepieces to them and a pair of trousers which appeared to have been made for a smaller man as besides being too tight they were much too short  over his shoulder was slung a green tin botanical box  he carried no visible weapons save a small hatchet and a bowieknife though his capacious pockets might easily have concealed half a dozen revolvers  goot night my frunds said the stranger in broken english as he approached  the same to yersilf sor returned flinders  anyone who had been closely watching the countenance of the stranger might have observed a sudden gleam of surprise on it when the irishman spoke but it passed instantly and was replaced by a pleasant air of good fellowship as he dismounted and led his horse nearer the fire  good night and welcome to our camp  you are a foreigner i perceive said fred westly in french but the stranger shook his head  i not unerstan  ah a german probably returned fred trying him with the language of the fatherland but again the stranger shook his head  you mus spok english  i is a swedish man knows noting but a leetil english  im sorry that i cannot speak swedish replied fred in english so we must converse in my native tongue  you are welcome to share our camp  have you travelled far  fred cast a keen glance of suspicion at the stranger as he spoke and in spite of himself there was a decided diminution in the heartiness of his tones but the stranger did not appear to observe either the change of tone or the glance for he replied with increased urbanity and openness of manner yis i has roden farvery faran moche wants meat an sleep  as he spoke paul bevan came staggering into camp under a heavy load of wood and again it may be said that a close observer might have noticed on the strangers face a gleam of surprise much more intense than the previous one when he saw paul bevan  but the gleam had utterly vanished when that worthy having thrown down his load looked up and bade him good evening  the urbanity of manner and blandness of expression increased as he returned the salutation  tanks tanks  i vill go for hubblevat you callhobble me horse he said taking the animals bridle and leading it a short distance from the fire  i dont like the look of him whispered fred to paul when he was out of earshot  sure an i howld the same opinion said flinders  pooh  never judge men by their looks returned bevanspecially in the diggins  theyre all blackguards or fools more or less  this one seems to be one o the fools  ive seed sitch critters before  they keep fillin their little boxes wi grass an stuff an never makes any use of it that i could see  but every man to his taste  ill be bound hes a good enough feller when ye come to know him an git over yer contempt for his idle ways  very likely he draws tooan plays the flute most o these furriners do  come now flinders look alive wi the grub  when the stranger returned to the fire he spread his huge hands over it and rubbed them with apparent satisfaction  fat a goot ting is supper he remarked with a benignant look all round the very smell of him be deliciowse  an no mistake added flinders  sure the half the good o victuals would be lost av they had no smell  where have you come from stranger asked bevan as they were about to begin supper  from de sawbuk hills answered the botanist filling his mouth with an enormous mass of dried meat  ay indeed  thats just where we are goin to returned bevan  an vere may you be come from asked the stranger  from simpsons gully said fred  ha how cooriouse  dat be joost vere i be go to  the conversation flagged a little at this point as they warmed to the work of feeding but after a little it was resumed and then their visitor gradually ingratiated himself with his new friends to such an extent that the suspicions of fred and flinders were somewhat though not altogether allayed  at last they became sufficiently confidential to inform the stranger of their object in going to the sawback hills  ha  vat is dat you say he exclaimed with wellfeigned surprise von yoong man carried avay by ridskins  i sawd dem  did pass dem not longe ago  tree mans carry von man  i tink him a sick comrade but now i reklect hims face vas vhitish  could ye guide us to the place where ye met them asked bevan quickly  the botanist did not reply at once but seemed to consider  vell i has not moche time to spare but come i has pity for you an dont mind if i goes out of de vay to help you  i vill go back to the sawbuk hills so far as need be  thank ee kindly returned bevan who possessed a grateful spirit ill think better of yer grassgatherin after this though it does puzzle me awful to make out whats the use ye put it to  if you kep tame rabbits now i could understand it but to carry it about in a green box an go squeezin it between the leaves o books as ive seed some of ee do seems to me the most outrageous  ha ha interrupted the botanist with a loud laugh you is not the first what tink hims nonsense  but you mus know dere be moche sense in ithe looked very grave and wise herevery moche  first ye finds him den ye squeezes an dries him den ye sticks him in von book an names him den ye talks about him oh dere is moche use in him very moche  well but arter youve found an squeezed an dried an stuck an named an talked about him repeated paul with a slight look of contempt what the better are ye for it all  vy ve is moche de better returned the botanist for den ve tries to find out all about him  ve magnifies him an writes vat ve zee about him an compares him vid oders of de same family an boils an stews an fries an melts an dissolves an mixes him till ve gits someting out of him  its little id expect to git out of him after tratin him so badly remarked flinders whose hunger was gradually giving way before the influence of venison steaks  true me frund returned the stranger it is ver leetil ve gits but den dat leetil is ver gootvalooable you calls it  humph ejaculated bevan with an air that betokened doubt  flinders and fred said nothing but the latter felt more than ever inclined to believe that their guest was a deceiver and resolved to watch him narrowly  on his part the stranger seemed to perceive that fred suspected him but he was not rendered less hearty or freeandeasy on that account  in the course of conversation paul chanced to refer to betty  ah me frund said the stranger has you brought yous vife to dis vile contry  no i havent replied paul bluntly  oh pardon  i did tink you spoke of bettie an surely dat is voomans name  ay but bettys my darter not my wife returned paul who resented this inquisition with regard to his private affairs  is you not fraid said the botanist quietly helping himself to a marrowbone to leave yous darter at simpsons gully  who told you i left her there asked bevan with increasing asperity  oh  i only tink so as yous come from dere  an why should i be afraid  because me frund de contry be full ob scoundrils  yes an you are one of the biggest of them thought fred westly but he kept his thoughts to himself while paul muttered something about being well protected and having no occasion to be afraid  perceiving the subject to be distasteful the stranger quickly changed it  soon afterwards each man rolling himself in his blanket went to sleepor appeared to do so  in regard to paddy flinders at least there could be no doubt for the trombonetones of his nose were eloquent  paul too lay on his back with eyes tight shut and mouth wide open while the regular heaving of his broad chest told that his slumbers were deep  but more than once fred westly raised his head gently and looked suspiciously round  at last in his case also tired nature asserted herself and his deep regular breathing proved that the sweet restorer was at work though an occasional movement showed that his sleep was not so profound as that of his comrades  the big botanist remained perfectly motionless from the time he lay down as if the sleep of infancy had passed with him into the period of manhood  it was not till the fire had died completely down and the moon had set leaving only the stars to make darkness visible that he moved  he did so not as a sleeper awaking but with the slow stealthy action of one who is already wide awake and has a purpose in view  gradually his huge shoulders rose till he rested on his left elbow  a sense of danger which had never left him even while he slept aroused fred but he did not lose his selfpossession  he carefully watched from the other side of the extinct fire the motions of the stranger and lay perfectly stillonly tightening his grasp on the knifehandle that he had been instinctively holding when he dropped asleep  the night was too dark for fred to distinguish the mans features  he could only perceive the outline of his black figure and that for some time he rested on his elbow without moving as if he were contemplating the stars  despite his efforts to keep awake fred felt that drowsiness was again slowly but surely overcoming him  maintaining the struggle however he kept his dreamy eyes riveted on their guest until he seemed to swell into gigantic proportions  presently fred was again thoroughly aroused by observing that the right arm of the man moved slowly upwards and something like a knife appeared in the hand he even fancied he saw it gleam though there was not light enough to render that possible  feeling restrained as if under the horrible influence of nightmare fred lay there spellbound and quite unable to move until he perceived the strangers form bend over in the direction of paul bevan who lay on the other side of him  then indeed freds powers returned  shouting look out paul he sprang up drew his bowieknife and leaped over the blackened logs but to his surprise and confusion found that the stranger lay extended on the ground as if sound asleep  he roused himself however and sat up as did the others on hearing freds shout  fat is wrong yoong man he inquired with a look of sleepy surprise  ye may well ax that sor said flinders staggering to his feet and seizing his axe which always lay handy at his side  paul had glanced round sharply like a man inured to danger but seeing nothing to alarm him had remained in a sitting position  why westly youve been dreaming he said with a broad grin  so i must have been returned the youth looking very much ashamed but youve no notion what a horrible dream i had  it seemed so real too that i could not help jumping up and shouting  pardon me comrades and as bad boys say when caught in mischief i wont do it again  ve pardon you by all means said the botanist stretching himself and yawning and ve do so vid de more pleasure for you has rouse us in time for start on de joorney  youre about right  its time we was off said paul rising slowly to his feet and looking round the horizon and up at the sky while he proceeded to fill a beloved little black pipe which invariably constituted his preliminary little breakfast  pat flinders busied himself in blowing up the embers of the fire  a slight and rapidly eaten meal sufficed to prepare these hardy backwoodsmen for their journey and long before daybreak illumined the plains they were far on their way towards the sawback mountain range  during the journey of two days which this trip involved the botanist seemed to change his character to some extent  he became silentalmost morose did not encourage the various efforts made by his companions to draw him into conversation and frequently rode alone in advance of the party or occasionally fell behind them  the day after the stranger had joined them as they were trotting slowly over the plains that lay between the rangers hill and the sawbacks fred rode close up to bevan and said in a low voice glancing at the botanist who was in advance  i am convinced paul that he is a scoundrel  that may be so mr fred but what then  why then i conclude that he is deceiving us for some purpose of his own  nonsense replied bevan who was apt to express himself bluntly what purpose can he serve in deceiving strangers like us  we carry no golddust and have nothing worth robbing us of even if he were fool enough to think of attemptin such a thing  then he can scarcely be deceivin us in sayin that he met three redskins carryin off a white manan what good could it do him if he is  besides he is goin out of his way to sarve us  it is impossible for me to answer your question paul but i understand enough of both french and german to know that his broken english is a mere shama mixture and a bad one too of what no german or frenchman would useso its not likely to be the sort of bad english that a swede would speak  moreover i have caught him once or twice using english words correctly at one time and wrongly at another  no you may depend on it that whatever his object may be he is deceiving us  its mesilf as agrees wid ye sor said flinders who had been listening attentively to the conversation  the mans no more a swede than an irishman but what can we do wid oursilves  true or false hes ladin us in the diriction we want to go an it would do no good to say to him ye spalpeen yer decavin of us for hed only say he wasnt or may be hed cut up rough an lave usbut after all it might be the best way to push him up to that  i think not said bevan  doesnt english law say that a man should be held innocent till hes proved guilty  its little i know or care about english law answered flinders but im sure enough that irish law howlds a bad man to be guilty till hes proved innocentat laste av it dosnt it should  youd better go an pump him a bit mr fred said bevan were close up to the sawback range another hour an well be among the mountains  they were turning round the spur of a little hillock as he spoke before fred could reply a small deer sprang from its lair cast on the intruders one startled gaze and then bounded gracefully into the bush too late however to escape from bevans deadly rifle  it had barely gone ten yards when a sharp crack was heard the animal sprang high into the air and fell dead upon the ground  bad luck to ye bevan exclaimed flinders who had also taken aim at it but not with sufficient speed isnt that always the way ye do plucks the baste out o me very hand  sure i had me sights lined on it as straight as could be wan second more an id have sent a bullet right into its brain when crack ye go before me  och its onkind to say the laste of it  why cudnt ye gi me a chance  im sorry flinders but i couldnt well help it  the critter rose right in front o me  vat a goot shote you is exclaimed the botanist riding back to them and surveying the prostrate deer through his blue spectacles  ay and its a lucky shot too said fred for our provisions are running low  but perchance we shant want much more food before reaching the indian camp  you said i think that you have a good guess where the camp lies misterwhat shall we call you  call me vat you please returned the stranger with a peculiar smile i is not partickler  some of me frunds calls me mr botaniste  well mr botanist the camp cannot be far off now an it seems to me that we should have overtaken men travelling on foot by this time  ye vill surely come on de tracks dis naight or de morrow replied the botanist riding forward after bevan had secured the carcass of the deer to his saddlebow bot ye must have patience yoong blood be always too hote  all in goot time  with this reply fred was fain to content himself for no amount of pressure availed to draw anything more satisfactory out of their strange guide  before sunset they had penetrated some distance into the sawback range and then proceeded to make their encampment for the night under the spreading branches of a lordly pine    chapter thirteen  tables are frequently turned in this world in more senses than one  as was said in the last chapter the romantic pair who were in search of the indians did not find those for whom they sought but as fickle fortune willed it those for whom they sought found them  it happened thus  soon after the rose of oregon and her young champion with their captors had passed through the long gap crossed the plain and entered the sawback hills they fell in with a band of twenty indians who from their appearance and costume evidently belonged to the same tribe as their captors  from the manner in which they met also it seemed that they had been in search of each other and had something interesting to communicate for they gesticulated much pointed frequently to the sky and to various directions of the compass chattered excitedly showed their brilliant teeth in fitful gleams and glittered quite awfully about the eyes  they paid little attention at first to their prisoners who remained sitting on their steeds looking on with interest and some anxiety  o betty what would i not give to have my arms free just now  what a chance it would be for a bold dash and a glorious run  youd make little of it on such rough ground tolly  pooh  id try it on any ground  just fancy id begin with a clear leap over that chiefs headthe one there wi the feathers an the long nose thats makin such hideous facesthen away up the glen over the stones down the hollows shoutin like mad an clearin the brooks and precipices with a band o yellin redskins at my tail  isnt it enough to drive a fellow wild to be on the brink of such a chance an miss it i say havent you got a penknife in your pocketno  not even a pair o scissors  why i thought you women never travelled without scissors  alas  tolly i have not even scissors besides if i had it would take me at least two minutes with all the strength of my fingers to cut the thongs that bind you with scissors and i dont think the redskins would stand quietly by and look on while i did it  but what say you to me trying it by myself  quite useless returned tolly  youd be caught at onceor break your neck  and youd never get on you know without me  no no weve got fairly into a fix an i dont see my way out of it  if my hands were free we might attempt anything but what can a fellow do when tied up in this fashion  he can submit tolly and wait patiently  tolly did not feel inclined to submit and was not possessed of much patience but he was too fond of betty to answer flippantly  he therefore let his feelings escape through the safetyvalve of a great sigh and relapsed into pensive silence  meanwhile the attention of the band of savages was attracted to another small band of natives which approached them from the eastward  that these were also friends was evident from the fact that the larger band made no hostile demonstration but quietly awaited the coming up of the others  the newcomers were three in number and two of them bore on their shoulders what appeared to be the body of a man wrapped up in a blanket  theyve got a wounded comrade with them i think said little trevor  so it would seem replied betty with a dash of pity in her tone for she was powerfully sympathetic  the savages laid the form in the blanket on the ground and began to talk earnestly with their comrades  its not dead yet anyhow remarked tolly for i see it move  i wonder whether it is a man or a woman  mayhap its their old grandmother theyre giving a little exercise to  ive heard that some o the redskins are affectionate sort o fellows though most of em are hard enough on the old folk  as he spoke he looked up in bettys face  just as he did so a startling change came over that face  it suddenly became ashy pale the large eyes dilated to their utmost extent and the mouth opened with a short gasp  in great alarm the boy turned his eyes in the direction in which the girl gazed so fixedly and then his own visage assumed a somewhat similar appearance as he beheld the pale thin cadaverous countenance of his friend tom brixton from off which a corner of the blanket had just slipped  but for the slight motion above referred to tom might have been mistaken for a dead man for his eyes were closed and his lips bloodless  uttering a sudden shout tolly trevor flung himself headlong off the pony and tried to get on his feet but failed owing to his hands being tied behind him  betty also leaped to the ground and running to where tom lay went down on her knees and raised his head in her hands  the poor youth being roused opened his eyes  they were terribly sunken and large but when they met those of betty they enlarged to an extent that seemed positively awful and a faint tinge of colour came to his hollow cheeks  betty he whispered cancan it be possible  yes it is i  surely god must have sent me to save your life  i fear not dear  he stopped abruptly and shut his eyes  for a few moments it seemed as if he were dead but presently he opened them again and said faintly it is too late i fear  you are very kind but ii feel so terribly weak that i think i am dying  by this time tolly having managed to get on his feet stood beside his friend on whom he gazed with intense anxiety  even the indians were solemnised by what appeared to be a deathscene  have you been wounded asked the girl quickly  no only starved returned tom a slight smile of humour flickering for a second on his pale face even in that hour of his extremity  have the indians given you anything to eat since they found you  they have tried to but what they offered me was dry and tough i could not get it down  the girl rose promptly  tolly fetch me some water and make a fire quick she said and going up to an indian coolly drew from its sheath his scalpingknife with which she cut tollys bonds  the savage evidently believed that such a creature could not possibly do evil for he made no motion whatever to check her  then without a word more she went to the saddlebags on the obstinate horse and opening one of them took out some soft sugar  the savage who held the horse made no objection  indeed from that moment the whole band stood silently by observing the pretty maiden and the active boy as they moved about regardless of everything but the work in hand  the rose of oregon constituted herself a sicknurse on that occasion with marvellous facility  true she knew nothing whatever about the duties of a sicknurse or a doctor for her father was one of those fortunate men who are never ill but her native tact and energy sufficed  it was not her nature to stand by inactive when anything urgent had to be done  if she knew not what to do and no one else did she was sure to attempt something  whether sugarandwater was the best food for a starving man she knew not but she did knowat least she thoughtthat the starvation ought to be checked without delay  here mr brixton sip a little of this she said going down on her knees and putting a tin mug to the patients mouth  poor tom would have sipped prussic acid cheerfully from her hand  he obeyed and seemed to like it  now a little more  god bless you dear girl murmured tom as he sipped a little more  there that will do you good till i can prepare something better  she rose and ran to the fire which tolly had already blown up almost to furnace heat  i filled the kettle for i knew youd want it said the boy turning up his fieryred visage for a moment it cant be long o boiling with such a blaze below it  he stooped again and continued to blow while betty cut some dried meat into small pieces  soon these were boiled and the resulting soup was devoured by the starving man with a zest that he had never before experienced  nectar he exclaimed faintly smiling as he raised his eyes to bettys face  but you must not take too much at a time she said gently drawing away the mug  tom submitted patiently  he would have submitted to anything patiently just then  during these proceedings the indians who seemed to be amiably disposed looked on with solemn interest and then coming apparently to the conclusion that they might as well accommodate themselves to circumstances they quietly made use of tollys fire to cook a meal for themselves  this done one of thema noblelooking savage who to judge from his bearing and behaviour was evidently their chiefwent up to betty and with a stately bend of the head said in broken english white woman git on horse  and what are you going to do with this man asked betty pointing to the prostrate form of tom  unaco will him take care briefly replied the chief meaning himself while with a wave of his hand he turned away and went to tolly whom he ordered to mount the pony which he styled the littil horse  the boy was not slow to obey for he was by that time quite convinced that his only chance of being allowed to have his hands left free lay in prompt submission  any lurking thought that might have remained of making a grand dash for liberty was effectually quelled by a big savage who quietly took hold of the ponys rein and led it away  another indian led bettys horse  then the original three who had found tom took him up quite gently and carried him off while the remainder of the band followed in single file  unaco led the way striding over the ground at a rate which almost forced the pony to trot and glancing from side to side with a keen look of inquiry that seemed to intimate an expectation of attack from an enemy in ambush  but if any such enemy existed he was careful not to show himself and the indian band passed through the defiles and fastnesses of the sawback hills unmolested until the shades of evening began to descend  then on turning round a jutting rock that obstructed the view up a mountain gorge unaco stopped abruptly and held up his hand  this brought the band to a sudden halt and the chief apparently sinking on his knees seemed to melt into the bushes  in a few minutes he returned with a look of stern resolve on his wellformed countenance  he has discovered something o some sort i  tollys remark to his fair companion was cut short by the point of a keen knife touching his side which caused him to end with hallo  the savage who held his bridle gave him a significant look that said silence  after holding a brief whispered conversation with several of his braves the chief advanced to betty and said  white mans in the bush  does white woman know why  betty at once thought of her father and his companions and said  i have not seen the white men  how can i tell why they are here  let me ride forward and look at themthen i shall be able to speak  a very slight smile of contempt curled the chiefs lip for an instant as he replied  no  the white woman see them when they be trapped  unaco knows one he is blacka devil with two facemany face but unacos eyes be sharp  they see far  so saying he turned and gave some directions to his warriors who at once scattered themselves among the underwood and disappeared  ordering the indians who carried tom brixton to follow him and the riders to bring up the rear he continued to advance up the gorge  a devil with two faces muttered tolly that must be a queer sort o beast  i have heard of a critter called a tasmanian devil but never before heard of an oregon one with two faces  an expressive glance from the indian who guarded him induced the lad to continue his speculations in silence  on passing round the jutting rock where unaco had been checked in his advance the party at once beheld the cause of anxiety  close to the track they were following were seen four men busily engaged in making arrangements to encamp for the night  it need scarcely be said that these were our friends paul bevan fred westly flinders and the botanist  the moment that these caught sight of the approaching party they sprang to their arms which of course lay handy for in those regions at the time we write of the law of might was in the ascendant  the appearance and conduct of unaco however deceived them for that wily savage advanced towards them with an air of confidence and candour which went far to remove suspicion and when on drawing nearer he threw down his knife and tomahawk and held up his empty hands their suspicions were entirely dispelled  theyre not likely to be onfriendly observed flinders for theres only five o them altogither an wan o thems only a bit of a boy an another looks uncommon like a wo  he had got thus far when he was checked by paul bevans exclaiming with a look of intense surprise why thats bettyor her ghost  flinderss astonishment was too profound to escape in many words  he only gave vent to musha theres tolly and let his lower jaw drop  yes its me an the beautiful nugget cried tolly jumping off the pony and running to assist the nugget to dismount while the bearers of tom brixton laid him on the ground removed the blanket and revealed his face  the exclamations of surprise would no doubt have been redoubled at this sight if the power of exclamation had not been for the time destroyed the sham botanist in particular was considerably puzzled for he at once recognised tom and also betty whom he had previously known  of course he did not know tolly trevor still less did he know that tolly knew him  unaco himself was somewhat surprised at the mutual recognitions though his habitual selfrestraint enabled him to conceal every trace of emotion  moreover he was well aware that he could not afford to lose time in the development of his little plot  taking advantage therefore of the surprise which had rendered every one for the moment more or less confused he gave a sharp signal which was well understood by his friends in the bush  instantly and before tolly or betty could warn their friends of what was coming the surrounding foliage parted as if by magic and a circle of yelling and painted redskins sprang upon the white men  resistance was utterly out of the question  they were overwhelmed as if by a cataract and almost before they could realise what had happened the arms of all the men were pinioned behind them  at that trying hour little tolly trevor proved himself to be more of a man than most of his friends had hitherto given him credit for  the savages regarding him as a weak little boy had paid no attention to him but confined their efforts to the overcoming of the powerful and by no means submissive men with whom they had to deal  tollys first impulse was to rush to the rescue of paul bevan but he was remarkably quickwitted and when on the point of springing observed that no tomahawk was wielded or knife drawn  suddenly grasping the wrist of betty who had also naturally felt the impulse to succour her father he exclaimed  stop  betty  they dont mean murder  you an i can do nothing against so many  keep quiet praps theyll leave us alone  as he spoke a still deeper idea flashed into his little brain  to the surprise of betty he suddenly threw his arms round her waist and clung to her as if for protection with a look of fear in his face and when the work of binding the captives was completed the indians found him still labouring to all appearance under great alarm  unaco cast on him one look of supreme scorn and then leaving him like betty unbound turned towards paul bevan  the white man is one of wicked band he said in his broken english  i dont know what ye mean redskin replied paul but speak your own tongue i understand it well enough to talk with ye  the indian repeated the question in his native language and paul replying in the same said  no redskin i belong to no band either wicked or good  how come you then to be in company with this man demanded the indian  in reply paul gave a correct account of the cause and object of his being there explained that the starving man before them was the friend for whom he sought that betty was his daughter though how she came to be there beat his comprehension entirely and that the botanist was a stranger whose name even he did not yet know  it is false returned the chief  the white man speaks with a forked tongue  he is one of the murderers who have slain my wife and my child  a dark fierce frown passed over the chiefs countenance as he spoke but it was quickly replaced by the habitual look of calm gravity  what can stop me he said reverting again to english as he turned and addressed betty from killing you as my wife was killed by white man  my god can stop you answered the girl in a steady voice though her heart beat fast and her face was very pale  your god exclaimed the savage  will your god defend the wicked  no but he will pardon the wicked who come to him in the name of jesus and he will defend the innocent  innocent repeated unaco vehemently as he turned and pointed to the botanist  does you call this man innocent  i know nothing about that man returned the girl earnestly but i do know that my father and i and all the rest of us are innocent of any crime against you  for a few seconds the savage chief gazed steadily at betty then turning towards the botanist he took a step towards the spot where he sat and looked keenly into his face  the botanist returned the gaze with equal steadiness through his blue spectacles    chapter fourteen  the big man with the blue glass eyes is a villain said the indian chief after a long scrutiny of the botanists countenance  so some of my mistaken friends have thought returned the man speaking for the first time in his natural voice which caused a thrill to pass through paul bevans frame  he is a thief continued the chief still gazing steadily at the blue glasses and a murderer  hes all that and liar and deceiver into the bargain thought tolly trevor but tolly did not speak he only vented his feelings in a low chuckle for he saw or thought he saw that the robbers career was about to receive a check  as the thought passed through his brain however he observed from the position in which he stood that stalker for as the reader has doubtless perceived it was hewas working his hands about in a very soft slow mysterious and scarcely observable manner  oho thought tolly is that your little game  ha  ill spoil it for you  he quietly took up a piece of firewood and began as it were to amuse himself therewith  you has many faces many colours continued unaco and too many eyes  at the last word he plucked the blue glasses off the botanists nose and flung them into the fire  my enemy gasped paul bevan turning first very pale and then very red as he glared like a chained tiger at his foe  you knows him now said unaco turning abruptly to paul  yes i knows him  the white man with the forked tongue say jus now he not knows him  ay redskin an i said the truth for hes a rare deceiveralways has beenan can pass himself off for amost anything  i knows him as my mortal foe  cast my hands loose an give me a knife an you shall see  o father your promiseremember exclaimed betty  true dear lass true i forgot returned paul with a humbled look yet it is hard for a man to see him there grinning like a big baboon an keep his hands off him  during this dialogue the indians looked from one speaker to another with keen interest although none but their chief understood a word of what was said and stalker took advantage of their attention being turned for the moment from himself to carry out what tolly had styled his little game all unaware that the boy was watching him like a lynx  among other shifts and devices with which the robber chief had become familiar he had learned the conjurors method of so arranging his limbs while being bound that he could untie his bonds in a marvellous manner on the present occasion however he had been tied by men who were expert in the use of deerskin thongs and he found some difficulty in loosening them without attracting attention but he succeeded at last he had been secured only by the wrists and forearms and remained sitting still a few seconds after he was absolutely free then seizing what he believed to be his opportunity he leapt up dashed the indian nearest him to the earth and sprang like a deer towards the bushes  but tolly trevor was ready for him  that daring youth plunged right in front of the big botanist and stooped  stalker tripped over him and came violently to the ground on his forehead and nose  before he could rise tolly had jumped up and swinging his billet of wood once in the air brought it down with all his little might on the robbers crown it sufficed to stupefy him and when he recovered he found himself in the close embrace of three muscular redskins  well done tolly trevor shouted paul bevan enthusiastically  even tom brixton who had been looking on in a state of inexpressible surprise managed to utter a feeble cheer  but the resources of the robber were not yet exhausted  finding himself in the grasp of overwhelming numbers he put forth all his strength as if to make a final effort and then suddenly collapsing dropped limp and helpless to the ground as a man does when he is stabbed to the heart  the savages knew the symptoms welltoo well  they rose breathless and each looked inquiringly at the other as though to say who did the deed  before they discovered that the deed had not been done at all stalker sprang up knocked down two of them overturned the third and bounding into the bushes was out of sight in a few seconds  the whole band of course went yelling after him except their chief who stood with an angry scowl upon his visage and awaited the return of his braves  one by one they came back panting and discomfited for the white robber had outrun them all and got clear away  well now it was cliverly done remarked paddy flinders finding his tongue at last an i raly cant but feel that he desarves to git off this time  all the same i hope hell be nabbed at last an recaive his duebad luck to him  now redskin began bevan  my name is unaco interrupted the chief with a look of dignity  well then unaco continued bevan since ye must see that we have nothing whatever to do wi the blackguard thats just given ye the slip i hope youll see your way to untie our hands an let us go  you may not belong to that mans band answered the chief in his own tongue but you are a white man and by white men i have been robbed of my wife and child  your lives are forfeited  you shall be slaves to those whom you call redskins and this girl with the sunny hair shall replace the lost one in my wigwam  without deigning to listen to a reply unaco turned and gave orders to his men who at once brought up the horse and pony set betty and tolly thereon lifted tom brixton on their shoulders as before and resumed their march deeper into the fastnesses of the sawback hills  it was growing rapidly dark as they advanced but the chief who led the party was intimately acquainted with every foot of the way and as the moon rose before daylight had quite disappeared they were enabled to continue their journey by night  no doubt remarked fred westly to paul who was permitted to walk beside him though flinders was obliged to walk behindno doubt the chief fears that stalker will pursue him when he is rejoined by his robber band and wants to get well out of his way  very likely returned bevan an its my opinion that hell find some more of his tribe hereabouts in which case master stalker and his blackguards will have pretty stiff work cut out for them  what think you of the threat of the chief to take betty to be one of his wives asked fred  well i dont think hell do it  why not  because ive got a hold over him that hes not aware of just yet  what is that and why did you not make use of it just now to prevent our being needlessly led farther into these mountains asked fred in surprise  what the hold is returned bevan you shall know at suppertime  the reason why i didnt make use of it sooner is that on the whole i think it better to stick by the redskins yet awhilefirst because if stalker should look for us as hes sartin sure to do we would not be strong enough to fight him in the open and secondly because poor tom brixton needs rest and he has more chance o that in the circumstances wi the redskins than he could have with us while being hunted by robbers and lastly because betty would come to grief if she fell into that villain stalkers hands just now  while paul and fred were thus conversing the rose of oregon and her little protector rode silently beside each other buried apparently in profound thought  at last tolly raised his head and voice  betty said he what a lucky thing it was that we fell in wi tom brixton and that you were able to give him somethin to eat  yes thank god replied the girl fervently  hed have died but for you said the boy  and you tolly added betty  well yes i did have a finger in the pie returned the boy with a selfsatisfied air but i say betty he added becoming suddenly serious what dye think o what that rascally chief said about takin you to his wigwam  you know that means he intends to make you his wife  yes i know but god will deliver me answered the girl  how dye know that  because i put my trust in him  oh but returned the boy with a slight look of surprise unless god works a miracle i dont see how he can deliver us from the redskins and you know he doesnt work miracles nowadays  im not so sure of that replied the girl  more than once i have seen a man who had been nearly all his life given to drinking fighting thieving and swearing and every sort of wickedness surrender himself body and soul to jesus christ so that he afterwards gave up all his evil ways and led a pure and peaceable life trying not only to serve god himself but doing his best to bring his old companions to the same state of mind  what would you call that tolly  im bound to say its as near a miracle as can be if not one altogether  but in what way do you think god will deliver you just now  that i cannot tell but i know this it is written in his word that those who put their trust in him shall never be confounded and i have put my trust in him  he will never forsake me  i wish i had as strong faith as you betty said the boy with a grave look  you may have itand stronger than i have for faith is the gift of god and we shall get it not in proportion to our trying to get it or to our trying to rouse it or to our working for it but according as we ask for it  the holy spirit can work anything in us and by us and he is promised to those who merely ask in the name of jesus  ah tolly have i not often told you this that in gods word it is written ye have not because ye ask not  while these two were yet speaking the chief called a halt and after a brief consultation with some of his braves ordered the band to encamp for the night  soon the camp fires were lighted under the spreading trees and their bright blaze and myriad sparks converted the gloomy forest into a brilliant banqueting hall in which unlike civilised halls the decorations were fresh and natural and the atmosphere was pure  there were at least six campfires each with its circle of grave red warriors its roasting steaks and its bubbling kettle in which latter was boiled a rich mixture of dried meat and flour  some of the indians stood conversing in low tones their faces ruddy with the brilliant blaze and their backs as black as the surrounding background  others lay at length on the ground or squatted thereon placidly smoking their calumets or the little iron pipes which formed part of the heads of their tomahawks or tending the steaks and kettles  to an observer outside the circle of light the whole scene was intensely vivid and picturesque for the groups being at different distances were varied in size and the intense light that shone on those nearest the fires shed a softer glow on those who were more distant while on the few indians who moved about in search of firewood it cast a pale light which barely sufficed to distinguish them from surrounding darkness  paul bevan and his friends occupied a fire by themselves the only native who stood beside them being unaco  it is probable that the savage chief constituted himself their guard in order to make quite sure of them for the escape of stalker weighed heavily on his mind  to secure this end more effectively and at the same time enable the captives to feed themselves the right arm of each was freed while the left was tied firmly to his body  of course betty and tom brixton were left altogether unbound  i feel uncommon lopsided goin about in this onearmed fashion remarked paul as he turned the stick on which his supper was roasting couldnt ye make up yer mind to trust us unaco  id promise for myself an friends that we wouldnt attempt to cut away like that big thief stalker  the chief who sat a little apart near the farther end of the blazing pile of logs smoking his pipe in motionless gravity took not the slightest notice  arrah howld yer tongue paul said flinders who made so much use of his one arm in stirring the kettle turning a roasting venison rib and arranging the fire that it seemed as if he were in full possession of two why dye disturb his majesty  dont ye see that hes meditatin or suthin o that sortmaybe about his forefathers  well well i hope his after mothers wont have many sulky ones like him returned paul rather crossly  its quite impossible to cut up a steak wi one hand so here goes i the next best fashion  he took up the steak in his fingers and was about to tear off a mouthful with his teeth when betty came to the rescue  stay father ill cut it into little bits for you if unaco will kindly lend me his scalpingknife  without a word or look the chief quietly drew the glittering weapon from its sheath and handed it to betty who at once using a piece of sharpened stick as a fork cut her fathers portion into manageable lumps  thats not a bad notion said fred  perhaps youll do the same for me betty  with pleasure mr westly  ah now av it wouldnt be axin too much might i make so bowld  flinders did not finish the sentence but laid his pewter plate before the rose of oregon with a significant smile  im glad to be so unexpectedly useful said betty with a laugh  when she had thus aided her halfhelpless companions betty returned the knife to its owner who received it with a dignified inclination of the head  she then filled a mug with soup and went to tom who lay on a deerskin robe gazing at her in rapt admiration and wondering when he was going to awake out of this most singular dream for in his weak condition he had taken to disbelieving all that he saw  and yet it cant well be a dream he murmured with a faint smile as the girl knelt by his side for i never dreamed anything half so real what is thissoup  yes try to take a little  it will do you good with gods blessing  ah yes with gods blessing repeated the poor youth earnestly you know what that means betty andandi think i am beginning to understand it  betty made no reply but a feeling of profound gladness crept into her heart  when she returned to the side of her father she found that he had finished supper and was just beginning to use his pipe  when are you going to tell me paul about thethesubject we were talking of on our way here asked fred who was still devoting much of his attention to a deers rib  ill tell ye now answered paul with a short glance at the indian chief who still sat profoundly grave in the dreamland of smoke theres no time like after supper for a good pipe an a good storynot that what im goin to tell ye is much of a story either but its true if that adds vally to it an itll be short  its about a brave young indian i once had the luck to meet with  his name was oswego  at the sound of the name unaco cast a sharp glance at bevan  it was so swift that no one present observed it save bevan himself who had expected it  but paul pretended not to notice it and turning himself rather more towards fred addressed himself pointedly to him  this young indian said paul was a fine specimen of his race tall and well made with a handsome countenance in which truth was as plain as the sun in the summer sky  i was out after grizzly bars at the time but hadnt had much luck an was comin back to camp one evenin in somethin of a sulky humour when i fell upon a trail which i knowed was the trail of a redskin  the redskins was friendly at that time wi the whites and as i was out alone an am somethin of a sociable critter i thought id follow him up an take him to my camp wi me if he was willin an give him some grub an baccy  well i hadnt gone far when i came to a precipiece  the trail followed the edge of it for some distance an i went along all right till i come to a bit where the trail seemed to go right over it  my heart gave a jump for i seed at a glance that a bit o the cliff had given way there an as there was no sign o the trail farther on of course i knowed that the injin whoever he was must have gone down with it  i tried to look over but it was too steep an dangerous so i sought for a place where i could clamber down  sure enough when i reached the bottom there lay the poor redskin  i thought he was dead for hed tumbled from a most awful height but a tree had broke his fall to some extent and when i went up to him i saw by his eyes that he was alive though he could neither speak nor move  i soon found that the poor lad was damaged past recovery so after tryin in vain to get him to speak to me i took him in my arms as tenderly as i could and carried him to my camp  it was five miles off and the road was rough and although neither groan nor complaint escaped him i knew that poor oswego suffered much by the great drops o perspiration that rolled from his brow so you see i had to carry him carefully  when id gone about four miles i met a small injin boy who said he was oswegos brother had seen him fall an not bein able to lift him had gone to seek for help but had failed to find it  that night i nursed the lad as i best could gave him some warm tea and did my best to arrange him comfortably  the poor fellow tried to speak his gratitude but couldnt yet i could see it in his looks  he died next day and i buried him under a pinetree  the poor heartbroken little brother said he knew the way back to the wigwams of his tribe so i gave him the most of the provisions i had told him my name and sent him away  at this point in the story unaco rose abruptly and said to bevan  the white man will follow me  paul rose and the chief led him into the forest a short way when he turned abruptly and with signs of emotion unusual in an indian said  your name is paul bevan  it is  i am the father of oswego said the chief grasping paul by the hand and shaking it vigorously in the white mans fashion  i know it unaco and i know you by report though weve never met before and i told that story in your ear to convince ye that my tongue is not forked  when paul bevan returned to the camp fire soon afterwards he came alone and both his arms were free  in a few seconds he had the satisfaction of undoing the bonds of his companions and relating to them the brief but interesting conversation which had just passed between him and the indian chief    chapter fifteen  at the edge of a small plain or bit of prairie land that shone like a jewel in a setting of bushclad hills dwelt the tribe of natives who owned unaco as their chief  it was a lovely spot in one of the most secluded portions of the sawback range far removed at that time from the evil presence of the golddiggers though now and then an adventurous prospector would make his way to these remote solitudes in quest of the precious metal  up to that time those prospectors had met with nothing to reward them for their pains save the gratification to be derived from fresh mountain air and beautiful scenery  it required three days of steady travelling to enable the chief and his party to reach the wigwams of the tribe  the sun was just setting on the evening of the third day when they passed out of a narrow defile and came in sight of the indian village  it seems to me paul remarked fred westly as they halted to take a brief survey of the scene that these indians have found an admirable spot on which to lead a peaceful life for the region is too high and difficult of access to tempt many goldhunters and the approaches to it could be easily defended by a handful of resolute men  that is true replied bevan as they continued on their way nevertheless it would not be very difficult for a few resolute men to surprise and capture the place  perchance stalker and his villains may attempt to prove the truth of what you say suggested fred  they will certainly attempt it returned paul but they are not what i call resolute men  scoundrels are seldom blessed wi much resolution an theyre never heartily united  what makes you feel so sure that they will follow us up paul  the fact that my enemy has followed me like a bloodhound for six years answered bevan with a frown  is it touching too much on private matters to ask why he is your enemy and why so vindictive  the reason is simple enough  buxley hates me and would kill me if he could  indeed im half afraid that he will manage it at last for ive promised my little gal that i wont kill him cept in selfdefence an of course if i dont kill him hes pretty sure to kill me  does betty know why this man persecutes you so  noshe dont  as it was evident both from his replies and manner that bevan did not mean to be communicative on the subject fred forbore to ask more questions about it  so you think unaco may be depended on he asked by way of changing the subject  ay surely  you may depend on it that the almighty made all men pretty much alike as regards their feelins  the civilised people an the redskins aint so different as some folk seem to think  they can both of em love an hate pretty stiffly an they are both able to feel an show gratitude as well as the reversealso theyre pretty equal in the matter of revenge  but dont we find said fred that among christians revenge is pretty much held in check  among christiansay replied bevan but white men aint always christians any more than red men are always devils  seems to me its six o one an half a dozen o the other  moreover when the missionaries git among the redskins some of em turns christians an some hypocritesjust the same as white men  what unaco is in the matter o christianity is not for me to say for i dont know but from what i do know from hearsay of his character im sartin sure that hes a good man and true an for that little bit of sarvice i did to his poor boy hed give me his life if need be  nevertheless i cant help thinking that we might have returned to simpsons gully and taken the risk of meeting with stalker said fred  ha thats because you dont know him returned bevan  if he had met with his blackguards soon after leaving us hed have overtook us by this time  anyway hes sure to send scouts all round and follow up the trail as soon as he can  but think what a trial this rough journey has been to poor tom brixton said fred  no doubt returned paul but havent we got him on tollys pony today and isnt that a sign hes better  an would you have me risk betty fallin into the hands o buxley  paul looked at his companion as if this were an unanswerable argument and fred admitted that it was  besides he went on it will be a pleasant little visit this to a friendly tribe o injins an we may chance to fall in wi gold who knows  an when the ugly thieves do succeed in findin us we shall have the help o the redskins who are not bad fighters when their cause is a good un an their wigwams are in danger  it may be so paul  however right or wrong here we are and a most charming spot it is the nearer we draw towards it  as fred spoke betty bevan who rode in advance reined in her horse which by the way had become much more docile in her handsand waited till her father overtook her  is it not like paradise father  not havin been to paradise dear i cant exactly say returned her matteroffact sire  oh i say aint it splendatious said tolly trevor coming up at the moment and expressing bettys idea in somewhat different phraseology just look at the lakelike a lookinglass with every wigwam picturd upside down so clear that a feller cant well say which is which  an the canoes in the same way bottom to bottom redskins above and redskins below  hallo  i say whats that  the excited lad pointed as he spoke to the bushes where a violent motion and crashing sound told of some animal disturbed in its lair next moment a beautiful little antelope bounded into an open space and stopped to cast a bewildered gaze for one moment on the intruders  that pause proved fatal  a concealed hunter seized his opportunity a sharp crack was heard and the animal fell dead where it stood shot through the head  poor poor creature exclaimed the tenderhearted betty  not a bad supper for somebody remarked her practical father  as he spoke the bushes parted at the other side of the open space and the man who had fired the shot appeared  he was a tall and spare but evidently powerful fellow  as he advanced towards our travellers they could see that he was not a son of the soil but a white manat least as regards blood though his face hands neck and bared bosom had been tanned by exposure to as red a brown as that of any indian  hes a trapper exclaimed tolly as the man drew nearer enabling them to perceive that he was middleaged and of rather slow and deliberate temperament with a sedate expression on his rugged countenance  ay he looks like one o these wanderin chaps said bevan that seem to be fond of a life o solitude in the wilderness  ive knowed a few of em  queer customers some that stick at nothin when their bloods up though i have met wi one or two that desarved an easier life an more o this worlds goods  but most of em prefer to hunt for their daily victuals an ony come down to the settlements when they run out o powder an lead or want to sell their furs  hallo  why tolly boy it isyes  i do believe its mahoghany drake himself  tolly did not reply for he had run eagerly forward to meet the trapper having already recognised him  his name is a strange one remarked fred westly gazing steadily at the man as he approached  drake is his right name explained bevan an mahoghany is a handle some fellers gave him cause hes so much tanned wi the sun  hes one o the right sort let me tell ye  none o your boastin bustin critters like gashford but a quiet thinkin man as is ready to tackle any subject amost in the univarse but can let his tongue lie till its time to speak  he can hold his own too wi man or beast aint he friendly wi little tolly trevor  hell shake his arm out o the socket if he dont take care  ill have to go to the rescue  in a few seconds paul bevan was having his own arm almost dislocated by the friendly shake of the trappers hand for although fond of solitude mahoghany drake was also fond of human beings and especially of old friends  glad to see you gentlemen he said in a low soft voice when introduced by paul to the travellers  at the same time he gave a friendly little nod to unaco thus indicating that with the indian chief he was already acquainted  well drake said bevan after the first greetings were over all right at the camp down there  all well he replied and the leaping buck quite recovered  he cast a quiet glance at the indian chief as he spoke for the leaping buck was unacos little son who had been ailing when his father left his village a few weeks before  no sign o goldseekers yet asked paul  nonecept one lot that ranged about the hills for a few days but they seemed to know nothin  sartinly they found nothin an went away disgusted  the trapper indulged in a quiet chuckle as he said this  what are ye larfin at asked paul  at the goldseekers replied drake  what was the matter wi em asked tolly  not much lad only they was blind and also ill of a strong appetite  ye was always fond o speakin in riddles said paul  what dye mean mahoghany  i mean that though there aint much gold in these hills maybe what little there is the seekers couldnt see though they was walkin over it an they was so blind they couldnt hit what they fired at so their appetites was stronger than was comfortable  i do believe theyd have starved if i hadnt killed a buck for them  during this conversation paddy flinders had been listening attentively and in silence  he now sidled up to tom brixton who although bestriding tollys pony seemed ill able to travel  dye hear what the trapper says muster brixton  yes paddy what then  och  i only thought to cheer you up a bit by pintin out that he says theres goold hereabouts  im glad for your sake and freds returned tom with a faint smile but it matters little to me i feel that my days are numbered  ah then sor dont spake like that returned flinders with a woebegone expression on his countenance  sure its in the dumps ye are an no occasion for that same  isnt miss  the irishman paused  he had it in his heart to say isnt miss betty smilin on ye like one oclock but never yet having ventured even a hint on that subject to tom an innate feeling of delicacy restrained him  as the chief who led the party gave the signal to move on at that moment it was unnecessary for him to finish the sentence  the indian village which was merely a cluster of tents made of deerskins stretched on poles was now plainly visible from the commanding ridge along which the party travelled  it occupied a piece of green level land on the margin of the lake before referred to and with its background of crag and woodland and its distance of jagged purple hills formed as lovely a prospect as the eye of man could dwell upon  the distance of the party from it rendered every sound that floated towards them soft and musical  even the barking of the dogs and the shouting of the little redskins at play came up to them in a mellow almost peaceful tone  to the right of the village lay a swamp from out of which arose the sweet and plaintive cries of innumerable gulls plovers and other wildfowl mingled with the trumpeting of geese and the quacking of ducks many of which were flying to and fro over the glassy lake while others were indulging in aquatic gambols among the reeds and sedges  after they had descended the hillside by a zigzag path and reached the plain below they obtained a nearer view of the eminently joyful scene the sound of the wildfowl became more shrill and the laughter of the children more boisterous  a number of the latter who had observed the approaching party were seen hurrying towards them with eager haste led by a little lad who bounded and leaped as if wild with excitement this was unacos little son leaping buck who had recognised the wellknown figure of his sire a long way off and ran to meet him  on reaching him the boy sprang like an antelope into his fathers arms and seized him round the neck while others crowded round the gaunt trapper and grasped his hands and legs affectionately  a few of the older boys and girls stood still somewhat shyly and gazed in silence at the strangers especially at betty whom they evidently regarded as a superior order of beingperhaps an angelin which opinion they were undoubtedly backed by tom buxton  after embracing his father leaping buck recognised paul bevan as the man who had been so kind to him and his brother oswego at the time when the latter got his deathfall over the precipice  with a shout of joyful surprise he ran to him and we need scarcely add was warmly received by the kindly backwoodsman  i cannot help thinking remarked betty to tom as they gazed on the pleasant meeting that god must have some way of revealing the spirit of jesus to these indians that we christians know not of  it is strange replied tom that the same thought has occurred to me more than once of late when observing the character and listening to the sentiments of unaco  and i have also been puzzled with this thoughtif god has some method of revealing christ to the heathen that we know not of why are christians so anxious to send the gospel to the heathen  that thought has never occurred to me replied betty because our reason for going forth to preach the gospel to the heathen is the simple one that god commands us to do so  yet it seems to me quite consistent with that command that god may have other ways and methods of making his truth known to men but this being a mere speculation does not free us from our simple duty  you are right  perhaps i am too fond of reasoning and speculating answered tom  nay that you are not rejoined the girl quickly it seems to me that to reason and speculate is an important part of the duty of man and cannot but be right so long as it does not lead to disobedience  let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind is our title from god to think fully and freely but go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature is a command so plain and peremptory that it does not admit of speculative objection  why betty i had no idea you were such a reasoner said tom with a look of surprise  surely it is not your father who has taught you to think thus  i have had no teacher at least of late years but the bible replied the girl blushing deeply at having been led to speak so freely on a subject about which she was usually reticent  but see she added hastily giving a shake to the reins of her horse we have been left behind  the chief has already reached his village  let us push on  the obstinate horse went off at an accommodating amble under the sweet sway of gentleness while the obedient pony followed at a brisk trot which nearly shook all the little strength that tom brixton possessed out of his wasted frame  the manner in which unaco was received by the people of his tribe young and old showed clearly that he was well beloved by them and the hospitality with which the visitors were welcomed was intensified when it was made known that paul bevan was the man who had shown kindness to their chiefs son oswego in his last hours  indeed the influence which an indian chief can have on the manners and habits of his people was well exemplified by this small and isolated tribe for there was among them a pervading tone of contentment and goodwill which was one of unacos most obvious characteristics  truthfulness also and justice were more or less manifested by them  even the children seemed to be free from disputation for although there were of course differences of opinion during games these differences were usually settled without quarrelling and the noise of which there was abundance was the result of gleeful shouts or merry laughter  they seemed in short to be a happy community the various members of which had leanedto a large extent from their chiefhow good a thing it is for brethren to dwell together in unity  a tent was provided for bevan flinders and tolly trevor near to the wigwam of unaco with a separate little one for the special use of the rose of oregon  not far from these another tent was erected for fred and his invalid friend tom brixton  as for mahoghany drake that lanky lanternjawed individual encamped under a neighbouring pinetree in quiet contempt of any more luxurious covering  but although the solitary wanderer of the western wilderness thus elected to encamp by himself he was by no means permitted to enjoy privacy for during the whole evening and greater part of that night his campfire was surrounded by an admiring crowd of boys and not a few girls who listened in openeyedandmouthed attention to his thrilling tales of adventure giving vent now and then to a waugh or a ho of surprise at some telling point in the narrative or letting fly sudden volleys of laughter at some humorous incident to the amazement no doubt of the neighbouring bucks and bears and wildfowl  tom said fred that night as he sat by the couch of his friend we shall have to stay here some weeks i suspect until you get strong enough to travel and to say truth the prospect is a pleasant as well as an unexpected one for we have fallen amongst amiable natives  true fred  nevertheless i shall leave the moment my strength permitsthat is if health be restored to meand i shall go off by myself  why tom what do you mean  i mean exactly what i say  dear fred answered the sick man feebly grasping his friends hand i feel that it is my duty to get away from all who have ever known me and begin a new career of honesty god permitting  i will not remain with the character of a thief stamped upon me to be a drag round your neck and i have made up my mind no longer to persecute dear betty bevan with the offer of a dishonest and dishonoured hand  in my insolent folly i had once thought her somewhat below me in station  i now know that she is far far above me in every way and also beyond me  tom my dear boy returned fred earnestly you are getting weak  it is evident that they have delayed supper too long  try to sleep now and ill go and see why tolly has not brought it  so saying fred westly left the tent and went off in quest of his little friend    chapter sixteen  little tolly trevor and leaping buckbeing about the same age and having similar tastes and propensities though very unlike each other in temperamentsoon became fast friends and they both regarded mahoghany drake the trapper with almost idolatrous affection  would you care to come wi me today tolly  im goin to look for some meat on the heights  it was thus that drake announced his intention to go ahunting one fine morning after he had disposed of a breakfast that might have sustained an ordinary man for several days  care to go with ye echoed tolly i just think i should  but look here mahoghany continued the boy with a troubled expression ive promised to go out on the lake today wi leaping buck an i must keep my promise  you know you told us only last night in that story about the chinaman and the grizzly that no true man ever breaks his promise  right lad right returned the trapper but you can go an ask the little buck to jine us an if hes inclined you can both comeonly you must agree to leave yer tongues behind ye if ye do for it behoves hunters to be silent and from my experience of you i raither think yer too fond o chatterin  before drake had quite concluded his remark tolly was off in search of his redskinned bosom friend  the manner in which the friendship between the red boy and the white was instituted and kept up was somewhat peculiar and almost incomprehensible for neither spoke the language of the other except to a very slight extent  leaping bucks father had indeed picked up a pretty fair smattering of english during his frequent expeditions into the goldfields which at the period we write of were being rapidly developed  paul bevan too during occasional hunting expeditions among the red men had acquired a considerable knowledge of the dialect spoken in that part of the country but leaping buck had not visited the diggings with his father so that his knowledge of english was confined to the smattering which he had picked up from paul and his father  in like manner tolly trevors acquaintance with the native tongue consisted of the little that had been imparted to him by his friend paul bevan mahoghany drake on the contrary spoke indian fluently and it must be understood that in the discourses which he delivered to the two boys he mixed up english and indian in an amazing compound which served to render him intelligible to both but which for the readers sake we feel constrained to give in the trappers ordinary english  it was in a place just like this said drake stopping with his two little friends on reaching a height and turning round to survey the scene behind him that a queer splinter of a man who was fond o callin himself an ornithologist shot a grizzly bar wi a mere popgun that was only fit for a squawkin babbys plaything  oh do sit down mahoghany cried little trevor in a voice of entreaty im so fond of hearin about grizzlies an id give all the world to meet one myself so would buckie here wouldnt you  the indian boy whose name tolly had thus modified tried to assent to this proposal by bending his little head in a stately manner in imitation of his dignified father  well i dont mind if i do replied the trapper with a twinkle of his eyes  mahoghany drake was blessed with that rare gift the power to invest with interest almost any subject no matter how trivial or commonplace on which he chose to speak  whether it was the charm of a musical voice or the serious tone and manner of an earnest man we cannot tell but certain it is that whenever or wherever he began to talk men stopped to listen and were held enchained until he had finished  on the present occasion the trapper seated himself on a green bank that lay close to the edge of a steep precipice and laid his rifle across his knees while the boys sat down one on each side of him  the view from the elevated spot on which they sat was most exquisite embracing the entire length of the valley at the other end of which the indian village lay its inhabitants reduced to mere specks and its wigwams to little cones by distance  owing also to the height of the spot the view of surrounding mountains was extended so that range upon range was seen in softened perspective while a variety of lakelets with their connecting watercourses which were hidden by foliage in the lower grounds were now opened up to view  glowing sunshine glittered on the waters and bathed the hills and valleys deepening the near shadows and intensifying the purple and blue of those more distant  it often makes me wonder said the trapper in a reflective tone as if speaking rather to himself than to his companions why the almighty has made the world so beautiful an parfect an allowed mankind to grow so awful bad  the boys did not venture to reply but as drake sat gazing in dreamy silence at the faroff hills little trevor who recalled some of his conversations with the rose of oregon ventured to say praps well find out some day though we dont understand it just now  true lad true returned drake  it would be well for us if we always looked at it in that light instead o findin fault wi things as they are for it stands to reason that the maker of all can fall into no mistakes  but what about the ornithologist said tolly who had no desire that the conversation should drift into abstruse subjects  ay ay lad im comin to him replied the trapper with the humorous twinkle that seemed to hover always about the corners of his eyes ready for instant development  well you must know this was the way of it and it do make me larf yet when i think o the face o that spiderlegged critter goin at the rate of twenty miles an hour or thereabouts wi that most awfullookin grizzly bar peltin after himhist  look there tolly  a chance for your popgun  the trapper pointed as he spoke to a flock of wild duck that was coming straight towards the spot on which they sat  the popgun to which he referred was one of the smoothbore flintlock singlebarrelled fowlingpieces which traders were in the habit of supplying to the natives at that time and which unaco had lent to the boy for the day with his powderhorn and ornamented shotpouch  for the three hunters to drop behind the bank on which they had been sitting was the work of a moment  young though he was tolly had already become a fair and ready shot  he selected the largest bird in the flock covered it with a deadly aim and pulled the trigger  but the click of the lock was not followed by an explosion as the birds whirred swiftly on  ah my boy observed the trapper taking the gun quietly from the boys hand and proceeding to chip the edge of the flint you should never go ahuntin without seein that your flint is properly fixed  but i did see to it replied tolly in a disappointed tone and it struck fire splendidly when i tried it before startin  true boy but the thing is worn too short an though its edge is pretty well you didnt screw it firm enough so it got drove back a bit and the hammerhead as well as the flint strikes the steel dye see there now prime it again an be sure ye wipe the pan before puttin in the powder  its not worth while to be disapinted about so small a matter  youll git plenty more chances  see theres another flock comin  dont hurry lad  if ye want to be a good hunter always keep cool an take time  better lose a chance than hurry  a chance lost you see is only a chance lost but blazin in a hurry is a bad lesson that yeve got to unlarn  the trappers advice was cut short by the report of tollys gun and next moment a fat duck striking the ground in front of them rolled fluttering to their feet  not badly done tolly said the trapper with a nod as he reseated himself on the bank while leaping buck picked up the bird which was by that time dead and the young sportsman recharged his gun just a leetle too hurried  if you had taken only half a second more time to put the gun to your shoulder youd have brought the bird to the ground dead and you boys cant larn too soon that you should never give needless pain to critters that youve got to kill  you must shoot of course or youd starve but always make sure of killin at once an the only way to do that is to keep cool an take time  you see it aint the aim you take that matters so much as the coolness an steadiness with which ye put the gun to your shoulder  if you only do that steadily an without hurry the gun is sure to pint straight forard an the aimll look arter itself  nevertheless it was smartly done lad for its a difficult shot when a wild duck comes straight for your head like a cannonball  but what about the ornithologist said tolly who albeit well pleased at the trappers complimentary remarks did not quite relish his criticism  yes yes im comin to that  well as i was sayin it makes me larf yet when i thinks on it  how he did run to be sure  greased lightnin could scarce have kep up wi him  but where was he arunnin to an why asked little trevor impatiently  now you leetle boy said drake with a look of grave remonstrance dont you go an git impatient  patience is one o the backwoods vartues without which youll never git on at all  if you dont cultivate patience you may as well go an live in the settlements or the big citieswhere it dont much matter what a man isbut itll be no use to stop in the wilderness  theres leapin buck now asittin as quiet as a redskin warrior on guard  take a lesson from him lad an restrain yourself  well as i was goin to say i was out settin my traps somewheres about the headwaters o the yellowstone river at the time when i fell in wi the critter  i couldnt rightly make out what he was for though ive seed mostly all sorts o men in my day id never met in wi one o this sort before  it wasnt his bodily shape that puzzled me though that was queer enough but his occupation that staggered me  he was a long thin spidershaped article that seemed to have run to seedall stalk with a frowsy top for his hair was long an dry an flyabout  im sixfutt one myself but my step was a mere joke to his stride  he seemed split up to the neck like a pair o human compasses an his clos fitted so tight that he might have passed for a livin skeleton  well it was close upon sundown an i was joggin along to my tent in the bush when i came to an openin where i saw the critter down on one knee an his gun up takin aim at somethin  i stopped to let him have his shot for i count it a mortal sin to spoil a mans sport an i looked hard to see what it was he was goin to let drive at but never a thing could i see far or near except a small bit of a bird about the size of a big bee sittin on a branch not far from his nose an cockin its eye at him as much as to say well you air a queer un surely thought i he aint agoin to blaze at that  but id scarce thought it when he did blaze at it an down it came flop on its back as dead as mutton  well stranger says i goin forard you do seem to be hard up for victuals when youd shoot a small thing like that  not at all my good man says hean the critter had a kindly smile an a sensible face enoughyou must know that i am shootin birds for scientific purposes  i am an ornithologist  oh say i for i didnt rightly know what else to say to that  yes says he an see here  wi that he opens a bag he had on his back an showed me a lot o birds big an small that hed been shootin an then he pulls out a small book in which hed been makin picturs of eman rally i was raither took wi that for the critter had got em down there almost as good as natur  they actooally looked as if they was alive  shut the book sir says i or theyll all escape  it was only a small joke i meant but the critter took it for a big un an larfed at it till he made me half ashamed  dye know any of these birds he axed arter wed looked at a lot of em  know em says i i should think i does  why ive lived among em ever since i was a babby  indeed says he an he got quite excited how interestin  an do you know anythin about their habits  if you mean by that their ways o goin on says i theres hardly a thing about em that i dont know except what they think an sometimes ive a sort o notion i could make a pretty fair guess at that too  will you come to my camp and spend the night with me he asked gettin more an more excited  no stranger i wont says i but if youll come to mine ill feed you an make you heartily welcome for somehow id took quite a fancy to the critter  ill go says he an he went an we had such a night of it  he didnt let me have a wink o sleep till pretty nigh daylight the next mornin an axed me more questions about birds an beasts an fishes than i was iver axed before in the whole course o my lifean it warnt yesterday i was born  i began to feel quite like a settlement boy at school  an he set it all down too as fast as i could speak in the queerest handwritin you ever did see  at last i couldnt stand it no longer  mister ornithologist says i  well says he  theres a pecooliar beast in them parts says i as has got some pretty stiff an settled habits  is there says he wakin up again quite fresh though he had been growin sleepy  yes says i an its a obstinate sort o brute that wont change its habits for nobody  one o these habits is that it turns in of a night quite reglar an has a good snooze before goin to work next day its name is mahoghany drake an thats me so ill bid you goodnight stranger  wi that i knocked the ashes out o my pipe stretched myself out wi my feet to the fire an rolled my blanket round me  the critter larfed again at this as if it was a great joke but he shut up his book put it and the bag o leetle birds under his head for a pillow spread himself out over the camp like a great spider that was awkard in the use o its limbs an went off to sleep even before i didan that was sharp practice let me tell you  well continued the trapper clasping his great bony hands over one of his knees and allowing the lines of humour to play on his visage while the boys drew nearer in openeyed expectancy we slep about three hours an then had a bit o breakfast after which we parted for he said he knew his way back to the camp where he left his friends but the poor critter didnt know nothincept ornithology  he lost himself an took to wanderin in a circle arter i left him  i came to know it cause i struck his trail the same arternoon an there could be no mistakin it the length o stride bein somethin awful  so i followed it up  i hadnt gone far when i came to a place pretty much like this as i said before and when i was lookin at the viewfor im fond of a fine view it takes a mans mind off trappin an victuals somehowi heerd a most awful screech an then another  a moment later an the ornithologist busted out o the bushes with his long legs goin like the legs of a big waterwagtail  he was too fur off to see the look of his face but his hair was tremendous to behold  when he saw the precipice before him he gave a most horrible yell for he knew that he couldnt escape that way from whatever was chasin him  i couldnt well help him for there was a wide gully between him an me an it was too fur off for a fair shot  howsever i stood ready  suddenly i seed the critter face right about an down on one knee like a pair o broken compasses up went the shotgun an at the same moment out busted a great old grizzly bar from the bushes  crack went my rifle at once but i could see that the ball didnt hurt him much although it hit him fair on the head  loadin in hot haste i obsarved that the ornithologist sat like a post till that bar was within six foot of him when he let drive both barrels of his popgun straight into its face then he jumped a one side with a spurt like a grasshopper an the bar tumbled heels over head and got up with an angry growl to rub its face then it made a savage rush forard and fell over a low bank jumped up again an went slap agin a face of rock  i seed at once that it was blind  the small shot used by the critter for his leetle birds had put out both its eyes an it went blunderin about while the ornithologist kep well out of its way  i knew he was safe so waited to see what hed do an what dye think he did  shoved his knife into him suggested tolly trevor in eager anxiety  what shove his knife into a healthy old bar with nothin gone but his sight  no lad he did do nothing so mad as that but he ran coolly up to it an screeched in its face  of course the bar went straight at the sound helterskelter and the ornithologist turned an ran to the edge o the precipice screechin as he went  when he got there he pulled up an darted a one side but the bar went slap over an i believe im well within the mark when i say that that bar turned five complete somersaults before it got to the bottom where it came to the ground with a whack that would have busted an elephant  i dont think we found a whole bone in its carcass when the ornithologist helped me to cut it up that night in camp  well done exclaimed little trevor with enthusiasm an what came o the ornywhatdyecallum  thats more than i can tell lad  he went off wi the bars claws to show to his friends an i never saw him again  but look there boys continued the trapper in a suddenly lowered tone of voice while he threw forward and cocked his rifle dye see our supper  what  where exclaimed tolly in a soft whisper straining his eyes in the direction indicated  the sharp crack of the trappers rifle immediately followed and a fine buck lay prone upon the ground  twas an easy shot said drake recharging his weapon only a man needs a leetle experience before he can fire down a precipice correctly come along boys    chapter seventeen  nothing further worth mentioning occurred to the hunters that day save that little tolly trevor was amazedwe might almost say petrifiedby the splendour and precision of the trappers shooting besides which he was deeply impressed with the undercurrent of what we may style grave fun coupled with calm enthusiasm which characterised the man and the utter absence of selfassertion or boastfulness  but if the remainder of the day was uneventful the stories round the campfire more than compensated him and his friend leaping buck  the latter was intimately acquainted with the trapper and seemed to derive more pleasure from watching the effect of his anecdotes on his new friend than in listening to them himself  probably this was in part owing to the fact that he had heard them all before more than once  the spot they had selected for their encampment was the summit of a projecting crag which was crowned with a little thicket and surrounded on three sides by sheer precipices  the neck of rock by which it was reached was free from shrubs besides being split across by a deep chasm of several feet in width so that it formed a natural fortress and the marks of old encampments seemed to indicate that it had been used as a campingplace by the red man long before his white brothertoo often his white foehad appeared in that western wilderness to disturb him the indians had no special name for the spot but the roving trappers who first came to it had named it the outlook because from its summit a magnificent view of nearly the whole region could be obtained  the great chasm or fissure already mentioned descended sheer down like the neighbouring precipices to an immense depth so that the outlook being a species of aerial island was usually reached by a narrow plank which bridged the chasm  it had stood many a siege in times past and when used as a fortress whether by white hunters or savages the plank bridge was withdrawn and the place renderedat least esteemed impregnable  when mahoghany drake and his young friends came up to the chasm a little before sunset leaping buck took a short run and bounded clear over it  ha  i knowed he couldnt resist the temptation said mahoghany with a quiet chuckle an its not many boysno nor yet menwho could jump that  i wouldnt try it myself for a noo rifleno though ye was to throw in a silvermounted powderhorn to the bargain  but you have jumped it cried the indian boy turning round with a gleeful face  ay lad long ago and then i was forced to when runnin for my life a manll do many a deed when so sitooate that he couldnt do in cold blood  come come young feller he added suddenly laying his heavy hand on little trevors collar and arresting him you wasnt thinkin o tryin it was ye  indeed i was and i think i could manage it said the foolishly ambitious tolly  thinkin is not enough boy returned the trapper with a grave shake of the head  you should always make sure  suppose you was wrong in your thinkin now who dee think would go down there to pick up the bits of ee an carry them home to your mother  but i havent got a mother said tolly  well your father then  but i havent got a father  so much the more reason returned the trapper in a softened tone that you should take care o yourself lest you should turn out to be the last o your race  come help me to carry this plank  after were over ill see you jump on safe ground and if you can clear enough mayhap ill let ee try the gap  have you a steady head  ay like a rock returned tolly with a grin  see that youre sure lad for if you aint ill carry you over  in reply to this tolly ran nimbly over the plank bridge like a tightrope dancer  drake followed and they were all soon busily engaged clearing a space on which to encamp and collecting firewood  tell me about your adventure at the time you jumped the gap mahoghany begged little trevor when the first volume of smoke arose from their fire and went straight up like a pillar into the calm air  not now lad  work first talk afterwards  thats my motto  but work is over nowthe fire lighted and the kettle on objected tolly  nay lad when you come to be an old hunter youll look on supper as about the most serious work o the day  when thats over an the pipe agoin an maybe a little stickwhittlin for variety a man may let his tongue wag to some extent  our small hero was fain to content himself with this reply and for the next halfhour or more the trio gave their undivided attention to steaks from the loin of the fat buck and slices from the breast of the wild duck which had fallen to tollys gun  when the pipeandstickwhittling period arrived however the trapper disposed his bulky length in front of the fire while his young admirers lay down beside him  the stickwhittling it may be remarked devolved upon the boys while the smoking was confined to the man  i cant see why it is observed tolly when the first whiffs curled from mahoghany drakes lips that you men are so strong in discouragin us boys from smokin  you keep it all selfishly to yourselves though buckie an i would give anythin to be allowed to try a whiff now an then  paul bevans just like youwont hear o me touchin a pipe though he smokes himself like a wigwam wi a greenwood fire  drake pondered a little before replying  it would never do you know he said at length for you boys to do zackly as we men does  why not demanded tolly developing an early bud of independent thought  why cause it wouldnt replied drake  then feeling that his answer was not a very convincing argument he added you see boys aint men no more than men are boys an whats good for the one aint good for the tother  i dont see that returned the radicalhearted tolly  isnt eatin an drinkin an sleepin an walkin an runnin an talkin an thinkin an huntin equally good for boys and men  if all these things is good for us both why not smokin  thats more than i can tell ee lad answered the honest trapper with a somewhat puzzled look  if mahoghany drake had thought the matter out a little more closely he might perhaps have seen that smoking is as good for boys as for men or what comes to much the same thing is equally bad for both of them but the sturdy trapper liked smoking hence like many wiser men he did not care to think the matter out  on the contrary he changed the subject and as the change was very much for the better in the estimation of his companions tolly did not object  well now about that jump he began emitting a prolonged and delicate whiff  ah yes  how did you manage to do it asked little trevor eagerly  oh for the matter o that its easy to explain but it wasnt my jump i was goin to tell about it was the jump o a poor crittera sort o neerdowell who jined a band o us trappers the day before we arrived at this place on our way through the mountains on a huntin expedition  he was a miserable specimen o human naturall the worse that he had a pretty stout body o his own an might have made a fairish man if hed had the spirit even of a crossgrained rabbit  his name was miffy an it sounded natral to him for there was no go in him whatever  i often wonder what sitch men was made for  theyre o no use to anybody an a nuisance to themselves  praps they wasnt made for any use at all suggested tolly who having whittled a small piece of stick down to nothing commenced another piece with renewed interest  no lad returned the trapper with a look of deeper gravity  even poor foolish man does not construct anything without some sort o purpose in view  its an outrage on common sense to think the almighty could do so  mayhap sitch critters was meant to act as warnins to other men  he told us that hed runned away from home when he was a boy cause he didnt like school  then he engaged as a cabinboy aboard a ship tradin to some place in south america an runned away from his ship the first port they touched at cause he didnt like the sea  then he came wellnigh to the starvin pint an took work on a farm as a labourer but left that cause it was too hard after which he got a berth as watchman at a warehouse or some place o the sort but left that for it was too easy  then he tried golddiggin but could make nothin of it engaged in a fur company but soon left it an then tried his hand at trappin on his own account but gave it up cause he could catch nothin  when he fell in with our band he was redooced to two rabbits an a prairie hen wi only three charges o powder in his horn an not a drop o lead  well we tuck pity on the miserable critter an let him come along wi us  there was ten of us altogether an he made eleven  at first we thought hed be of some use to us but we soon found he was fit for nothin  however we couldnt cast him adrift in the wilderness for hed have bin sure to come to damage somehow so we let him go on with us  when we came to this neighbourhood we made up our minds to trap in the valley and as the injins were wild at that time owin to some rascally white men who had treated them badly and killed a few we thought it advisable to pitch our camp on the outlook here  it was a wellknown spot to most o my comrades tho i hadnt seen it myself at that time  when we came to the gap one of the young fellows named bounce gave a shout took a run and went clear over it just as leapin buck did  he was fond o showin off you know  he turned about with a laugh and asked us to follow  we declined and felled a small tree to bridge it next day we cut the tree down to a plank as bein more handy to shove across in a hurry if need be  well we had good sportplenty of bar and moose steaks no end of fresh eggs of all sorts and enough o pelts to make it pay  you see we didnt know there was gold here in those days so we didnt look for it an wouldnt ha knowed it if wed seen it  but i never myself cared to look for gold  its dirty work grubbin among mud and water like a beaver  its hard work too an ive obsarved that the men who get most gold at the diggins are not the diggers but the storekeepers an a bad lot they are many of em though im bound to say that ive knowed a few as was real honest men who kep no false weights or measures an had some sort of respec for their maker  however continued the trapper filling a fresh pipe while tolly and his little red friend whittling their sticks less vigorously as the story went on and at length dropping them altogether kept their bright eyes riveted on drakes face  however thats not what ive got to tell ee about  you must know that one evening close upon sundown we was all returnin from our traps more or less loaded wi skins an meat all except miffy who had gone as he said a huntin  bin truer if hed said he meant to go around scarin the animals  well just as we got within a mile o this place we was set upon by a band o redskins there must have bin a hundred of em at least  ive lived a longish time now in the wilderness but i never before or since heard sitch a yellin as the painted critters set up in the woods all around when they came at us sendin a shower o arrows in advance to tickle us up but they was bad shots for only one took effect an that shaft just grazed the point o young bounces nose as neat as if it was only meant to make him sneeze  it made him jump i tell ee higher than i ever seed him jump before  of course fightin was out o the question  ten trappers under cover might hold their own easy enough agin a hundred redskins but not in the open  we all knew that an had no need to call a council o war  every man let his pack fall an away we went for the outlook followed by the yellin critters closer to our heels than we quite liked  but they couldnt shoot runnin so we got to the gap  the plank was there all right  over we went faced about and while one o us hauled it over the rest gave the savages a volley that sent them back faster than they came  miffys lost obsarved one o my comrades as we got in among the bushes here an prepared to fight it out  no great loss remarked another  no fear o miffy said bounce feelin his nose tenderly hes a bad shillin and bad shillins always turn up they say  bounce had barely finished when we heard another most awesome burst o yellin in the woods followed by a deep roar  thats miffy says i feelin quite excited for id got to have a sneakin sort o pity for the miserable critter  its a twin roar to the one he gave that day when he mistook hairy sam for a grizzly bar an went up a sprucefir like a squirrel  sure enough in another moment miffy burst out o the woods an came tearin across the open space straight for the gap followed by a dozen or more savages  run bouncethe plank says i jumpin up  well drive the reptiles back  while i was speakin we were all runnin full split to meet the poor critter bounce far in advance  whether it was overhaste or the pain of his nose i never could make out but somehow in tryin to shove the plank over bounce let it slip  down it went an split to splinters on the rocks a hundred feet below  miffy was close up at the time  his cheeks was yaller an his eyes starin as he came on but his face turned green and his eyes took to glarin when he saw what had happened i saw a kind o hesitation in his look as he came to the unbridged gulf  the savages thinkin no doubt it was all up with him gave a fiendish yell o delight  that yell saved the poor neerdowell  it was as good as a spanish spur to a wild horse  over he came with legs an arms out like a flyin squirrel and down he fell flat on his stummick at our feet wi the nearest thing to a fair bust that i ever saw or raither heard for i was busy sightin a redskin at the time an didnt actually see it  when the savages saw what hed done they turned tail an scattered back into the woods so we only gave them a loose volley for we didnt want to kill the critters  i just took the bark off the thigh of one to prevent his forgettin me  we held the place here for three days an then findin they could make nothin of us or havin other work on hand they went away an left us in peace  an what became o poor miffy asked little trevor earnestly  we took him down with us to a new settlement that had been started in the prairieland west o the blue mountains an there he got a sitooation in a store but i spose he didnt stick to it long  anyhow that was the last i ever saw of him  now boys its time to turn in  that night when the moon had gone down and the stars shed a feeble light on the camp of those who slumbered on the outlook rock two figures like darker shades among the surrounding shadows glided from the woods and approaching the edge of the gap gazed down into the black abyss  i told you redskin that the plank would be sure to be drawn over said one of the figures in a low but gruff whisper  when the tomahawk is red men do not usually sleep unguarded replied the other in the indian tongue  speak english maqua i dont know enough o your gibberish to make out what you mean  do you think now that the villain paul bevan is in the camp  maqua is not a god that he should be able to tell what he does not know  no but he could guess retorted stalkerfor it was the robberchief my scouts said they thought it was his figure they saw  however it matters not  if you are to earn the reward i have offered you must creep into the camp put your knife in bevans heart and bring me his scalp  i would do it myself redskin and be indebted to nobody but i cant creep as you and your kindred can  id be sure to make row enough to start them in time for selfdefence as to the scalp i dont want itonly want to make certain that youve done the deed  you may keep it to ornament your dress or to boast about to your squaw  if you should take a fancy to do a little murder on your own account do so  it matters nothin to me  ill be ready to back you up if they give chase  while the robberchief was speaking he searched about for a suitable piece of wood to span the chasm  he soon found what he wanted for there was much felled timber lying about the work of previous visitors to the outlook  in a few minutes maqua had crossed and glided in a stealthy stooping position towards the camp seeming more like a moving shadow than a real man  when pretty close he went down on hands and knees and crept forward with his scalpingknife between his teeth  it would have been an interesting study to watch the savage had his object been a good onethe patience the slow gliding movements the careful avoidance of growing branches and the gentle removal of dead ones from his path for well did maqua know that a snapping twig would betray him if the camp contained any of the indian warriors of the far west  at last he drew so near that by stretching his neck he could see over the intervening shrubs and observe the sleepers  just then drake chanced to waken  perhaps it was a presentiment of danger that roused him for the indian had up to that moment made not the slightest sound  sitting up and rubbing his eyes the trapper looked cautiously round then he lay down and turned over on his other side to continue his slumbers  like the treestems around him maqua remained absolutely motionless until he thought the trapper was again sleeping  then he retired as he had come to his anxiouslyawaiting comrade  bevan not there he said briefly when they had retired to a safe distance only mahoghany drake an two boy  well why didnt ye scalp them asked stalker savagely for he was greatly disappointed to find that his enemy was not in the camp  you said that all white men were your enemies  no not all replied the savage  drake have the blood of white mans but the heart of red mans  he have be good to injins  well well it makes no odds to me returned stalker come along an walk before me for i wont trust ye behind  as for slippery paul ill find him yet you shall see  when a man fails in one attempt all hes got to do is to make another  now then redskin move on    chapter eighteen  as widely different as night is from day summer from winter heat from cold are some members of the human family yet god made them all and has a purpose of love and mercy towards each  common sense says this the general opinion of mankind holds this highest of all the word clearly states this god willeth not the death of a sinner but rather that he should turn from his wickedness and live and he maketh his sun to shine upon the just and on the unjust  nevertheless it seemed difficult to believe that the same god formed and spared and guarded and fed the fierce lawless man stalker and the loving gentle delicate rose of oregon  about the same hour that the former was endeavouring to compass the destruction of paul bevan betty was on her knees in her little tented room recalling the deeds the omissions and the shortcomings of the past day interceding alike for friends and foesif we may venture to assume that a rose without a thorn could have foes  even the robberchief was remembered among the rest and you may be very sure that tom brixton was not forgotten  having slept the sleep of innocence and purity betty rose refreshed on the following day and before the indian village was astir went out to ramble along a favourite walk in a thicket on the mountainside  it so fell out that tom had selected the same thicket for his morning ramble but poor tom did not look like one who hoped to meet with his ladylove that morning  he had under good nursing recovered some of his former strength and vigour of body with wonderful rapidity but his face was still haggard and careworn in an unusual degree for one so young  when the two met tom did not pretend to be surprised  on the contrary he said  i expected to meet you here betty because i have perceived that you are fond of the place and believe me i would not have presumed to intrude were it not that i wish to ask one or two questions the answers to which may affect my future movements  he paused and bettys heart fluttered for she could not help remembering former meetings when tom had tried to win her affections and when she had felt it her duty to discourage him  she made no reply to this rather serious beginning to the interview but dropped her eyes on the turf for she saw that the youth was gazing at her with a very mingled and peculiar expression  tell me he resumed after a few moments thought do you feel quite safe with these indians  quite replied the girl with a slight elevation of the eyebrows they are unusually gentle and goodnatured people  besides their chief would lay down his life for my fatherhe is so grateful  oh yes i feel perfectly safe here  but what does your father think  he is always so fearlessi might say recklessthat i dont feel certain as to his real opinion  have you heard him speaking about the chance of that rascal stalker following him up  yes he has spoken freely about that  he fully expects that stalker will search for us but considers that he will not dare to attack us while we live with so strong a band of indians and as stalkers followers wont hang about here very long for the mere purpose of pleasing their chief especially when nothing is to be gained by it father thinks that his enemy will be forced to go away  besides he has made up his mind to remain here for a long timemany months it may be  that will do returned tom with a sigh of relief then there will be no need for me to  to what asked betty seeing that the youth paused  forgive me if i do not say what i meant to  i have reasons for he paused againthen you are pleased with the way the people treat you  of course i am  they could not be kinder if i were one of themselves and some of the women are so intelligent too  you know i have picked up a good deal of the indian language and understand them pretty well though i cant speak much and youve no idea what deep thinkers some of them are  there is unacos mother who looks so old and dried up and stupidshe is one of the dearest old things i ever knew  why continued the girl with increasing animation as she warmed with her subject that old creature led me the other night into quite an earnest conversation about religion and asked me ever so many questions about the ways of god with manspeculative difficult questions too that almost puzzled me to answer  you may be sure i took the opportunity to explain to her gods great love to man in and through jesus and  she stopped abruptly for tom brixton was at that moment regarding her with a steady and earnest gaze  yes he said slowly almost dreamily i can well believe you took your opportunity to commend jesus to her  you did so once to me and  tom checked himself as if with a great effort  the girl longed to hear more but he did not finish the sentence  well he said with a forced air of gaiety i have sought you here to tell you that i am going off onona long hunting expedition  going at oncebut i would not leave without bidding you goodbye  going away mr brixton exclaimed betty in genuine surprise  yes  as you see i am ready for the field with rifle and wallet firebag and blanket  but you are not yet strong enough said betty  oh yes i amstronger than i look  besides that will mend every day  i dont intend to say goodbye to westly or any one because i hate to have people try to dissuade me from a thing when my mind is made up i only came to say goodbye to you because i wish you to tell fred and your father that i am grateful for all their kindness to me and that it will be useless to follow me  perhaps we may meet again betty he added still in the forced tone of lightness while he gently took the girls hand in his and shook it but the dangers of the wilderness are numerous and as you have once or twice told me we know not what a day or an hour may bring forth his tone had deepened suddenly to that of intense earnestnessgod bless you betty farewell  he dropped her hand turned sharply on his heel and walked swiftly away never once casting a look behind  poor tom  it was a severe wrench but he had fought the battle manfully and gained the victory  in his newborn sense of personal unworthiness and strict justice he had come to the conclusion that he had forfeited the right to offer heart or hand to the rose of oregon  whether he was right or wrong in his opinion we do not pretend to judge but this does not alter the fact that a hard battle with self had been fought by him and a great victory won  but tom neither felt nor looked very much like a conqueror  his heart seemed to be made of lead and the strength of which he had so recently boasted seemed to have deserted him altogether after he had walked a few miles insomuch that he was obliged to sit down on a bank to rest  fear lest fred or paul should follow up his trail however infused new strength into his limbs and he rose and pushed steadily on for he was deeply impressed with the duty that lay upon himnamely to get quickly and as far as possible away from the girl whom he could no longer hope to wed  thus advancing at times with great animation sitting down occasionally for short rests and then resuming the march with renewed vigour he travelled over the mountains without any definite end in view beyond that to which we have already referred  for some time after he was gone betty stood gazing at the place in the thicket where he had disappeared as if she half expected to see him return then heaving a deep sigh and with a mingled expression of surprise disappointment and anxiety on her fair face she hurried away to search for her father  she found him returning to their tent with a load of firewood and at once told him what had occurred  hell soon come back betty said paul with a significant smile when a young feller is fond of a lass hes as sure to return to her as water is sure to find its way as fast as it can to the bottom of a hill  fred westly thought the same when paul afterwards told him about the meeting though he did not feel quite so sure about the return being immediate but mahoghany drake differed from them entirely  depend ont he said to his friend paul when in the privacy of a retired spot on the mountainside they discussed the matterdepend ont that young feller aint made o butter  what he says he will do hell stick to if im any judge o human natur  of course it aint for me to guess why he should fling off in this fashion  are ye sure hes fond o your lass  sure  ay as sure as i am that yon is the sun an not the moon ashinin in the sky  hm thats strange  an theyve had no quarrel  none that i knows on  moreover they aint bin used to quarrel bettys not one o that sortdear lass  shes always fair an above board honest an straight forard  says zactly what she means an means what she says  mister tom aint given to shillyshallyin neither  no im sure theyve had no quarrel  well its the old story said drake while a puzzled look flitted across his weatherbeaten countenance and the smoke issued more slowly from his unflagging pipe the conduct o lovers is not to be accounted for  howsever theres one thing im quite sure ofthat he must be looked after  dye think so said paul  id have thought he was quite able to look arter himself  not just now returned the trapper hes not yet got the better of his touch o starvation an theres a chance o your friend stalker or buxley which dye call him  whichever you like he answers to either or neither as the case may be  hes best known as stalker in these parts though buxley is his real name  well then resumed drake theres strong likelihood o him prowlin about here and comin across the tracks o young brixton so as i said before he must be looked after and ill take upon myself to do it  well ill jine ye said paul for of course yell have to make up a party  not at all returned the trapper with decision  ill do it best alone leastwise ill take only little tolly trevor an leapin buck with me for theyre both smart an safe lads and are burnin keen to learn somethin o woodcraft  in accordance with this determination mahoghany drake leaping buck and little trevor set off next day and followed tom brixtons trail into the mountains  it was a broad trail and very perceptible at least to an indian or a trapper for tom had a natural swagger which he could not shake off even in the hour of his humiliation and besides he had never been an adept at treading the western wilderness with the care which the red man finds needful in order to escape from or baffle his foes  tis as well marked amost said drake pausing to survey the trail as if hed bin draggin a toboggan behind him  yet a settlement man wouldnt see much of it remarked little trevor eh  buckie  the indian boy nodded gravely  he emulated his father in this respect and would have been ashamed to have given way to childish levity on what he was pleased to consider the warpath but he had enough of the humorous in his nature to render the struggle to keep grave in tollys presence a pretty severe one  not that tolly aimed at being either witty or funny but he had a peculiarly droll expression of face which added much point to whatever he said  ho exclaimed the trapper after they had gone a little farther heres a trail that even a settlement man could hardly fail to see theres bin fifty men or more  dye see it tolly  see it  i should think so  dyou suppose i carry my eyes in my pocket  come now lad said drake turning to leaping buck you want to walk in your fathers tracks no doubt  read me this trail if ye can  the boy stepped forward with an air of dignity that drake regarded as sublime and tolly thought ludicrous but the latter was too fond of his red friend to allow his feelings to betray themselves  as the white trapper has truly said he began fifty men or more have passed this way  they are most of them white men but three or four are indians  good said drake with an approving nod i thought yed notice that well go on  they were making straight for my fathers camp continued the lad bending a stern look on the trail but they turned sharp round like the swallow on coming to the trail of the white man brixton and followed it  how dye know that lad asked the trapper  because i see it returned the boy promptly pointing at the same time to a spot on the hillside considerably above them where the conformation of the land at a certain spot revealed enough of the trail of the fifty men or more to show the change of direction  good again lad  a worthy son of your father  i didnt give e credit for sharpness enough to perceive that  can you read anything more  one man was a horseman but he left his horse behind on getting to the rough places of the hills and walked with the rest  he is paul bevans enemy  and how dye know all that said drake regarding the little fellow with a look of pride  by the footprints returned leaping buck  he wears boots and spurs  just so returned the trapper and weve bin told by paul that stalker was the only man of his band who wouldnt fall in wi the ways o the country but sticks to the clumsy jackboots and spurs of old england  yes the scoundrel has followed you up tolly as paul bevan said he would and havin come across brixtons track has gone after him from all which i now come to the conclusion that your friend mister tom is a prisoner an stands in need of our sarvices  what say you tolly  go at em at once replied the warlike trevor an set him free  what us three attack fifty men  why not responded tolly were more than a match for em  paul bevan has told me oftentimes that honest men are as a rule ten times more plucky than dishonest ones  well you are one honest man thats equal to ten an buckie and i are two honest boys equal say to five each thats ten more making twenty among three of us  three times twentys sixty isnt it so surely thats more than enough to fight fifty  ah boy answered the trapper with a slightly puzzled expression i never could make nothin o rithmetic though my mother put me to school one winter with a sort o halfmad parson that came to the head waters o the yellowstone river an took to teachindear me how long ago was it now  well i forget but somehow you seem to add up the figgurs raither faster than i was made to do  howsever well go an see whats to be done for tom brixton  the trapper who had been leaning on his gun looking down at his bold little comrades during the foregoing conversation once more took the lead and closely following the trail of the robberband continued the ascent of the mountains  the indian village was by that time far out of sight behind them and the scenery in the midst of which they were travelling was marked by more than the average grandeur and ruggedness of the surrounding region  on their right arose frowning precipices which were fringed and crowned with forests of pine intermingled with poplar birch maple and other trees  on their left a series of smaller precipices or terraces descended to successive levels like giant steps till they reached the bottom of the valley up which our adventurers were moving where a brawling river appeared in the distance like a silver thread  the view both behind and in advance was extremely wild embracing almost every variety of hill scenery and in each case was shut in by snowcapped mountains  these however were so distant and so soft in texture as to give the impression of clouds rather than solid earth  standing on one of the many jutting crags from which could be had a wide view of the vale lying a thousand feet below tolly trevor threw up his arms and waved them to and fro as if in an ecstasy exclaimingoh if i had only wings what a swoop id makedown there  ah boy you aint the first thats wished for wings in the like circumstances  but weve bin denied these advantages  praps wed have made a bad use of em  sartinly weve made a bad use o sich powers as we do possess  just think now if men could go about through the air as easy as the crows what a row theyd kick up all over the arth  as it is when we want to fight weve got to crawl slowly from place to place an make roads for our wagins an big guns an supplies to go along with us but if wed got wingswhy the first fire eatin great man that could lead his fellows by the nose would only have to give the word when up would start a whole army o men like some thousand jackintheboxes an away theyd go to some place theyd took a fancy to an down theyd come all of a heap quite onexpected take their enemy by surprise sweep him off the face o the arth and enter into possession  well it would be a blue lookout remarked tolly if that was to be the way of it  there wouldnt be many men left in the world before long  thats true lad an sitch as was left would be the worst o the race no on the whole i think were better without wings  while he was talking to little trevor the trapper had been watching the countenance of the indian boy with unusual interest  at last he turned to him and asked  has leaping buck nothin to say  when the white trapper speaks the indians tongue should be silent replied the youth  a good sentiment and does you credit lad  but i am silent now  has leaping buck no remark to make on what he sees  he sees the smoke of the robbers camp far up the heights replied the boy pointing as he spoke  clever lad exclaimed the trapper i knowd he was his fathers son  where  i can see nothing cried tolly who understood the indian tongue sufficiently to make out the drift of the conversation  of course ye cant the smoke is too far off an too thin for eyes not well practised in the signs o the wilderness  but come we shall go and pay the robbers a visit mayhap disturb their rest a littlewho knows  with a quiet laugh mahoghany drake withdrew from the rocky ledge and followed by his eager satellites continued to wend his way up the rugged mountainsides taking care however that he did not again expose himself to view for well did he know that sharp eyes and ears would be on the qui vive that night    chapter nineteen  when tom brixton sternly set his face like a flint to what he believed to be his duty he wandered as we have said into the mountains with a heavy heart and without any definite intentions as to what he intended to do  if his thoughts had taken the form of words they would probably have run somewhat as follows  farewell for ever sweet rose of oregon  dear betty  you have been the means in gods hand of saving at least one soul from death and it would be requiting you ill indeed were i to persuade you to unite yourself to a man whose name is disgraced even among rough men whose estimate of character is not very high  no henceforth our lives diverge wider and wider apart  may god bless you and give you a good husgive you happiness in his own way  and now i have the world before me where to choose  it is a wide world and there is much work to be done  surely i shall be led in the right way to fill the niche which has been set apart for me  i wonder what it is to be  am i to hunt for gold or to become a furtrader or go down to the plains and turn cattledealer or to the coast and become a sailor or try farming  one thing is certain i must not be an idler must not join the ranks of those who merely hunt that they may eat and sleep and who eat and sleep that they may hunt  i have a work to do for him who bought me with his precious blood and my first step must be to commit my way to him  tom brixton took that step at once  he knelt down on a mossy bank and there with the glorious prospect of the beautiful wilderness before him and the setting sun irradiating his still haggard countenance held communion with god  that night he made his lonely bivouac under a spreading pine and that night while he was enjoying a profound and healthgiving slumber the robberchief stepped into his encampment and laid his hand roughly on his shoulder  in his days of high health tom would certainly have leaped up and given stalker a considerable amount of trouble but starvation and weakness coupled with selfcondemnation and sorrow had subdued his nerves and abated his energies so that when he opened his eyes and found himself surrounded by as disagreeable a set of cutthroats as could well be brought together he at once resigned himself to his fate and said without rising and with one of his halfhumorous smiles  well mister botanist sorry i cant say it gives me pleasure to see you  i wonder youre not ashamed to return to the country of the great chief unaco after running away from him as you did  im in no humour for joking answered stalker gruffly  what has become of your friend paul bevan  im not aware that anything particular has become of him replied tom sitting up with a look of affected surprise  come you know what i mean  where is he  when i last saw him he was in oregon  whether he has now gone to europe or the moon or the sun i cannot tell but i should think it unlikely  if you dont give me a direct and civil answer ill roast you alive you young puppy growled stalker  if you roast me dead instead of alive youll get no answer from me but such as i choose to give you middleaged villain retorted tom with a glare of his eyes which quite equalled that of the robberchief in ferocity for toms nature was what we may style volcanic and he found it hard to restrain himself when roused to a certain point so that he was prone to speak unadvisedly with his lips  a halfsmothered laugh from some of the band who did not care much for their chief rendered stalker furious  he sprang forward with a savage oath drew the small hatchet which he carried in his belt and would certainly then and there have brained the rash youth with it if his hand had not been unexpectedly arrested  the gleaming weapon was yet in the air when the loud report of a rifle close at hand burst from the bushes with a sheet of flame and smoke and the robbers right arm fell powerless at his side hit between the elbow and shoulder  it was the rifle of mahoghany drake that had spoken so opportunely  that stalwart backwoodsman had as we have seen followed up the trail of the robbers and with tolly trevor and his friend leaping buck had lain for a considerable time safely ensconced in a mosscovered crevice of the cliff that overlooked the campingplace  there quietly observing the robbers and almost enjoying the little scene between tom and the chief they remained inactive until stalkers hatchet gleamed in the air  the boys were almost petrified by the suddenness of the act  not so the trapper who with rapid aim saved toms life as we have seen  dropping his rifle he seized the boys by the neck and thrust their faces down on the moss not a moment too soon for a withering volley was instantly sent by the bandits in the direction whence the shots had come  it passed harmlessly over their heads  now home like two arrows and rouse your father leaping buck whispered the trapper and keep well out o sight  next moment picking up his empty rifle he stalked from the fringe of bushes that partially screened the cliff and gave himself up  ha  i know youmahoghany drake  is it not so cried stalker savagely  seize him men  you shall swing for this you rascal  two or three of the robbers advanced but drake quietly held up his hand and they stopped  im in your power you see he said laying his rifle on the ground yes he continued drawing his tall figure up to its full height and crossing his arms on his breast my name is drake  as to mahoghany ive no objection to it though it aint complimentary  if as you say mister stalker im to swing for this of course i must swing  yet it do seem raither hard that a man should swing for savin his friends life an his enemys at the same time  howwhat do you mean  i mean that mister brixton is my friend answered the trapper and ive saved his life just now for which i thank the lord  at the same time stalker is my enemyleastwise i fear hes no friendan didnt i save his life too when i put a ball in his arm that i could have as easily put into his head or his heart  well responded stalker with a fiendish grin that the increasing pain of his wound did not improve at all events you have not saved your own life drake  as i said you shall swing for it  but ill give you one chance  if you choose to help me i will spare your life  can you tell me where paul bevan and his daughter are  they are with unaco and his tribe  i could have guessed as much as that  i ask you where they are  on the other side of yonder mountain range where the chiefs village lies  somewhat surprised at the trappers readiness to give the information required and rendered a little suspicious stalker asked if he was ready and willing to guide him to the indian village  surely  if thats the price im to pay for my life it can be easily paid replied the trapper  ay but you shall march with your arms bound until we are there and the fight wi the redskins is over said the robberchief and if i find treachery in your acts or looks ill blow your brains out on the spot  my left hand you shall find can work as well as the right wi the revolver  a beggar they say must not be a chooser returned the trapper  i accept your terms  good  here goff said stalker turning to his lieutenant bind his hands behind him after hes had some supper and then come an fix up this arm o mine  i think the bone has escaped  hadnt we better start off at once suggested drake an catch the redskins when theyre asleep  is it far off asked stalker  a goodish bit  but the night is young  we might git pretty near by midnight and then encamp so as to git an hours sleep before makin the attack  you see redskins sleep soundest just before daybreak  while he was speaking the trapper coughed a good deal and sneezed once or twice as if he had a bad cold  cant you keep your throat and nose quieter said the chief sternly  well praps i might replied drake emitting a highly suppressed cough at the moment but ive got a queer throat just now  the least thing affects it  after consultation with the principal men of his band stalker determined to act on drakes advice and in a few minutes the trapper was guiding them over the hills in a state of supreme satisfaction despite his bonds for had he not obtained the power to make the robbers encamp on a spot which the indians could not avoid passing on their way to the rescue and had he not established a sort of right to emit sounds which would make his friends aware of his exact position and thus bring both parties into collision before daybreak which could not have been the case if the robbers had remained in the encampment where he found them  turn we now to leaping buck and tolly trevor  need it be said that these intelligent lads did not as the saying is allow grass to grow under their feet  the former went over the hills at a pace and in a manner that fully justified his title and the latter followed with as much vigour and resolution if not as much agility as his friend  in a wonderfully short space of time considering the distance they burst upon the indian village and aroused it with the startling news  warfare in those regions was not the cumbrous and slow affair that it is in civilised places  there was no commissariat no ammunition wagons no baggage no campfollowers to hamper the line of march  in five or ten minutes after the alarm was given about two hundred indian braves marched out from the camp in a column which may be described as onedeepie one following the otherand took their rapid way up the mountain sides led by unaco in person  next to him marched paul bevan who was followed in succession by fred westly paddy flinders leaping buck and tolly  for some time the long line could be seen by the rose of oregon passing swiftly up the mountainside  then as distance united the individuals as it were to each other it assumed the form of a mighty snake crawling slowly along  by degrees it crawled over the nearest ridge and disappeared after which betty went to discuss the situation with unacos old mother  it was near midnight when the robberband encamped in a wooded hollow which was backed on two sides by precipices and on the third by a deep ravine  a good spot to set a host at defiance remarked stalker glancing round with a look that would have expressed satisfaction if the wounded arm had allowed  yes added the trapper and a violent fit of coughing prevented the completion of the sentence which however when thought out in drakes mind rana good spot for hemming you and your scoundrels in and starving you into submission  a short time sufficed for a bite of cold supper and a little whiff soon after which the robber camp with the exception of the sentinels was buried in repose  tom brixton was not allowed to have any intercourse whatever with his friend drake  both were bound and made to sleep in different parts of the camp  nevertheless during one brief moment when they chanced to be near each other drake whispered be ready and tom heard him  ere long no sound was heard in the camp save an occasional snore or sigh and drakes constant and hacking but highly suppressed cough poor fellow  he was obviously consumptive and it was quite touching to note the careful way in which he tried to restrain himself giving vent to as little sound as was consistent with his purpose  turning a corner of jutting rock in the valley which led to the spot unacos sharp and practised ear caught the sound  he stopped and stood like a bronze statue by michael angelo in the attitude of suddenly arrested motion  upwards of two hundred bronze arrested statues instantly tailed away from him  presently a smile such as michael angelo probably never thought of reproducing rippled on the usually grave visage of the chief  mogany drake he whispered softly in paul bevans ear  i didnt know drake had sitch a horrid cold whispered bevan in reply  tolly trevor clenched his teeth and screwed himself up internally to keep down the laughter that all but burst him for he saw through the device at once  as for leaping buck he did more than credit to his sire because he kept as grave as michael angelo himself could have desired while chiselling his features  musha but that is a quare sound whispered flinders to westly  hush returned westly  at a signal from their chief the whole band of indians sank as it seemed into the ground melted off the face of the earth and only the white men and the chief remained  i must go forward alone whispered unaco turning to paul  white man knows not how to go on his belly like the serpent  mahoghany drake would be inclined to dispute that pint with ee returned bevan  however you know best so well wait till you give us the signal to advance  having directed his white friends to lie down unaco divested himself of all superfluous clothing and glided swiftly but noiselessly towards the robber camp with nothing but a tomahawk in his hand and a scalpingknife in his girdle  he soon reached the open side of the wooded hollow guided thereto by drakes persistent and evidently distressing cough  here it became necessary to advance with the utmost caution  fortunately for the success of his enterprise all the sentinels that night had been chosen from among the white men  the consequence was that although they were wide awake and on the qui vive their unpractised senses failed to detect the very slight sounds that unaco made while gliding slowlyinch by inch and with many an anxious pauseinto the very midst of his foes  it was a trying situation for instant death would have been the result of discovery  as if to make matters more difficult for him just then drakes hacking cough ceased and the indian could not make out where he lay  either his malady was departing or he had fallen into a temporary slumber that the latter was the case became apparent from his suddenly recommencing the cough  this however had the effect of exasperating one of the sentinels  cant you stop that noise he muttered sternly  im doin my best to smother it said drake in a conciliatory tone  apparently he had succeeded for he coughed no more after that  but the fact was that a hand had been gently laid upon his arm  so soon he thought  well done boys  but he said never a word while a pair of lips touched his ear and said in the indian tongue  where lies your friend  drake sighed sleepily and gave a short and intensely subdued cough as he turned his lips to a brown ear which seemed to rise out of the grass for the purpose and spoke something that was inaudible to all save that ear  instantly hand lips and ear withdrew leaving the trapper in apparently deep repose  a sharp knife however had touched his bonds and he knew that he was free  a few minutes later and the same hand touched tom brixtons arm  he would probably have betrayed himself by an exclamation but remembering drakes be ready he lay perfectly still while the hands knife and lips did their work  the latter merely said in broken english rise when me rise an run  next instant unaco leaped to his feet and with a terrific yell of defiance bounded into the bushes  tom brixton followed him like an arrow and so prompt was mahoghany drake to act that he and tom came into violent collision as they cleared the circle of light thrown by the few sinking embers of the campfires  no damage however was done  at the same moment the band of indians in ambush sprang up with their terrible war whoop and rushed towards the camp  this effectually checked the pursuit which had been instantly begun by the surprised bandits who at once retired to the shelter of the mingled rocks and shrubs in the centre of the hollow from out of which position they fired several tremendous volleys  thats rightwaste yer ammunition said paul bevan with a short laugh as he and the rest lay quickly down to let the leaden shower pass over  its always the way wi men taken by surprise said drake who with brixton and the chief had stopped in their flight and turned with their friends  they blaze away wildly for a bit just to relieve their feelins i spose  but theyll soon stop  an whatll we do now inquired flinders for it seems to me weve got all we want out o them an its no use fightin them for mere funthough its mesilf that used to like fightin for that same but i think the air of oregon has made me more peaceful inclined  but the country has been kept for a long time in constant alarm and turmoil by these men said fred westly and although i like fighting as little as any man i cannot help thinking that we owe it as a duty to society to capture as many of them as we can especially now that we seem to have caught them in a sort of trap  what says mahoghany drake on the subject asked unaco  i vote for fightin cause therell be no peace in the country till the band is broken up  might it not be better to hold them prisoners here suggested paul bevan  they cant escape you tell me except by this side and theres nothin so good for tamin men as hunger  ah said tom brixton you speak the truth bevan i have tried it  but what does unaco himself think asked westly  we must fight em at once an root them out neck and crop  these words were spoken not by the indian but by a deep bass voice which sent a thrill of surprise not unmingled with alarm to more hearts than one and no wonder for it was the voice of gashford the big bully of pine tree diggings    chapter twenty  to account for the sudden appearance of gashford as told in our last chapter it is necessary to explain that two marauding indians chanced to pay pine tree diggings a visit one night almost immediately after the unsuccessful attack made by stalker and his men  the savages were more successful than the white robbers had been  they managed to carry off a considerable quantity of gold without being discovered and gashford erroneously attributing their depredations to a second visit from stalker was so enraged that he resolved to pursue and utterly root out the robberband  volunteers were not wanting  fifty stout young fellows offered their services and at the head of these gashford set out for the sawback mountains which were known to be the retreat of the bandits  an indian who knew the region well and had once been illtreated by stalker became a willing guide  he led the golddiggers to the robbers retreat and there learning from a brother savage that the robberchief and his men had gone off to hunt up paul bevan in the region that belonged to unaco he led his party by a short cut over the mountains and chanced to come on the scene of action at the critical moment when unaco and his party were about to attack the robbers  ignorant of who the parties were that contended yet feeling pretty sure that the men he sought for probably formed one of them he formed the somewhat hazardous determination personally and alone to join the rush of the assailants under cover of the darkness telling his lieutenant crossby to await his return or to bring on his men at the run if they should hear his wellknown signal  on joining the attacking party without having been observedor rather having been taken for one of the band in the uncertain lighthe recognised westlys and flinderss voices at once and thus it was that he suddenly gave his unasked advice on the subject then under discussion  but stalkers bold spirit settled the question for them in an unexpected manner  perceiving at once that he had been led into a trap he felt that his only chance lay in decisive and rapid action  men he said to those who crowded round him in the centre of the thicket which formed their encampment weve bin caught  our only chance lies in a bold rush and then scatter  are you ready  ready responded nearly every man  those who might have been unwilling were silent for they knew that objection would be useless come on then an give them a screech when ye burst out  like an avalanche of demons the robber band rushed down the slope and crashed into their foes and a yell that might well have been born of the regions below rang from cliff to cliff but the indians were not daunted  taken by surprise however many of them were overturned in the rush when high above the din arose the bass roar of gashford  crossby heard the signal and led his men down to the scene of battle at a rapid run  but the robbers were too quick for them most of them were already scattering far and wide through the wilderness  only one group had been checked and strange to say that was the party that happened to cluster round and rush with their chief  but the reason was clear enough for that section of the foe had been met by mahoghany drake bevan westly brixton flinders and the rest while gashford at last met his match in the person of the gigantic stalker  but they did not meet on equal terms for the robbers wounded arm was almost useless  still with the other arm he fired a shot at the huge digger missed and flinging the weapon at his head grappled with him  there was a low precipice or rocky ledge about fifteen feet high close to them  over this the two giants went after a brief but furious struggle and here after the short fight was over they were found grasping each other by their throats and in a state of insensibility  only two other prisoners were taken besides stalkerone by bevan the other by flinders  but these were known by drake to be poor wretches who had only joined the band a few weeks before and as they protested that they had been captured and forced to join they were set free  you see its of no manner o use hangin the wretched critters observed drake to bevan confidentially when they were returning to the indian village the following morning  it would do them no good  all that we wanted was to break up the band and captur the chief which bein done it would be a shame to shed blood uselessly  but we must hang stalker said little tolly who had taken part in the attack and whose sense of justice it seems would have been violated if the leader of the band had been spared  im inclined to think he wont want hangin tolly replied drake gravely  that tumble didnt improve his wounded arm for gashford fell atop of him  the trappers fear was justified  when stalker was carried into the indian village and examined by fred westly it was found that besides other injuries two of his ribs had been broken and he was already in high fever  betty bevan whose sympathy with all sufferers was strong volunteered to nurse him and as she was unquestionably the best nurse in the place her services were accepted  thus it came about that the robberchief and the rose of oregon were for a time brought into close companionship  on the morning after their return to the indian village paul bevan and betty sauntered away towards the lake  the rose had been with stalker the latter part of the night and after breakfast had said she would take a stroll to let the fresh air blow sleepiness away  paul had offered to go with her  well betty lass what think ye of this robberchief now youve seen somethin of him at close quarters asked paul as they reached the margin of the lake  i have scarcely seen him in his right mind father for he has been wandering a little at times during the night and oh you cannot think what terrible things he has been talking about  has he said paul glancing at betty with sudden earnestness  what did he speak about  i can scarcely tell you for at times he mixed up his ideas so that i could not understand him but i fear he has led a very bad life and done many wicked things  he brought in your name too pretty often and seemed to confuse you with himself putting on you the blame of deeds which just a minute before he had confessed he had himself done  ay did he said paul with a peculiar expression and tone  well he warnt far wrong for i have helped him sometimes  father exclaimed betty with a shocked lookbut you misunderstand he spoke of such things as burglary and highway robbery and you could never have helped him in deeds of that kind  oh he spoke of such things as these did he returned paul  well yes hes bin up to a deal of mischief in his day  and what did you say to him lass  did you try to quiet him  what could i say father except tell him the old old story of jesus and his love that he came to seek and to save the lost even the chief of sinners  an how did he take it inquired paul with a grave almost an anxious look  at first he would not listen but when i began to read the word to him and then tried to explain what seemed suitable to him he got up on his unhurt elbow and looked at me with such a peculiar and intense look that i felt almost alarmed and was forced to stop  then he seemed to wander again in his mind for he said such a strange thing  what was that betty  he said i was like his mother  well lass he wasnt far wrong for you are uncommon like her  did you know his mother then  ay betty i knowed her well an a fine goodlookin woman she was wi a kindly religious soul just like yours  she was amost heartbroken about her son who was always wild but she had a strong power over him for he was very fond of her and ive no doubt that your readin the bible an telling him about christ brought back old times to his mind  but if his mother was so good and taught him so carefully and as i doubt not prayed often and earnestly for him how was it that he fell into such awful ways asked betty  it was the old old story lass on the other side o the question drink and bad companionsandand i was one of them  you father the companion of a burglar and highway robber  well he wasnt just that at the time though both him and me was bad enough  it was my refusin to jine him in some of his jobs that made a coolness between us an when his mother died i gave him some trouble about money matters which turned him into my bitterest foe  he vowed he would take my life and as he was one o those chaps that when they say theyll do a thing are sure to do it i thought it best to bid adieu to old england especially as i was wanted at the time by the police  poor rose of oregon  the shock to her feelings was terrible for although she had always suspected from some traits in his character that her father had led a wild life it had never entered her imagination that he was an outlaw  for some time she remained silent with her face in her hands quite unable to collect her thoughts or decide what to say for whatever her father might have been in the past he had been invariably kind to her and moreover had given very earnest heed to the loving words which she often spoke when urging him to come to the saviour  at last she looked up quickly  father she said i will nurse this man with more anxious care and interest for his mothers sake  you may do it dear lass for his own sake returned paul impressively for he is your own brother  my brother gasped betty  why what do you mean father  surely you are jesting  very far from jesting lass  stalker is your brother edwin whom you havent seen since you was a small girl and you thought was dead  but come as the cats out o the bag at last i may as well make a clean breast of it  sit down here on the bank betty and listen  the poor girl obeyed almost mechanically for she was wellnigh stunned by the unexpected news which paul had given her and of which from her knowledge of her fathers character she could not doubt the truth  then stalkeredwinmust be your own son she said looking at paul earnestly  nay hes not my son no more than you are my daughter  forgive me betty  ive deceived you throughout but i did it with a good intention  you see if i hadnt passed myself off as your father id never have bin able to git ye out o the boardinschool where ye was putt  but i did it for the best betty i did it for the best an all to benefit your poor mother an you  that is how it was  he paused as if endeavouring to recall the past and betty sat with her hands clasped gazing in pauls face like a fascinated creature unable to speak or move  you see betty he resumed your real father was a doctor in the army an im sorry to have to add he was a bad manso bad that he went and deserted your mother soon after you was born  i raither think that your brother edwin must have got his wickedness from him just as you got your goodness from your mother but ive bin told that your father became a better man before he died an i can well believe it wi such a woman as your mother prayin for him every day as long as he lived  well when you was about six your brother edwin who was then about twenty had got so bad in his ways an used to kick up sitch shindies in the house an swore so terrible that your mother made up her mind to send you to a boardinschool to keep you out o harms way though it nigh broke her heart for you seemed to be the only comfort she had in life  about that time i was goin a good deal about the house bein as ive said a chum o your brother  but he was goin too fast for me and that made me split with him  i tried at first to make him hold in a bit but what was the use of a black sheep like me tryin to make a white sheep o him  the thing was so absurd that he laughed at it indeed we both laughed at it  your mother was at that time very poorly offmade a miserable livin by dressmakin  indeed shed have bin half starved if i hadnt given her a helpin hand in a small way now an then  she was very grateful and very friendly wi me for i was very fond of her and she knowd that bad as i was i tried to restrain her son to some extent  so she told me about her wish to git you well out o the house an axed me if id go an put you in a school down at brighton which she knowd was a good an a cheap one  of course i said i would for you see the poor thing was that hard worked that she couldnt git away from her stitchstitchin not even for an hour much less a day  when i got down to the school before goin up to the door it came into my head that it would be better that the people should know you was well looked after so says i to you quite sudden betty remember youre to call me father when you speak about me  you turned your great blue eyes to my face dear lass when i said that with a puzzled look  me sought mamma say father was far far away in other country says you  thats true says i but ive come home from the other country you see so dont you forget to call me father  vewy well fadder says you in your own sweet way for you was always a biddable child an did what you was told without axin questions  well when id putt you in the school an paid the first quarter in advance an told em that the correspondence would be done chiefly through your mother i went back to london puzzlin my mind all the way what id say to your mother for what id done  once it came into my head i would ax her to marry mefor she was a widow by that timean so make the deception true  but i quickly putt that notion a one side for i knowd i might as well ax an angel to come down from heaven an dwell wi me in a backwoods shantybut after all said paul with a quiet laugh i did get an angel to dwell wi me in a backwoods shanty when i got you betty  howsever as things turned out i was saved the trouble of explainin  when i got back i found your mother in a great state of excitement shed just got a letter from the west indies tellin her that a distant relation had died an left her a small fortin  peoples notions about the size o fortins differs  enough an to spare is oceans wealth to some  thousands o pounds is poverty to others  shed only just got the letter an was so taken up about it that she couldnt help showin it to me  now says i mrs buxleythat was her name an your real name too bettysays i make your will right off an putt it away safe leavin every rap o that fortin to betty for you may depend ont if edwin gits wind o this hell worm it out o you by hook or by crook you know he willand go straight to the dogs at full gallop  what says she an leave nothin to my boymy poor boy for whom i have never ceased to pray  he may repent you knowhe will repent i feel sure of itand then he will find that his mother left him nothing though god had sent her a fortune  oh as to that says i make your mind easy  if edwin does repent an turn to honest ways hes got talents and go enough in him to make his way in the world without help but you can leave him what you like you know only make sure that you leave the bulk of it to betty  this seemed to strike her as a plan that would do for she was silent for some time and then suddenly makin up her mind she said ill go and ask gods help in this matter an then see about gettin a lawyer for i suppose a thing o this sort cant be done without one  no mum says i it cant  you may if you choose make a muddle of it without a lawyer but you cant do it right without one  can you recommend one to me says she  i was greatly tickled at the notion o the likes o me bein axed to recommend a lawyer  it was so like your mothers innocence and trustfulness  howsever shed come to the right shop as it happened for i did know a honest lawyer  yes betty from the way the world speaks an whats often putt in books youd fancy there warnt suchn a thing to be found on arth  but thats all bam betty  leastwise i knowd one honest firm  yes mrs buxley says i theres a firm o the name o truefoot tickle and badger in the city who can do amost anything thats possible to man  but youll have to look sharp for if edwin comes home an diskivers whats doin its all up with the fortin an betty  well to make a long story short your mother went to the lawyers an had her will made leavin a good lump of a sum to your brother but the most of the fortin to you  by the advice o truefoot tickle and badger she made it so that you shouldnt touch the money till you come to be twentyone for says she theres no sayin what bad men will be runnin after the poor thing an deceivin her for the sake of her money before she is of an age to look after herself  yes thought i an theres no sayin what bad menll be runnin after the poor thing an deceivin of her for the sake of her money after shes of an age to look after herself but i didnt say that out for your mother was excited enough and overanxious about things i could see that  well when the will was made out all right she took it out of her chest one night an read it all over to me  i could see it was shipshape though i couldnt read a word of its crabbed letters myself  now mrs buxley says i where are you goin to keep that dockiment  in my chest says she  wont be safe there says i for i knowed her forgivin and confidin natur too well an that shed never be able to keep it from your brother but before i could say more there was a tremendous knockin wi a stick at the front door  your poor mother turned paleshe knowd the sound too well  thats edwin she says jumpin up an runnin to open the door forgetting all about the will so i quietly folded it up an shoved it in my pocket  when edwin was comin up stairs i knowd he was very drunk and savage by the way he was goin on an when he came into the room an saw me he gave a yell of rage  didnt i tell you never to show your face here again says he  just so says i but not bein subjec to your orders dye see i am here again  wi that he swore a terrible oath an rushed at me but he tripped over a footstool and fell flat on the floor  before he could recover himself i made myself scarce an went home  next mornin when id just finished breakfast a thunderin rap came to the door  i knowd it well enough  now look out for squalls said i to myself as i went an opened it  edwin jumped in banged the door to an locked it  youve no occasion to do that says i for i dont expect no friendsnot even bobbies  you doublefaced villain says he youve bin robbin my mother  come come says i civility you know between pals  what have i done to your mother  you neednt try to deceive me paul says he tryin to keep his temper down  mothers bin took bad wi overexcitement the doctor says an shes told me all about the fortin an the will an where betty is down at brighton  my betty at brighton says ipretendin great surprise for i had a darter at that time whom i had called after your mother for that was her name toobut shes dead poor thingshe was dyin in hospital at the very time we was speakin though i didnt know at the time that her end was so nearmy betty at brighton says i  why shes in hospital  bin there for some weeks  i dont mean your brat but my sister says edwin quite fierce where have you put her  whats the name of the school  what have you done wi the will  youd better ax your mother says i  its likely that she knows the partiklers better nor me  he lost patience altogether at this an sprang at me like a tiger but i was ready for him  we had a regular setto then an there  by good luck there was no weapons of any kind in the room not even a table knife for id had to pawn amost everything to pay my rent and the claspknife id eat my breakfast with was in my pocket  but we was both handy with our fists  we kep at it for about half an hour  smashed all the furniture an would have smashed the winders too but there was only one an it was a skylight  in the middle of it the door was burst open an in rushed half a dozen bobbies who put a stop to it at once  were only havin a friendly bout wi the gloves says i smilin quite sweet  i dont see no gloves says the man as held me  thats true says i lookin at my hands  they must have dropped off an rolled up the chimbly  hallo  edwin buxley said the sargeant lookin earnestly at your brother why youve bin wanted for some time  here joe the bracelets  in half a minute he was marched off  ill have your blood paul for this he said bitterly looking back as he went out  as i wasnt wanted just then i went straight off to see your mother to find out how much she had told to edwin for from what he had said i feared she must have told all  i was anxious also to see if shed bin really ill  when i got to the house i met a nurse who said she was dyin an would hardly let me in till i got her persuaded i was an intimate friend  on reachin the bedroom i saw by the looks o two women who were standin there that it was serious  and so it was for there lay your poor mother as pale as death her eyes closed and her lips white but there was a sweet contented smile on her face and her thin hands clasped her wellworn bible to her breast  paul bevan stopped for the poor girl had burst into tears  for a time he was silent and laid his heavy hand gently on her shoulder  i did not ventur to speak to her he continued an indeed it would have been of no use for she was past hearin  a few minutes later and her gentle spirit went up to god  i had no time now to waste for i knew that your brother would give information that might be bad for me so i asked the nurse to write down while i repeated it the lawyers address  now says i go there an tell em whats took place  itll be the better for yourself if you do  an then i went straight off to brighton    chapter twenty one  well you must know said paul bevan continuing his discourse to the rose of oregon when i got to brighton i went to the school told em that your mother was just dead and brought you straight away  i wasnt an hour too soon for as i expected your brother had given information an the plice were on my heels in a jiffy but i was too sharp for em  i went into hidin in london an youve no notion betty what a rare place london is to hide in  a needle what takes to wanderin in a haystack aint safer than a feller is in london if he only knows how to go about the business  i lay there nigh three months durin which time my own poor child betty continued hoverin tween life an death  at last one night when i was at the hospital sittin beside her she suddenly raised her sweet face an fixin her big eyes on me said  father im goin home  shall i tell mother that youre comin  what dye mean my darlin says i while an awful thump came to my heart for i saw a great change come over her  ill be there soon father she said as her dear voice began to fail have you no message for mother  i was so crushed that i couldnt speak so she went on  youll comewont you father an well be so glad to welcome you to heaven  an so will jesus  remember he is the only door father no name but that of jesus she stopped all of a sudden and i saw that she had gone home  after that continued paul hurrying on as if the memory of the event was too much for him havin nothin to keep me in england i came off here to the goldfields with you an brought the will with me intendin when you came of age to tell you all about it an see justice done both to you an to your brother but  fathpaul said betty checking herself that brown parcel you gave me long ago with such earnest directions to keep it safe and only to open it if you were killed is  thats the will my dear  and edwindoes he think that i am your real daughter betty  no doubt he does for he never heard of her bein dead and he never saw you since you was quite a little thing an theres a great change on you since thena wonderful change  yes fathoh it is so hard to lose my father said betty almost breaking down and letting her hands fall listlessly into her lap  but why lose him betty  i did it all for the best said paul gently taking hold of one of the poor girls hands  she made a slight motion to withdraw it but checked herself and let it rest in the mans rough but kindly grasp while tears silently coursed down her rounded cheeks  presently she looked up and said  how did edwin find out where you had gone to  thats more than i can tell betty unless it was through truefoot tickle and badger  i wrote to them after gettin here tellin them to look well after the property and it would be claimed in good time an i raither fear that the postmark on the letter must have let the cat out o the bag  anyhow not long after that edwin found me out an you know how he has persecuted me though you little thought he was your own brother when you were beggin of me not to kill himno more did you guess that i was as little anxious to kill him as you were though i did pretend id have to do it now an then in selfdefence  sometimes indeed he riled me up to sitch an extent that there wasnt much pretence about it but thank god my hand has been held back  yes thank god for that and now i must go to him said betty rising hastily and hurrying back to the indian village  in a darkened tent on a soft couch of deerskins the dying form of buxley alias stalker lay extended  in the fierceness of his selfwill he had neglected his wounds until too late to save his life  a look of stern resolution sat on his countenanceprobably he had resolved to die game as hardened criminals express it  his determination on whatever ground based was evidently not shaken by the arguments of a man who sat by his couch  it was tom brixton  whats the use o preachin to me young fellow said the robberchief testily  i dare say you are pretty nigh as great a scoundrel as i am  perhaps a greater returned tom  i have no wish to enter into comparisons but im quite prepared to admit that i am as bad  well then youve as much need as i have to seek salvation for yourself  indeed i have and it is because i have sought it and obtained it said tom earnestly that i am anxious to point out the way to you ive come through much the same experiences no doubt as you have  i have been a scouter of my mothers teachings a thief and in heart if not in act a murderer  no one could be more urgently in need of salvation from sin than i and i used to think that i was so bad that my case was hopeless until god opened my eyes to see that jesus came to save his people from their sins  that is what you need is it not  ay but it is too late said stalker bitterly  the crucified thief did not find it too late returned tom and it was the eleventh hour with him  stalker made no reply but the stern hard expression of his face did not change one iota until he heard a female voice outside asking if he were asleep  then the features relaxed the frown passed like a summer cloud before the sun and with halfopen lips and a look of glad almost childish expectancy he gazed at the curtaindoor of the tent  mothers voice he murmured apparently in utter forgetfulness of tom brixtons presence  next moment the curtain was raised and betty entering quickly advanced to the side of the couch  tom rose as if about to leave  dont go mr brixton said the girl i wish you to hear us  my brother she continued turning to the invalid and grasping his hand for the first time as she sat down beside him  if you were not so young id swear you were my mother exclaimed stalker with a slight look of surprise at the changed manner of his nurse  ha  i wish that i were indeed your brother  but you are my brother edwin buxley cried the girl with intense earnestness my dear and only brother whom god will save through jesus christ  what do you mean betty asked stalker with an anxious and puzzled look  i mean that i am not betty bevan  paul bevan has told me sotold me that i am betty buxley and your sister  the dying mans chest heaved with labouring breath for his wasted strength was scarcely sufficient to bear this shock of surprise  i would not believe it he said with some difficulty even though paul bevan were to swear to it were it not for the wonderful likeness both in look and tone  he pressed her hand fervently and added yes dear betty  i do believe that you are my very sister  tom brixton from an instinctive feeling of delicacy left the tent while the rose of oregon related to her brother the story of her life with paul bevan and then followed it up with the story of gods love to man in jesus christ  tom hurried to bevans tent to have the unexpected and surprising news confirmed and paul told him a good deal but was very careful to make no allusion to bettys fortin  now mister brixton said paul somewhat sternly when he had finished there must be no more shillyshallyin wi bettys feelins youre fond o her an shes fond o you  in them circumstances a man is bound to wedall the more that the poor thing has lost her natral protector so to speak for im afraid shell no longer look upon me as a father  there was a touch of pathos in pauls tone as he concluded which checked the rising indignation in brixtons breast  but you forget paul that gashford and his men are here and will probably endeavour to lay hold of me  i can scarce look on myself as other than an outlaw  pooh lay hold of you exclaimed paul with contempt dye think gashford or any one else will dare to touch you with mahoghany drake an mister fred an flinders an me and unaco with all his injins at your back  besides let me tell you that gashford seems a changed man  ive had a talk wi him about you an he said he was done persecutin of youthat you had made restitootion when you left all the goold on the rivers bank for him to pick up and that as nobody else in partikler wanted to hang you youd nothin to fear  well that does change the aspect of affairs said tom and it may be that you are right in your advice about betty  i have twice tried to get away from her and have failed  perhaps it may be right now to do as you suggest though after all the time seems not very suitable but as you truly observe she has lost her natural protector for of course you cannot be a father to her any longer  yes ill go and see fred about it  tom had considerable qualms of conscience as to the propriety of the step he meditated and tried to argue with himself as he went in search of his friend  you see he soliloquised aloud her brother is dying and then though i am not a whit more worthy of her than i was the case is nevertheless altered for she has no father now  then by marrying her i shall have a right to protect herand she stands greatly in need of a protector in this wild country at this time poor thing and some one to work for her seeing that she has no means whatever  troth an thats just what she does need sor said paddy flinders stepping out of the bush at the moment  excuse me sor but i cudnt help hearin ye for ye was spakin out loud  but i agree with ye intirely an if i may make so bowld im glad to find ye in that state o mind  did ye hear the news sor  theyve found goold at the hid o the valley here  indeed said tom with a lack of interest that quite disgusted his volatile friend  yes indade said he  why sor theyve found it in big nuggets in some places an muster gashford is off wid a party not half an hour past  im goin mesilf only i thought id see first if ye wouldnt jine me but ye dont seem to care for goold no more nor if it was copper an thats quare too whin it was the very objec that brought ye here  ah flinders i have gained more than my object in coming  i have found goldmost fine gold too that i wont have to leave behind me when it pleases god to call me home  but never fear ill join you  i owe you and other friends a debt and i must dig to pay that  then if i succeed in the little scheme which you overheard me planning i shall need some gold to keep the pot boiling  good luck to ye sor so ye will  but plaze dont mintion the little debt you say you owe me an the other boys  ye dont owe us nothin o the sort  but who comes here  muster fred it isthe very man i want to see  yes and i want to see him too paddy so let me speak first for a brief space in private and you can have him as long as you like afterwards  fred westlys opinion on the point which his friend put before him entirely coincided with that of paul bevan  im not surprised to learn that paul is not her father he said  it was always a puzzle to me how she came to be so ladylike and refined in her feelings with such a rough though kindly father  but i can easily understand it now that i hear who and what her mother was  but the principal person concerned in tom brixtons little scheme held an adverse opinion to his friends paul and fred and flinders  betty would by no means listen to toms proposals until one day her brother said that he would like to see her married to tom brixton before he died  then the obdurate rose of oregon gave in  but how is it to be managed without a clergyman asked fred westly one evening over the camp fire when supper was being prepared  ay how indeed said tom with a perplexed look  oh bother the clergy cried the irreverent flinders  thats just what id do if there was one here responded tom id bother him till he married us  i say what did adam and eve an those sort o people do asked tolly trevor with the sudden animation resulting from the budding of a new idea there was no clergy in their day i suppose  true for ye boy remarked flinders as he lifted a large pot of soup off the fire  i know and care not tolly what those sort o people did said tom and as betty and i are not adam and eve and the nineteenth century is not the first we need not inquire  ill tell ee what said mahoghany drake its just comed into my mind that theres a missionary goes up once a year to an outlyin post o the furtraders an this is about the very time  what say ye to make an excursion there to get spliced its only about two hundred miles off  we could soon ride there an back for the countrys all pretty flattish after passin the sawback range  the very thing cried tom onlyperhaps betty might object to go her brother being so ill  not she said fred since the poor man found in her a sister as well as a nurse he seems to have got a new lease of life  i dont indeed think it possible that he can recover but he may yet live a good while and the mere fact that she has gone to get married will do him good  so it was finally arranged that they should all go and before three days had passed they went with a strong band of their indian allies they found the missionary as had been expected  the knot was tied and tom brixton brought back the rose of oregon as a blooming bride to the sawback range  from that date onward tom toiled at the goldfields as if he had been a galleyslave and scraped together every speck and nugget of gold he could find and hoarded it up as if he had been a very miser and strange to say betty did not discourage him  one day he entered his tent with a large canvas bag in his hand quite full  its all here at last he said holding it up  ive had it weighed and im going to square up  go dear tom and god speed you said the rose giving him a kiss that could not have been purchased by all the gold in oregon  tom went off and soon returned with the empty bag  it was hard work betty to get them to take it but they agreed when i threatened to heave it all into the lake if they didnt  theni ventured said tom looking down with something like a blushit does seem presumptuous in me but i couldnt help iti preached to them  i told them of my having been twice bought of the gold that never perishes and of the debt i owe which i could never repay like theirs with interest because it is incalculable  and now dear betty we begin the world afresh from today  yes and with clear consciences returned betty  i like to recommence life thus  but with empty pockets added tom with a peculiar twist of his mouth  no not quite empty rejoined the young wife drawing a very businesslooking envelope from her pocket and handing it to her husband read that tom  need we say that tom read it with mingled amusement and amazement that he laughed at it and did not believe it that he became grave and inquired into it and that finally when paul bevan detailed the whole affair he was forced to believe it  an estate in the west indies he murmured to himself in a condition of semibewilderment yielding over fifteen hundred a year  a tidy little fortin remarked paddy flinders who overheard him  i hope sor ye wont forgit yer owld frinds in oregon when ye go over to take possession  i wont my boyyou may depend on that  and he did not  but edwin buxley did not live to enjoy his share of the fortune  soon after the wedding he began to sink rapidly and finally died while gazing earnestly in his sisters face with the word mother trembling faintly on his lips  he was laid under a lordly tree not far from the indian village in the sawback range  it was six months afterwards that betty became of age and was entitled to go home and claim her own  she and tom went first to a small village in kent where dwelt an old lady who for some time past had had her heart full to the very brim with gratitude because of a longlost prodigal son having been brought back to hersaved by the blood of the lamb  when at last she set her longing eyes on tom and heard his wellremembered voice say mother the full heart overflowed and rushed down the wrinkled cheeks in floods of inexpressible joy  and the floods were increased and the joy intensified when she turned at last to gaze on a little modest tearful sympathetic flower whom tom introduced to her as the rose of oregon  thereafter tom and the rose paid a visit to london city and called upon truefoot tickle and badger  truefoot was the only partner in the office at the time but he ably represented the firm for he tickled them with information and badgered them with questions to such an extent that they left the place of business in a state of mental confusion but on the whole very well satisfied  the result of all these things was that tom brixton settled down near the village where his mother dwelt and fred westly after staying long enough among the sawback mountains to dig out of them a sufficiency returned home and bought a small farm beside his old chum  and did tom forget his old friends in oregon  no  he became noted for the length and strength of his correspondence  he wrote to flinders begging him to come home and help him with his property and flinders accepted  he wrote to mahoghany drake and sent him a splendid rifle besides good advice and many other things at different times too numerous to mention  he wrote to little tolly trevor endeavouring to persuade him to come to england and be made a man of but tolly politely declined preferring to follow the fortunes of mahoghany and be made a man of in the backwoods sense of the expression in company with his fast friend the leaping buck  tolly sent his special love to the rose of oregon and said that she would be glad to hear that the old place in the sawback range had become a little colony and that a missionary had settled in it and gashford had held by his promise to hernot only giving up drink and gambling entirely but had set up a temperance coffeehouse and a store both of which were in the full blast of prosperity  tolly also said in quite a poetical burst that the fragrance of the rose not only remained in the colony but was still felt as a blessed memory and a potent influence for good throughout all the land  finally tom brixton settled down to a life of usefulness beside his motherwho lived to a fabulous old ageand was never tired of telling especially to his young friends of his wonderful adventures in the far west and how he had been twice boughtonce with gold and once with blood  the end
