table of contents           a novelists allegory           some platitudes concerning drama           meditation on finality           wantedschooling           on our dislike of things as they are           the windlestraw     a novelists allegory  once upon a time the prince of felicitas had occasion to set forth on a journey  it was a late autumn evening with few pale stars and a moon no larger than the paring of a fingernail  and as he rode through the purlieus of his city the white mane of his ambercoloured steed was all that he could clearly see in the dusk of the high streets  his way led through a quarter but little known to him and he was surprised to find that his horse instead of ambling forward with his customary gentle vigour stepped carefully from side to side stopping now and then to curve his neck and prick his earsas though at some thing of fear unseen in the darkness while on either hand creatures could be heard rustling and scuttling and little cold draughts as of wings fanned the riders cheeks  the prince at last turned in his saddle but so great was the darkness that he could not even see his escort  what is the name of this street he said  sire it is called the vita publica  it is very dark even as he spoke his horse staggered but recovering its foothold with an effort stood trembling violently nor could all the incitements of its master induce the beast again to move forward  is there no one with a lanthorn in this street asked the prince  his attendants began forthwith to call out loudly for any one who had a lanthorn  now it chanced that an old man sleeping in a hovel on a pallet of straw was awakened by these cries  when he heard that it was the prince of felicitas himself he came hastily carrying his lanthorn and stood trembling beside the princes horse  it was so dark that the prince could not see him  light your lanthorn old man he said  the old man laboriously lit his lanthorn  its pale rays fled out on either hand beautiful but grim was the vision they disclosed  tall houses fair courtyards and a palm grown garden in front of the princes horse a deep cesspool on whose jagged edges the good beasts hoofs were planted and as far as the glimmer of the lanthorn stretched both ways down the rutted street paving stones displaced and smooth tesselated marble pools of mud the hanging fruit of an orange tree and dark scurrying shapes of monstrous rats bolting across from house to house  the old man held the lanthorn higher and instantly bats flying against it would have beaten out the light but for the thin protection of its horn sides  the prince sat still upon his horse looking first at the rutted space that he had traversed and then at the rutted space before him  without a light he said this thoroughfare is dangerous  what is your name old man  my name is cethru replied the aged churl  cethru said the prince  let it be your duty henceforth to walk with your lanthorn up and down this street all night and every nightand he looked at cethru do you understand old man what it is you have to do  the old man answered in a voice that trembled like a rusty flute  aye ayeto walk up and down and hold my lanthorn so that folk can see where they be going  the prince gathered up his reins but the old man lurching forward touched his stirrup  how long be i to go on wi thiccy job  until you die  cethru held up his lanthorn and they could see his long thin face like a sandwich of dried leather jerk and quiver and his thin grey hairs flutter in the draught of the bats wings circling round the light  twill be main hard he groaned an my lanthorns nowt but a poor thing  with a high look the prince of felicitas bent and touched the old mans forehead  until you die old man he repeated and bidding his followers to light torches from cethrus lanthorn he rode on down the twisting street  the clatter of the horses hoofs died out in the night and the scuttling and the rustling of the rats and the whispers of the bats wings were heard again  cethru left alone in the dark thoroughfare sighed heavily then spitting on his hands he tightened the old girdle round his loins and slinging the lanthorn on his staff held it up to the level of his waist and began to make his way along the street  his progress was but slow for he had many times to stop and rekindle the flame within his lanthorn which the bats wings his own stumbles and the jostlings of footpads or of revellers returning home were for ever extinguishing  in traversing that long street he spent half the night and half the night in traversing it back again  the saffron swan of dawn slow swimming up the skyriver between the high roofbanks bent her neck down through the dark airwater to look at him staggering below her with his still smoking wick  no sooner did cethru see that sunlit bird than with a great sigh of joy he sat him down and at once fell asleep  now when the dwellers in the houses of the vita publica first gained knowledge that this old man passed every night with his lanthorn up and down their street and when they marked those pallid gleams gliding over the motley prospect of cesspools and garden gates over the sightless hovels and the richcarved frontages of their palaces or saw them stay their journey and remain suspended like a handful of daffodils held up against the black stuffs of secrecythey said  it is good that the old man should pass like thiswe shall see better where were going and if the watch have any job on hand or want to put the pavements in order his lanthorn will serve their purpose well enough  and they would call out of their doors and windows to him passing  hola old man cethru  alls well with our house and with the street before it  but for answer the old man only held his lanthorn up so that in the ring of its pale light they saw some sight or other in the street  and his silence troubled them one by one for each had expected that he would reply  aye aye  alls well with your house sirs and with the street before it  thus they grew irritated with this old man who did not seem able to do anything but just hold his lanthorn up  and gradually they began to dislike his passing by their doors with his pale light by which they could not fail to see not only the richcarved frontages and scrolled gates of courtyards and fair gardens but things that were not pleasing to the eye  and they murmured amongst themselves what is the good of this old man and his silly lanthorn  we can see all we want to see without him in fact we got on very well before he came  so as he passed rich folk who were supping would pelt him with orangepeel and empty the dregs of their wine over his head and poor folk sleeping in their hutches turned over as the rays of the lanthorn fell on them and cursed him for that disturbance  nor did revellers or footpads treat the old man civilly but tied him to the wall where he was constrained to stay till a kind passerby released him  and ever the bats darkened his lanthorn with their wings and tried to beat the flame out  and the old man thought this be a terrible hard job i dont seem to please nobody  but because the prince of felicitas had so commanded him he continued nightly to pass with his lanthorn up and down the street and every morning as the saffron swan came swimming overhead to fall asleep  but his sleep did not last long for he was compelled to pass many hours each day in gathering rushes and melting down tallow for his lanthorn so that his lean face grew more than ever like a sandwich of dried leather  now it came to pass that the town watch having had certain complaints made to them that persons had been bitten in the vita publica by rats doubted of their duty to destroy these ferocious creatures and they held investigation summoning the persons bitten and inquiring of them how it was that in so dark a street they could tell that the animals which had bitten them were indeed rats  howbeit for some time no one could be found who could say more than what he had been told and since this was not evidence the town watch had good hopes that they would not after all be forced to undertake this tedious enterprise  but presently there came before them one who said that he had himself seen the rat which had bitten him by the light of an old mans lanthorn  when the town watch heard this they were vexed for they knew that if this were true they would now be forced to prosecute the arduous undertaking and they said  bring in this old man  cethru was brought before them trembling  what is this we hear old man about your lanthorn and the rat  and in the first place what were you doing in the vita publica at that time of night  cethru answered i were just passin with my lanthorn  tell usdid you see the rat  cethru shook his head my lanthorn seed the rat maybe he muttered  old owl said the captain of the watch be careful what you say  if you saw the rat why did you then not aid this unhappy citizen who was bitten by itfirst to avoid that rodent and subsequently to slay it thereby relieving the public of a pestilential danger  cethru looked at him and for some seconds did not reply then he said slowly i were just passin with my lanthorn  that you have already told us said the captain of the watch it is no answer  cethrus leathern cheeks became winecoloured so desirous was he to speak and so unable  and the watch sneered and laughed saying  this is a fine witness  but of a sudden cethru spoke  what would i be duinkillin rats tidden my business to kill rats  the captain of the watch caressed his beard and looking at the old man with contempt said  it seems to me brothers that this is an idle old vagabond who does no good to any one  we should be well advised i think to prosecute him for vagrancy  but that is not at this moment the matter in hand  owing to the accidentscarcely fortunateof this old mans passing with his lanthorn it would certainly appear that citizens have been bitten by rodents  it is then i fear our duty to institute proceedings against those poisonous and violent animals  and amidst the sighing of the watch it was so resolved  cethru was glad to shuffle away unnoticed from the court and sitting down under a cameldate tree outside the city wall he thus reflected  they were rough with me  i done nothin so fars i can see  and a long time he sat there with the bunches of the cameldates above him golden as the sunlight  then as the scent of the lyricflowers released by evening warned him of the night dropping like a flight of dark birds on the plain he rose stiffly and made his way as usual toward the vita publica  he had traversed but little of that black thoroughfare holding his lanthorn at the level of his breast when the sound of a splash and cries for help smote his long thin ears  remembering how the captain of the watch had admonished him he stopped and peered about but owing to his proximity to the light of his own lanthorn he saw nothing  presently he heard another splash and the sound of blowings and of puffings but still unable to see clearly whence they came he was forced in bewilderment to resume his march  but he had no sooner entered the next bend of that obscure and winding avenue than the most lamentable lusty cries assailed him  again he stood still blinded by his own light  somewhere at hand a citizen was being beaten for vague quickmoving forms emerged into the radiance of his lanthorn out of the deep violet of the night air the cries swelled and died away and swelled and the mazed cethru moved forward on his way  but very near the end of his first traversage the sound of a long deep sighing as of a fat man in spiritual pain once more arrested him  drat me he thought this time i will see what tis and he spun round and round holding his lanthorn now high now low and to both sides  the devil an alls in it tonight he murmured to himself theres someat here fetchin of its breath awful loud  but for his life he could see nothing only that the higher he held his lanthorn the more painful grew the sound of the fat but spiritual sighing  and desperately he at last resumed his progress  on the morrow while he still slept stretched on his straw pallet there came to him a member of the watch  old man you are wanted at the court house rouse up and bring your lanthorn  stiffly cethru rose  what be they wantin me fur now mester  ah replied the watchman they are about to see if they cant put an end to your goingson  cethru shivered and was silent  now when they reached the court house it was patent that a great affair was forward for the judges were in their robes and a crowd of advocates burgesses and common folk thronged the careen lofty hall of justice  when cethru saw that all eyes were turned on him he shivered still more violently fixing his fascinated gaze on the three judges in their emerald robes  this then is the prisoner said the oldest of the judges proceed with the indictment  a little advocate in snuffcoloured clothes rose on little legs and commenced to read  forasmuch as on the seventeenth night of august fifteen hundred years since the messiahs death one celestine a maiden of this city fell into a cesspool in the vita publica and while being quietly drowned was espied of the burgess pardonix by the light of a lanthorn held by the old man cethru and forasmuch as plunging in the said pardonix rescued her not without grave risk of life and the ruin of his clothes and today lies ill of fever and forasmuch as the old man cethru was the cause of these misfortunes to the burgess pardonix by reason of his wandering lanthorns showing the drowning maiden the watch do hereby indict accuse and otherwise place charge upon this cethru of vagabondage without serious occupation  and forasmuch as on this same night the watchman filepo made aware by the light of this said cethrus lanthorn of three sturdy footpads went to arrest them and was set on by the rogues and wellnigh slain the watch do hereby indict accuse and otherwise charge upon cethru complicity in this assault by reasons namely first that he discovered the footpads to the watchman and the watchman to the footpads by the light of his lanthorn and second that having thus discovered them he stood idly by and gave no assistance to the law  and forasmuch as on this same night the wealthy burgess pranzo who having prepared a banquet was standing in his doorway awaiting the arrival of his guests did see by the light of the said cethrus lanthorn a beggar woman and her children grovelling in the gutter for garbage whereby his appetite was lost completely and forasmuch as he pranzo has lodged a complaint against the constitution for permitting women and children to go starved the watch do hereby indict accuse and otherwise make charge on cethru of rebellion and of anarchy in that wilfully he doth disturb good citizens by showing to them without provocation disagreeable sights and doth moreover endanger the laws by causing persons to desire to change them  these be the charges reverend judges so please you  and having thus spoken the little advocate resumed his seat  then said the oldest of the judges  cethru you have heard what answer do you make  but no word only the chattering of teeth came from cethru  have you no defence said the judge these are grave accusations  then cethru spoke  so please your highnesses he said can i help what my lanthorn sees  and having spoken these words to all further questions he remained more silent than a headless man  the judges took counsel of each other and the oldest of them thus addressed himself to cethru  if you have no defence old man and there is no one will say a word for you we can but proceed to judgment  then in the main aisle of the court there rose a youthful advocate  most reverend judges he said in a mellifluous voice clearer than the fluting of a bellbird it is useless to look for words from this old man for it is manifest that he himself is nothing and that his lanthorn is alone concerned in this affair  but reverend judges bethink you well  would you have a lanthorn ply a trade or be concerned with a profession or do aught indeed but pervade the streets at night shedding its light which if you will is vagabondage  and sirs upon the second count of this indictment would you have a lanthorn dive into cesspools to rescue maidens  would you have a lanthorn to beat footpads or indeed to be any sort of partisan either of the law or of them that break the law  sure sirs i think not  and as to this third charge of fostering anarchy let me but describe the trick of this lanthorns flame it is distilled most reverend judges of oil and wick together with that sweet secret heat of whose birth no words of mine can tell  and when sirs this pale flame has sprung into the air swaying to every wind it brings vision to the human eye  and if it be charged on this old man cethru that he and his lanthorn by reason of their showing not only the good but the evil bring no pleasure into the world i ask sirs what in the world is so dear as this power to see whether it be the beautiful or the foul that is disclosed  need i indeed tell you of the way this flame spreads its feelers and delicately darts and hovers in the darkness conjuring things from nothing  this mechanical summoning sirs of visions out of blackness is benign by no means of malevolent intent no more than if a man passing two donkeys in the road one lean and the other fat could justly be arraigned for malignancy because they were not both fat  this reverend judges is the essence of the matter concerning the rich burgess pranzo who on account of the sight he saw by cethrus lanthorn has lost the equilibrium of his stomach for sirs the lanthorn did but show that which was there both fair and foul no more no less and though it is indeed true that pranzo is upset it was not because the lanthorn maliciously produced distorted images but merely caused to be seen in due proportions things which pranzo had not seen before  and surely reverend judges being just men you would not have this lanthorn turn its light away from what is ragged and ugly because there are also fair things on which its light may fall how indeed being a lanthorn could it if it would  and i would have you note this sirs that by this impartial discovery of the proportions of one thing to another this lanthorn must indeed perpetually seem to cloud and sadden those things which are fair because of the deep instincts of harmony and justice planted in the human breast  however unfair and cruel then this lanthorn may seem to those who deficient in these instincts desire all their lives to see naught but what is pleasant lest they like pranzo should lose their appetitesit is not consonant with equity that this lanthorn should even if it could be prevented from thus mechanically buffeting the holiday cheek of life  i would think sirs that you should rather blame the queazy state of pranzos stomach  the old man has said that he cannot help what his lanthorn sees  this is a just saying  but if reverend judges you deem this equipoised indifferent lanthorn to be indeed blameworthy for having shown in the same moment side by side the skull and the fair face the burdock and the tigerlily the butterfly and toad then most reverend judges punish it but do not punish this old man for he himself is but a flume of smoke thistle down dispersednothing  so saying the young advocate ceased  again the three judges took counsel of each other and after much talk had passed between them the oldest spoke  what this young advocate has said seems to us to be the truth  we cannot punish a lanthorn  let the old man go  and cethru went out into the sunshine         now it came to pass that the prince of felicitas returning from his journey rode once more on his ambercoloured steed down the vita publica  the night was dark as a rooks wing but far away down the street burned a little light like a red star truant from heaven  the prince riding by descried it for a lanthorn with an old man sleeping beside it  how is this friend said the prince  you are not walking as i bade you carrying your lanthorn  but cethru neither moved nor answered  lift him up said the prince  they lifted up his head and held the lanthorn to his closed eyes  so lean was that brown face that the beams from the lanthorn would not rest on it but slipped past on either side into the night  his eyes did not open  he was dead  and the prince touched him saying farewell old man  the lanthorn is still alight  go fetch me another one and let him carry it 1909     some platitudes concerning drama  a drama must be shaped so as to have a spire of meaning  every grouping of life and character has its inherent moral and the business of the dramatist is so to pose the group as to bring that moral poignantly to the light of day  such is the moral that exhales from plays like lear hamlet and macbeth  but such is not the moral to be found in the great bulk of contemporary drama  the moral of the average play is now and probably has always been the triumph at all costs of a supposed immediate ethical good over a supposed immediate ethical evil  the vice of drawing these distorted morals has permeated the drama to its spine discoloured its art humanity and significance infected its creators actors audience critics too often turned it from a picture into a caricature  a drama which lives under the shadow of the distorted moral forgets how to be free fair and fineforgets so completely that it often prides itself on having forgotten  now in writing plays there are in this matter of the moral three courses open to the serious dramatist  the first is to definitely set before the public that which it wishes to have set before it the views and codes of life by which the public lives and in which it believes this way is the most common successful and popular  it makes the dramatists position sure and not too obviously authoritative  the second course is to definitely set before the public those views and codes of life by which the dramatist himself lives those theories in which he himself believes the more effectively if they are the opposite of what the public wishes to have placed before it presenting them so that the audience may swallow them like powder in a spoonful of jam  there is a third course to set before the public no cutanddried codes but the phenomena of life and character selected and combined but not distorted by the dramatists outlook set down without fear favour or prejudice leaving the public to draw such poor moral as nature may afford  this third method requires a certain detachment it requires a sympathy with a love of and a curiosity as to things for their own sake it requires a far view together with patient industry for no immediately practical result  it was once said of shakespeare that he had never done any good to any one and never would  this unfortunately could not in the sense in which the word good was then meant be said of most modern dramatists in truth the good that shakespeare did to humanity was of a remote and shall we say eternal nature something of the good that men get from having the sky and the sea to look at  and this partly because he was in his greater plays at all events free from the habit of drawing a distorted moral  now the playwright who supplies to the public the facts of life distorted by the moral which it expects does so that he may do the public what he considers an immediate good by fortifying its prejudices and the dramatist who supplies to the public facts distorted by his own advanced morality does so because he considers that he will at once benefit the public by substituting for its wornout ethics his own  in both cases the advantage the dramatist hopes to confer on the public is immediate and practical  but matters change and morals change men remainand to set men and the facts about them down faithfully so that they draw for us the moral of their natural actions may also possibly be of benefit to the community  it is at all events harder than to set men and facts down as they ought or ought not to be  this however is not to say that a dramatist should or indeed can keep himself and his temperamental philosophy out of his work  as a man lives and thinks so will he write but it is certain that to the making of good drama as to the practice of every other art there must be brought an almost passionate love of discipline a whiteheat of selfrespect a desire to make the truest fairest best thing in ones power and that to these must be added an eye that does not flinch such qualities alone will bring to a drama the selfless character which soaks it with inevitability  the word pessimist is frequently applied to the few dramatists who have been content to work in this way  it has been applied among others to euripides to shakespeare to ibsen it will be applied to many in the future  nothing however is more dubious than the way in which these two words pessimist and optimist are used for the optimist appears to be he who cannot bear the world as it is and is forced by his nature to picture it as it ought to be and the pessimist one who cannot only bear the world as it is but loves it well enough to draw it faithfully the true lover of the human race is surely he who can put up with it in all its forms in vice as well as in virtue in defeat no less than in victory the true seer he who sees not only joy but sorrow the true painter of human life one who blinks nothing  it may be that he is also incidentally its true benefactor  in the whole range of the social fabric there are only two impartial persons the scientist and the artist and under the latter heading such dramatists as desire to write not only for today but for tomorrow must strive to come  but dramatists being as they are madepast remedy it is perhaps more profitable to examine the various points at which their qualities and defects are shown  the plot  a good plot is that sure edifice which slowly rises out of the interplay of circumstance on temperament and temperament on circumstance within the enclosing atmosphere of an idea  a human being is the best plot there is it may be impossible to see why he is a good plot because the idea within which he was brought forth cannot be fully grasped but it is plain that he is a good plot  he is organic  and so it must be with a good play  reason alone produces no good plots they come by original sin sure conception and instinctive afterpower of selecting what benefits the germ  a bad plot on the other hand is simply a row of stakes with a character impaled on eachcharacters who would have liked to live but came to untimely grief who started bravely but fell on these stakes placed beforehand in a row and were transfixed one by one while their ghosts stride on squeaking and gibbering through the play  whether these stakes are made of facts or of ideas according to the nature of the dramatist who planted them their effect on the unfortunate characters is the same the creatures were begotten to be staked and staked they are  the demand for a good plot not unfrequently heard commonly signifies tickle my sensations by stuffing the play with arbitrary adventures so that i need not be troubled to take the characters seriously  set the persons of the play to action regardless of time sequence atmosphere and probability  now true dramatic action is what characters do at once contrary as it were to expectation and yet because they have already done other things  no dramatist should let his audience know what is coming but neither should he suffer his characters to act without making his audience feel that those actions are in harmony with temperament and arise from previous known actions together with the temperaments and previous known actions of the other characters in the play  the dramatist who hangs his characters to his plot instead of hanging his plot to his characters is guilty of cardinal sin  the dialogue  good dialogue again is character marshalled so as continually to stimulate interest or excitement  the reason good dialogue is seldom found in plays is merely that it is hard to write for it requires not only a knowledge of what interests or excites but such a feeling for character as brings misery to the dramatists heart when his creations speak as they should not speakashes to his mouth when they say things for the sake of saying themdisgust when they are smart  the art of writing true dramatic dialogue is an austere art denying itself all license grudging every sentence devoted to the mere machinery of the play suppressing all jokes and epigrams severed from character relying for fun and pathos on the fun and tears of life  from start to finish good dialogue is handmade like good lace clear of fine texture furthering with each thread the harmony and strength of a design to which all must be subordinated  but good dialogue is also spiritual action  in so far as the dramatist divorces his dialogue from spiritual actionthat is to say from progress of events or toward events which are significant of characterhe is stultifying the thing done he may make pleasing disquisitions he is not making drama  and in so far as he twists character to suit his moral or his plot he is neglecting a first principle that truth to nature which alone invests art with handmade quality  the dramatists license in fact ends with his design  in conception alone he is free  he may take what character or group of characters he chooses see them with what eyes knit them with what idea within the limits of his temperament but once taken seen and knitted he is bound to treat them like a gentleman with the tenderest consideration of their mainsprings  take care of character action and dialogue will take care of themselves  the true dramatist gives full rein to his temperament in the scope and nature of his subject having once selected subject and characters he is just gentle restrained neither gratifying his lust for praise at the expense of his offspring nor using them as puppets to flout his audience  being himself the nature that brought them forth he guides them in the course predestined at their conception so only have they a chance of defying time which is always lying in wait to destroy the false topical or fashionable allin a wordthat is not based on the permanent elements of human nature  the perfect dramatist rounds up his characters and facts within the ringfence of a dominant idea which fulfils the craving of his spirit having got them there he suffers them to live their own lives  plot action character dialogue  but there is yet another subject for a platitude  flavour  an impalpable quality less easily captured than the scent of a flower the peculiar and most essential attribute of any work of art  it is the thin poignant spirit which hovers up out of a play and is as much its differentiating essence as is caffeine of coffee  flavour in fine is the spirit of the dramatist projected into his work in a state of volatility so that no one can exactly lay hands on it here there or anywhere  this distinctive essence of a play marking its brand is the one thing at which the dramatist cannot work for it is outside his consciousness a man may have many moods he has but one spirit and this spirit he communicates in some subtle unconscious way to all his work  it waxes and wanes with the currents of his vitality but no more alters than a chestnut changes into an oak  for in truth dramas are very like unto trees springing from seedlings shaping themselves inevitably in accordance with the laws fast hidden within themselves drinking sustenance from the earth and air and in conflict with the natural forces round them  so they slowly come to full growth until warped stunted or risen to fair and gracious height they stand open to all the winds  and the trees that spring from each dramatist are of different race he is the spirit of his own sacred grove into which no stray tree can by any chance enter  one more platitude  it is not unfashionable to pit one form of drama against anotherholding up the naturalistic to the disadvantage of the epic the epic to the belittlement of the fantastic the fantastic to the detriment of the naturalistic  little purpose is thus served  the essential meaning truth beauty and irony of things may be revealed under all these forms  vision over life and human nature can be as keen and just the revelation as true inspiring delightgiving and thoughtprovoking whatever fashion be employedit is simply a question of doing it well enough to uncover the kernel of the nut  whether the violet come from russia from parma or from england matters little close by the greek temples at paestum there are violets that seem redder and sweeter than any ever seenas though they have sprung up out of the footprints of some old pagan goddess but under the april sun in a devonshire lane the little blue scentless violets capture every bit as much of the spring  and so it is with dramano matter what its form it need only be the real thing need only have caught some of the precious fluids revelation or delight and imprisoned them within a chalice to which we may put our lips and continually drink  and yet starting from this last platitude one may perhaps be suffered to speculate as to the particular forms that our renascent drama is likely to assume  for our drama is renascent and nothing will stop its growth  it is not renascent because this or that man is writing but because of a new spirit  a spirit that is no doubt in part the gradual outcome of the impact on our homegrown art of russian french and scandinavian influences but which in the main rises from an awakened humanity in the conscience of our time  what then are to be the main channels down which the renascent english drama will float in the coming years  it is more than possible that these main channels will come to be two in number and situate far apart  the one will be the broad and clearcut channel of naturalism down which will course a drama poignantly shaped and inspired with high intention but faithful to the seething and multiple life around us drama such as some are inclined to term photographic deceived by a seeming simplicity into forgetfulness of the old proverb ars est celare artem and oblivious of the fact that to be vital to grip such drama is in every respect as dependent on imagination construction selection and eliminationthe main laws of artistryas ever was the romantic or rhapsodic play the question of naturalistic technique will bear indeed much more study than has yet been given to it  the aim of the dramatist employing it is obviously to create such an illusion of actual life passing on the stage as to compel the spectator to pass through an experience of his own to think and talk and move with the people he sees thinking talking and moving in front of him  a false phrase a single word out of tune or time will destroy that illusion and spoil the surface as surely as a stone heaved into a still pool shatters the image seen there  but this is only the beginning of the reason why the naturalistic is the most exacting and difficult of all techniques it is easy enough to reproduce the exact conversation and movements of persons in a room it is desperately hard to produce the perfectly natural conversation and movements of those persons when each natural phrase spoken and each natural movement made has not only to contribute toward the growth and perfection of a dramas soul but also to be a revelation phrase by phrase movement by movement of essential traits of character to put it another way naturalistic art when alive indeed to be alive at all is simply the art of manipulating a procession of most delicate symbols  its service is the swaying and focussing of mens feelings and thoughts in the various departments of human life  it will be like a steady lamp held up from time to time in whose light things will be seen for a space clearly and in due proportion freed from the mists of prejudice and partisanship  and the other of these two main channels will i think be a twisting and delicious stream which will bear on its breast new barques of poetry shaped it may be like prose but a prose incarnating through its fantasy and symbolism all the deeper aspirations yearning doubts and mysterious stirrings of the human spirit a poetic prosedrama emotionalising us by its diversity and purity of form and invention and whose province will be to disclose the elemental soul of man and the forces of nature not perhaps as the old tragedies disclosed them not necessarily in the epic mood but always with beauty and in the spirit of discovery  such will i think be the two vital forms of our drama in the coming generation  and between these two forms there must be no crude unions they are too far apart the cross is too violent  for where there is a seeming blend of lyricism and naturalism it will on examination be found i think to exist only in plays whose subjects or settingsas in synges playboy of the western world or in mr masefields nanare so removed from our ken that we cannot really tell and therefore do not care whether an absolute illusion is maintained  the poetry which may and should exist in naturalistic drama can only be that of perfect rightness of proportion rhythm shapethe poetry in fact that lies in all vital things  it is the illmating of forms that has killed a thousand plays  we want no more bastard drama no more attempts to dress out the simple dignity of everyday life in the peacocks feathers of false lyricism no more strawstuffed heroes or heroines no more rabbits and goldfish from the conjurers pockets nor any limelight  let us have starlight moonlight sunlight and the light of our own selfrespects 1909     meditation on finality  in the grand canyon of arizona that most exhilarating of all natural phenomena nature has for once so focussed her effects that the result is a framed and final work of art  for there between two high lines of plateau level as the sea are sunk the wrought thrones of the innumerable gods couchant and for ever revering in their million moods of light and colour the master mystery  having seen this culmination i realize why many people either recoil before it and take the first train home or speak of it as a remarkable formation  for though mankind at large craves finality it does not crave the sort that bends the knee to mystery in nature in religion in art in life the common cry is tell me precisely where i am what doing and where going  let me be free of this fearful untidiness of not knowing all about it  the favoured religions are always those whose message is most finite  the fashionable professionsthey that end us in assured positions  the most popular works of fiction such as leave nothing to our imagination  and to this craving after prose who would not be lenient that has at all known life with its usual predominance of our lower and less courageous selves our constant hankering after the cosey closed door and line of least resistance  we are continually begging to be allowed to know for certain though if our prayer were granted and mystery no longer hovered made blue the hills and turned day into night we should as surely wail at once to be delivered of that ghastliness of knowing things for certain  now in art i would never quarrel with a certain living writer who demands of it the kind of finality implied in what he calls a moral discoveryusing no doubt the words in their widest sense  i would maintain however that such finality is not confined to positively discovering the true conclusion of premises laid down but that it may also distil gradually negatively from the whole work in a moral discovery as it were of author  in other words that permeation by an essential point of view by emanation of author may so unify and vitalize a work as to give it all the finality that need be required of art  for the finality that is requisite to art be it positive or negative is not the finality of dogma nor the finality of fact it is ever the finality of feelingof a spiritual light subtly gleaned by the spectator out of that queer luminous haze which one mans nature must ever be to others  and herein incidentally it is that art acquires also that quality of mystery more needful to it even than finality for the mystery that wraps a work of art is the mystery of its maker and the mystery of its maker is the difference between that makers soul and every other soul  but let me take an illustration of what i mean by these two kinds of finality that art may have and show that in essence they are but two halves of the same thing  the term a work of art will not be denied i think to that early novel of m anatole france le lys rouge  now that novel has positive finality since the spiritual conclusion from its premises strikes one as true  but neither will the term a work of art be denied to the same writers four bergeret volumes whose negative finality consists only in the temperamental atmosphere wherein they are soaked  now if the theme of le lys rouge had been treated by tolstoy meredith or turgenev we should have had spiritual conclusions from the same factual premises so different from m frances as prunes from prisms and yet being the work of equally great artists they would doubtless have struck us as equally true  is not then the positive finality of le lys rouge though expressed in terms of a different craftsmanship the same in essence as the negative finality of the bergeret volumes  are not both in fact merely flower of author true to himself  so long as the scent colour form of that flower is strong and fine enough to affect the senses of our spirit then all the rest surely is academici would say immaterial  but here in regard to art is where mankind at large comes on the field flower of author it says senses of the spirit phew  give me something i can understand  let me know where i am getting to  in a word it wants a finality different from that which art can give  it will ask the artist with irritation what his solution or his lesson or his meaning really is having omitted to notice that the poor creature has been giving all the meaning that he can in every sentence it will demand to know why it was not told definitely what became of charles or mary in whom it had grown so interested and will be almost frightened to learn that the artist knows no more than itself  and if by any chance it be required to dip its mind into a philosophy that does not promise it a defined position both in this world and the next it will assuredly recoil and with a certain contempt say no sir  this means nothing to me and if it means anything to youwhich i very much doubti am sorry for you  it must have facts and again facts not only in the present and the past but in the future  and it demands facts of that which alone cannot glibly give it facts  it goes on asking facts of art or rather such facts as art cannot givefor after all even flower of author is fact in a sort of way  consider for instance synges masterpiece the playboy of the western world there is flower of author  what is it for mankind at large  an attack on the irish character  a pretty piece of writing  an amusing farce  enigmatic cynicism leading nowhere  a puzzling fellow wrote it mankind at large has little patience with puzzling fellows  few in fact want flower of author  moreover it is a quality that may well be looked for where it does not exist  to say that the finality which art requires is merely an enwrapping mood or flower of author is not by any means to say that any robust fellow slamming his notions down in ink can give us these  indeed no  so long as we see the authors proper person in his work we do not see the flower of him  let him retreat himself if he pretend to be an artist  there is no less of subtle skill no less impersonality in the bergeret volumes than in le lys rouge  no less labour and mental torturing went to their making page by page in order that they might exhale their perfume of mysterious finality their withdrawn but implicit judgment  flower of author is not quite so common as the buttercup the californian poppy or the gay texan gaillardia and for that very reason the finality it gives off will never be robust enough for a mankind at large that would have things cut and dried and labelled in thick letters  for considerto take one phase alone of this demand for factual finalityhow continual and insistent is the cry for characters that can be worshipped how intense and persistent the desire to be told that charles was a real hero and how bitter the regret that mary was no better than she should be  mankind at large wants heroes that are heroes and heroines that are heroinesand nothing so inappropriate to them as unhappy endings  travelling away i remember from that grand canyon of arizona were a young man and a young woman evidently in love  he was sitting very close to her and reading aloud for her pleasure from a papercovered novel heroically oblivious of us all  sir robert she murmured lifting her beauteous eyes i may not tempt you for you are too dear to me sir robert held her lovely face between his two strong hands  farewell he said and went out into the night but something told them both that when he had fulfilled his duty sir robert would return         he had not returned before we reached the junction but there was finality about that baronet and we well knew that he ultimately would  and long after the sound of that young mans faithful reading had died out of our ears we meditated on sir robert and compared him with the famous characters of fiction slowly perceiving that they were none of them so final in their heroism as he  no none of them reached that apex  for hamlet was a most unfinished fellow and lear extremely violent  pickwick addicted to punch and sam weller to lying bazarof actually a nihilist and

not even so virtuous as mary who failed of being what she should be  and coming to more familiar persons joseph and moses david and elijah all of them lacked his finality of true heroismnone could quite pass muster beside sir robert        long we meditated and reflecting that an author must ever be superior to the creatures of his brain were refreshed to think that there were so many living authors capable of giving birth to sir robert for indeed sir robert and finality like hisno doubtful heroes no flower of author and no mystery is what mankind at large has always wanted from letters and will always want  as truly as that oil and water do not mix there are two kinds of men the main cleavage in the whole tale of life is this subtle all pervading division of mankind into the man of facts and the man of feeling  and not by what they are or do can they be told one from the other but just by their attitude toward finality  fortunately most of us are neither quite the one nor quite the other  but between the pureblooded of each kind there is real antipathy far deeper than the antipathies of race politics or religionan antipathy that not circumstance love goodwill or necessity will ever quite get rid of  sooner shall the panther agree with the bull than that other one with the man of facts there is no bridging the gorge that divides these worlds  nor is it so easy to tell of each to which world he belongs as it was to place the lady who held out her finger over that gorge called grand canyon and said  it doesnt look thirteen miles but they measured it just there  excuse my pointing 1912     wantedschooling  et nous jongleurs inutiles frivoles joueurs de luth    useless jugglers frivolous players on the lute  must we so describe ourselves we the producers season by season of so many hundreds of remarkable works of fictionfor though when we take up the remarkable works of our fellows we really cannot read them the press and the advertisements of our publishers tell us that they are remarkable  a story goes that once in the twilight undergrowth of a forest of nutbearing trees a number of little purblind creatures wandered singing for nuts  on some of these purblind creatures the nuts fell heavy and full extremely indigestible and were quickly swallowed on others they fell light and contained nothing because the kernel had already been eaten up above and these light and kernelless nuts were accompanied by sibilations or laughter  on others again no nuts at all empty or full came down  but nuts or no nuts full nuts or empty nuts the purblind creatures below went on wandering and singing  a traveller one day stopped one of these creatures whose voice was peculiarly disagreeable and asked why do you sing like this  is it for pleasure that you do it or for pain  what do you get out of it  is it for the sake of those up there  is it for your own sakefor the sake of your familyfor whose sake  do you think your songs worth listening to  answer  the creature scratched itself and sang the louder  ah  cacoethes  i pity but do not blame you said the traveller  he left the creature and presently came to another which sang a squeaky treble song  it wandered round in a ring under a grove of stunted trees and the traveller noticed that it never went out of that grove  is it really necessary he said for you to express yourself thus  and as he spoke showers of tiny hard nuts came down on the little creature who ate them greedily  the traveller opened one it was extremely small and tasted of dry rot  why at all events he said need you stay under these trees the nuts are not good here  but for answer the little creature ran round and round and round and round  i suppose said the traveller small bad nuts are better than no bread if you went out of this grove you would starve  the purblind little creature shrieked  the traveller took the sound for affirmation and passed on  he came to a third little creature who under a tall tree was singing very loudly indeed while all around was a great silence broken only by sounds like the snuffling of small noses the creature stopped singing as the traveller came up and at once a storm of huge nuts came down the traveller found them sweetish and very oily  why he said to the creature did you sing so loud  you cannot eat all these nuts  you really do sing louder than seems necessary come answer me  but the purblind little creature began to sing again at the top of its voice and the noise of the snuffling of small noses became so great that the traveller hastened away  he passed many other purblind little creatures in the twilight of this forest till at last he came to one that looked even blinder than the rest but whose song was sweet and low and clear breaking a perfect stillness and the traveller sat down to listen  for a long time he listened to that song without noticing that not a nut was falling  but suddenly he heard a faint rustle and three little oval nuts lay on the ground  the traveller cracked one of them  it was of delicate flavour  he looked at the little creature standing with its face raised and said  tell me little blind creature whose song is so charming where did you learn to sing  the little creature turned its head a trifle to one side as though listening for the fall of nuts  ah indeed said the traveller you whose voice is so clear is this all you get to eat  the little blind creature smiled         it is a twilight forest in which we writers of fiction wander and once in a way though all this has been said before we may as well remind ourselves and others why the light is so dim why there is so much bad and false fiction why the demand for it is so great living in a world where demand creates supply we writers of fiction furnish the exception to this rule  for consider how as a class we come into existence unlike the followers of any other occupation nothing whatever compels any one of us to serve an apprenticeship  we go to no school have to pass no examination attain no standard receive no diploma  we need not study that which should be studied we are at liberty to flood our minds with all that should not be studied  like mushrooms in a single sight we spring upa pen in our hands very little in our brains and whoknowswhat in our hearts  few of us sit down in cold blood to write our first stories we have something in us that we feel we must express  this is the beginning of the vicious circle  our first books often have some thing in them  we are sincere in trying to express that something  it is true we cannot express it not having learnt how but its ghost haunts the pages the ghost of real experience and real lifejust enough to attract the untrained intelligence just enough to make a generous press remark this shows promise  we have tasted blood we pant for more  those of us who had a carking occupation hasten to throw it aside those who had no occupation have now found one some few of us keep both the old occupation and the new whichever of these courses we pursue the hurry with which we pursue it undoes us for often we have only that one book in us which we did not know how to write and having expressed that which we have felt we are driven in our second our third our fourth to warm up variations like those dressed remains of last nights dinner which are served for lunch or to spin from our usually commonplace imaginations thin extravagances which those who do not try to think for themselves are ever ready to accept as full of inspiration and vitality anything for a book we sayanything for a book  from time immemorial we have acted in this immoral manner till we have accustomed the press and public to expect it  from time immemorial we have allowed ourselves to be driven by those powerful drivers bread and praise and cared little for the quality of either  sensibly or insensibly we tune our songs to earn the nuts of our twilight forest we tune them not to the key of is it good but to the key of will it pay and at each tuning the nuts fall fast  it is all so natural how can we help it seeing that we are undisciplined and standardless seeing that we started without the backbone that schooling gives  here and there among us is a genius here and there a man of exceptional stability who trains himself in spite of all the forces working for his destruction  but those who do not publish until they can express and do not express until they have something worth expressing are so rare that they can be counted on the fingers of three or perhaps four hands mercifully we allor nearly all believe ourselves of that company  it is the fashion to say that the public will have what it wants certainly the public will have what it wants if what it wants is given to the public  if what it now wants were suddenly withdrawn the public the big public would by an obvious natural law take the lowest of what remained if that again were withdrawn it would take the next lowest until by degrees it took a relatively good article the public the big public is a mechanical and helpless consumer at the mercy of what is supplied to it and this must ever be so  the public then is not to blame for the supply of bad false fiction the press is not to blame for the press like the public must take what is set before it their critics for the most part like ourselves have been to no school passed no test of fitness received no certificate they cannot lead us it is we who lead them for without the critics we could live but without us the critics would die  we cannot therefore blame the press  nor is the publisher to blame for the publisher will publish what is set before him  it is true that if he published no books on commission he would deserve the praise of the state but it is quite unreasonable for us to expect him to deserve the praise of the state since it is we who supply him with these books and incite him to publish them  we cannot therefore lay the blame on the publisher  we must lay the blame where it clearly should be laid on ourselves we ourselves create the demand for bad and false fiction  very many of us have private means for such there is no excuse  very many of us have none for such once started on this journey of fiction there is much often tragic excusethe less reason then for not having trained ourselves before setting out on our way  there is no getting out of it the fault is ours  if we will not put ourselves to school when we are young if we must rush into print before we can spell if we will not repress our natural desires and walk before we run if we will not learn at least what not to dowe shall go on wandering through the forest singing our foolish songs  and since we cannot train ourselves except by writing let us write and burn what we write then shall we soon stop writing or produce what we need not burn  for as things are now without compass without map we set out into the twilight forest of fiction without path without trackand we never emerge  yes with the french writer we must say  et nous jongleurs inutiles frivoles joueurs de luth      1906     reflections on our dislike of things as they are  yes  why is this the chief characteristic of our art  what secret instincts are responsible for this inveterate distaste  but first is it true that we have it  to stand still and look at a thing for the joy of looking without reference to any material advantage and personal benefit either to ourselves or our neighbours just simply to indulge our curiosity  is that a british habit  i think not  if on some november afternoon we walk into kensington gardens where they join the park on the bayswater side and crossing in front of the ornamental fountain glance at the semicircular seat let into a dismal little temple of the sun we shall see a halfmoon of apathetic figures there enjoying a moment of lugubrious idleness may be sitting an old countrywoman with steady eyes in a lean dustyblack dress and an old pokebonnet by her side some ginfaced creature of the town all blousy and draggled a holloweyed foreigner far gone in consumption a bronzed young navvy asleep with his muddy boots jutting straight out a bearded dreary being chin on chest and more consumptives and more vagabonds and more people deadtired speechless and staring before them from that crescentshaped haven where there is no draught at their backs and the sun occasionally shines  and as we look at them according to the state of our temper we think poor creatures i wish i could do something for them or revolting  they oughtnt to allow it but do we feel any pleasure in just watching them any of that intimate sensation a cat entertains when its back is being rubbed are we curiously enjoying the sight of these people simply as manifestations of life as objects fashioned by the ebb and flow of its tides  again i think not  and why  either because we have instantly felt that we ought to do something that here is a danger in our midst which one day might affect our own security and at all events a sight revolting to us who came out to look at this remarkably fine fountain  or because we are too humane  though very possibly that frequent murmuring of ours ah  its too sad is but another way of putting the words stand aside please youre too depressing  or again is it that we avoid the sight of things as they are avoid the unedifying because of what may be called the uncreative instinct that safeguard and concomitant of a civilisation which demands of us complete efficiency practical and thorough employment of every second of our time and every inch of our space  we know of course that out of nothing nothing can be made that to create anything a man must first receive impressions and that to receive impressions requires an apparatus of nerves and feelers exposed and quivering to every vibration round it an apparatus so entirely opposed to our national spirit and traditions that the bare thought of it causes us to blush  a robust recognition of this a steadfast resolve not to be forced out of the current of strenuous civilisation into the sleepy backwater of pure impression ism makes us distrustful of attempts to foster in ourselves that receptivity and subsequent creativeness the microbes of which exist in every man to watch a thing simply because it is a thing entirely without considering how it can affect us and without even seeing at the moment how we are to get anything out of it jars our consciences jars that inner feeling which keeps secure and makes harmonious the whole concert of our lives for we feel it to be a waste of time dangerous to the community contributing neither to our meat and drink our clothes and comfort nor to the stability and order of our lives  of these three possible reasons for our dislike of things as they are the first two are perhaps contained within the third  but to whatever our dislike is due we have itoh we have it  with the possible exception of hogarth in his nonpreaching pictures and constable in his sketches of the skyi speak of dead men onlyhave we produced any painter of reality like manet or millet any writer like flaubert or maupassant like turgenev or tchekov  we are i think too deeply civilised so deeply civilised that we have come to look on nature as indecent  the acts and emotions of life undraped with ethics seem to us anathema  it has long been and still is the fashion among the intellectuals of the continent to regard us as barbarians in most aesthetic matters  ah  if they only knew how infinitely barbarous they seem to us in their naive contempt of our barbarism and in what we regard as their infantine concern with things as they are  how far have we not gone past all thatwe of the oldest settled western country who have so veneered our lives that we no longer know of what wood they are made  whom generations have so soaked with the preserve good form that we are impervious to the claims and clamour of that illbred creaturelife  who think it either dreadful or vieux jeu that such things as the crude emotions and the raw struggles of fate should be even mentioned much less presented in terms of art  for whom an artist is suspect if he is not in his work a sportsman and a gentleman  who shake a solemn head over writers who will treat of sex and with the remark worst of it is theres so much truth in those fellows close the book  ah well  i suppose we have been too long familiar with the unprofitableness of speculation have surrendered too definitely to actionto the material side of things retaining for what relaxation our spirits may require a habit of sentimental aspiration carefully divorced from things as they are  we seem to have decided that things are not or if they are ought not to beand what is the good of thinking of things like that  in fact our national ideal has become the will to health to material efficiency and to it we have sacrificed the will to sensibility  it is a point of view  and yetto the philosophy that craves perfection to the spirit that desires the golden mean and hankers for the serene and balanced seat in the centre of the seesaw it seems a little pitiful and constricted a confession of defeat a hedging and limitation of the soul  need we put up with this must we for ever turn our eyes away from things as they are stifle our imaginations and our sensibilities for fear that they should become our masters and destroy our sanity  this is the eternal question that confronts the artist and the thinker  because of the inevitable decline after full floweringpoint is reached the inevitable fading of the fire that follows the full flame and glow are we to recoil from striving to reach the perfect and harmonious climacteric  better to have loved and lost i think than never to have loved at all better to reach out and grasp the fullest expression of the individual and the national soul than to keep for ever under the shelter of the wall i would even think it possible to be sensitive without neurasthenia to be sympathetic without insanity to be alive to all the winds that blow without getting influenza  god forbid that our letters and our arts should decade into beardsleyism but between that and their present health there lies full floweringpoint not yet by a long way reached  to flower like that i suspect we must see things just a little moreas they are 19051912     the windlestraw  a certain writer returning one afternoon from rehearsal of his play sat down in the hall of the hotel where he was staying  no he reflected this play of mine will not please the public it is gloomy almost terrible  this very day i read these words in my morning paper no artist can afford to despise his public for whether he confesses it or not the artist exists to give the public what it wants  i have then not only done what i cannot afford to do but i have been false to the reason of my existence  the hall was full of people for it was the hour of tea and looking round him the writer thought and this is the publicthe public that my play is destined not to please  and for several minutes he looked at them as if he had been hypnotised  presently between two tables he noticed a waiter standing lost in his thoughts  the mask of the mans professional civility had come awry and the expression of his face and figure was curiously remote from the faces and forms of those from whom he had been taking orders he seemed like a bird discovered in its own haunts all unconscious as yet of human eyes and the writer thought but if those people at the tables are the public what is that waiter how if i was mistaken and not they but he were the real public  and testing this thought his mind began at once to range over all the people he had lately seen  he thought of the founders day dinner of a great school which he had attended the night before  no he mused i see very little resemblance between the men at that dinner and the men in this hall still less between them and the waiter  how if they were the real public and neither the waiter nor these people here  but no sooner had he made this reflection than he bethought him of a gathering of workers whom he had watched two days ago  again he mused i do not recollect any resemblance at all between those workers and the men at the dinner and certainly they are not like any one here  what if those workers are the real public not the men at the dinner nor the waiter nor the people in this hall  and thereupon his mind flew off again and this time rested on the figures of his own immediate circle of friends they seemed very different from the four real publics whom he had as yet discovered yes he considered when i come to think of it my associates painters and writers and critics and all that kind of persondo not seem to have anything to speak of in common with any of these people  perhaps my own associates then are the real public and not these others  perceiving that this would be the fifth real public he felt discouraged  but presently he began to think the past is the past and cannot be undone and with this play of mine i shall not please the public but there is always the future  now i do not wish to do what the artist cannot afford to do i earnestly desire to be true to the reason of my existence and since the reason of that existence is to give the public what it wants it is really vital to discover who and what the public is  and he began to look very closely at the faces around him hoping to find out from types what he had failed to ascertain from classes  two men were sitting near one on each side of a woman  the first who was all crumpled in his armchair had curly lips and wrinkles round the eyes cheeks at once rather fat and rather shadowy and a dimple in his chin  it seemed certain that he was humourous and kind sympathetic rather diffident speculative moderately intelligent with the rudiments perhaps of an imagination  and he looked at the second man who was sitting very upright as if he had a particularly fine backbone of which he was not a little proud  he was extremely big and handsome with pronounced and regular nose and chin firm wellcut lips beneath a smooth moustache direct and rather insolent eyes a some what receding forehead and an air of mastery over all around  it was obvious that he possessed a complete knowledge of his own mind some brutality much practical intelligence great resolution no imagination and plenty of conceit and he looked at the woman  she was pretty but her face was vapid and seemed to have no character at all  and from one to the other he looked and the more he looked the less resemblance he saw between them till the objects of his scrutiny grew restive  then ceasing to examine them an idea came to him  no  the public is not this or that class this or that type the public is an hypothetical average human being endowed with average human qualitiesa distillation in fact of all the people in this hall the people in the street outside the people of this country everywhere  and for a moment he was pleased but soon he began again to feel uneasy  since he reflected it is necessary for me to supply this hypothetical average human being with what he wants i shall have to find out how to distil him from all the ingredients around me now how am i to do that  it will certainly take me more than all my life to collect and boil the souls of all of them which is necessary if i am to extract the genuine article and i should then apparently have no time left to supply the precipitated spirit when i had obtained it with what it wanted  yet this hypothetical average human being must be found or i must stay for ever haunted by the thought that i am not supplying him with what he wants  and the writer became more and more discouraged for to arrogate to himself knowledge of all the heights and depths and even of all the virtues and vices tastes and dislikes of all the people of the country without having first obtained it seemed to him to savour of insolence  and still more did it appear impertinent having taken this mass of knowledge which he had not got to extract from it a golden mean man in order to supply him with what he wanted  and yet this was what every artist did who justified his existenceor it would not have been so stated in a newspaper  and he gaped up at the lofty ceiling as if he might perchance see the public flying up there in the faint bluish mist of smoke  and suddenly he thought suppose by some miracle my goldenmean bird came flying to me with its beak open for the food with which it is my duty to supply itwould it after all be such a very strangelooking creature would it not be extremely like my normal self  am i not in fact myself the public  for without the strongest and most reprehensible conceit can i claim for my normal self a single attribute or quality not possessed by an hypothetical average human being  yes i am myself the public or at all events all that my consciousness can ever know of it for certain and he began to consider deeply  for sitting there in cold blood with his nerves at rest and his brain and senses normal the play he had written did seem to him to put an unnecessary strain upon the faculties ah he thought in future i must take good care never to write anything except in cold blood with my nerves well clothed and my brain and senses quiet  i ought only to write when i feel as normal as i do now  and for some minutes he remained motionless looking at his boots then there crept into his mind an uncomfortable thought  but have i ever written anything without feeling a littleabnormal at the time have i ever even felt inclined to write anything until my emotions had been unduly excited my brain immoderately stirred my senses unusually quickened or my spirit extravagantly roused  never  alas never  i am then a miserable renegade false to the whole purpose of my beingnor do i see the slightest hope of becoming a better man a less unworthy artist  for i literally cannot write without the stimulus of some feeling exaggerated at the expense of other feelings  what has been in the past will be in the future i shall never be taking up my pen when i feel my comfortable and normal self never be satisfying that self which is the public  and he thought i am lost  for to satisfy that normal self to give the public what it wants is i am told and therefore must believe what all artists exist for  aeschylus in his choephorae and his prometheus sophocles in his oedipus tyrannus euripides when he wrote the trojan women medeaand hippolytus shakespeare in his leer goethe in his faust ibsen in his ghosts and his peer gynt tolstoy in the powers of darkness allall in those great works must have satisfied their most comfortable and normal selves allall must have given to the average human being to the public what it wants for to do that we know was the reason of their existence and who shall say those noble artists were not true to it  that is surely unthinkable and yetand yetwe are assured and indeed it is true that there is no real public in this country for just those plays  therefore aeschylus sophocles euripides shakespeare goethe ibsen tolstoy in their greatest works did not give the public what it wants did not satisfy the average human being their more comfortable and normal selves and as artists were not true to the reason of their existence therefore they were not artists which is unthinkable therefore i have not yet found the public  and perceiving that in this impasse his last hope of discovery had foundered the writer let his head fall on his chest  but even as he did so a gleam of light like a faint moonbeam stole out into the garden of his despair  is it possible he thought that by a writer until his play has been performed when alas it is too late the public is inconceivablein fact that for him there is no such thing  but if there be no such thing i cannot exist to give it what it wants  what then is the reason of my existence  am i but a windlestraw  and wearied out with his perplexity he fell into a doze and while he dozed he dreamed that he saw the figure of a woman standing in darkness from whose face and form came a misty refulgence such as steals out into the dusk from white campion flowers along summer hedgerows  she was holding her pale hands before her wide apart with the palms turned down quivering as might doves about to settle and for all it was so dark her grey eyes were visiblefull of light with black rims round the irises  to gaze at those eyes was almost painful for though they were beautiful they seemed to see right through his soul to pass him by as though on a far discovering voyage and forbidden to rest  the dreamer spoke to her who are you standing there in the darkness with those eyes that i can hardly bear to look at  who are you  and the woman answered friend i am your conscience i am the truth as best it may be seen by you  i am she whom you exist to serve with those words she vanished and the writer woke  a boy was standing before him with the evening papers  to cover his confusion at being caught asleep he purchased one and began to read a leading article  it commenced with these
