hartleap well is a small spring of water about five miles from richmond in yorkshire and near the side of the road which leads from richmond to askrigg its name is derived from a remarkable chase the memory of which is preserved by the monuments spoken of in the second part of the following poem which monuments do now exist as i have there described them     the knight had ridden down from wensley moor   with the slow motion of a summers cloud   he turnd aside towards a vassals door   and bring another horse he cried aloud    another horsethat shout the vassal heard   and saddled his best steed a comely grey   sir walter mounted him he was the third   which he had mounted on that glorious day    joy sparkeled in the prancing coursers eyes   the horse and horsemen are a happy pair   but though sir walter like a falcon flies   there is a doleful silence in the air    a rout this morning left sir walters hall   that as they gallopd made the echoes roar   but horse and man are vanishd one and all   such race i think was never seen before    sir walter restless as a veering wind   calls to the few tired dogs that yet remain   brach swift and music noblest of their kind   follow and weary up the mountain strain    the knight hallood he chid and cheerd them on   with suppliant gestures and upbraidings stern   but breath and eyesight fail and one by one   the dogs are stretchd among the mountain fern    where is the throng the tumult of the chace   the bugles that so joyfully were blown   this race it looks not like an earthly race   sir walter and the hart are left alone    the poor hart toils along the mountain side   i will not stop to tell how far he fled   nor will i mention by what death he died   but now the knight beholds him lying dead    dismounting then he leand against a thorn   he had no follower dog nor man nor boy   he neither smackd his whip nor blew his horn   but gazd upon the spoil with silent joy    close to the thorn on which sir walter leand   stood his dumb partner in this glorious act   weak as a lamb the hour that it is yeand   and foaming like a mountain cataract    upon his side the hart was lying stretchd   his nose halftouchd a spring beneath a hill   and with the last deep groan his breath had fetchd   the waters of the spring were trembling still    and now too happy for repose or rest   was never man in such a joyful case   sir walter walkd all round north south and west   and gazd and gazd upon that darling place    and turning up the hill it was at least   nine roods of sheer ascent sir walter found   three several marks which with his hoofs the beast   had left imprinted on the verdant ground    sir walter wiped his face and cried till now   such sight was never seen by living eyes   three leaps have borne him from this lofty brow   down to the very fountain where he lies    ill build a pleasurehouse upon this spot   and a small arbour made for rural joy   twill be the travellers shed the pilgrims cot   a place of love for damsels that are coy    a cunning artist will i have to frame   a bason for that fountain in the dell   and they who do make mention of the same   from this day forth shall call it hartleap well    and gallant brute to make thy praises known   another monument shall here be raisd   three several pillars each a rough hewn stone   and planted where thy hoofs the turf have grazd    and in the summertime when days are long   i will come hither with my paramour   and with the dancers and the minstrels song   we will make merry in that pleasant bower    till the foundations of the mountains fail   my mansion with its arbour shall endure   the joy of them who till the fields of swale   and them who dwell among the woods of ure    then home he went and left the hart stonedead   with breathless nostrils stretchd above the spring   and soon the knight performd what he had said   the fame whereof through many a land did ring    ere thrice the moon into her port had steerd   a cup of stone receivd the living well   three pillars of rude stone sir walter reard   and built a house of pleasure in the dell    and near the fountain flowers of stature tall   with trailing plants and trees were intertwind   which soon composed a little sylvan hall   a leafy shelter from the sun and wind    and thither when the summer days were long   sir walter journeyd with his paramour   and with the dancers and the minstrels song   made merriment within that pleasant bower    the knight sir walter died in course of time   and his bones lie in his paternal vale   but there is matter for a second rhyme   and i to this would add another tale    part second    the moving accident is not my trade   to curl the blood i have no ready arts   tis my delight alone in summer shade   to pipe a simple song to thinking hearts    as i from hawes to richmond did repair   it chancd that i saw standing in a dell   three aspins at three corners of a square   and one not four yards distant near a well    what this imported i could ill divine   and pulling now the rein my horse to stop   i saw three pillars standing in a line   the last stone pillar on a dark hilltop    the trees were grey with neither arms nor head   halfwasted the square mound of tawny green   so that you just might say as then i said   here in old time the hand of man has been    i lookd upon the hills both far and near   more doleful place did never eye survey   it seemd as if the springtime came not here   and nature here were willing to decay    i stood in various thoughts and fancies lost   when one who was in shepherds garb attird   came up the hollow him did i accost   and what this place might be i then inquird    the shepherd stoppd and that same story told   which in my former rhyme i have rehearsd   a jolly place said he in times of old   but something ails it now the spot is cursd    you see these lifeless stumps of aspin wood   some say that they are beeches others elms   these were the bower and here a mansion stood   the finest palace of a hundred realms    the arbour does its own condition tell   you see the stones the fountain and the stream   but as to the great lodge you might as well   hunt half a day for a forgotten dream    theres neither dog nor heifer horse nor sheep   will wet his lips within that cup of stone   and oftentimes when all are fast asleep   this water doth send forth a dolorous groan    some say that here a murder has been done   and blood cries out for blood but for my part   ive guessd when ive been sitting in the sun   that it was all for that unhappy hart    what thoughts must through the creatures brain have passd   to this place from the stone upon the steep   are but three bounds and look sir at this last   o master it has been a cruel leap    for thirteen hours he ran a desperate race   and in my simple mind we cannot tell   what cause the hart might have to love this place   and come and make his deathbed near the well    here on the grass perhaps asleep he sank   lulld by this fountain in the summertide   this water was perhaps the first he drank   when he had wanderd from his mothers side    in april here beneath the scented thorn   he heard the birds their morning carols sing   and he perhaps for aught we know was born   not half a furlong from that selfsame spring    but now heres neither grass nor pleasant shade   the sun on drearier hollow never shone   so will it be as i have often said   till trees and stones and fountain all are gone    greyheaded shepherd thou hast spoken well   small difference lies between thy creed and mine   this beast not unobservd by nature fell   his death was mournd by sympathy divine    the being that is in the clouds and air   that is in the green leaves among the groves   maintains a deep and reverential care   for them the quiet creatures whom he loves    the pleasurehouse is dustbehind before   this is no common waste no common gloom   but nature in due course of time once more   shall here put on her beauty and her bloom    she leaves these objects to a slow decay   that what we are and have been may be known   but at the coming of the milder day   these monuments shall all be overgrown    one lesson shepherd let us two divide   taught both by what she shews and what conceals   never to blend our pleasure or our pride   with sorrow of the meanest thing that feels      there was a boy ye knew him well ye cliffs   and islands of winander many a time   at evening when the stars had just begun   to move along the edges of the hills   rising or setting would he stand alone   beneath the trees or by the glimmering lake   and there with fingers interwoven both hands   pressd closely palm to palm and to his mouth   uplifted he as through an instrument   blew mimic hootings to the silent owls   that they might answer him and they would shout   across the watry vale and shout again   responsive to his call with quivering peals   and long halloos and screams and echoes loud   redoubled and redoubled a wild scene    of mirth and jocund din and when it chanced   that pauses of deep silence mockd his skill   then sometimes in that silence while he hung   listening a gentle shock of mild surprize   has carried far into his heart the voice   of mountain torrents or the visible scene   would enter unawares into his mind   with all its solemn imagery its rocks   its woods and that uncertain heaven receivd   into the bosom of the steady lake    fair are the woods and beauteous is the spot   the vale where he was born the churchyard hangs   upon a slope above the village school   and there along that bank when i have passd   at evening i believe that near his grave   a full halfhour together i have stood   mutefor he died when he was ten years old     the  brothers  a pastoral poem   the brothers 1  footnote 1 this poem was intended to be the concluding poem of a series of pastorals the scene of which was laid among the mountains of cumberland and westmoreland i mention this to apologise for the abruptness with which the poem begins      these tourists heaven preserve us needs must live   a profitable life some glance along   rapid and gay as if the earth were air   and they were butterflies to wheel about   long as their summer lasted some as wise   upon the forehead of a jutting crag   sit perchd with book and pencil on their knee   and look and scribble scribble on and look   until a man might travel twelve stout miles   or reap an acre of his neighbours corn   but for that moping son of idleness   why can he tarry yonderin our churchyard   is neither epitaph nor monument   tombstone nor name only the turf we tread   and a few natural graves to jane his wife   thus spake the homely priest of ennerdale   it was a july evening and he sate   upon the long stone seat beneath the eaves   of his old cottage as it chanced that day   employd in winters work upon the stone   his wife sate near him teasing matted wool   while from the twin cards toothd with glittering wire   he fed the spindle of his youngest child   who turnd her large round wheel in the open air   with back and forward steps towards the field   in which the parish chapel stood alone   girt round with a bare ring of mossy wall   while half an hour went by the priest had sent   many a long look of wonder and at last   risen from his seat beside the snowy ridge   of carded woolwhich the old man had piled   he laid his implements with gentle care   each in the other lockd and down the path   which from his cottage to the churchyard led   he took his way impatient to accost   the stranger whom he saw still lingering there    twas one well known to him in former days   a shepherdlad who ere his thirteenth year   had changd his calling with the mariners   a fellowmariner and so had fared   through twenty seasons but he had been reard   among the mountains and he in his heart   was half a shepherd on the stormy seas   oft in the piping shrouds had leonard heard   the tones of waterfalls and inland sounds   of caves and trees and when the regular wind   between the tropics filld the steady sail   and blew with the same breath through days and weeks   lengthening invisibly its weary line   along the cloudless main he in those hours   of tiresome indolence would often hang   over the vessels aide and gaze and gaze   and while the broad green wave and sparkling foam   flashd round him images and hues that wrought   in union with the employment of his heart   he thus by feverish passion overcome   even with the organs of his bodily eye   below him in the bosom of the deep   saw mountains saw the forms of sheep that grazd   on verdant hills with dwellings among trees   and shepherds clad in the same country grey   which he himself had worn 2  footnote 2 this description of the calenture is sketched from an imperfect recollection of an admirable one in prose by mr gilbert author of the hurricane                              and now at length   from perils manifold with some small wealth   acquird by traffic in the indian isles   to his paternal home he is returnd   with a determind purpose to resume   the life which he livd there both for the sake   of many darling pleasures and the love   which to an only brother he has borne   in all his hardships since that happy time   when whether it blew foul or fair they two   were brother shepherds on their native hills   they were the last of all their race and now   when leonard had approachd his home his heart   faild in him and not venturing to inquire   tidings of one whom he so dearly lovd   towards the churchyard he had turnd aside   that as he knew in what particular spot   his family were laid he thence might learn   if still his brother livd or to the file   another grave was addedhe had found   another grave near which a full half hour   he had remaind but as he gazd there grew   such a confusion in his memory   that he began to doubt and he had hopes   that he had seen this heap of turf before   that it was not another grave but one   he had forgotten he had lost his path   as up the vale he came that afternoon   through fields which once had been well known to him   and oh what joy the recollection now   sent to his heart he lifted up his eyes   and looking round he thought that he perceivd   strange alteration wrought on every side   among the woods and fields and that the rocks   and the eternal hills themselves were changd    by this the priest who down the field had come   unseen by leonard at the churchyard gate   stoppd short and thence at leisure limb by limb   he scannd him with a gay complacency   aye thought the vicar smiling to himself   tis one of those who needs must leave the path   of the worlds business to go wild alone   his arms have a perpetual holiday   the happy man will creep about the fields   following his fancies by the hour to bring   tears down his check or solitary smiles   into his face until the setting sun   write fool upon his forehead planted thus   beneath a shed that overarchd the gate   of this rude churchyard till the stars appeard   the good man might have commund with himself   but that the stranger who had left the grave   approachd he recognizd the priest at once   and after greetings interchangd and given   by leonard to the vicar as to one   unknown to him this dialogue ensued    leonard    you live sir in these dales a quiet life   your years make up one peaceful family   and who would grieve and fret if welcome come   and welcome gone they are so like each other   they cannot be rememberd scarce a funeral   comes to this churchyard once in eighteen months   and yet some changes must take place among you   and you who dwell here even among these rocks   can trace the finger of mortality   and see that with our threescore years and ten   we are not all that perishi remember   for many years ago i passd this road   there was a footway all along the fields   by the brooksidetis goneand that dark cleft   to me it does not seem to wear the face   which then it had    priest                      why sir for aught i know   that chasm is much the same    leonard                                  but surely yonder   priest    aye there indeed your memory is a friend   that does not play you falseon that tall pike   it is the loneliest place of all these hills   there were two springs which bubbled side by side   as if they had been made that they might be   companions for each other ten years back   close to those brother fountains the huge crag   was rent with lightningone is dead and gone   the other left behind is flowing still   for accidents and changes such as these   why we have store of them a waterspout   will bring down half a mountain what a feast   for folks that wander up and down like you   to see an acres breadth of that wide cliff   one roaring cataracta sharp may storm   will come with loads of january snow   and in one night send twenty score of sheep   to feed the ravens or a shepherd dies   by some untoward death among the rocks   the ice breaks up and sweeps away a bridge   a wood is felldand then for our own homes   a child is born or christend a field ploughd   a daughter sent to service a web spun   the old house cloth is deckd with a new face   and hence so far from wanting facts or dates   to chronicle the time we all have here   a pair of diaries one serving sir   for the whole dale and one for each fireside   yours was a strangers judgment for historians   commend me to these vallies    leonard                                 yet your churchyard   seems if such freedom may be used with you   to say that you are heedless of the past   heres neither head nor footstone plate of brass   crossbones or skull type of our earthly state   or emblem of our hopes the dead mans home   is but a fellow to that pasture field    priest    why there sir is a thought thats new to me   the stonecutters tis true might beg their bread   if every english churchyard were like ours   yet your conclusion wanders from the truth    we have no need of names and epitaphs   we talk about the dead by our firesides   and then for our immortal part we want   no symbols sir to tell us that plain tale   the thought of death sits easy on the man   who has been born and dies among the mountains    leonard    your dalesmen then do in each others thoughts   possess a kind of second life no doubt   you sir could help me to the history   of half these graves    priest    with what ive witnessd and with what ive heard   perhaps i might and on a winters evening   if you were seated at my chimneys nook   by turning oer these hillocks one by one   we two could travel sir through a strange round   yet all in the broad highway of the world   now theres a graveyour foot is half upon it   it looks just like the rest and yet that man   died brokenhearted    leonard                         tis a common case   well take another who is he that lies   beneath yon ridge the last of those three graves   it touches on that piece of native rock   left in the churchyard wall    priest                                 thats walter ewbank   he had as white a head and fresh a cheek   as ever were producd by youth and age   engendering in the blood of hale fourscore   for five long generations had the heart   of walters forefathers oerflowd the bounds   of their inheritance that single cottage   you see it yonder and those few green fields   they toild and wrought and still from sire to son   each struggled and each yielded as before   a littleyet a littleand old walter   they left to him the family heart and land   with other burthens than the crop it bore   year after year the old man still preservd   a chearful mind and buffeted with bond   interest and mortgages at last he sank   and went into his grave before his time   poor walter whether it was care that spurrd him   god only knows but to the very last   he had the lightest foot in ennerdale   his pace was never that of an old man   i almost see him tripping down the path   with his two grandsons after himbut you   unless our landlord be your host tonight   have far to travel and in these rough paths   even in the longest day of midsummer    leonard    but these two orphans    priest                            orphans such they were   yet not while walter livdfor though their parents   lay buried side by side as now they lie   the old man was a father to the boys   two fathers in one father and if tears   shed when he talkd of them where they were not   and hauntings from the infirmity of love   are aught of what makes up a mothers heart   this old man in the day of his old age   was half a mother to themif you weep sir   to hear a stranger talking about strangers   heaven bless you when you are among your kindred   aye you may turn that wayit is a grave   which will bear looking at    leonard                               these boys i hope   they lovd this good old man    priest                                   they didand truly   but that was what we almost overlookd   they were such darlings of each other for   though from their cradles they had livd with walter   the only kinsman near them in the house   yet he being old they had much love to spare   and it all went into each others hearts   leonard the elder by just eighteen months   was two years taller twas a joy to see   to hear to meet them from their house the school   was distant three short miles and in the time   of storm and thaw when every watercourse   and unbridgd stream such as you may have noticd   crossing our roads at every hundred steps   was swoln into a noisy rivulet   would leonard then when elder boys perhaps   remaind at home go staggering through the fords   bearing his brother on his backive seen him   on windy days in one of those stray brooks   aye more than once ive seen him midleg deep   their two books lying both on a dry stone   upon the hither sideand once i said   as i remember looking round these rocks   and hills on which we all of us were born   that god who made the great book of the world   would bless such piety    leonard                            it may be then    priest    never did worthier lads break english bread   the finest sunday that the autumn saw   with all its mealy clusters of ripe nuts   could never keep these boys away from church   or tempt them to an hour of sabbath breach   leonard and james i warrant every corner   among these rocks and every hollow place   where foot could come to one or both of them   was known as well as to the flowers that grew there   like roebucks they went bounding oer the hills   they playd like two young ravens on the crags   then they could write aye and speak too as well   as many of their bettersand for leonard   the very night before he went away   in my own house i put into his hand   a bible and id wager twenty pounds   that if he is alive he has it yet    leonard    it seems these brothers have not livd to be   a comfort to each other    priest                               that they might   live to that end is what both old and young   in this our valley all of us have wishd   and what for my part i have often prayd   but leonard    leonard                  then james still is left among you    priest    tis of the elder brother i am speaking   they had an uncle he was at that time   a thriving man and traffickd on the seas   and but for this same uncle to this hour   leonard had never handled rope or shroud   for the boy lovd the life which we lead here   and though a very stripling twelve years old   his soul was knit to this his native soil   but as i said old walter was too weak   to strive with such a torrent when he died   the estate and house were sold and all their sheep   a pretty flock and which for aught i know   had clothed the ewbauks for a thousand years   wellall was gone and they were destitute   and leonard chiefly for his brothers sake   resolvd to try his fortune on the seas   tis now twelve years since we had tidings from him   if there was one among us who had heard   that leonard ewbank was come home again   from the great gavel 3 down by leezas banks   and down the enna far as egremont   the day would be a very festival   and those two bells of ours which there you see   hanging in the open airbut o good sir   this is sad talktheyll never sound for him   living or deadwhen last we heard of him   he was in slavery among the moors   upon the barbary coasttwas not a little   that would bring down his spirit and no doubt   before it ended in his death the lad   was sadly crossdpoor leonard when we parted   he took me by the hand and said to me   if ever the day came when he was rich   he would return and on his fathers land   he would grow old among us  footnote 3 the great gavel so called i imagine from its resemblance to the gable end of a house is one of the highest of the cumberland mountains it stands at the head of the several vales of ennerdale wastdale and borrowdale  the leeza is a river which follows into the lake of ennerdale on issuing from the lake it changes its name and is called the end eyne or enna it falls into the sea a little below egremont    leonard                               if that day   should come twould needs be a glad day for him   he would himself no doubt be as happy then   as any that should meet him    priest                                 happy sir    leonard    you said his kindred all were in their graves   and that he had one brother    priest                                 that is but   a fellow tale of sorrow  from his youth   james though not sickly yet was delicate   and leonard being always by his side   had done so many offices about him   that though he was not of a timid nature   yet still the spirit of a mountain boy   in him was somewhat checkd and when his brother   was gone to sea and he was left alone   the little colour that he had was soon   stolen from his cheek he droopd and pind and pind    leonard    but these are all the graves of full grown men    priest    aye sir that passd away we took him to us   he was the child of all the dalehe livd   three months with one and six months with another   and wanted neither food nor clothes nor love   and many many happy days were his   but whether blithe or sad tis my belief   his absent brother still was at his heart   and when he livd beneath our roof we found   a practice till this time unknown to him   that often rising from his bed at night   he in his sleep would walk about and sleeping   he sought his brother leonardyou are movd   forgive me sir before i spoke to you   i judgd you most unkindly    leonard                              but this youth   how did he die at last    priest                            one sweet may morning   it will be twelve years since when spring returns   he had gone forth among the newdroppd lambs   with two or three companions whom it chancd   some further business summond to a house   which stands at the dalehead james tird perhaps   or from some other cause remaind behind   you see yon precipiceit almost looks   like some vast building made of many crags   and in the midst is one particular rock   that rises like a column from the vale   whence by our shepherds it is calld the pillar   james pointing to its summit over which   they all had purposd to return together   informd them that he there would wait for them   they parted and his comrades passd that way   some two hours after but they did not find him   at the appointed place a circumstance   of which they took no heed but one of them   going by chance at night into the house   which at this time was jamess home there learnd   that nobody had seen him all that day   the morning came and still he was unheard of   the neighbours were alarmd and to the brook   some went and some towards the lake ere noon   they found him at the foot of that same rock   dead and with mangled limbs the third day after   i buried him poor lad and there he lies    leonard    and that then is his gravebefore his death   you said that he saw many happy years    priest    aye that he did    leonard                      and all went well with him    priest    if he had one the lad had twenty homes    leonard    and you believe then that his mind was easy    priest    yes long before he died he found that time   is a true friend to sorrow and unless   his thoughts were turnd on leonards luckless fortune   he talkd about him with a chearful love    leonard    he could not come to an unhallowd end    priest    nay god forbid you recollect i mentiond   a habit which disquietude and grief   had brought upon him and we all conjecturd   that as the day was warm he had lain down   upon the grass and waiting for his comrades   he there had fallen asleep that in his sleep   he to the margin of the precipice   had walkd and from the summit had fallen headlong   and so no doubt he perishd at the time   we guess that in his hands he must have had   his shepherds staff for midway in the cliff   it had been caught and there for many years   it hungand moulderd there                                  the priest here ended   the stranger would have thankd him but he felt   tears rushing in both left the spot in silence   and leonard when they reachd the churchyard gate   as the priest lifted up the latch turnd round   and looking at the grave he said my brother   the vicar did not hear the words and now   pointing towards the cottage he entreated   that leonard would partake his homely fare   the other thankd him with a fervent voice   but added that the evening being calm   he would pursue his journey so they parted    it was not long ere leonard reachd a grove   that overhung the road he there stoppd short   and sitting down beneath the trees reviewd   all that the priest had said his early years   were with him in his heart his cherishd hopes   and thoughts which had been his an hour before   all pressd on him with such a weight that now   this vale where he had been so happy seemd   a place in which he could not bear to live   so he relinquishd all his purposes   he travelld on to egremont and thence   that night addressd a letter to the priest   reminding him of what had passd between them   and adding with a hope to be forgiven   that it was from the weakness of his heart   he had not dared to tell him who he was    this done he went on shipboard and is now   a seaman a grey headed mariner     ellen irwin   or the braes of kirtle 4  footnote 4 the kirtle is a river in the southern part of scotland on whose banks the events here related took place       fair ellen irwin when she sate   upon the braes of kirtle   was lovely as a grecian maid   adornd with wreaths of myrtle   young adam bruce beside her lay   and there did they beguile the day   with love and gentle speeches   beneath the budding beeches    from many knights and many squires   the brace had been selected   and gordon fairest of them all   by ellen was rejected   sad tidings to that noble youth   for it may be proclaimd with truth   if bruce hath lovd sincerely   the gordon loves as dearly    but what is gordons beauteous face   and what are gordons crosses   to them who sit by kirtles braes   upon the verdant mosses   alas that ever he was born   the gordon couchd behind a thorn   sees them and their caressing   beholds them blessd and blessing    proud gordon cannot bear the thoughts   that through his brain are travelling   and starting up to bruces heart   he launchd a deadly javlin   fair ellen saw it when it came   and stepping forth to meet the same   did with her body cover   the youth her chosen lover    and falling into bruces arms   thus died the beauteous ellen   thus from the heart of her truelove   the mortal spear repelling   and bruce as soon as he had slain   the gordon saild away to spain   and fought with rage incessant   against the moorish crescent    but many days and many months   and many years ensuing   this wretched knight did vainly seek   the death that he was wooing   so coming back across the wave   without a groan on ellens grave   his body he extended   and there his sorrow ended    now ye who willingly have heard   the tale i have been telling   may in kirkonnel churchyard view   the grave of lovely ellen   by ellens side the bruce is laid   and for the stone upon his head   may no rude hand deface it   and its forlorn hic jacet         strange fits of passion i have known   and i will dare to tell   but in the lovers ear alone   what once to me befel    when she i lovd was strong and gay   and like a rose in june   i to her cottage bent my way   beneath the evening moon    upon the moon i fixd my eye   all over the wide lea   my horse trudgd on and we drew nigh   those paths so dear to me    and now we reachd the orchard plot   and as we climbd the hill   towards the roof of lucys cot   the moon descended still    in one of those sweet dreams i slept   kind natures gentlest boon   and all the while my eyes i kept   on the descending moon    my horse movd on hoof after hoof   he raisd and never stoppd   when down behind the cottage roof   at once the planet droppd    what fond and wayward thoughts will slide   into a lovers head   o mercy to myself i cried   if lucy should be dead      song      she dwelt among th untrodden ways     beside the springs of dove   a maid whom there were none to praise     and very few to love    a violet by a mossy stone     halfhidden from the eye   fair as a star when only one     is shining in the sky    she livd unknown and few could know     when lucy ceasd to be   but she is in her grave and oh     the difference to me        a slumber did my spirit seal     i had no human fears   she seemd a thing that could not feel     the touch of earthly years    no motion has she now no force     she neither hears nor sees   rolld round in earths diurnal course     with rocks and stones and trees      the waterfall and the eglantine     begone thou fond presumptuous elf   exclaimd a thundering voice   nor dare to thrust thy foolish self   between me and my choice   a falling water swoln with snows   thus spake to a poor briarrose   that all bespatterd with his foam   and dancing high and dancing low   was living as a child might know   in an unhappy home    dost thou presume my course to block   off off or puny thing   ill hurl thee headlong with the rock   to which thy fibres cling   the flood was tyrannous and strong   the patient briar sufferd long   nor did he utter groan or sigh   hoping the danger would be passd   but seeing no relief at last   he ventured to reply    ah said the briar blame me not   why should we dwell in strife   we who in this our natal spot   once livd a happy life   you stirrd me on my rocky bed   what pleasure thro my veins you spread   the summer long from day to day   my leaves you freshend and bedewd   nor was it common gratitude   that did your cares repay    when spring came on with bud and bell   among these rocks did i   before you hang my wreath to tell   that gentle days were nigh   and in the sultry summer hours   i shelterd you with leaves and flowers   and in my leaves now shed and gone   the linnet lodgd and for us two   chaunted his pretty songs when you   had little voice or none    but now proud thoughts are in your breast   what grief is mine you see   ah would you think evn yet how blest   together we might be   though of both leaf and flower bereft   some ornaments to me are left   rich store of scarlet hips is mine   with which i in my humble way   would deck you many a winters day   a happy eglantine    what more he said i cannot tell   the stream came thundering down the dell   and gallopd loud and fast   i listend

careful student he had been   among the woods and hills   one winters night when through the trees   the wind was thundering on his knees   his youngest born did andrew hold   and while the rest a ruddy quire   were seated round their blazing fire   this tale the shepherd told    i saw a crag a lofty stone   as ever tempest beat   out of its head an oak had grown   a broom out of its feet   the

your slender shape   and yet just three years backno more   you had a strange escape   down from yon cliff a fragment broke   it came you know with fire and smoke   and hither did it bend its way   this pondrous block was caught by me   and oer your head as you may see   tis hanging to this day    the thing had better been asleep   whatever thing it were   or breeze or bird or fleece of sheep   that first did plant you there   for you and your green twigs decoy   the little witless shepherdboy   to come and slumber in your bower   and trust me on some sultry noon   both you and he heaven knows how soon   will perish in one hour    from me this friendly warning take   the broom began to doze   and thus to keep herself awake   did gently interpose   my thanks for your discourse are due   that it is true and more than true   i know and i have known it long   frail is the bond by which we hold   our being be we young or old   wise foolish weak or strong    disasters do the best we can

mother ewe   lies with her infant lamb i see   the love they to each other make   and the sweet joy which they partake   it is a joy to me    her voice was blithe her heart was light   the broom might have pursued   her speech until the stars of night   their journey had renewd   but in the branches of the oak   two ravens now began to croak   their nuptial song a gladsome air   and to her own green bower the breeze   that instant brought two stripling bees   to feed and murmur there    one night the wind came from the north   and blew a furious blast   at break of day i venturd forth   and near the cliff i passd   the storm had falln upon the oak   and struck him with a mighty stroke   and whirld and whirld him far away   and in one hospitable cleft   the little careless broom was left   to live for many a day      lucy gray     oft i had heard of lucy gray   and when i crossd the wild   i chancd to see at break of day   the solitary child    no mate no comrade lucy knew   she dwelt on a wild moor   the sweetest thing that ever grew   beside a human door    you yet may spy the fawn at play   the hare upon the green   but the sweet face of lucy gray   will never more be seen    tonight will be a stormy night   you to the town must go   and take a lantern child to light   your mother thro the snow    that father will i gladly do   tis scarcely afternoon   the minsterclock has just struck two   and yonder is the moon    at this the father raisd his hook   and snappd a faggotband   he plied his work and lucy took   the lantern in her hand    not blither is the mountain roe   with many a wanton stroke   her feet disperse the powdry snow   that rises up like smoke    the storm came on before its time   she wanderd up and down   and many a hill did lucy climb   but never reachd the town    the wretched parents all that night   went shouting far and wide   but there was neither sound nor sight   to serve them for a guide    at daybreak on a hill they stood   that overlookd the moor   and thence they saw the bridge of wood   a furlong from their door    and now they homeward turnd and cryd   in heaven we all shall meet   when in the snow the mother spied   the print of lucys feet    then downward from the steep hills edge   they trackd the footmarks small   and through the broken hawthornhedge   and by the long stonewall    and then an open field they crossd   the marks were still the same   they trackd them on nor ever lost   and to the bridge they came    they followd from the snowy bank   the footmarks one by one   into the middle of the plank   and further there were none    yet some maintain that to this day   she is a living child   that you may see sweet lucy gray   upon the lonesome wild    oer rough and smooth she trips along   and

is a short and for the most part a steep narrow valley with a stream running through it force is the word universally employed in these dialects for waterfall       i    the valley rings with mirth and joy   among the hills the echoes play   a never never ending song   to welcome in the may   the magpie chatters with delight    the mountain ravens youngling brood   have left the mother and the nest   and they go rambling east and west   in search of their own food   or thro the glittering vapors dart   in very wantonness of heart     ii    beneath a rock upon the grass   two boys are

  a lamb that in the pool is pent   within that black and frightful rent     vii    the lamb had slippd into the stream   and safe without a bruise or wound   the cataract had borne him down   into the gulph profound   his dam had seen him when he fell   she saw him down the torrent borne   and while with all a mothers love   she from the lofty rocks above   sent forth a cry forlorn   the lamb still swimming round and round   made answer to that plaintive sound     viii    when he had learnt what thing it was   that sent this rueful cry i ween   the boy recoverd heart and told   the sight

the helpless lamb he found   by those huge rocks encompassd round     ix    he drew it gently from the pool   and brought it forth into the light   the shepherds met him with his charge   an unexpected sight   into their arms the lamb they took   said they hes neither maimd nor scarrd   then up the steep ascent they hied   and placed him at his mothers side   and gently did the bard   those idle shepherdboys upbraid   and bade them better mind their trade    tis said that some have died for love   and here and there a churchyard grave is found   in the cold norths unhallowd ground   because the wretched man himself had slain   his love was such a grievous pain   and there is one whom i five years have known   he dwells alone   upon helvellyns side   he lovedthe pretty barbara

was passing by   a penny on the ground had thrown   but the poor cripple was alone   and could not stoopno help was nigh    inchthick the dust lay on the ground   for it had long been droughty weather   so with his staff the cripple wrought   among the dust till he had brought   the halfpennies together    it chancd that andrew passd that way   just at the time and there he found   the cripple in the midday heat   standing alone and at his feet   he saw the penny on the ground    he stoppd and took the penny up   and when the cripple nearer drew   quoth andrew under halfacrown   what a man

that murmur as they run   had been his dearest joy    he was a lovely youth i guess   the panther in the wilderness   was not so fair as he   and when he chose to sport and play   no dolphin ever was so gay   upon the tropic sea    among the indians he had fought   and with him many tales he brought   of pleasure and of fear   such tales as told to any maid   by such a youth in the green shade   were perilous to hear    he told of girls a happy rout   who quit their fold with dance and shout   their pleasant indian town   to gather strawberries all day long   returning with a choral song   when daylight is gone down    he spake of plants divine and strange   that evry day their blossoms change   ten thousand lovely hues   with budding fading faded flowers   they stand the wonder of the bowers   from morn to evening dews    he told of the magnolia 6 spread   high as a cloud high over head   the cypress and her spire   of flowers that with one scarlet gleam 7   cover a hundred leagues and seem   to set the hills on fire   footnote 6 magnolia grandiflora  footnote 7 the splendid appearance of these scarlet flowers which are scattered with such profusion over the hills in the southern parts of north america is frequently mentioned by bartram in his travels    the youth of green savannahs spake   and many an endless endless lake   with all its fairy crowds   of islands that together lie   as quietly as spots of sky   among the evening clouds    and then he said how sweet it were   a fisher or a hunter there   a gardener in the shade   still wandering with an easy mind   to build a household fire and find   a home in every glade    what days and what sweet years ah me   our life were life indeed with thee   so passd in quiet bliss   and all the while said he to know   that we were in a world of woe   on such an earth as this    and then he sometimes interwove   dear thoughts about a fathers love   for there said he are spun   around the heart such tender ties   that our own children to our eyes   are dearer than the sun    sweet ruth and could you go with me   my helpmate in the woods to be   our shed at night to rear   or run my own adopted bride   a sylvan huntress at my side   and drive the flying deer    beloved ruth no more he said   sweet ruth alone at midnight shed   a solitary tear   she thought againand did agree   with him to sail across the sea   and drive the flying deer    and now as fitting is and right   we in the church our faith will plight   a husband and a wife   even so they did and i may say   that to sweet ruth that happy day   was more than human life    through dream and vision did she sink   delighted all the while to think   that on those lonesome floods   and green savannahs she should share   his board with lawful joy and bear   his name in the wild woods    but as you have before been told   this stripling sportive gay and bold   and with his dancing crest   so beautiful through savage lands   had roamd about with vagrant bands   of indians in the west    the wind the tempest roaring high   the tumult of a tropic sky   might well be dangerous food   for him a youth to whom was given   so much of earth so much of heaven   and such impetuous blood    whatever in those climes he found   irregular in sight or sound   did to his mind impart   a kindred impulse seemd allied   to his own powers and justified   the workings of his heart    nor less to feed voluptuous thought   the beauteous forms of nature wrought   fair trees and lovely flowers   the breezes their own languor lent   the stars had feelings which they sent   into those magic bowers    yet in his worst pursuits i ween   that sometimes there did intervene   pure hopes of high intent   for passions linkd to forms so fair   and stately needs must have their share   of noble sentiment    but ill he livd much evil saw   with men to whom no better law   nor better life was known   deliberately and undeceivd   those wild mens vices he receivd   and gave them back his own    his genius and his moral frame   were thus impaird and he became   the slave of low desires   a man who without selfcontroul   would seek what the degraded soul   unworthily admires    and yet he with no feignd delight   had wood the maiden day and night   had luvd her night and morn   what could he less than love a maid   whose heart with so much nature playd   so kind and so forlorn    but now the pleasant dream was gone   no hope no wish remaind not one   they stirrd him now no more   new objects did new pleasure give   and once again he wishd to live   as lawless as before    meanwhile as thus with him it fared   they for the voyage were prepared   and went to the seashore   but when they thither came the youth   deserted his poor bride and ruth   could never find him more    god help thee ruthsuch pains she had   that she in half a year was mad   and in a prison housd   and there exulting in her wrongs   among the music of her songs   she fearfully carouzd    yet sometimes milder hours she knew   nor wanted sun nor rain nor dew   nor pastimes of the may   they all were with her in her cell   and a wild brook with chearful knell   did oer the pebbles play    when ruth three seasons thus had lain   there came a respite to her pain   she from her prison fled   but of the vagrant none took thought   and where it liked her best she sought   her shelter and her bread    among the fields she breathd again   the mastercurrent of her brain   ran permanent and free   and to the pleasant banks of tone 8   she took her way to dwell

heavd were sighs   of one tird out with fun and madness   the tears which came to matthews eyes   were tears of light the oil of gladness    yet sometimes when the secret cup   of still and serious thought went round   it seemd as if he drank it up   he felt with spirit so profound    thou soul of gods best earthly mould   thou happy soul and can it be   that these two words of glittering gold   are all that must remain of thee      the two april mornings    we walkd along while bright and red   uprose the morning sun   and matthew stoppd he lookd and said   the will of god be done    a

blooming girl whose hair was wet   with points of morning dew       the fountain   a conversation    we talkd with open heart and tongue   affectionate and true   a pair of friends though i was young   and matthew seventytwo    we lay beneath a spreading oak   beside a mossy seat   and from the turf a fountain broke   and gurgled at our feet    now matthew let us try to match   this waters pleasant

dim with childish tears   my heart is idly stirrd   for the same sound is in my ears   which in those days i heard    thus fares it still in our decay   and yet the wiser mind   mourns less for what

boarded during the time i was at school    motley accoutrements of power to smile   at thorns and brakes and brambles and in truth   more ragged than need was among the woods   and oer the pathless rocks i forcd my way   until at length i came to one dear nook   unvisited where not a broken bough   droopd with its witherd leaves ungracious sign   of devastation but the hazels rose   tall and erect with milkwhite clusters hung   a virgin scenea little while i stood   breathing with such suppression of the heart   as joy delights in and with wise restraint   voluptuous fearless of a rival eyed   the banquet or beneath the trees i sate   among the flowers and with the flowers i playd   a temper known to those who after long   and weary expectation have been blessd   with sudden happiness beyond all hope   perhaps it was a bower beneath whose leaves   the violets of five seasons reappear   and fade unseen by any human eye   where fairy waterbreaks do murmur on   for ever and i saw the sparkling foam   and with my cheek on one of those green stones   that fleecd with moss beneath the shady trees   lay round me scatterd like a flock of sheep   i heard the murmur and the murmuring sound   in that sweet mood when pleasure loves to pay   tribute to ease and of its joy secure   the heart luxuriates with indifferent things   wasting its kindliness on stocks and stones   and on the vacant air then up i rose   and draggd to earth both branch and bough with crash   and merciless ravage and the shady nook   of hazels and the green and mossy bower   deformd and sullied patiently gave up   their quiet being and unless i now   confound my present feelings with the past   even then when from the bower i turnd away   exulting rich beyond the wealth of kings   i felt a

 the floating clouds their state shall lend   to her for her the willow bend   nor shall she fail to see   even in the motions of the storm   a beauty that shall mould her form   by silent sympathy    the stars of midnight shall be dear   to her and she shall lean her ear   in many a secret place   where rivulets dance their wayward round   and beauty born of murmuring sound   shall pass into her face    and vital feelings of delight   shall rear her form to stately height   her virgin bosom swell   such thoughts to lucy i will give   while she and i together live   here in this happy dell

petlamb a pastoral    the dew was falling fast the stars began to blink   i heard a voice it said drink pretty creature drink   and looking oer the hedge before me i espied   a snowwhite mountain lamb with a maiden at its side    no other sheep were near the lamb was all alone   and by a slender cord was tetherd to a stone   with one knee on the grass did the little maiden kneel   while to that mountain lamb she gave its evening meal    the lamb while from her hand he thus his supper took   seemd to feast with head and ears and his tail with pleasure shook   drink pretty creature drink she said in such a tone   that i almost receivd her heart into my own    twas little barbara lewthwaite a child of beauty rare   i watchd them with delight they were a lovely pair   and now with empty can the maiden turnd away   but ere ten yards were gone her footsteps did she stay    towards the lamb she lookd and from that shady place   i unobservd could see the workings of her face   if nature to her tongue could measurd numbers bring   thus thought i to her lamb that little maid would sing    what ails thee young one what why pull so at thy cord   is it not well with thee well both for bed

cumberland beggar   a description    the class of beggars to which the old man here described belongs will probably soon be extinct it consisted of poor and mostly old and infirm persons who confined themselves to a stated round in their neighbourhood and had certain fixed days on which at different houses they regularly received charity sometimes in money but mostly in provisions      i saw an aged beggar in my walk   and he was seated by the highway side   on a low structure of rude masonry   built at the foot of a huge hill that they   who lead their horses down the steep rough road   may thence remount at ease the aged man   had placed his staff across the broad smooth stone   that overlays the pile and from a bag   all white with flour the dole of village dames   he drew his scraps and fragments one by one   and scannd them with a fixd and serious look   of idle computation in the sun   upon the second step of that small pile   surrounded by those wild unpeopled hills   he sate and eat his food in solitude   and ever scatterd from his palsied hand   that still attempting to prevent the waste   was baffled still the crumbs in little showers   fell on the ground and the small mountain birds   not venturing yet to peck their destind meal   approached within the length of half his staff    him from my childhood have i known and then   he was so old he seems not older now   he travels on a solitary man   so helpless in appearance that for him   the sauntering horsemantraveller does not throw   with careless hand his alms upon the ground   but stops that he may safely lodge the coin   within the old mans hat nor quits him so   but still when he has given his horse the rein   towards the aged beggar turns a look   sidelong and halfreverted she who tends   the

wheels oertake   the aged beggar in the woody lane   shouts to him from behind and if perchance   the old man does not change his course the boy   turns with less noisy wheels to the roadside   and passes gently by without a curse   upon his lips or anger at his heart    he travels on a solitary man   his age has no companion on the ground   his eyes are turnd and as he moves along   they move along the ground and evermore   instead of common and habitual sight   of fields with rural works of hill and dale   and the blue sky one little span of earth   is all his prospect thus from day to day   bowbent his eyes for ever on the ground   he plies his weary journey seeing still   and never knowing that he sees some straw   some scatterd leaf or marks which in one track   the nails of cart or chariot wheel have left   impressd on the white road in the same line   at distance still the same poor traveller   his staff trails with him scarcely do his feet   disturb the summer dust he is so still   in look and motion that the cottage curs   ere he have passd the door will turn away   weary of barking at him boys and girls   the vacant and the busy maids and youths   and urchins newly breechd all pass him by   him even the slowpaced waggon leaves behind    but deem not this man uselessstatesmen ye   who are so restless in your wisdom ye   who have a broom still ready in your hands

of the hills   and sacred to the sky    and in this smooth and open dell   there is a tempeststricken tree   a corner stone by lightning cut   the last stone of a cottage hut   and in this dell you see   a thing no storm can eer destroy   the shadow of a danish boy    in clouds above the lark is heard   he sings his blithest and his beet     but in this lonesome nook the bird   did never build his nest    no beast no bird hath here his home   the bees borne on the breezy air   pass high above those fragrant bells   to other flowers to other dells   nor ever linger there   the danish boy walks here alone   the lovely dell is all his own    a spirit of noon day is he   he seems a form of flesh and blood   a piping shepherd he might be   a herdboy of the wood    a regal vest of fur he wears   in colour like a ravens wing   it fears nor rain nor wind nor dew   but in the storm tis fresh and blue   as budding pines in spring   his helmet has a vernal grace   fresh as the bloom upon his face    a harp is from his shoulder slung   he rests the harp upon his knee   and there in a forgotten tongue   he warbles melody    of flocks and herds both far and near   he is the darling and the joy   and often when no cause appears   the mountain ponies prick their ears   they hear the danish boy   while in the dell he sits alone   beside the tree and cornerstone    when near this blasted tree you pass   two sods are plainly to be seen   close at its root and each with grass   is coverd fresh and green    like turf upon a newmade grave   these two green sods together lie   nor heat nor cold nor rain nor wind   can these two sods together bind   nor sun nor earth nor sky   but side by side the two are laid   as if just severd by the spade    there sits he in his face you spy

the country and attached to rural objects many places will be found unnamed or of unknown names where little incidents will have occurred or feelings been experienced which will have given to such places a private and peculiar interest from a wish to give some sort of record to such incidents or renew the gratification of such feelings names have been given to places by the author and some of his friends and the following poems written in consequence      poems on the naming of places      1    it was an april morning fresh and clear   the rivulet delighting in its strength   ran with a young mans speed and yet the voice   of waters which the winter had supplied   was softend down into a vernal tone    the spirit of enjoyment and desire   and hopes and wishes from all living things   went circling like a multitude of sounds   the budding groves appeard as if in haste   to spur the steps of june as if their shades   of various green were hindrances that stood   between them and their object yet meanwhile   there was such deep contentment in the air   that every naked ash and tardy tree   yet leafless seemd as though the countenance   with which it lookd on this delightful day   were native to the summerup the brook   i roamd in the confusion of my heart   alive to all things and forgetting all    at length i to a sudden turning came   in this continuous glen where down a rock   the stream so ardent in its course before   sent forth such sallies of glad sound that all   which i till then had heard appeard the voice   of common pleasure beast and bird the lamb   the shepherds dog the linnet and the thrush   vied with this waterfall and made a song   which while i listend seemd like the wild growth   or like some natural produce of the air   that could not cease to be green leaves were here   but twas the foliage of the rocks the birch   the yew the holly and the bright green thorn   with hanging islands of resplendent furze   and on a summit distant a short space   by any who should look beyond the dell   a single mountain cottage might be seen   i gazd and gazd and to myself i said   our thoughts at least are ours and this wild nook   my emma i will dedicate to thee    soon did the spot become my other home   my dwelling and my outofdoors abode   and of the shepherds who have seen me there   to whom i sometimes in our idle talk   have told this fancy two or three perhaps   years after we are gone and in our graves   when they have cause to speak of this wild place   may call it by the name of emmas dell         ii     to joanna    amid the smoke of cities did you pass   your time of early youth and there you learnd   from years of quiet industry to love   the living beings by your own fireside   with such a strong devotion that your heart   is slow towards the sympathies of them   who look upon the hills with tenderness   and make dear friendships with the streams and groves   yet we who are transgressors in this kind   dwelling retired in our simplicity   among the woods and fields we love you well   joanna and i guess since you have been   so distant from us now for two long years   that you will gladly listen to discourse   however trivial if you thence are taught   that they with whom you once were happy talk   familiarly of you and of old times    while i was seated now some ten days past   beneath those lofty firs that overtop   their ancient neighbour the old steeple tower   the vicar from his gloomy house hard by   came forth to greet me and when he had askd   how fares joanna that wildhearted maid   and when will she return to us he pausd   and after short exchange of village news   he with grave looks demanded for what cause   reviving obsolete idolatry   i like a runic priest in characters   of formidable size had chiseld out   some uncouth name upon the native rock   above the rotha by the forest side   now by those dear immunities of heart   engenderd betwixt malice and true love   i was not both to be so catechizd   and this was my replyas it befel   one summer morning we had walkd abroad   at break of day joanna and myself   twas that delightful season when the broom   full flowerd and visible on every steep   along the copses runs in veins of gold    our pathway led us on to rothas banks   and when we came in front of that tall rock   which looks towards the east i there stoppd short   and tracd the lofty barrier with my eye   from base to summit such delight i found   to note in shrub and tree in stone and flower   that intermixture of delicious hues   along so vast a surface all at once   in one impression by connecting force   of their own beauty imagd in the heart    when i had gazd perhaps two minutes space   joanna looking in my eyes beheld   that ravishment of mine and laughd aloud   the rock like something starting from a sleep   took up the ladys voice and laughd again   that ancient woman seated on helmcrag   was ready with her cavern hammarscar   and the tall steep of silverhow sent forth   a noise of laughter southern loughrigg heard   and fairfield answerd with a mountain tone   helvellyn far into the clear blue sky   carried the ladys voiceold skiddaw blew   his speaking trumpetback out of the clouds   of glaramara southward came the voice   and kirkstone tossd it from his misty head   now whether said i to our cordial friend   who in the heyday of astonishment   smild in my face this were in simple truth   a work accomplishd by the brotherhood   of ancient mountains or my ear was touchd   with dreams and visionary impulses   is not for me to tell but sure i am   that there was a loud uproar in the hills   and while we both were listening to my side   the fair joanna drew is if she wishd   to shelter from some object of her fear    and hence long afterwards when eighteen moons   were wasted as i chancd to walk alone   beneath this rock at sunrise on a calm   and silent morning i sate down and there   in memory of affections old and true   i chisseld out in those rude characters   joannas name upon the living stone   and i and all who dwell by my fireside   have calld the lovely rock joannas rock   note  in cumberland and westmoreland are several inscriptions upon the native rock which from the wasting of time and the rudeness of the workmanship had been mistaken for runic they are without doubt roman  the roths mentioned in this poem is the river which flowing through the lakes of grasmere and rydole fells into wyndermere on helmcrag that impressive single mountain at the head of the vale of grasmere is a rock which from most points of view bears a striking resemblance to an old woman cowering close by this rock is one of those fissures or caverns which in the language of the country are called dungeons the other mountains either immediately surround the vale of grasmere or belong to the same cluster         iii    there is an eminenceof these our hills   the last that parleys with the setting sun   we can behold it from our orchard seat   and when at evening we pursue our walk   along the public way this cliff so high   above us and so distant in its height   is visible and often seems to send   its own deep quiet to restore our hearts   the meteors make of it a favorite haunt   the star of jove so beautiful and large   in the mid heavns is never half so fair   as when he shines above it tis in truth   the loneliest place we have among the clouds    and she who dwells with me whom i have lovd   with such communion that no place on earth   can ever be a solitude to me   hath said this lonesome peak shall bear my name      iv    a narrow girdle of rough stones and crags   a rude and natural causeway interposd   between the water and a winding slope   of copse and thicket leaves the eastern shore   of grasmere safe in its own privacy   and there myself and two beloved friends   one calm september morning ere the mist   had altogether yielded to the sun   saunterd on this retird and difficult way   ill suits the road with one in haste but we   playd with our time and as we strolld along    it was our occupation to observe   such objects as the waves had tossd ashore   feather or leaf or weed or witherd bough   each on the other heapd along the line   of the dry wreck and in our vacant mood   not seldom did we stop to watch some tuft   of dandelion seed or thistles beard   which seeming lifeless half and half impelld   by some internal feeling skimmd along   close to the surface of the lake that lay   asleep in a dead calm ran closely on   along the dead calm lake now here now there   in all its sportive wanderings all the while   making report of an invisible breeze   that was its wings its chariot and its horse   its very playmate and its moving soul    and often trifling with a privilege   alike indulgd to all we pausd one now   and now the other to point out perchance   to pluck some flower or waterweed too fair   either to be divided from the place   on which it grew or to be left alone   to its own beauty many such there are   fair ferns and flowers and chiefly that tall plant   so stately of the queen osmunda namd   plant lovelier in its own retird abode   on grasmeres beach than naid by the side   of grecian brook or lady of the mere   solesitting by the shores of old romance   so fared we that sweet morning from the fields   meanwhile a noise was heard the busy mirth   of reapers men and women boys and girls    delighted much to listen to those sounds   and in the fashion which i have describd   feeding unthinking fancies we advancd   along the indented shore when suddenly   through a thin veil of glittering haze we saw   before us on a point of jutting land   the tall and upright figure of a man   attird in peasants garb who stood alone   angling beside the margin of the lake   that way we turnd our steps nor was it long   ere making ready comments on the sight   which then we saw with one and the same voice   we all cried out that he must be indeed   an idle man who thus could lose a day   of the mid harvest when the labourers hire   is ample and some little might be stord   wherewith to chear him in the winter time    thus talking of that peasant we approachd   close to the spot where with his rod and line   he stood alone whereat he turnd his head   to greet usand we saw a man worn down   by sickness gaunt and lean with sunken cheeks   and wasted limbs his legs so long and lean   that for my single self i lookd at them   forgetful of the body they sustaind   too weak to labour in the harvest field   the man was using his best skill to gain   a pittance from the dead unfeeling lake   that knew not of his wants i will not say   what thoughts immediately were ours nor how   the happy idleness of that sweet morn   with all its lovely images was changd   to serious musing and to selfreproach    nor did we fail to see within ourselves   what need there is to be reservd in speech   and temper all our thoughts with charity   therefore unwilling to forget that day   my friend myself and she who then receivd   the same admonishment have calld the plate   by a memorial name uncouth indeed   as eer by mariner was givn to bay   or foreland on a newdiscoverd coast   and point rashjudgment is the name it bears         v    to m h    our walk was far among the ancient trees   there was no road nor any woodmans path   but the thick umbrage checking the wild growth   of weed sapling on the soft green turf   beneath the branches of itself had made   a track which brought us to a slip of lawn   and a small bed of water in the woods    all round this pool both flocks and herds might drink   on its firm margin even as from a well   or some stonebason which the herdsmans hand   had shapd for their refreshment nor did sun   or wind from any quarter ever come   but as a blessing to this calm recess   this glade of water and this one green field   the spot was made by nature for herself   the travellers know it not and twill remain   unknown to them but it is beautiful   and if a man should plant his cottage near   should sleep beneath the shelter of its tress   and blend its waters with his daily meal   he would so love it that in his deathhour   its image would survive among his thoughts   and therefore my sweet mary this still nook   with all its beeches we have named from you      michael   a pastoral poem    michael    a pastoral poem      if from the public way you turn your steps   up the tumultuous brook of greenhead gill   you will suppose that with an upright path   your feet must struggle in such bold ascent   the pastoral mountains front you face to face   but courage for beside that boisterous brook   the mountains have all opend out themselves   and made a hidden valley of their own    no habitation there is seen but such   as journey thither find themselves alone   with a few sheep with rocks and stones and kites   that overhead are sailing in the sky   it is in truth an utter solitude   nor should i have made mention of this dell   but for one object which you might pass by   might see and notice not beside the brook   there is a straggling heap of unhewn stones   and to that place a story appertains   which though it be ungarnishd with events   is not unfit i deem for the fireside   or for the summer shade it was the first   the earliest of those tales that spake to me   of shepherds dwellers in the vallies men   whom i already lovd not verily   for their own sakes but for the fields and hills   where was their occupation and abode    and hence this tale while i was yet a boy   careless of books yet having felt the power   of nature by the gentle agency   of natural objects led me on to feel   for passions that were not my own and think   at random and imperfectly indeed   on man the heart of man and human life   therefore although it be a history   homely and rude i will relate the same   for the delight of a few natural hearts   and with yet fonder feeling for the sake   of youthful poets who among these hills   will be my second self when i am gone        upon the forestside in grasmere vale   there dwelt a shepherd michael was his name   an old man stout of heart and strong of limb   his bodily frame had been from youth to age   of an unusual strength his mind was keen   intense and frugal apt for all affairs   and in his shepherds calling he was prompt   and watchful more than ordinary men    hence he had learnd the meaning of all winds   of blasts of every tone and oftentimes   when others heeded not he heard the south   make subterraneous music like the noise   of bagpipers on distant highland hills   the shepherd at such warning of his flock   bethought him and he to himself would say   the winds are now devising work for me    and truly at all times the storm that drives   the traveller to a shelter summond him   up to the mountains he had been alone   amid the heart of many thousand mists   that came to him and left him on the heights   so livd he till his eightieth year was passd    and grossly that man errs who should suppose   that the green valleys and the streams and rocks   were things indifferent to the shepherds thoughts   fields where with chearful spirits he had breathd   the common air the hills which he so oft   had climbd with vigorous steps which had impressd   so many incidents upon his mind   of hardship skill or courage joy or fear   which like a book preservd the memory   of the dumb animals whom he had savd   had fed or shelterd linking to such acts   so grateful in themselves the certainty   of honorable gains these fields these hills   which were his living being even more   than his own bloodwhat could they less had laid   strong hold on his affections were to him   a pleasurable feeling of blind love   the pleasure which there is in life itself    he had not passed his days in singleness   he had a wife a comely matron old   though younger than himself full twenty years   she was a woman of a stirring life   whose heart was in her house two wheels she had   of antique form this large for spinning wool   that small for flax and if one wheel had rest   it was because the other was at work   the pair had but one inmate in their house   an only child who had been born to them   when michael telling oer his years began   to deem that he was old in shepherds phrase   with one foot in the grave this only son   with two brave sheep dogs tried in many a storm    the one of an inestimable worth   made all their household i may truly say   that they were as a proverb in the vale   for endless industry when day was gone   and from their occupations out of doors   the son and father were come home even then   their labour did not cease unless when all   turnd to their cleanly supperboard and there   each with a mess of pottage and skimmd milk   sate round their basket pild with oaten cakes   and their plain homemade cheese yet when their meal   was ended luke for so the son was namd   and his old father both betook themselves   to such convenient work as might employ   their hands by the fireside perhaps to card   wool for the housewifes spindle or repair   some injury done to sickle flail or scythe   or other implement of house or field    down from the cicling by the chimneys edge   which in our ancient uncouth country style   did with a huge projection overbrow   large space beneath as duly as the light   of day grew dim the housewife hung a lamp   an aged utensil which had performd   service beyond all others of its kind    early at evening did it burn and late   surviving comrade of uncounted hours   which going by from year to year had found   and left the couple neither gay perhaps   nor chearful yet with objects and with hopes   living a life of eager industry    and now when luke was in his eighteenth year   there by the light of this old lamp they sate   father and son while late into the night   the housewife plied her own peculiar work   making the cottage thro the silent hours   murmur as with the sound of summer flies    not with a waste of words but for the sake   of pleasure which i know that i shall give   to many living now i of this lamp   speak thus minutely for there are no few   whose memories will bear witness to my tale   the light was famous in its neighbourhood   and was a public symbol of the life   the thrifty pair had livd for as it chancd   their cottage on a plot of rising ground   stood single with large prospect north and south   high into easedale up to dunmalraise   and westward to the village near the lake   and from this constant light so regular   and so far seen the house itself by all   who dwelt within the limits of the vale   both old and young was namd the evening star    thus living on through such a length of years   the shepherd if he lovd himself must needs   have lovd his helpmate but to michaels heart   this son of his old age was yet more dear   effect which might perhaps have been producd   by that instinctive tenderness the same   blind spirit which is in the blood of all   or that a child more than all other gifts   brings hope with it and forwardlooking thoughts   and stirrings of inquietude when they   by tendency of nature needs must fail    from such and other causes to the thoughts   of the old man his only son was now   the dearest object that he knew on earth   exceeding was the love he bare to him   his heart and his hearts joy for oftentimes   old michael while he was a babe in arms   had done him female service not alone   for dalliance and delight as is the use   of fathers but with patient mind enforcd   to acts of tenderness and he had rockd   his cradle with a womans gentle hand    and in a later time ere yet the boy   had put on boys attire did michael love   albeit of a stern unbending mind   to have the young one in his sight when he   had work by his own door or when he sate   with sheep before him on his shepherds stool   beneath that large old oak which near their door   stood and from its enormous breadth of shade   chosen for the shearers covert from the sun   thence in our rustic dialect was calld   the clipping tree 10 a name which yet it bears  footnote 10 clipping is the word used in the north of england for shearing    there while they two were sitting in the shade   with others round them earnest all and blithe   would michael exercise his heart with looks   of fond correction and reproof bestowd   upon the child if he dislurbd the sheep   by catching at their legs or with his shouts   scard them while they lay still beneath the shears    and when by heavens good grace the boy grew up   a healthy lad and carried in his cheek   two steady roses that were five years old   then michael from a winter coppice cut   with his own hand a sapling which he hoopd   with iron making it throughout in all   due requisites a perfect shepherds staff   and gave it to the boy wherewith equippd   he as a watchman oftentimes was placd   at gate or gap to stem or turn the flock   and to his office prematurely calld   there stood the urchin as you will divine   something between a hindrance and a help   and for this cause not always i believe   receiving from his father hire of praise    while this good household thus were living on   from day to day to michaels ear there came   distressful tidings long before the time   of which i speak the shepherd had been bound   in surety for his brothers son a man   of an industrious life and ample means   but unforeseen misfortunes suddenly   had pressd upon him and old michael now   was summond to discharge the forfeiture   a grievous penalty but little less   than half his substance this unlookdfor claim   at the first hearing for a moment took   more hope out of his life than he supposed   that any old man ever could have lost    as soon as he had gatherd so much strength   that he could look his trouble in the face   it seemd that his sole refuge was to sell   a portion of his patrimonial fields   such was his first resolve he thought again   and his heart faild him isabel said he   two evenings after he had heard the news   i have been toiling more than seventy years   and in the open sunshine of gods love   have we all livd yet if these fields of ours   should pass into a strangers hand i think   that i could not lie quiet in my grave    our lot is a hard lot the sun itself   has scarcely been more diligent than i   and i have livd to be a fool at last   to my own family an evil man   that was and made an evil choice if he   were false to us and if he were not false   there are ten thousand to whom loss like this   had been no sorrow i forgive himbut   twere better to be dumb than to talk thus   when i began my purpose was to speak   of remedies and of a chearful hope    our luke shall leave us isabel the land   shall not go from us and it shall be free   he shall possess it free as is the wind   that passes over it we have thou knowest   another kinsman he will be our friend   in this distress he is a prosperous man   thriving in trade and luke to him shall go   and with his kinsmans help and his own thrift   he quickly will repair this loss and then   may come again to us if here he stay   what can be done where every one is poor   what can be gaind at this the old man pausd   and isabel sate silent for her mind   was busy looking back into past times    theres richard bateman thought she to herself   he was a parishboyat the churchdoor   they made a gathering for him shillings pence   and halfpennies wherewith the neighbours bought   a basket which they filld with pedlars wares   and with this basket on his arm the lad   went up to london found a master there   who out of many chose the trusty boy   to go and overlook his merchandise   beyond the seas where he grew wondrous rich   and left estates and monies to the poor   and at his birthplace built a chapel floord   with marble which he sent from foreign lands   these thoughts and many others of like sort   passd quickly thro the mind of isabel   and her face brightend the old man was glad    and thus resumd well i isabel this scheme   these two days has been meat and drink to me   far more than we have lost is left us yet   we have enoughi wish indeed that i   were younger but this hope is a good hope   make ready lukes best garments of the best   buy for him more and let us send him forth   tomorrow or the next day or tonight   if he could go the boy should go tonight   here michael ceasd and to the fields went forth   with a light heart the housewife for five days   was restless morn and night and all day long   wrought on with her best fingers to prepare   things needful for the journey of her son    but isabel was glad when sunday came   to stop her in her work for when she lay   by michaels side she for the two last nights   heard him how he was troubled in his sleep   and when they rose at morning she could see   that all his hopes were gone that day at noon   she said to luke while they two by themselves   were sitting at the door thou must not go   we have no other child but thee to lose   none to rememberdo not go away   for if thou leave thy father he will die   the lad made answer with a jocund voice   and isabel when she had told her fears   recoverd heart that evening her best fare   did she bring forth and all together sate   like happy people round a christmas fire    next morning isabel resumd her work   and all the ensuing week the house appeard   as cheerful as a grove in spring at length   the expected letter from their kinsman came   with kind assurances that he would do   his utmost for the welfare of the boy   to which requests were added that forthwith   he might be sent to him ten times or more   the letter was read over isabel   went forth to shew it to the neighbours round   nor was there at that time on english land   a prouder heart than lukes when isabel   had to her house returnd the old man said   he shall depart tomorrow to this word   the housewife answered talking much of things   which if at such short notice he should go   would surely be forgotten but at length   she gave consent and michael was at ease    near the tumultuous brook of greenhead gill   in that deep valley michael had designd   to build a sheepfold and before he heard   the tidings of his melancholy loss   for this same purpose he had gathered up   a heap of stones which close to the brook side   lay thrown together ready for the work   with luke that evening thitherward he walkd   and soon as they had reachd the place he stoppd   and thus the old man spake to him my son   tomorrow thou wilt leave me with full heart   i look upon thee for thou art the same   that wert a promise to me ere thy birth   and all thy life hast been my daily joy   i will relate to thee some little part   of our two histories twill do thee good   when thou art from me even if i should speak   of things thou caust not know ofafter thou   first camst into the world as it befalls   to newborn infants thou didst sleep away   two days and blessings from thy fathers tongue   then fell upon thee day by day passd on   and still i lovd thee with encreasing love    never to living ear came sweeter sounds   than when i heard thee by our own fireside   first uttering without words a natural tune   when thou a feeding babe didst in thy joy   sing at thy mothers breast month followd month   and in the open fields my life was passd   and in the mountains else i think that thou   hadst been brought up upon thy fathers knees   but we were playmates luke among these hills   as well thou knowst in us the old and young   have playd together nor with me didst thou   lack any pleasure which a boy can know    luke had a manly heart but at these words   he sobbd aloud the old man graspd his hand   and said nay do not take it soi see   that these are things of which i need not speak   even to the utmost i have been to thee   a kind and a good father and herein   i but repay a gift which i myself   receivd at others hands for though now old   beyond the common life of man i still   remember them who lovd me in my youth    both of them sleep together here they livd   as all their forefathers had done and when   at length their time was come they were not loth   to give their bodies to the family mold   i wishd that thou shouldst live the life they livd   but tis a long time to look back my son   and see so little gain from sixty years   these fields were burthend when they came to me   till i was forty years of age not more   than half of my inheritance was mine    i toild and toild god blessd me in my work   and till these three weeks past the land was free   it looks as if it never could endure   another master heaven forgive me luke   if i judge ill for thee but it seems good   that thou shouldst go at this the old man pausd   then pointing to the stones near which they stood   thus after a short silence he resumd   this was a work for us and now my son   it is a work for me but lay one stone   here lay it for me luke with thine own hands   i for the purpose brought thee to this place    nay boy be of good hopewe both may live   to see a better day at eightyfour   i still am strong and stoutdo thou thy part   i will do minei will begin again   with many tasks that were resignd to thee   up to the heights and in among the storms   will i without thee go again and do   all works which i was wont to do alone   before i knew thy faceheaven bless thee boy   thy heart these two weeks has been beating fast   with many hopesit should be soyesyes   i knew that thou couldst never have a wish   to leave me luke thou hast been bound to me   only by links of love when thou art gone   what will be left to usbut i forget   my purposes lay now the cornerstone   as i requested and hereafter luke   when thou art gone away should evil men   be thy companions let this sheepfold be   thy anchor and thy shield amid all fear   and all temptation let it be to thee   an emblem of the life thy fathers livd   who being innocent did for that cause   bestir them in good deeds now fare thee well   when thou returnst thou in this place wilt see   a work which is not here a covenant   twill be between usbut whatever fate   befall thee i shall love thee to the last   and bear thy memory with me to the grave    the shepherd ended here and luke stoopd down   and as his father had requested laid   the first stone of the sheepfold at the sight   the old mans grief broke from him to his heart   he pressd his son he kissed him and wept   and to the house together they returnd    next morning as had been resolvd the boy   began his journey and when he had reachd   the public way he put on a bold face   and all the neighbours as he passd their doors   came forth with wishes and with farewell prayrs   that followd him till he was out of sight    a good report did from their kinsman come   of luke and his welldoing and the boy   wrote loving letters full of wondrous news   which as the housewife phrased it were throughout   the prettiest letters that were ever seen    both parents read them with rejoicing hearts   so many months passd on and once again   the shepherd went about his daily work   with confident and cheerful thoughts and now   sometimes when he could find a leisure hour   he to that valley took his way and there   wrought at the sheepfold meantime luke began   to slacken in his duty and at length   he in the dissolute city gave himself   to evil courses ignominy and shame   fell on him so that he was driven at last   to seek a hidingplace beyond the seas    there is a comfort in the strength of love   twill make a thing endurable which else   would break the heartold michael found it so   i have conversd with more than one who well   remember the old man and what he was   years after he had heard this heavy news   his bodily frame had been from youth to age   of an unusual strength among the rocks   he went and still lookd up upon the sun   and listend to the wind and as before   performd all kinds of labour for his sheep   and for the land his small inheritance    and to that hollow dell from time to time   did he repair to build the fold of which   his flock had need tis not forgotten yet   the pity which was then in every heart   for the old manands tis believd by all   that many and many a day he thither went   and never lifted up a single stone    there by the sheepfold sometimes was he seen   sitting alone with that his faithful dog   then old beside him lying at his feet   the length of full seven years from time to time   he at the building of this sheepfold wrought   and left the work unfinished when he died    three years or little more did isabel   survive her husband at her death the estate   was sold and went into a strangers hand   the cottage which was namd the evening star   is gone the ploughshare has been through the ground   on which it stood great changes have been wrought   in all the neighbourhood yet the oak is left   that grew beside their door and the remains   of the unfinished sheepfold may be seen   beside the boisterous brook of greenhead gill     notes to the poem of the brothers  note i  page 26line 20 there were two springs that bubbled side by side the impressive circumstance here described actually took place some years ago in this country upon an eminence called kidstow pike one of the highest of the mountains that surround haweswater the summit of the pike was stricken by lightning and every trace of one of the fountains disappeared while the other continued to flow as before  note ii  page 29line 5 the thought of death sits easy on the man c there is not any thing more worthy of remark in the manners of the inhabitants of these mountains than the tranquillity i might say indifference with which they think and talk upon the subject of death some of the country churchyards as here described do not contain a single tombstone and most of them have a very small number  notes to the poem of michael  note i  page 213line 14 theres richard bateman c this story alluded to here is well known in the country the chapel is called ings chapel and is on the right hand side of the road leading from kendal to ambleside  note ii  page 217line 4 had designd to build a sheepfold etc it may be proper to inform some readers that a sheepfold in these mountains is an unroofed building of stone walls with different divisions it is generally placed by the side of a brook for the convenience of washing the sheep but it is also useful as a shelter for them and as a place to drive them into to enable the shepherds conveniently to single out one or more for any particular purpose  end  errata
