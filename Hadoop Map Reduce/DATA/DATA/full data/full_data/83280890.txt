83280890	prince prigio  from his own fairy book  by andrew lang     to children  the author of this book is also the editor of the blue red greenland yellow fairy books he has always felt rather an impostor because so many children seem to think that he made up these books out of his own head now he only picked up a great many old fairy tales told in french german greek chinese red indian russian and other languages and had them translated and printed with pictures he is glad that children like them but he must confess that they should be grateful to old forgotten people long ago who first invented these tales and who knew more about fairies than we can hope to do  my own fairy book which you now have in your hands was made up altogether out of his own head by the author of course with the help of the historical papers in the kingdom of pantouflia about that ancient kingdom very little is known the natives speak german but the royal family as usual was of foreign origin just as england has had norman scottish and at present a line of german monarchs so the kings of pantouflia are descended from an old greek family the hypnotidæ who came to pantouflia during the crusades they wanted they explained not to be troubled with the crusades which they thought very injudicious and tiresome the crest of the regal house is a dormouse dormant proper on a field vert and the motto when translated out of the original greek means anything for a quiet life  it may surprise the young reader that princes like prigio and ricardo whose feet were ever in the stirrup and whose lances were always in rest should have descended from the family of the hypnotidæ who were remarkably lazy and peaceful but these heroes doubtless inherited the spirit of their great ancestress whose story is necessary to be known on leaving his native realm during the crusades in search of some secure asylum the founder of the pantouflian monarchy landed in the island of cyprus where during the noontide heat he lay down to sleep in a cave now in this cave dwelt a dragon of enormous size and unamiable character what was the horror of the exiled prince when he was aroused from slumber by the fiery breath of the dragon and felt its scaly coils about him  oh hang your practical jokes exclaimed the prince imagining that some of his courtiers were playing a prank on him  do you call this a joke asked the dragon twisting its forked tail into a line with his royal highnesss eye  do take that thing away said the prince and let a man have his nap peacefully  kiss me cried the dragon which had already devoured many gallant knights for declining to kiss it  give you a kiss murmured the prince oh certainly if thats all anything for a quiet life  so saying he kissed the dragon which instantly became a most beautiful princess for she had lain enchanted as a dragon by a wicked magician till somebody should be bold enough to kiss her  my love my hero my lord how long i have waited for thee and now i am eternally thine own  so murmured in the most affectionate accents the lady dragonissa as she was now called  though wedded to a bachelor life the prince was much too wellbred to make any remonstrance  the lady dragonissa a female of extraordinary spirit energy and ambition took command of him and of his followers conducted them up the danube seized a principality whose lord had gone crusading set her husband on the throne and became in course of time the mother of a little prince who again was great great great greatgrandfather of our prince prigio  from this adventurous lady dragonissa prince prigio derived his character for gallantry but her husband it is said was often heard to remark by a slight change of his family motto  anything for a quiet wife  you now know as much as the author does of the early history of pantouflia  as to the story called the gold of fairnilee such adventures were extremely common in scotland long ago as may be read in many of the works of sir walter scott and of the learned in general indeed fairnilee is the very place where the fairy queen appointed to meet her lover thomas the rhymer  with these explanations the author leaves to the judgment of young readers his own fairy book     prince prigio  by andrew lang  adorned by gordon browne t scott and e a lemann  is  dedicated  to  alma thyra edith rosalind norna cecily and violet     preface  in compiling the following history from the archives of pantouflia the editor has incurred several obligations to the learned the return of benson chapter xii is the fruit of the research of the late mr allen quatermain while the final wish of prince prigio was suggested by the invention or erudition of a lady  a study of the firedrake in south africa where he is called the nanaboulélé a difficult wordhas been published in french translated from the basuto language by m paul sébillot in the revue des traditione populaires for the rémora the editor is indebted to the voyage à la lune of m cyrano de bergérac  illustration chapter one     chapter ihow the fairies were not invited to court  once upon a time there reigned in pantouflia a king and a queen with almost everything else to make them happy they wanted one thing they had no children this vexed the king even more than the queen who was very clever and learned and who had hated dolls when she was a child however she too in spite of all the books she read and all the pictures she painted would have been glad enough to be the mother of a little prince the king was anxious to consult the fairies but the queen would not hear of such a thing she did not believe in fairies she said that they had never existed and that she maintained though the history of the royal family was full of chapters about nothing else  well at long and at last they had a little boy who was generally regarded as the finest baby that had ever been seen even her majesty herself remarked that though she could never believe all the courtiers told her yet he certainly was a fine childa very fine child  now the time drew near for the christening party and the king and queen were sitting at breakfast in their summer parlour talking over it it was a splendid room hung with portraits of the royal ancestors there was cinderella the grandmother of the reigning monarch with her little foot in her glass slipper thrust out before her there was the marquis de carabas who as everyone knows was raised to the throne as prince consort after his marriage with the daughter of the king of the period on the arm of the throne was seated his celebrated cat wearing boots there too was a portrait of a beautiful lady sound asleep this was madame la belle au boisdormant also an ancestress of the royal family many other pictures of celebrated persons were hanging on the walls  you have asked all the right people my dear said the king  everyone who should be asked answered the queen  people are so touchy on these occasions said his majesty you have not forgotten any of our aunts  no the old cats replied the queen for the kings aunts were oldfashioned and did not approve of her and she knew it they are very kind old ladies in their way said the king and were nice to me when i was a boy  then he waited a little and remarked  the fairies of course you have invited it has always been usual in our family on an occasion like this and i think we have neglected them a little of late  how can you be so absurd cried the queen how often must i tell you that there are no fairies and even if there werebut no matter pray let us drop the subject  they are very old friends of our family my dear thats all said the king timidly often and often they have been godmothers to us one in particular was most kind and most serviceable to cinderella i my own grandmother  your grandmother interrupted her majesty fiddlededee if anyone puts such nonsense into the head of my little prigio  but here the baby was brought in by the nurse and the queen almost devoured it with kisses and so the fairies were not invited it was an extraordinary thing but none of the nobles could come to the christening party when they learned that the fairies had not been asked some were abroad several were ill a few were in prison among the saracens others were captives in the dens of ogres the end of it was that the king and queen had to sit down alone one at each end of a very long table arrayed with plates and glasses for a hundred guestsfor a hundred guests who never came  any soup my dear shouted the king through a speakingtrumpet when suddenly the air was filled with a sound like the rustling of the wings of birds  flitter flitter flutter went the noise and when the queen looked up lo and behold on every seat was a lovely fairy dressed in green each with a most interestinglooking parcel in her hand dont you like opening parcels the king did and he was most friendly and polite to the fairies but the queen though she saw them distinctly took no notice of them you see she did not believe in fairies nor in her own eyes when she saw them so she talked across the fairies to the king just as if they had not been there but the king behaved as politely as if they were realwhich of course they were  when dinner was over and when the nurse had brought in the baby all the fairies gave him the most magnificent presents one offered a purse which could never be empty and one a pair of sevenleagued boots and another a cap of darkness that nobody might see the prince when he put it on and another a wishingcap and another a carpet on which when he sat he was carried wherever he wished to find himself another made him beautiful for ever and another brave and another lucky but the last fairy of all a cross old thing crept up and said my child you shall be too clever  this fairys gift would have pleased the queen if she had believed in it more than anything else because she was so clever herself but she took no notice at all and the fairies went each to her own country and none of them stayed there at the palace where nobody believed in them except the king a little but the queen tossed all their nice boots and caps carpets purses swords and all away into a dark lumberroom for of course she thought that they were all nonsense and merely old rubbish out of books or pantomime properties  illustration chapter two     chapter iiprince prigio and his family  well the little prince grew up i think ive told you that his name was prigiodid i not well that was his name  you cannot think how clever he was he argued with his nurse as soon as he could speak which was very soon he argued that he did not like to be washed because the soap got into his eyes however when he was told all about the pores of the skin and how they could not be healthy if he was not washed he at once ceased to resist for he was very reasonable he argued with his father that he did not see why there should be kings who were rich while beggars were poor and why the kingwho was a little greedyshould have poached eggs and plumcake at afternoon tea while many other persons went without dinner the king was so surprised and hurt at these remarks that he boxed the princes ears saying i ll teach you to be too clever my lad then he remembered the awful curse of the oldest fairy and was sorry for the rudeness of the queen and when the prince after having his ears boxed said that force was no argument the king went away in a rage  indeed i cannot tell you how the prince was hated by all he would go down into the kitchen and show the cook how to make soup he would visit the poor peoples cottage and teach them how to make the beds and how to make plum pudding out of turniptops and venison cutlets out of rusty bacon he showed the fencingmaster how to fence and the professional cricketer how to bowl and instructed the ratcatcher in breeding terriers he set sums to the chancellor of the exchequer and assured the astronomer royal that the sun does not go round the earthwhich for my part i believe it does the young ladies of the court disliked dancing with him in spite of his good looks because he was always asking have you read this and have you read thatand when they said they hadnt he sneered and when they said they had he found them out  he found out all his tutors and masters in the same horrid way correcting the accent of his french teacher and trying to get his german tutor not to eat peas with his knife he also endeavoured to teach the queendowager his grandmother an art with which she had long been perfectly familiar in fact he knew everything better than anybody else and the worst of it was that he did and he never was in the wrong and he always said didnt i tell you so and what was more he had  illustration page 12  as time went on prince prigio had two younger brothers whom everybody liked they were not a bit clever but jolly prince alphonso the third son was round fat goodhumoured and as brave as a lion prince enrico the second was tall thin and a little sad but never too clever both were in love with two of their own cousins with the approval of their dear parents and all the world said what nice unaffected princes they are but prigio nearly got the country into several wars by being too clever for the foreign ambassadors now as pantouflia was a rich lazy country which hated fighting this was very unpleasant and did not make people love prince prigio any better  illustration chapter three     chapter iiiabout the firedrake  of all the people who did not like prigio his own dear papa king grognio disliked him most for the king knew he was not clever himself when he was in the countinghouse counting out his money and when he happened to say sixteen shillings and fourteen and twopence are three pounds fifteen it made him wild to hear prigio whisper one pound ten and twopencewhich of course it is and the king was afraid that prigio would conspire and get made king himselfwhich was the last thing prigio really wanted he much preferred to idle about and know everything without seeming to take any trouble  well the king thought and thought how was he to get prigio out of the way and make enrico or alphonso his successor he read in books about it and all the books showed that if a king sent his three sons to do anything it was always the youngest who did it and got the crown and he wished he had the chance well it arrived at last  illustration page 15  there was a very hot summer it began to be hot in march all the rivers were dried up the grass did not grow the corn did not grow the thermometers exploded with heat the barometers stood at set fair the people were much distressed and came and broke the palace windowsas they usually do when things go wrong in pantouflia  the king consulted the learned men about the court who told him that probably a firedrake was in the neighbourhood  now the firedrake is a beast or bird about the bigness of an elephant its body is made of iron and it is always redhot a more terrible and cruel beast cannot be imagined for if you go near it you are at once broiled by the firedrake  but the king was not illpleased for thought he of course my three sons must go after the brute the eldest first and as usual it will kill the first two and be beaten by the youngest it is a little hard on enrico poor boy but anything to get rid of that prigio  then the king went to prigio and said that his country was in danger and that he was determined to leave the crown to whichever of them would bring him the horns for it has horns and tail of the firedrake  it is an awkward brute to tackle the king said but you are the oldest my lad go where glory waits you put on your armour and be off with you  illustration page 17  this the king said hoping that either the firedrake would roast prince prigio alive which he could easily do as i have said for he is all over as hot as a redhot poker or that if the prince succeeded at least his country would be freed from the monster  but the prince who was lying on the sofa doing sums in compound division for fun said in the politest way  thanks to the education your majesty has given me i have learned that the firedrake like the siren the fairy and so forth is a fabulous animal which does not exist but even granting for the sake of argument that there is a firedrake your majesty is well aware that there is no kind of use in sending me it is always the eldest son who goes out first and comes to grief on these occasions and it is always the third son that succeeds send alphonso this was the youngest brother and he will do the trick at once at least if he fails it will be most unusual and enrico can try his luck  then he went back to his arithmetic and his slate and the king had to send for prince alphonso and prince enrico they both came in very warm for they had been whipping tops and the day was unusually hot  look here said the king just you two younger ones look at prigio you see how hot it is and how coolly he takes it and the country suffering and all on account of a firedrake you know which has apparently built his nest not far off well i have asked that lout of a brother of yours to kill it and he says  that he does not believe in firedrakes interrupted prigio the weathers warm enough without going out hunting  not believe in firedrakes cried alphonso i wonder what you do believe in just let me get at the creature for he was as brave as a lion hi page my chainarmour helmet lance and buckler a molinda a molinda which was his warcry  the page ran to get the armour but it was so uncommonly hot that he dropped it and put his fingers in his mouth crying  you had better put on flannels alphonso for this kind of work said prigio and if i were you id take a light gardenengine full of water to squirt at the enemy  happy thought said alphonso i will and off he went kissed his dear molinda bade her keep a lot of dances for him there was to be a dance when he had killed the firedrake and then he rushed to the field  but he never came back any more  everyone wept bitterlyeveryone but prince prigio for he thought it was a practical joke and said that alphonso had taken the opportunity to start off on his travels and see the world  there is some dreadful mistake sir said prigio to the king you know as well as i do that the youngest son has always succeeded up to now but i entertain great hopes of enrico  and he grinned for he fancied it was all nonsense and that there were no firedrakes  enrico was present when prigio was consoling the king in this unfeeling way  enrico my boy said his majesty the task awaits you and the honour when you come back with the horns and tail of the firedrake you shall be crown prince and prigio shall be made an usher at the grammar schoolit is all he is fit for  enrico was not quite so confident as alphonso had been he insisted on making his will and he wrote a poem about the pleasures and advantages of dying young this is part of it       the violet is a blossom sweet        that droops before the day is done      slain by thine overpowering heat o sun        and i like that sweet purple flower      may roast or boil or broil or bake        if burned by thy terrific power firedrake  this poem comforted enrico more or less and he showed it to prigio but the prince only laughed and said that the second line of the last verse was not very good for violets do not roast or boil or broil or bake  enrico tried to improve it but could not so he read it to his cousin lady kathleena just as it was and she cried over it though i dont think she understood it and enrico cried a little too  however next day he started with a spear a patent refrigerator and a lot of the bottles people throw at fires to put them out  but he never came back again  after shedding torrents of tears the king summoned prince prigio to his presence  dastard he said poltroon your turn which should have come first has arrived at last you must fetch me the horns and the tail of the fired rake probably you will be grilled thank goodness but who will give me back enrico and alphonso  indeed your majesty said prigio you must permit me to correct your policy your only reason for dispatching your sons in pursuit of this dangerous but i believe fabulous animal was to ascertain which of us would most worthily succeed to your throne at the datelong may it be deferredof your lamented decease now there can be no further question about the matter i unworthy as i am represent the sole hope of the royal family therefore to send me after the firedrake were both dangerous and unnecessary dangerous because if he treats me as you say he did my brothersmy unhappy brothersthe throne of pantouflia will want an heir but if i do come back alivewhy i cannot be more the true heir than i am at present now can i ask the lord chief justice if you dont believe me        subjunctive mood   he was a great grammarian  these arguments were so clearly and undeniably correct that the king unable to answer them withdrew into a solitary place where he could express himself with freedom and give rein to his passions  illustration chapter four     chapter ivhow prince prigio was deserted by everybody  meanwhile prince prigio had to suffer many unpleasant things though he was the crown prince and though his arguments were unanswerable everybody shunned him for a coward the queen who did not believe in firedrakes alone took his side he was not only avoided by all but he had most disagreeable scenes with his own cousins lady molinda and lady kathleena in the garden lady molinda met him walking alone and did not bow to him  dear molly said the prince who liked her how have i been so unfortunate as to offend you  my name sir is lady molinda she said very proudly and you have sent your own brother to his grave  illustration page 24  oh excuse me said the prince i am certain he has merely gone off on his travels hell come back when hes tired there are no firedrakes a french writer says they are purement fabuleux purely fabulous you know  prince alphonso has gone on his travels and will come back when he is tired and was he thentiredof me cried poor molinda bursting into tears and forgetting her dignity  oh i beg your pardon i never noticed im sure i am very sorry cried the prince who never having been in love himself never thought of other people and he tried to take molindas hand but she snatched it from him and ran away through the garden to the palace leaving prince prigio to feel foolish for once and ashamed  as for lady kathleena she swept past him like a queen without a word so the prince for all his cleverness was not happy  after several days had gone by the king returned from the solitary place where he had been speaking his mind he now felt calmer and better and so at last he came back to the palace but on seeing prince prigio who was lolling in a hammock translating egyptian hieroglyphs into french poetry for his mother the king broke out afresh and made use of the most cruel and impolite expressions  at last he gave orders that all the court should pack up and move to a distant city and that prince prigio should be left alone in the palace by himself for he was quite unendurable the king said and he could not trust his own temper when he thought of him and he grew so fierce that even the queen was afraid of him now  the poor queen cried a good deal prigio being her favourite son on account of his acknowledged ability and talent but the rest of the courtiers were delighted at leaving prince prigio behind for his part he very goodnaturedly showed them the best and shortest road to falkenstein the city where they were going and easily proved that neither the chief secretary for geography nor the general of the army knew anything about the matterwhich indeed they did not  the ungrateful courtiers left prigio with hoots and yells for they disliked him so much that they forgot he would be king one day he therefore reminded them of this little fact in future history which made them feel uncomfortable enough and then lay down in his hammock and went to sleep  when he wakened the air was cold and the day was beginning to grow dark prince prigio thought he would go down and dine at a tavern in the town for no servants had been left with him but what was his annoyance when he found that his boots his sword his cap his cloakall his clothes in fact except those he worehad been taken away by the courtiers merely to spite him his wardrobe had been ransacked and everything that had not been carried off had been cut up burned and destroyed never was such a spectacle of wicked mischief it was as if hay had been made of everything he possessed what was worse he had not a penny in his pocket to buy new things and his father had stopped his allowance of fifty thousand pounds a month  can you imagine anything more cruel and unjust than this conduct for it was not the princes fault that he was so clever the cruel fairy had made him so but even if the prince had been born clever as may have happened to you was he to be blamed for that the other people were just as much in fault for being born so stupid but the world my dear children can never be induced to remember this if you are clever you will find it best not to let people know itif you want them to like you  well here was the prince in a pretty plight not a pound in his pocket not a pair of boots to wear not even a cap to cover his head from the rain nothing but cold meat to eat and never a servant to answer the bell  illustration chapter five     chapter vwhat prince prigio found in the garret  the prince walked from room to room of the palace but unless he wrapped himself up in a curtain there was nothing for him to wear when he went out in the rain at last he climbed up a turretstair in the very oldest part of the castle where he had never been before and at the very top was a little round room a kind of garret the prince pushed in the door with some difficultynot that it was locked but the handle was rusty and the wood had swollen with the damp the room was very dark only the last grey light of the rainy evening came through a slit of a window one of those narrow windows that they used to fire arrows out of in old times  but in the dusk the prince saw a heap of all sorts of things lying on the floor and on the table there were two caps he put one onan old grey ugly cap it was made of felt there was a pair of boots and he kicked off his slippers and got into them they were a good deal worn but fitted as if they had been made for him on the table was a purse with just three gold coinsold ones tooin it and this as you may fancy the prince was very well pleased to put in his pocket a sword with a swordbelt he buckled about his waist and the rest of the articles a regular collection of odds and ends he left just where they were lying then he ran downstairs and walked out of the hall door  illustration chapter six     chapter viwhat happened to prince prigio in town  by this time the prince was very hungry the town was just three miles off but he had such a royal appetite that he did not like to waste it on bad cookery and the people of the royal town were bad cooks i wish i were in the bear at gluckstein said he to himself for he remembered that there was a very good cook there but then the town was twentyone leagues awaysixtythree long miles  no sooner had the prince said this and taken just three steps than he found himself at the door of the bear inn at gluckstein  this is the most extraordinary dream said he to himself for he was far too clever of course to believe in sevenleague boots yet he had a pair on at that very moment and it was they which had carried him in three strides from the palace to gluckstein  the truth is that the prince in looking about the palace for clothes had found his way into that very old lumberroom where the magical gifts of the fairies had been thrown by his clever mother who did not believe in them but this of course the prince did not know  now you should be told that sevenleague boots only take those prodigious steps when you say you want to go a long distance otherwise they would be very inconvenientwhen you only want to cross the room for example perhaps this has not been explained to you by your governess  well the prince walked into the bear and it seemed odd to him that nobody took any notice of him and yet his face was as well known as that of any man in pantouflia for everybody had seen it at least in pictures he was so puzzled by not being attended to as usual that he quite forgot to take off his cap  illustration page 31  he sat down at a table however and shouted kellner at which all the waiters jumped and looked round in every direction but nobody came to him at first he thought they were too busy but presently another explanation occurred to him  the king said he to himself has threatened to execute anybody who speaks to me or helps me in any way well i dont mean to starve in the midst of plenty anyhow here goes  the prince rose and went to the table in the midst of the room where a huge roast turkey had just been placed he helped himself to half the breast some sausages chestnut stuffing bread sauce potatoes and a bottle of red wineburgundy he then went back to a table in a corner where he dined very well nobody taking any notice of him when he had finished he sat watching the other people dining and smoking his cigarette as he was sitting thus a very tall man an officer in the uniform of the guards came in and walking straight to the princes table said kellner clean this table and bring in the bill of fare  with these words the officer sat down suddenly in the princes lap as if he did not see him at all he was a heavy man and the prince enraged at the insult pushed him away and jumped to his feet as he did so his cap dropped off the officer fell on his knees at once crying  pardon my prince pardon i never saw you  this was more than the prince could be expected to believe  nonsense count frederick von matterhorn he said you must be intoxicated sir you have insulted your prince and your superior officer consider yourself under arrest you shall be sent to a prison tomorrow  on this the poor officer appealed piteously to everybody in the tavern they all declared that they had not seen the prince nor ever had an idea that he was doing them the honour of being in the neighbourhood of their town  more and more offended and convinced that there was a conspiracy to annoy and insult him the prince shouted for the landlord called for his bill threw down his three pieces of gold without asking for change and went into the street  it is a disgraceful conspiracy he said the king shall answer for this i shall write to the newspapers at once  he was not put in a better temper by the way in which people hustled him in the street they ran against him exactly as if they did not see him and then staggered back in the greatest surprise looking in every direction for the person they had jostled in one of these encounters the prince pushed so hard against a poor old beggar woman that she fell down as he was usually most kind and polite he pulled off his cap to beg her pardon when behold the beggar woman gave one dreadful scream and fainted a crowd was collecting and the prince forgetting that he had thrown down all his money in the tavern pulled out his purse then he remembered what he had done and expected to find it empty but lo there were three pieces of gold in it overcome with surprise he thrust the money into the womans hand and put on his cap again in a moment the crowd which had been staring at him rushed away in every direction with cries of terror declaring that there was a magician in the town and a fellow who could appear and disappear at pleasure  illustration page 35  by this time you or i or anyone who was not so extremely clever as prince prigio would have understood what was the matter he had put on without knowing it not only the sevenleague boots but the cap of darkness and had taken fortunatuss purse which could never be empty however often you took all the money out all those and many other delightful wares the fairies had given him at his christening and the prince had found them in the dark garret but the prince was so extremely wise and learned and scientific that he did not believe in fairies nor in fairy gifts  it is indigestion he said to himself those sausages were not of the best and that burgundy was extremely strong things are not as they appear  here as he was arguing with himself he was nearly run over by a splendid carriage and six the driver of which never took the slightest notice of him annoyed at this the prince leaped up behind threw down the two footmen who made no resistance and so was carried to the door of a magnificent palace he was determined to challenge the gentleman who was in the carriage but noticing that he had a very beautiful young lady with him whom he had never seen before he followed them into the house not wishing to alarm the girl and meaning to speak to the gentleman when he found him alone  a great ball was going on but as usual nobody took any notice of the prince he walked among the guests being careful not to jostle them and listening to their conversation  it was all about himself everyone had heard of his disgrace and almost everyone cried serve him right they said that the airs he gave himself were quite unendurablethat nothing was more rude than to be always in the rightthat cleverness might be carried far too farthat it was better even to be born stupid like the rest of you thought the prince and in fact nobody had a good word for him  yes one had it was the pretty lady of the carriage i never could tell you how pretty she was she was tall with cheeks like white roses blushing she had dark hair and very large darkgrey eyes and her face was the kindest in the world the prince first thought how nice and good she looked even before he thought how pretty she looked she stood up for prince prigio when her partner would speak ill of him she had never seen the prince for she was but newly come to pantouflia but she declared that it was his misfortune not his fault to be so clever and then think how hard they made him work at school besides said this kind young lady i hear he is extremely handsome and very brave and he has a good heart for he was kind i have heard to a poor boy and did all his examination papers for him so that the boy passed first in everything and now he is minister for education though he cant do a line of greek prose  the prince blushed at this for he knew his conduct had not been honourable but he at once fell over head and ears in love with the young lady a thing he had never done in his life before becausehe saidwomen were so stupid you see he was so clever  now at this very momentwhen the prince all of a sudden was as deep in love as if he had been the stupidest officer in the rooman extraordinary thing happened something seemed to give a whirr in his brain and in one instant he knew all about it he believed in fairies and fairy gifts and understood that his cap was the cap of darkness and his shoes the sevenleague boots and his purse the purse of fortunatus he had read about those things in historical books but now he believed in them  illustration chapter seven     chapter viithe prince falls in love  he understood all this and burst out laughing which nearly frightened an old lady near him out of her wits ah how he wished he was only in evening dress that he might dance with the charming young lady but there he was dressed just as if he were going out to hunt if anyone could have seen him so even if he took off his cap of darkness and became visible he was no figure for a ball once he would not have cared but now he cared very much indeed  but the prince was not clever for nothing he thought for a moment then went out of the room and in three steps of the sevenleague boots was at his empty dark cold palace again he struck a light with a flint and steel lit a torch and ran upstairs to the garret the flaring light of the torch fell on the pile of rubbish as the queen would have called it which he turned over with eager hands was thereyes there was another cap there it lay a handsome green one with a red feather  the prince pulled off the cap of darkness put on the other and said  i wish i were dressed in my best suit of white and gold with the royal pantouflia diamonds  in one moment there he was in white and gold the greatest and most magnificent dandy in the whole world and the handsomest man  how about my boots i wonder said the prince for his sevenleague boots were stout ridingboots not good to dance in whereas now he was in elegant shoes of silk and gold  he threw down the wishing cap put on the otherthe cap of darknessand made three strides in the direction of gluckstein but he was only three steps nearer it than he had been and the sevenleague boots were standing beside him on the floor  no said the prince no man can be in two different pairs of boots at one and the same time thats mathematics  he then hunted about in the lumberroom again till he found a small shabby old persian carpet the size of a hearthrug he went to his own room took a portmanteau in his hand sat down on the carpet and said  i wish i were in gluckstein  in a moment there he found himself for this was that famous carpet which prince hussein bought long ago in the market at bisnagar and which the fairies had brought with the other presents to the christening of prince prigio  illustration page 40  when he arrived at the house where the ball was going on he put the magical carpet in the portmanteau and left it in the cloakroom receiving a numbered ticket in exchange then he marched in all his glory and of course without the cap of darkness into the room where they were dancing everybody made place for him bowing down to the ground and the loyal band struck up the princes march  heaven bless our prince prigio what is there he doesnt know greek swiss german high and low and the names of the mountains in mexico heaven bless the prince  he used to be very fond of this march and the wordssome people even said he had made them himself but now somehow he didnt much like it he went straight to the duke of stumpfelbahn the hereditary master of the ceremonies and asked to be introduced to the beautiful young lady she was the daughter of the new english ambassador and her name was lady rosalind but she nearly fainted when she heard who it was that wished to dance with her for she was not at all particularly clever and the prince had such a bad character for snubbing girls and asking them difficult questions however it was impossible to refuse and so she danced with the prince and he danced very well then they sat out in the conservatory among the flowers where nobody came near them and then they danced again and then the prince took her down to supper and all the time he never once said have you read this or have you read that or what you never heard of alexander the great or julius caesar or michael angelo or whoever it might behorrid difficult questions he used to ask that was the way he used to go on but now he only talked to the young lady about herself and she quite left off being shy or frightened and asked him all about his own country and about the firedrake shooting and said how fond she was of hunting herself and the prince said  oh if you wish it you shall have the horns and tail of a firedrake to hang up in your hall tomorrow evening  then she asked if it was not very dangerous work firedrake hunting and he said it was nothing when you knew the trick of it and he asked her if she would but give him a rose out of her bouquet and in short he made himself so agreeable and unaffected that she thought him very nice indeed  for even a clever person can be nice when he likesabove all when he is not thinking about himself and now the prince was thinking of nothing in the world but the daughter of the english ambassador and how to please herhe got introduced to her father too and quite won his heart and at last he was invited to dine next day at the embassy  in pantouflia it is the custom that a ball must not end while one of the royal family goes on dancing this ball lasted till the light came in and the birds were singing out of doors and all the mothers present were sound asleep  illustration page 42  then nothing would satisfy the prince but that they all should go home singing through the streets in fact there never had been so merry a dance in all pantouflia the prince had made a point of dancing with almost every girl there and he had suddenly become the most beloved of the royal family but everything must end at last and the prince putting on the cap of darkness and sitting on the famous carpet flew back to his lonely castle  illustration chapter eight     chapter viiithe prince is puzzled  prince prigio did not go to bed it was bright daylight and he had promised to bring the horns and tail of a firedrake as a present to a pretty lady he had said it was easy to do this but now as he sat and thought over it he did not feel so victorious  first he said where is the firedrake  he reflected for a little and then ran upstairs to the garret  it should be here he cried tossing the fairies gifts about and by george here it is  indeed he had found the spyglass of carved ivory which prince ali in the arabian nights bought in the bazaar in schiraz now this glass was made so that by looking through it you could see anybody or anything you wished however far away prigios first idea was to look at his lady but she does not expect to be looked at he thought and i wont on the other hand he determined to look at the firedrake for of course he had no delicacy about spying on him the brute  the prince clapped the glass to his eye stared out of window and there sure enough he saw the firedrake he was floating about in a sea of molten lava on the top of a volcano there he was swimming and diving for pleasure tossing up the flaming waves and blowing fountains of fire out of his nostrils like a whale spouting  illustration page 44  the prince did not like the looks of him  with all my cap of darkness and my shoes of swiftness and my sword of sharpness i never could get near that beast he said and if i did stalk him i could not hurt him poor little alphonso poor enrico what plucky fellows they were i fancied that there was no such thing as a firedrake hes not in the natural history books and i thought the boys were only making fun and would be back soon safe and sound how horrid being too clever makes one and now what am i to do  what was he to do indeed and what would you have done bring the horns and tail he must or perish in the adventure otherwise how could he meet his ladywhy she would think him a mere braggart  the prince sat down and thought and thought and the day went on and it was now high noon  at last he jumped up and rushed into the library a room where nobody ever went except himself and the queen there he turned the books upside down in his haste till he found an old one by a french gentleman monsieur cyrano de bergerac it was an account of a voyage to the moon in which there is a great deal of information about matters not generally known for few travellers have been to the moon in that book prince prigio fancied he would find something he half remembered and that would be of use to him and he did so you see that cleverness and minding your book have some advantages after all for here the prince learned that there is a very rare beast called a remora which is at least as cold as the firedrake is hot  now thought he if i can only make these two fight why the remora may kill the firedrake or take the heat out of him at least so that i may have a chance  then he seized the ivory glass clapped it to his eye and looked for the remora just the tip of his nose as white as snow and as smooth as ice was sticking out of a chink in a frozen mountain not far from the burning mountain of the firedrake  illustration page 46  hooray said the prince softly to himself and he jumped like mad into the winged shoes of swiftness stuck on the cap of darkness girdled himself with the sword of sharpness and put a good slice of bread with some cold tongue in a wallet which he slung on his back never you fight if you can help it except with plenty of food to keep you going and in good heart then off he flew and soon he reached the volcano of the firedrake  illustration chapter nine     chapter ixthe prince and the firedrake  it was dreadfully hot even high up in the air where the prince hung invisible great burning stones were tossed up by the volcano and nearly hit him several times moreover the steam and smoke and the flames which the firedrake spouted like foam from his nostrils would have daunted even the bravest man the sides of the hill too were covered with the blackened ashes of his victims whom he had roasted when they came out to kill him the gardenengine of poor little alphonso was lying in the valley all broken and useless but the firedrake as happy as a wild duck on a lonely lock was rolling and diving in the liquid flame all redhot and full of frolic hi shouted the prince the firedrake rose to the surface his horns as red as a red crescentmoon only bigger and lashing the fire with his hoofs and his blazing tail  whos there he said in a hoarse angry voice just let me get at you  its me answered the prince it was the first time he had forgotten his grammar but he was terribly excited  what do you want grunted the beast i wish i could see you and horrible to relate he rose on a pair of wide flaming wings and came right at the prince guided by the sound of his voice  now the prince had never heard that firedrakes could fly indeed he had never believed in them at all till the night before for a moment he was numb with terror then he flew down like a stone to the very bottom of the hill and shouted  hi  well grunted the firedrake whats the matter why cant you give a civil answer to a civil question  will you go back to your hole and swear on your honour as a firedrake to listen quietly  on my sacred word of honour said the beast casually scorching an eagle that flew by into ashes the cinders fell jingling and crackling round the prince in a little shower  then the firedrake dived back with an awful splash of flame and the mountain roared round him  the prince now flew high above him and cried  a message from the remora he says you are afraid to fight him  dont know him grunted the firedrake  he sends you his glove said prince prigio as a challenge to mortal combat till death do you part  then he dropped his own glove into the fiery lake  does he yelled the firedrake just let me get at him and he scrambled out all redhot as he was  ill go and tell him youre coming said the prince and with two strides he was over the frozen mountain of the remora  illustration chapter ten     chapter xthe prince and the remora  if he had been too warm before the prince was too cold now the hill of the remora was one solid mass of frozen steel and the cold rushed out of it like the breath of some icy beast which indeed it was all around were things like marble statues of men in armour they were the dead bodies of the knights horses and all who had gone out of old to fight the remora and who had been frosted up by him the prince felt his blood stand still and he grew faint but he took heart for there was no time to waste yet he could nowhere see the remora hi shouted the prince then from a narrow chink at the bottom of the smooth black hilla chink no deeper than that under a door but a mile widestole out a hideous head  it was as fiat as the head of a skatefish it was deathly pale and two chillblue eyes deadcoloured like stones looked out of it  then there came a whisper like the breath of the bitter east wind on a wintry day  where are you and how can i come to you  here i am said the prince from the top of the hill  then the flat white head set itself against the edge of the chink from which it had peeped and slowly like the movement of a sheet of ice it slipped upwards and curled upwards and up and up there seemed no end to it at all and it moved horribly without feet holding on by its own frost to the slippery side of the frozen hill now all the lower part of the black hill was covered with the horrid white thing coiled about it in smooth flat shiny coils and still the head was higher than the rest and still the icy cold came nearer and nearer like death  the prince almost fainted everything seemed to swim and in one moment more he would have fallen stiff on the mountaintop and the white head would have crawled over him and the cold coils would have slipped over him and turned him to stone and still the thing slipped up from the chink under the mountain  but the prince made a great effort he moved and in two steps he was far away down in the valley where it was not so very cold  hi he shouted as soon as his tongue could move within his chattering teeth  there came a clear hissing answer like frozen words dropping round him  wait till i come down what do you want  then the white folds began to slide like melting ice from the black hill  prince prigio felt the air getting warmer behind him and colder in front of him  he looked round and there were the trees beginning to blacken in the heat and the grass looking like a sea of fire along the plains for the firedrake was coming  the prince just took time to shout the firedrake is going to pay you a visit and then he soared to the top of a neighbouring hill and looked on at what followed  illustration chapter eleven     chapter xithe battle  it was an awful sight to behold when the remora heard the name of the firedrake his hated enemy he slipped with wonderful speed from the cleft of the mountain into the valley on and on and on he poured over rock and tree as if a frozen river could slide downhill on and on till there were miles of him stretching along the valleymiles of the smoothribbed icy creature crawling and slipping forwards the green trees dropped their leaves as he advanced the birds fell down dead from the sky slain by his frosty breath but fast as the remora stole forward the firedrake came quicker yet flying and clashing his fiery wings at last they were within striking distance and the firedrake stooping from the air dashed with his burning horns and flaming feet slap into the body of the remora  then there rose a steam so dreadful such a white yet fiery vapour of heat that no one who had not the princes magic glass could have seen what happened with horrible grunts and roars the firedrake tried to burn his way right through the flat body of the remora and to chase him to his cleft in the rock but the remora hissing terribly and visibly melting away in places yet held his ground and the prince could see his cold white folds climbing slowly up the hoofs of the firedrakeup and up till they reached his knees and the great burning beast roared like a hundred bulls with the pain then up the firedrake leaped and hovering on his fiery wings he lighted in the midst of the remoras back and dashed into it with his horns but the flat cruel head writhed backwards and slowly bending over on itself the wounded remora slid greedily to fasten again on the limbs of the firedrake  meanwhile the prince safe on his hill was lunching on the loaf and the cold tongue he had brought with him  go it remora go it firedrake youre gaining give it him remora he shouted in the wildest excitement  nobody had ever seen such a battle he had it all to himself and he never enjoyed anything more he hated the remora so much that he almost wished the firedrake could beat it for the firedrake was the more natural beast of the pair still he was alarmed when he saw that the vast flat body of the remora was now slowly coiling backwards backwards into the cleft below the hill while a thick wet mist showed how cruelly it had suffered but the firedrake too was in an unhappy way for his legs were now cold and black his horns were black also though his body especially near the heart glowed still like redhot iron  go it remora cried the prince his legs are giving way hes groggy on his pins one more effort and he wont be able to move  encouraged by this advice the white slippery remora streamed out of his cavern again more and more of him uncoiling as if the mountain were quite full of him he had lost strength no doubt for the steam and mist went up from him in clouds and the hissing of his angry voice grew fainter but so did the roars of the firedrake presently they sounded more like groans and at last the remora slipped up his legs above the knees and fastened on his very heart of fire then the firedrake stood groaning like a black bull kneedeep in snow and still the remora climbed and climbed  go it now firedrake shouted the prince for he knew that if the remora won it would be too cold for him to draw near the place and cut off the firedrakes head and tail  go it drake hes slackening cried the prince again and the brave firedrake made one last furious effort and rising on his wings dropped just on the spine of his enemy  the wounded remora curled back his head again on himself and again crawled steaming terribly towards his enemy but the struggle was too much for the gallant remora the flat cruel head moved slower the steam from his thousand wounds grew fiercer and he gently breathed his last just as the firedrake too fell over and lay exhausted with one final roar like the breath of a thousand furnaces the firedrake expired  illustration page 58  the prince watching from the hilltop could scarcely believe that these two awful scourges of nature which had so long devastated his country were actually dead but when he had looked on for halfanhour and only a river ran where the remora had been while the body of the firedrake lay stark and cold he hurried to the spot  drawing the sword of sharpness he hacked off at two blows the iron head and the tail of the firedrake they were a weary weight to carry but in a few strides of the shoes of swiftness he was at his castle where he threw down his burden and nearly fainted with excitement and fatigue  but the castle clock struck halfpast seven dinner was at eight and the poor prince crawled on hands and knees to the garret here he put on the wishingcap wished for a pint of champagne a hot bath and his best black velvet and diamond suit in a moment these were provided he bathed dressed drank a glass of wine packed up the head and tail of the firedrake sat down on the flying carpet and knocked at the door of the english ambassador as the clocks were striking eight in gluckstein  punctuality is the politeness of princes and a prince is polite when he is in love  the prince was received at the door by a stout porter and led into the hall where several butlers met him and he laid the mortal remains of the firedrake under the cover of the flying carpet  then he was led upstairs and he made his bow to the pretty lady who of course made him a magnificent courtesy she seemed prettier and kinder than ever the prince was so happy that he never noticed how something went wrong about the dinner the ambassador looked about and seemed to miss someone and spoke in a low voice to one of the servants who answered also in a low voice and what he said seemed to displease the ambassador but the prince was so busy in talking to his lady and in eating his dinner too that he never observed anything unusual he had never been at such a pleasant dinner  illustration chapter twelve     chapter xiia terrible misfortune  when the ladies left and the prince and the other gentlemen were alone the ambassador appeared more gloomy than ever at last he took the prince into a corner on pretence of showing him a rare statue does your royal highness not know he asked that you are in considerable danger still said the prince thinking of the firedrake  the ambassador did not know what he meant for he had never heard of the fight but he answered gravely never more than now then he showed the prince two proclamations which had been posted all about the town here is the first       to  all  loyal  subjects       whereas       our eldest son prince prigio hath of late been guilty of      several high crimes and misdemeanours       first by abandoning the post of danger against the      firedrake whereby our beloved sons prince alphonso and      prince enrico have perished and been overdone by that      monster       secondly by attending an unseemly revel in the town of      gluckstein where he brawled in the streets       thirdly by trying to seduce away the hearts of our loyal      subjects in that city and to blow up a party against our      crown and our peace       illustration page 61       this is to give warning       that whoever consorts with comforts aids or abets the      said prince prigio is thereby a partner in his treason and      that a reward of five thousand purses will be given to      whomsoever brings the said prince alive to our castle of      falkenstein       grognio r   and here is the second proclamation       reward the firedrake whereas       our dominions have lately been devastated by a firedrake      the salamander furiosus of buffon       this is to advise all       that whosoever brings the horns and tail of the said      firedrake to our castle of falkenstein shall receive five      thousand purses the position of crown prince with the      usual perquisites and the hand of the kings niece the      lady molinda       grognio r   hm said the prince i did not think his majesty wrote so well and he would have liked to say dont you think we might join the ladies  but sir said the ambassador the streets are lined with soldiers and i know not how you have escaped them here under my roof you are safe for the moment but a prolonged stayexcuse my inhospitalitycould not but strain the harmonious relations which prevail between the government of pantouflia and that which i have the honour to represent  we dont want to fight and no more i think do you said the prince smiling  then how does your royal highness mean to treat the proclamations  why by winning these ten thousand purses i can tell you £1000000 is worth having said the prince i ll deliver up the said prince alive at falkenstein this very night also the horns and tail of the said firedrake but i dont want to marry my cousin molly  may i remind your royal highness that falkenstein is three hundred miles away moreover my head butler benson disappeared from the house before dinner and i fear he went to warn captain kopzoffski that you are here  that is nothing said the prince but my dear lord kelso may i not have the pleasure of presenting lady rosalind with a little gift a philippine which i lost to her last night merely the head and tail of a firedrake which i stalked this morning  the ambassador was so astonished that he ran straight upstairs forgetting his manners and crying  linda linda come down at once heres a surprise for you  lady rosalind came sweeping down with a smile on her kind face she guessed what it was though the prince had said nothing about it at dinner  lead the way your royal highness cried the ambassador and the prince offering lady rosalind his arm went out into the hall where he saw neither his carpet nor the horns and tail of the firedrake  he turned quite pale and said  will you kindly ask the servants where the little persian prayerrug and the parcel which i brought with me have been placed  lord kelso rang the bell and in came all the servants with william the underbutler at their head  william said his lordship where have you put his royal highnesss parcel and his carpet  please your lordship said william we think benson have took them away with him  and where is benson  we dont know your lordship we think he have been come for  come forby whom  william stammered and seemed at a loss for a reply  quick answer what do you know about it  william said at last rather as if he were making a speech  your royaliness and my lords and ladies it was like this his royaliness comed in with a rug over his arm and summat under it and he lays it down on that there seat and thomas shows him into the droringroom then benson says dinnerll be ready in five minutes how tired i do feel then he takes the libbuty of sitting hisself down on his royalinesss rug and he says asking your pardon i ve had about enough of service here i m about tired and i thinks of bettering myself i wish i was at the kings court and butler  illustration page 65  but before the words was out of his mouth off he flies like a shot through the open door and his royalinesss parcel with him i run to the door and there he was flying right hover the town in a northerly direction and thats all i know for i would not tell a lie not if it was hever so and me and thomasas didnt see itand cook we thinks as how benson was come for and cook says as she dont wonder at it neither for a grumblinger more illconditioneder  thank you william said lord kelso that will do you can go for the present  illustration chapter thirteen     chapter xiiisurprises  the prince said nothing the ambassador said nothing lady rosalind said never a word till they were in the drawingroom it was a lovely warm evening and the french windows were wide open on the balcony which looked over the town and away north to the hills below them flowed the clear green water of the gluckthal and still nobody said a word at last the prince spoke this is a very strange story lord kelso  very sir said the ambassador but true added the prince at least there is no reason in the nature of things why it shouldnt be true  i can hardly believe sir that the conduct of benson whom i always found a most respectable man deserved  that he should be come for said the prince oh no it was a mere accident and might have happened to any of us who chanced to sit down on my carpet  and then the prince told them shortly all about it how the carpet was one of a number of fairy properties which had been given him at his christening and how so long a time had gone by before he discovered them and how probably the carpet had carried the butler where he had said he wanted to gonamely to the kings court at falkenstein  it would not matter so much added the prince only i had relied on making my peace with his majesty my father by aid of those horns and that tail he was set on getting them and if the lady rosalind had not expressed a wish for them they would today have been in his possession  oh sir you honour us too highly murmured lady rosalind and the prince blushed and said  not at all impossible  then of course the ambassador became quite certain that his daughter was admired by the crown prince who was on bad terms with the king of the country and a more uncomfortable position for an ambassadorhowever they are used to them  what on earth am i to do with the young man he thought he cant stay here for ever and without his carpet he cant get away for the soldiers have orders to seize him as soon as he appears in the street and in the meantime benson will be pretending that he killed the firedrakefor he must have got to falkenstein by nowand they will be for marrying him to the kings niece and making my butler crown prince to the kingdom of pantouflia it is dreadful  now all this time the prince was on the balcony telling lady rosalind all about how he got the firedrake done for in the most modest way for as he said i didnt kill him and it is really the remora poor fellow who should marry molly but he s dead  at this very moment there was a whizz in the air something shot past them and through the open window the king the queen benson and the mortal remains of the firedrake were shot into the ambassadors drawing room  illustration page 69  illustration chapter fourteen     chapter xivthe king explains  the first who recovered his voice and presence of mind was benson  did your lordship ring for coffee he asked quietly and when he was told yes he bowed and withdrew with majestic composure when he had gone the prince threw himself at the kings feet crying  pardon pardon my liege dont speak to me sir answered the king very angrily and the poor prince threw himself at the feet of the queen  but she took no notice of him whatever no more than if he had been a fairy and the prince heard her murmur as she pinched her royal arms  i shall waken presently this is nothing out of the way for a dream dr rumpfino ascribes it to imperfect nutrition  all this time the lady rosalind as pale as a marble statue was leaning against the side of the open window the prince thought he could do nothing wiser than go and comfort her so he induced her to sit down on a chair in the balconyfor he felt that he was not wanted in the drawingroomand soon they were talking happily about the stars which had begun to appear in the summer night  meanwhile the ambassador had induced the king to take a seat but there was no use in talking to the queen  it would be a miracle she said to herself and miracles do not happen therefore this has not happened presently i shall wake up in my own bed at falkenstein  now benson william and thomas brought in the coffee but the queen took no notice when they went away the rest of the company slipped off quietly and the king was left alone with the ambassador for the queen could hardly be said to count  you want to know all about it i suppose said his majesty in a sulky voice well you have a right to it and i shall tell you we were just sitting down to dinner at falkenstein rather latehours get later every year i thinkwhen i heard a row in the premises and the captain of the guard colonel mcdougal came and told us that a man had arrived with the horns and tail of the firedrake and was claiming the reward her majesty and i rose and went into the outer court where we found sitting on that carpet with a glass of beer in his hand a respectablelooking upper servant whom i recognised as your butler he informed us that he had just killed the beast and showed us the horns and tail sure enough there they are the tail is like the iron handle of a pump but the horns are genuine a pair were thrown up by a volcano in my greatgrandfathers time giglio i excellent coffee this of yours        the history of this prince may be read in a treatise      called the rose and the ring by m a titmarsh      london 1855  illustration page 72  the ambassador bowed  well we asked him where he killed the firedrake and he said in a garden near gluckstein then he began to speak about the reward and the perkisits as he called them which it seems he had read about in my proclamation rather a neat thing drew it up myself added his majesty  very much to the point said the ambassador wondering what the king was coming to  glad you like it said the king much pleased well where was i oh yes your man said he had killed the creature in a garden quite near gluckstein i didnt much like the whole affair he is an alien you see and then there was my niece molindapoor girl she was certain to give trouble her heart is buried if i may say so with poor alphonso but the queen is a very remarkable womanvery remarkable  very said the ambassador with perfect truth  caitiff she cries to your butler his majesty went on perjured knave thou liest in thy throat gluckstein is a hundred leagues from here and how say est thou that thou slewest the molester and earnest hither in a few hours space this had not occurred to mei am a plain king but i at once saw the force of her majestys argument yes said i how did you manage it but heyour man i meanwas not a bit put out why your majesty says he i just sat down on that there bit of carpet wished i was here and here i ham and i d be glad having had the troubleand my time not being my ownto see the colour of them perkisits according to the proclamation on this her majesty grew more indignant if possible nonsense she cried a story out of the arabian nights is not suited for a modern public and fails to win æsthetic credence these were her very words  her majestys expressions are ever choice and appropriate said the ambassador  sit down there on the carpet knave she went on ourself and consortmeaning mewill take our places by thy side and i shall wish us in gluckstein at thy masters when the experiment has failed thy head shall from thy shoulders be shorn so your man merely said very well mumyour majesty i mean and sat down the queen took her place at the edge of the carpet i sat between her and the butler and she said i wish i were in gluckstein then we rose flew through the air at an astonishing pace and here we are so i suppose the rest of the butlers tale is true which i regret but a kings word is sacred and he shall take the place of that sneak prigio but as we left home before dinner and yours is over may i request your lordship to believe that i should be delighted to take something cold  the ambassador at once ordered a sumptuous collation to which the king did full justice and his majesty was shown to the royal chamber as he complained of fatigue the queen accompanied him remarking that she was sound asleep but would waken presently neither of them said goodnight to the prince indeed they did not see him again for he was on the balcony with lady rosalind they found a great deal to say to each other and at last the prince asked her to be his wife and she said that if the king and her father gave their permissionwhy then she would after this she went to bed and the prince who had not slept at all the night before felt very sleepy also but he knew that first he had something that must be done so he went into the drawingroom took his carpet and wished to benow where do you suppose beside the dead body of the firedrake there he was in a moment and dreadful the body looked lying stark and cold in the white moonshine then the prince cut off its four hoofs put them in his wallet and with these he flew back in a second and met the ambassador just as he came from ushering the king to bed then the prince was shown his own room where he locked up the hoofs the carpet the cap of darkness and his other things in an iron box and so he went to bed and dreamed of his lady rosalind  illustration chapter fifteen     chapter xvthe kings cheque  when they all awakened next morning their first ideas were confused it is often confusing to wake in a strange bed much more so when you have flown through the air like the king the queen and benson the butler for her part the queen was the most perplexed of all for she did undeniably wake and yet she was not at home where she had expected to be however she was a determined woman and stood to it that nothing unusual was occurring the butler made up his mind to claim the crown princeship and the hand of the lady molinda because as he justly remarked to william here was such a chance to better himself as might not soon come in his way again as for the king he was only anxious to get back to falkenstein and have the whole business settled in a constitutional manner the ambassador was not sorry to get rid of the royal party and it was proposed that they should all sit down on the flying carpet and wish themselves at home again but the queen would not hear of it she said it was childish and impossible so the carriage was got ready for her and she started without saying a word of goodbye to anyone the king benson and the prince were not so particular and they simply flew back to falkenstein in the usual way arriving there at 1135a week before her majesty  the king at once held a court the horns and tail of the monster were exhibited amidst general interest and benson and the prince were invited to state their claims  bensons evidence was taken first he declined to say exactly where or how he killed the firedrake there might be more of them left he remarkedyoung ones that would take a lot of killingand he refused to part with his secret only he claimed the reward which was offered if you remember not to the man who killed the beast but to him wha brought its horns and tail this was allowed by the lawyers present to be very sound law and benson was cheered by the courtiers who decidedly preferred him to prigio and who besides thought he was going to be crown prince as for lady molinda she was torn by the most painful feelings for much as she hated prigio she could not bear the idea of marrying benson yet one or the other choice seemed certain  unhappy lady perhaps no girl was ever more strangely beset by misfortune  prince prigio was now called on to speak  he admitted that the reward was offered for bringing the horns and tail not for killing the monster but were the kings intentions to go for nothing when a subject only meant well of course he had to suffer but when a king said one thing was he not to be supposed to have meant another any fellow with a waggon could bring the horns and tail the difficult thing was to kill the monster if bensons claim was allowed the royal prerogative of saying one thing and meaning something else was in danger  on hearing this argument the king so far forgot himself as to cry bravo well said and to clap his hands whereon all the courtiers shouted and threw up their hats  the prince then said that whoever had killed the monster could of course tell where to find him and could bring his hoofs he was ready to do this himself was mr benson equally ready on this being interpreted to himfor he did not speak pantouflianbenson grew pale with horror but fell back on the proclamation he had brought the horns and tail and so he must have the perquisites and the lady molinda  the kings mind was so much confused by this time that he determined to leave it to the lady molinda herself  which of them will you have my dear he asked in a kind voice  but poor molinda merely cried then his majesty was almost driven to say that he would give the reward to whoever produced the hoofs by that day week but no sooner had he said this than the prince brought them out of his wallet and displayed them in open court this ended the case and benson after being entertained with sherry and sandwiches in the stewards room was sent back to his master and i regret to say that his temper was not at all improved by his failure to better himself on the contrary he was unusually cross and disagreeable for several days but we must perhaps make some allowance for his disappointment  but if benson was irritated and suffered from the remarks of his fellowservants i do not think we can envy prince prigio here he was restored to his position indeed but by no means to the royal favour for the king disliked him as much as ever and was as angry as ever about the deaths of enrico and alphonso nay he was even more angry and perhaps not without reason he called up prigio before the whole court and thereon the courtiers cheered like anything but the king cried  silence mcdougal drag the first man that shouts to the serpenthouse in the zoological gardens and lock him up with the rattlesnakes  after that the courtiers were very quiet  prince said the king as prigio bowed before the throne you are restored to your position because i cannot break my promise but your base and malevolent nature is even more conspicuously manifest in your selfish success than in your previous dastardly contempt of duty why confound you cried the king dropping the high style in which he had been speaking and becoming the father not the monarchwhy if you could kill the firedrake did you let your poor little brothers go and be bbbbroiled eh what do you say you sneak you didnt believe there were any firedrakes that just comes of your eternal conceit and arrogance if you were clever enough to kill the creatureand i admit thatyou were clever enough to know that what everybody said must be true you have not generally found it so well you have this time and let it be a lesson to you not that there is much comfort in that for it is not likely you will ever have such another chanceexactly the idea that had occurred to benson  here the king wept among the tears of the lord chief justice the poet laureate who had been awfully frightened when he heard of the rattlesnakes the maids of honour the chaplain royal and everyone but colonel mcdougal a scottish soldier of fortune who maintained a military reserve  when his majesty had recovered he said to prigio who had not been crying he was too much absorbed  a kings word is his bond bring me a pen somebody and my chequebook  the royal chequebook bound in red morocco was brought in by eight pages with ink and a pen his majesty then filled up and signed the following satisfactory documentah my children how i wish mr arrowsmith would do as much for me  illustration the kings cheque  there said his majesty crossing his cheque and throwing sand over it for blottingpaper had not yet been invented there take that and be off with you  prince prigio was respectfully but rapidly obeying his royal command for he thought he had better cash the royal cheque as soon as possible when his majesty yelled  hi here come back i forgot something youve got to marry molinda  illustration chapter sixteen     chapter xvia melancholy chapter  the prince had gone some way when the king called after him how he wished he had the sevenleague boots on or that he had the cap of darkness in his pocket if he had been so lucky he would now have got back to gluckstein and crossed the border with lady rosalind a million of money may not seem much but a pair of young people who really love each other could live happily on less than the cheque he had in his pocket however the king shouted very loud as he always did when he meant to be obeyed and the prince sauntered slowly back again  prigio said his majesty where were you off to dont you remember that this is your weddingday my proclamation offered not only the money which you have but the hand of the lady molinda which the court chaplain will presently make your own i congratulate you sir molinda is a dear girl  i have the highest affection and esteem for my cousin sir said the prince but  ill never marry him cried poor molinda kneeling at the throne where her streaming eyes and hair made a pretty and touching picture never i despise him  illustration page 84  i was about to say sir the prince went on that i cannot possibly have the pleasure of wedding my cousin  the family gibbet i presume is in good working order asked the king of the family executioner a tall gaunt man in black and scarlet who was only employed in the case of members of the blood royal  never better sire said the man bowing with more courtliness than his profession indicated  very well said the king prince prigio you have your choice there is the gallows here is lady molinda my duty is painful but clear a kings word cannot be broken molly or the gibbet  the prince bowed respectfully to lady molinda  madam my cousin said he your clemency will excuse my answer and you will not misinterpret the apparent discourtesy of my conduct i am compelled most unwillingly to slight your charms and to select the extreme rigour of the law executioner lead on do your duty for me prigio est prêtfor this was his motto and meant that he was ready  illustration page 85  poor lady molinda could not but be hurt by the princes preference for death over marriage to her little as she liked him  is life then so worthless and is molinda so terrible a person that you prefer those arms and she pointed to the gibbet to thesehere she held out her own which were very white round and pretty for molinda was a goodhearted girl she could not bear to see prigio put to death and then perhaps she reflected that there are worse positions than the queenship of pantouflia for alphonso was gonecrying would not bring him back  ah madam said the prince you are forgiving  for you are brave said molinda feeling quite a respect for him  but neither your heart nor mine is ours to give since mine was anothers i understand too well the feeling of yours do not let us buy life at the price of happiness and honour  then turning to the king the prince said  sir is there no way but by death or marriage you say you cannot keep half only of your promise and that if i accept the reward i must also unite myself with my unwilling cousin cannot the whole proclamation be annulled and will you consider the bargain void if i tear up this flimsy scroll  and here the prince fluttered the cheque for £1000000 in the air  for a moment the king was tempted but then he said to himself  never mind its only an extra penny on the incometax then keep your dross he shouted meaning the million but let me keep my promise to chapel at once or and he pointed to the executioner the word of a king of pantouflia is sacred  and so is that of a crown prince answered prigio and mine is pledged to a lady  she shall be a mourning bride cried the king savagely unlesshere he paused for a momentunless you bring me back alphohso and enrico safe and well  the prince thought for the space of a flash of lightning  i accept the alternative he said if your majesty will grant me my conditions  name them said the king  let me be transported to gluckstein left there unguarded and if in three days i do not return with my brothers safe and well your majesty shall be spared a cruel duty prigio of pantouflia will perish by his own hand  the king whose mind did not work very quickly took some minutes to think over it then he saw that by granting the princes conditions he would either recover his dear sons or at least get rid of prigio without the unpleasantness of having him executed for though some kings have put their eldest sons to death and most have wished to do so they have never been better loved by the people for their roman virtue  honour bright said the king at last  honour bright answered the prince and for the first time in many months the royal father and son shook hands  for you madam said prigio in a stately way to lady molinda in less than a week i trust we shall be taking our vows at the same altar and that the close of the ceremony which finds us cousins will leave us brother and sister  poor molinda merely stared for she could not imagine what he meant in a moment he was gone and having taken by the kings permission the flying carpet he was back at the ambassadors house in gluckstein  illustration chapter seventeen     chapter xviithe black cat and the brethren  who was glad to see the prince if it was not lady rosalind the white roses of her cheeks turned to red roses in a moment and then back to white again they were so alarmed at the change so the two went into the gardens together and talked about a number of things but at last the prince told her that before three days were over all would be well or all would be over with him for either he would have brought his brothers back sound and well to falkenstein or he would not survive his dishonour  it is no more than right he said for had i gone first neither of them would have been sent to meet the monster after i had fallen and i should have fallen dear rosalind if i had faced the firedrake before i knew you  then when she asked him why and what good she had done him he told her all the story and how before he fell in love with her he didnt believe in fairies or firedrakes or caps of darkness or anything nice and impossible but only in horrid useless facts and chemistry and geology and arithmetic and mathematics and even political economy and the firedrake would have made a mouthful of him then  so she was delighted when she heard this almost as much delighted as she was afraid that he might fail in the most difficult adventure for it was one thing to egg on a remora to kill a firedrake and quite another to find the princes if they were alive and restore them if they were dead  but the prince said he had his plan and he stayed that night at the ambassadors next morning he rose very early before anyone else was up that he might not have to say goodbye to lady rosalind then he flew in a moment to the old lonely castle where nobody went for fear of ghosts ever since the court retired to falkenstein  how still it was how deserted not a sign of life and yet the prince was looking everywhere for some living thing he hunted the castle through in vain and then went out to the stableyard but all the dogs of course had been taken away and the farmers had offered homes to the poultry at last stretched at full length in a sunny place the prince found a very old halfblind miserable cat the poor creature was lean and its fur had fallen off in patches it could no longer catch birds nor even mice and there was nobody to give it milk but cats do not look far into the future and this old black catfrank was his namehad got a breakfast somehow and was happy in the sun the prince stood and looked at him pityingly and he thought that even a sick old cat was in some ways happier than most men  illustration page 91  well said the prince at last he could not live long anyway and it must be done he will feel nothing  then he drew the sword of sharpness and with one turn of his wrist cut the cats head clean off  it did not at once change into a beautiful young lady as perhaps you expect no that was improbable and as the prince was in love already would have been vastly inconvenient the dead cat lay there like any common cat  then the prince built up a heap of straw with wood on it and there he laid poor puss and set fire to the pile very soon there was nothing of old black frank left but ashes  then the prince ran upstairs to the fairy cupboard his heart beating loudly with excitement the sun was shining through the arrowshot window all the yellow motes were dancing in its rays the light fell on the strange heaps of fairy thingstalismans and spells the prince hunted about here and there and at last he discovered six ancient watervessels of black leather each with a silver plate on it and on the plate letters engraved this was what was written on the plates  aqva de fonte leonvm        water from the fountain of lions  thank heaven said the prince i thought they were sure to have brought it  then he took one of the old blackleather bottles and ran downstairs again to the place where he had burned the body of the poor old sick cat  illustration page 93  he opened the bottle and poured a few drops of the water on the ashes and the dying embers  up there sprang a tall white flame of fire waving like a tongue of light and forth from the heap jumped the most beautiful strong funny black cat that ever was seen  it was frank as he had been in the vigour of his youth and he knew the prince at once and rubbed himself against him and purred  the prince lifted up frank and kissed his nose for joy and a bright tear rolled down on franks face and made him rub his nose with his paw in the most comical manner  then the prince set him down and he ran round and round after his tail and lastly cocked his tail up and marched proudly after the prince into the castle  oh frank said prince prigio no cat since the time of puss in boots was ever so well taken care of as you shall be for if the fairy water from the fountain of lions can bring you back to lifewhy there is a chance for alphonso and enrico  then prigio bustled about got ready some cold luncheon from the storeroom took all his fairy things that he was likely to need sat down with them on the flying carpet and wished himself at the mountain of the firedrake  i have the king now he said for if i cant find the ashes of my brothers by jove ill  do you know what he meant to do if he could not find his brothers let every childguess  off he flew and there he was in a second just beside poor alphonsos gardenengine then prigio seeing a little heap of grey ashes beside the engine watered them with the fairy water and up jumped alphonso as jolly as ever his sword in his hand  hullo prigio cried he are you come after the monster too ive been asleep and i had a kind of dream that he beat me but the pair of us will tackle him how is molinda  prettier than ever said prigio but anxious about you however the firedrakes dead and done for so never mind him but i left enrico somewhere about just you sit down and wait a minute till i fetch him  the prince said this because he did not wish alphonso to know that he and enrico had not had quite the best of it in the affair with the monster  all right old fellow says alphonso but have you any luncheon with you never was so hungry in my life  prince prigio had thought of this and he brought out some cold sausage to which alphonso was partial and some bread with which the younger prince expressed himself satisfied then prigio went up the hill some way first warning alphonso not to sit on his carpet for fear of accidents like that which happened to benson in a hollow of the hill sure enough there was the sword of enrico the diamonds of the hilt gleaming in the sun and there was a little heap of grey ashes  the prince poured a few drops of the water from the fountain of lions on them and up of course jumped enrico just as alphonso had done  sleepy old chap you are enrico said the prince but come on alphonso will have finished the grub unless we look smart  so back they came in time to get their share of what was going and they drank the remoras very good health when prigio told them about the fight but neither of them ever knew that they had been dead and done for because prigio invented a story that the mountain was enchanted and that as long as the firedrake lived everyone who came there fell asleep he did tell them about the flying carpet however which of course did not much surprise them because they had read all about it in the arabian nights and other historical works  and now i ll show you fun said prigio and he asked them both to take their seats on the carpet and wished to be in the valley of the remora  there they were in a moment among the old knights whom if you remember the remora had frozen into stone there was quite a troop of them in all sorts of armourgreek and roman and knight templars like front de bouf and brian du bois gilbertall the brave warriors that had tried to fight the remora since the world began  then prigio gave each of his brothers some of the water in their caps and told them to go round pouring a drop or two on each frozen knight and as they did it lo and behold each knight came alive with his horse and lifted his sword and shoute  long live prince prigio in greek latin egyptian french german and spanishall of which the prince perfectly understood and spoke like a native  so he marshalled them in order and sent them off to ride to falkenstein and cry  prince prigio is coming  illustration page 97  off they went the horses hoofs clattering banners flying sunshine glittering on the spearpoints off they rode to falkenstein and when the king saw them come galloping in i can tell you he had no more notion of hanging prigio  illustration chapter eighteen     chapter xviiithe very last  the princes returned to gluckstein on the carpet and went to the best inn where they dined together and slept next morning they and the ambassador who had been told all the story and lady rosalind floated comfortably on the carpet back to falkenstein where the king wept like anything on the shoulders of alphonso and enrico they could not make out why he cried so nor why lady molinda and lady kathleena cried but soon they were all laughing and happy again but thenwould you believe he could be so meanhe refused to keep his royal promise and restore prigio to his crownprinceship kings are like that  but prigio very quietly asking for the head of the firedrake said hed pour the magic water on that and bring the firedrake back to life again unless his majesty behaved rightly this threat properly frightened king grognio and he apologised then the king shook hands with prigio in public and thanked him and said he was proud of him as to lady rosalind the old gentleman quite fell in love with her and he sent at once to the chaplain royal to get into his surplice and marry all the young people off at once without waiting for weddingcakes and milliners and all the rest of it  illustration page 100  now just as they were forming a procession to march into church who should appear but the queen her majesty had been travelling by post all the time and luckily had heard of none of the doings since prigio benson and the king left gluckstein i say luckily because if she had heard of them she would not have believed a word of them but when she saw alphonso and enrico she was much pleased and said  naughty boys where have you been hiding the king had some absurd story about your having been killed by a fabulous monster bah dont tell me i always said you would come back after a little tripdidnt i prigio  certainly madam said prigio and i said so too didnt i say so and all the courtiers cried yes you did but some added to themselves he always says didnt i say so  then the queen was introduced to lady rosalind and she said it was rather a short engagement but she supposed young people understood their own affairs best and they do so the three pairs were married with the utmost rejoicings and her majesty never her whole life long could be got to believe that anything unusual had occurred  the honeymoon of prince prigio and the crown princess rosalind was passed at the castle where the prince had been deserted by the court but now it was delightfully fitted up and master frank marched about the house with his tail in the air as if the place belonged to him  now on the second day of their honeymoon the prince and princess were sitting in the garden together and the prince said are you quite happy my dear and rosalind said yes quite  but the prince did not like the tone of her voice and he said  no theres something do tell me what it is  well said rosalind putting her head on his shoulder and speaking very low i want everybody to love you as much as i do no not quite so very muchbut i want them to like you now they cant because they are afraid of you for you are so awfully clever now couldnt you take the wishing cap and wish to be no cleverer than other people then everybody would like you  the prince thought a minute then he said  your will is law my dear anything to please you just wait a minute  then he ran upstairs for the last time to the fairy garret and he put on the wishing cap  no thought he to himself i wont wish that every man has one secret from his wife and this shall be mine  then he said aloud i wish to seem no cleverer than other people  then he ran downstairs again and the princess noticed a great difference in him though of course there was really none at all and so did everyone for the prince remained as clever as ever he had been but as nobody observed it he became the most popular prince and finally the bestbeloved king who had ever sat on the throne of pantouflia  but occasionally rosalind would say i do believe my dear that you are really as clever as ever  and he was  illustration page 103
