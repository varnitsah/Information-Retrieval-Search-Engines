from out the full surcharge of a days experience sleep does slowly draw the harvest the spent action to itself leaves me unburdened to begin again at night i say when i am gone in sleep does my slow heart rebel do my dead hands complain of what the day has had them do  never let it be said i was poltroon at this my task of living this my dream this me which rises from the dark of sleep in white flesh robed to drape another dream as lightning comes all white and trembling from out the cloud of sleep looks round about one moment sees and swift its dream is over in one rich drip it sinks to another sleep and sleep thereby is one more dream enrichened  if so the vast the god the sleep that still grows      richer have said that i this mote in the body of sleep must in my transiency pass

eternal sleep within the immense and toilsome lifetime      heaved with ache of dreams that body forth the sleep  shall i less than the least red grain of flesh within my body cry out to the dreaming

in love with me   the sea  you you are all unloving loveless you restless and lonely shaken by your own moods you are celibate and single scorning a comrade even threshing your own passions with no woman for    the threshingfloor finishing your dreams for your own sake only playing your great game around the world alone without playmate or helpmate having no one to    cherish no one to comfort and refusing any comforter  not like the earth the spouse all full of increase moiled over with the rearing of her manymouthed    young you are single you are fruitless phosphorescent    cold and callous naked of worship of love or of adornment scorning the panacea even of labour sworn to a high and splendid purposelessness of brooding and delighting in the secret of lifes    goings sea only you are free sophisticated  you who toil not you who spin not surely but for you and your like toiling were not worth while nor spinning worth the    effort  you who take the moon as in a sieve and sift her flake by flake and spread her meaning out you who roll the stars like jewels in your palm so that they seem to utter themselves aloud you who steep from out the days their colour reveal the universal tint that dyes their web who shadow the suns great gestures    and expressions so that he seems a stranger in his passing who voice the dumb night fittingly sea you shadow of all things now mock us to    death with your shadowing    bournemouth   hymn to priapus  my love lies underground with her face upturned to mine and her mouth unclosed in a last long kiss that ended her life and mine  i dance at the christmas party under the mistletoe along with a ripe slack country lass jostling to and fro  the big soft country lass like a loose sheaf of wheat slipped through my arms on the threshing floor at my feet  the warm soft country lass sweet as an armful of wheat at threshingtime broken was broken for me and ah it was sweet  now i am going home fulfilled and alone i see the great orion standing looking down  hes the star of my first beloved lovemaking the witness of all that bittersweet heartaching  now he sees this as well this last commission nor do i get any look of admonition  he can add the reckoning up i suppose between now and then having walked himself in the thorny difficult ways of men  he has done as i have done no doubt remembered and forgotten turn and about  my love lies underground with her face upturned to mine and her mouth unclosed in the last long kiss that ended her life and mine  she fares in the stark immortal fields of death i in these goodly frozen fields beneath  something in me remembers and will not forget the stream of my life in the darkness deathward set  and something in me has forgotten has ceased to care desire comes up and contentment is debonair  i who am worn and careful how much do i care how is it i grin then and chuckle over despair  grief grief i suppose and sufficient grief makes us free to be faithless and faithful together as we have to be   ballad of a wilful woman              first part  upon her plodding palfrey with a heavy child at her breast and joseph holding the bridle they mount to the last hillcrest  dissatisfied and weary she sees the blade of the sea dividing earth and heaven in a glitter of ecstasy  sudden a darkfaced stranger with his back to the sun holds out his arms so she lights from her palfrey and turns her round about  she has given the child to joseph gone down to the flashing shore and joseph shading his eyes with his hand stands watching evermore              second part  the sea in the stones is singing a woman binds her hair with yellow frail seapoppies that shine as her fingers stir  while a naked man comes swiftly like a spurt of white foam rent from the crest of a falling breaker over the poppies sent  he puts his surfwet fingers over her startled eyes and asks if she sees the land the land the land of her glad surmise              third part  again in her blue blue mantle riding at josephs side she says i went to cythera and woe betide  her heart is a swinging cradle that holds the perfect child but the shade on her forehead ill becomes a mother mild  so on with the slow mean journey in the pride of humility till they halt at a cliff on the edge of the land over a sullen sea  while joseph pitches the sleeptent she goes far down to the shore to where a man in a heaving boat waits with a lifted oar              fourth part  they dwelt in a huge hoarse seacave and looked far down the dark where an archway torn and glittering shone like a huge seaspark  he said do you see the spirits crowding the bright doorway he said do you hear them whispering he said do you catch what they say              fifth part  then joseph grey with waiting his dark eyes full of pain heard i have been to patmos give me the child again  now on with the hopeless journey looking bleak ahead she rode and the man and the child of no more account than the earth the palfrey trode  till a beggar spoke to joseph but looked into her eyes so she turned and said to her husband i give whoever denies              sixth part  she gave on the open heather beneath bare judgment stars and she dreamed of her children and joseph and the isles and her men and her scars  and she woke to distil the berries the beggar had gathered at night whence he drew the curious liquors he held in delight  he gave her no crown of flowers no child and no palfrey slow only led her through harsh hard places where strange winds blow  she follows his restless wanderings till night when by the fires red stain her face is bent in the bitter steam that comes from the flowers of pain  then merciless and ruthless he takes the flamewild drops to the town and tries to sell them with the marketcrops  so she follows the cruel journey that ends not anywhere and dreams as she stirs the mixingpot she is brewing hope from despair    trier   first morning  the night was a failure   but why not  in the darkness    with the pale dawn seething at the window    through the black frame    i could not be free    not free myself from the past those others    and our love was a confusion    there was a horror    you recoiled away from me  now in the morning as we sit in the sunshine on the seat by the little      shrine and look at the mountainwalls walls of blue shadow and see so near at our feet in the meadow myriads of dandelion pappus bubbles ravelled in the dark green grass held still beneath the sunshine  it is enough you are near the mountains are balanced the dandelion seeds stay halfsubmerged in the      grass you and i together we hold them proud and blithe on our love they stand upright on our love everything starts from us we are the source    beuerberg   and oh   that the man i am   might cease to be  no now i wish the sunshine would stop and the white shining houses and the gay red     flowers on the balconies and the bluish mountains beyond would be crushed     out between two valves of darkness the darkness falling the darkness rising with     muffled sound obliterating everything  i wish that whatever props up the walls of light would fall and darkness would come hurling     heavily down and it would be thick black dark for ever not sleep which is grey with dreams nor death which quivers with birth but heavy sealing darkness silence all immovable  what is sleep it goes over me like a shadow over a hill but it does not alter me nor help me and death would ache still i am sure it would be lambent uneasy i wish it would be completely dark everywhere inside me and out heavily dark utterly    wolfratshausen   she looks back  the pale bubbles the lovely palegold bubbles of the globeflowers in a great swarm clotted and single went rolling in the dusk towards the river to where the sunset hung its wan gold cloths and you stood alone watching them go and that motherlove like a demon drew you    from me towards england  along the road after nightfall along the glamorous birchtree avenue across the river levels we went in silence and you staring to england  so then there shone within the jungle darkness of the long lush undergrass a glowworms    sudden green lantern of pure light a little intense fusing    triumph white and haloed with firemist down in the    tangled darkness  then you put your hand in mine again kissed me    and we struggled to be together and the little electric flashes went with us in the    grass tiny lighthouses little souls of lanterns courage    burst into an explosion of green light everywhere down in the grass where darkness was    ravelled in darkness  still the kiss was a touch of bitterness on my mouth like salt burning in and my hand withered in your hand for you were straining with a wild heart back    back again back to those children you had left behind to all    the Ã¦ons of the past and i was here in the underdusk of the isar  at home we leaned in the bedroom window of the old bavarian gasthaus and the frogs in the pool beyond thrilled with    exuberance like a boiling pot the pond crackled with happiness like a rattle a child spins round for joy the night    rattled with the extravagance of the frogs and you leaned your cheek on mine and i suffered it wanting to sympathise  at last as you stood your white gown falling from    your breasts you looked into my eyes and said but this is    joy i acquiesced again but the shadow of lying was in your eyes the mother in you fierce as a murderess glaring    to england yearning towards england towards your young    children insisting upon your motherhood devastating  still the joy was there also you spoke truly the joy was not to be driven off so easily stronger than fear or destructive motherlove it    stood flickering the frogs helped also whirring away yet how i have learned to know that look in your    eyes of horrid sorrow how i know that glitter of salt dry sterile    sharp corrosive salt not tears but white sharp brine making hideous your eyes  i have seen it felt it in my mouth my throat my    chest my belly burning of powerful salt burning eating through    my defenceless nakedness i have been thrust into white sharp crystals writhing twisting superpenetrated  ah lots wife lots wife the pillar of salt the whirling horrible column    of salt like a waterspout that has enveloped me snow of salt white burning eating salt in which i have writhed  lots wifenot wife but mother i have learned to curse your motherhood you pillar of salt accursed i have cursed motherhood because of you accursed base motherhood  i long for the time to come when the curse against    you will have gone out of my heart but it has not gone yet nevertheless once the frogs the globeflowers of    bavaria the glowworms gave me sweet lymph against the saltburns there is a kindness in the very rain  therefore even in the hour of my deepest pas    sionate malediction i try to remember it is also well between us that you are with me in the end that you never look quite back ninetenths ah    more you look round over your shoulder but never quite back  nevertheless the curse against you is still in my    heart like a deep deep burn the curse against all mothers all mothers who fortify themselves in motherhood    devastating the vision they are accursed and the curse is not taken off it burns within me like a deep old burn and oh i wish it was better  beuerberg   on the balcony  in front of the sombre mountains a faint lost    ribbon of rainbow and between us and it the thunder and down below in the green wheat the labourers stand like dark stumps still in the green wheat  you are near to me and your naked feet in their    sandals and through the scent of the balconys naked    timber i distinguish the scent of your hair so now the    limber lightning falls from heaven  adown the palegreen glacier river floats a dark boat through the gloomand whither the thunder roars but still we have each other the naked lightnings in the heavens dither and disappearwhat have we but each other the boat has gone    icking   frohnleichnam  you have come your way i have come my way you have stepped across your people carelessly    hurting them all i have stepped across my people and hurt them    in spite of my care  but steadily surely and notwithstanding we have come our ways and met at last here in this upper room  here the balcony overhangs the street where the bullockwagons    slowly go by with their loads of green and silver birch    trees for the feast of corpus christi  here from the balcony we look over the growing wheat where the jade    green river goes between the pinewoods over and beyond to where the many mountains stand in their blueness flashing with snow and the    morning  i have done a quiver of exultation goes through    me like the first breeze of the morning through a narrow white    birch you glow at last like the mountain tops when they    catch day and make magic in heaven  at last i can throw away world without end and    meet you unsheathed and naked and narrow and white at last you can throw immortality off and i see you glistening with all the moment and all your    beauty  shameless and callous i love you out of indifference i love you out of mockery we dance together out of the sunshine into the shadow passing across the shadow into the sunlight out of sunlight to shadow  as we dance your eyes take all of me in as a communication as we dance i see you ah in full only to dance together in triumph of being together two white ones sharp vindicated shining and touching is heaven of our own sheer with repudiation   in the dark  a blotch of pallor stirs beneath the high square picturedusk the window of dark sky  a sound subdued in the

your eyes when you look at me  ah never before did i see the shadows that live in the sun  now every tall glad tree turns round its back to the sun and looks down on the ground to see the shadow it used to shun  at the foot of each glowing thing a night lies looking up  oh and i want to sing and dance but i cant lift up my eyes from the shadows dark they lie spilt round the cup  what is ithark the faint fine seethe in the air  like the seething sound in a shell it is death still seething where the wildflower shakes its bell and the sky lark twinkles blue  the pain of loving you is almost more than i can bear   green  the dawn was applegreen the sky was green wine held up in the sun the moon was a golden petal between  she opened her eyes and green they shone clear like flowers undone for the first time now for the first time seen   icking   river roses  by the isar in the twilight we were wandering and singing by the isar in the evening we climbed the huntsmans ladder and sat    swinging in the firtree overlooking the marshes while river met with river and the ringing of their palegreen glacier water filled the evening  by the isar in the twilight we found the dark wild roses hanging red at the river and simmering frogs were singing and over the river closes was savour of ice and of roses and glimmering fear was abroad we whispered no one    knows us let it be as the snake disposes here in this simmering marsh   kloster schaeftlarn   gloire de dijon  when she rises in the morning i linger to watch her she spreads the bathcloth underneath the window and the sunbeams catch her glistening white on the shoulders while down her sides the mellow golden shadow glows as she stoops to the sponge and her swung breasts sway like fullblown yellow gloire de dijon roses  she drips herself with water and her shoulders glisten as silver they crumple up like wet and falling roses and i listen for the sluicing of their raindishevelled petals in the window full of sunlight concentrates her golden shadow fold on fold until it glows as mellow as the glory roses   icking   roses on the breakfast table  just a few of the roses we gathered from the isar are fallen and their mauvered petals on the    cloth float like boats on a river while other roses are ready to fall reluctant and loth  she laughs at me across the table saying i am beautiful i look at the rumpled young roses and suddenly realise in them as in me how lovely the present is that this day discloses   i am like a rose  i am myself at last now i achieve my very self i with the wonder mellow full of fine warmth i issue forth in clear and single me perfected from my fellow  here i am all myself no rosebush heaving its limpid sap to culmination has brought itself more sheer and naked out of the green in starkclear roses than i to myself am brought   rose of all the world  i am here myself as though this heave of effort at starting other life fulfilled my own roseleaves that whirl in colour round a core of seedspecks kindled lately and softly blown  by all the blood of the rosebush into being strange that the urgent will in me to set my mouth on hers in kisses and so softly to bring together two strange sparks beget  another life from our lives so should send the innermost fire of my own dim soul out    spinning and whirling in blossom of flame and being upon    me that my completion of manhood should be the    beginning  another life from mine for so it looks the seed is purpose blossom accident the seed is all in all the blossom lent to crown the triumph of this new descent  is that it woman does it strike you so the great breath blowing a tiny seed of fire fans out your petals for excess of flame till all your being smokes with fine desire  or are we kindled you and i to be one rose of wonderment upon the tree of perfect life and is our possible seed but the residuum of the ecstasy  how will you have itthe rose is all in all or the ripe rosefruits of the luscious fall the sharp begetting or the child begot our consummation matters or does it not  to me it seems the seed is just left over from the red roseflowers fiery transience just orts and slarts berries that smoulder in the    bush which burnt just now with marvellous immanence  blossom my darling blossom be a rose of roses unchidden and purposeless a rose for rosiness only without an ulterior motive for me it is more than enough if the flower un    close   a youth mowing  there are four men mowing down by the isar i can hear the swish of the scythestrokes four sharp breaths taken yea and i am sorry for whats in store  the first man out of the four thats mowing is mine i claim him once and for all though its sorry i am on his young feet knowing none of the trouble hes led to stall  as he sees me bringing the dinner he lifts his head as proud as a deer that looks shoulderdeep out of the corn and wipes his scytheblade bright unhooks  the scythestone and over the stubble to me lad thou hast gotten a child in me laddie a man thoult hae to be yea though im sorry for thee   quite forsaken  what pain to wake and miss you   to wake with a tightened heart and mouth reaching forward to kiss you  this then at last is the dawn and the bell   clanging at the farm such bewilderment comes with the sight of the room i cannot tell  it is raining down the halfobscure road   four labourers pass with their scythes dejectedlya huntsman goes by with his load  a gun and a bunchedup deer its four little feet   clustered deadand this is the dawn for which i wanted the night to retreat   forsaken and forlorn  the house is silent it is late at night i am alone                from the balcony           i can hear the isar moan                can see the white rift of the river eerily between the pines under           a sky of stone  some fireflies drift through the middle air                tinily           i wonder where ends this darkness that annihilates me   fireflies in the corn  she speaks look at the little darlings in the corn    the rye is taller than you who think yourself so high and mighty look how the heads are      borne dark and proud on the sky like a number of      knights passing with spears and pennants and manly scorn  knights indeedmuch knight i know will ride    with his head held highserene against the sky limping and following rather at my side    moaning for me to love himoh darling rye how i adore you for your simple pride  and the dear dear fireflies wafting in between    and over the swaying cornstalks just above all the darkfeathered helmets like little green    stars come low and wandering here for love of these dark knights shedding their delicate      sheen  i thank you i do you happy creatures you dears    riding the air and carrying all the time your little lanterns behind you ah it cheers    my soul to see you settling and trying to      climb the cornstalks tipping with fire the spears  all over the dim corns motion against the blue    dark sky of night a wandering glitter a      swarm of questing brilliant souls going out with their      true    proud knights to battle sweet how i warm my poor my perished soul with the sight of      you   a doe at evening  as i went through the marshes a doe sprang out of the corn and flashed up the hillside leaving her fawn  on the skyline she moved round to watch she pricked a fine black blotch on the sky  i looked at her and felt her watching i became a strange being still i had my right to be there with her  her nimble shadow trotting along the skyline she put back her fine levelbalanced head and i knew her  ah yes being male is not my head hardbalanced     antlered are not my haunches light has she not fled on the same wind with me does not my fear cover her fear   irschenhausen   song of a man who is not loved  the space of the world is immense before me and    around me if i turn quickly i am terrified feeling space    surround me like a man in a boat on very clear deep water    space frightens and confounds me  i see myself isolated in the universe and wonder what effect i can have my hands wave under the heavens like specks of dust that are floating    asunder  i hold myself up and feel a big wind blowing me like a gadfly into the dusk without my know    ing whither or why or even how i am going  so much there is outside me so infinitely small am i what matter if minutely i beat my way to be lost immediately  how shall i flatter myself that i can do anything in such immensity i am too little to count in the wind that drifts me through

young year comes in and is halfway over the lake we must begin  again this love so full of hate has hurt us so we lie side by side mooredbut no  let me get up and wash quite clean of this hate so green  the great star goes i am washed quite clean quite clean of it all but een  so cold so cold and clean now the hate is gone it is all no good i am chilled to the bone  now the hate is gone there

righteousness god will keep hidden he wont come forth   giorno dei morti  along the avenue of cypresses all in their scarlet cloaks and surplices of linen go the chanting choristers the priests in gold and black the villagers     and all along the path to the cemetery the round dark heads of men crowd silently and blackscarved faces of womenfolk wistfully watch at the banner of death and the mystery  and at the foot of a grave a father stands with sunken head and forgotten folded hands and at the foot of a grave a mother kneels with pale shut face nor either hears nor feels  the coming of the chanting choristers between the avenue of cypresses the silence of the many villagers the candleflames beside the surplices   all souls  they are chanting now the service of all the dead and the village folk outside in the burying ground listenexcept those who strive with their dead reaching out in anguish yet unable quite to     touch them those villagers isolated at the grave where the candles burn in the daylight and the     painted wreaths are propped on end there where the mystery     starts  the naked candles burn on every grave on your grave in england the weeds grow  but i am your naked candle burning and that is not your grave in england the world is your grave and my naked body standing on your grave upright towards heaven is burning off to you its flame of life now and always till the end  it is my offering to you every day is all souls     day  i forget you have forgotten you i am busy only at my burning i am busy only at my life but my feet are on your grave planted and when i lift my face it is a flame that goes up to the other world where you are now but i am not concerned with you     i have forgotten you  i am a naked candle burning on your grave   lady wife  ah yes i know you well a sojourner     at the hearth i know right well the marriage ring you wear     and what its worth  the angels came to abraham and they stayed     in his house awhile so you to mine i imagine yes happily     condescend to be vile  i see you all the time you birdblithe lovely     angel in disguise i see right well how i ought to be grateful     smitten with reverent surprise  listen i have no use     for so rare a visit mine is a common devils     requisite  rise up and go i have no use for you     and your blithe glad mien no angels here for me no goddesses     nor any queen  put ashes on your head put sackcloth on     and learn to serve you have fed me with your sweetness now i am sick     as i deserve  queens ladies angels women rare     i have had enough put sackcloth on be crowned with powdery ash     be common stuff  and serve now woman serve as a woman should     implicitly since i must serve and struggle with the imminent     mystery  serve then i tell you add your strength to mine     take on this doom what are you by yourself do you think and what     the mere fruit of your womb  what is the fruit of your womb then you mother       you queen     when it falls to the ground is it more than the apples of sodom you scorn so       the men    who abound  bring forth the sons of your womb then and put       them     into the fire of sodom that covers the earth bring them forth     from the womb of your precious desire  you woman most holy you mother you being       beyond     question or diminution add yourself up and your seed to the nought     of your last solution   both sides of the medal  and because you love me think you you do not hate me ha since you love me to ecstasy it follows you hate me to ecstasy  because when you hear me go down the road outside the house you must come to the window to watch me go do you think it is pure worship  because when i sit in the room here in my own house and you want to enlarge yourself with this friend of     mine such a friend as he is yet you cannot get beyond your awareness of me you are held back by my being in the same world     with you do you think it is bliss alone sheer harmony  no doubt if i were dead you must reach into death after me but would not your hate reach even more madly     than your love your impassioned unfinished hate  since you have a passion for me as i for you does not that passion stand in your way like a     balaams ass and am i not balaams ass goldenmouthed occasionally but mostly do you not detest my bray  since you are confined in the orbit of me do you not loathe the confinement is not even the beauty and peace of an orbit an intolerable prison to you as it is to everybody  but we will learn to submit each of us to the balanced eternal orbit wherein we circle on our fate in strange conjunction  what is chaos my love it is not freedom a disarray of falling stars coming to nought   loggerheads  please yourself how you have it take my words and fling them down on the counter roundly see if they ring  sift my looks and expressions and see what proportion there is of sand in my doubtful sugar of verities  have a real stocktaking of my manly breast find out if im sound or bankrupt or a poor thing at best  for i am quite indifferent to your dubious state as to whether youve found a fortune in me or a fleabitten fate  make a good investigation of all that is there and then if its worth it be grateful if not then despair  if despair is our portion then let us despair let us make for the weeping willow i dont care   december night  take off your cloak and your hat and your shoes and draw up at my hearth where never woman sat  i have made the fire up bright let us leave the rest in the dark and sit by firelight  the wine is warm in the hearth the flickers come and go i will warm your feet with kisses until they glow   new years eve  there are only two things now the great black night scooped out and this fireglow  this fireglow the core and we the two ripe pips that are held in store  listen the darkness rings as it circulates round our fire take off your things  your shoulders your bruised throat your breasts your nakedness this fiery coat  as the darkness flickers and dips as the firelight falls and leaps from your feet to your lips   new years night  now you are mine tonight at last i say it youre a dove i have bought for sacrifice and tonight i slay it  here in my arms my naked sacrifice death do you hear in my arms i am bringing my offering bought at great price  shes a silvery dove worth more than all ive got now i offer her up to the ancient inexorable god who knows me not  look shes a wonderful dove without blemish or    spot i sacrifice all in her my last of the world pride strength all the lot  all all on the altar and death swooping down like a falcon tis god has taken the victim i have won my renown   valentines night  you shadow and flame you interchange you death in the game  now i gather you up now i put you back like a poppy in its cup  and so you are a maid again my darling but new unafraid  my love my blossom a child almost the flower in the bud again undefiled  and yet a woman knowing all good evil both in one blossom blowing   birth night  this fireglow is a red womb in the night where youre folded up on your doom  and the ugly brutal years are dissolving out of you and the stagnant tears  i the great vein that leads from the night to the source of you which the sweet blood feeds  new phase in the germ of you new sunny streams of blood washing you through  you are born again of me i adam from the veins of me the eve that is to be  what has been long ago grows dimmer we both forget we no longer know  you are lovely your face is soft like a flower in bud on a mountain croft  this is noÃ«l for me tonight is a woman born of the man in me   rabbit snared in the night  why do you spurt and sprottle like that bunny why should i want to throttle you bunny  yes bunch yourself between my knees and lie still lie on me with a hot plumb live weight heavy as a stone passive yet hot waiting  what are you waiting for what are you waiting for what is the hot plumb weight of your desire on     me you have a hot unthinkable desire of me bunny  what is that spark glittering at me on the unutterable darkness of your eye bunny the finest splinter of a spark that you throw off straight on the tinder of my     nerves  it sets up a strange fire a soft most unwarrantable burning a balefire mounting mounting up in me  tis not of me bunny it was you engendered it with that fine demoniacal spark you jetted off your eye at me  i did not want it this furnace this draughtmaddened fire which mounts up my arms making them swell with turgid ungovernable     strength  twas not i that wished it that my fingers should turn into these flames avid and terrible that they are at this moment  it must have been your inbreathing gaping desire that drew this red gush in me i must be reciprocating your vacuous hideous     passion  it must be the want in you that has drawn this terrible draught of white fire up my veins as up a chimney  it must be you who desire this intermingling of the black and monstrous     fingers of moloch in the bloodjets of your throat  come you shall have your desire since already i am implicated with you in your strange lust   paradise reentered  through the strait gate of passion between the bickering fire where flames of fierce love tremble on the body of fierce desire  to the intoxication the mind fused down like a bead flees in its agitation the flames stiff speed  at last to calm incandescence burned clean by remorseless hate now at the days renascence we approach the gate  now from the darkened spaces of fear and of frightened faces death in our awful embraces approached and passed by  we near the flameburnt porches where the brands of the angels like torches whirlin these perilous marches pausing to sigh  we look back on the withering roses the stars in their sundimmed closes where twas given us to repose us sure on our sanctity  beautiful candid lovers burnt out of our earthy covers we might have nestled like plovers in the fields of eternity  there sure in sinless being allseen and then allseeing in us life unto death agreeing we might have lain  but we storm the angelguarded gates of the longdiscarded garden which god has hoarded against our pain  the lord of hosts and the devil are left on eternitys level field and as victors we travel to eden home  back beyond good and evil return we eve dishevel your hair for the blissdrenched revel on our primal loam   spring morning  ah through the open door is there an almond tree aflame with blossom    let us fight no more  among the pink and blue of the sky and the almond flowers a sparrow flutters    we have come through  it is really springsee when he thinks himself alone how he bullies the flowers    ah you and me  how happy well besee him he clouts the tufts of flowers in his impudence    but did you dream  it would be so bitter never mind it is finished the spring is here and were going to be summerhappy    and summerkind  we have died we have slain and been slain we are not our old selves any more i feel new and eager    to start again  it is gorgeous to live and forget and to feel quite new see the bird in the flowershes making    a rare todo  he thinks the whole blue sky is much less than the bit of blue egg hes got in his nestwell be happy    you and i i and you  with nothing to fight any more in each other at least see how gorgeous the world is    outside the door   san gaudenzio   wedlock                        i  come my little one closer up against me creep right up with your round head pushed in    my breast  how i love all of you do you feel me wrap    you up with myself and my warmth like a flame    round the wick  and how i am not at all except a flame that    mounts off you where i touch you i flame into beingbut is it    me or you  that round head pushed in my chest like a nut    in its socket and i the swift bracts that sheathe it those    breasts those thighs and knees  those shoulders so warm and smooth i feel    that i am a sunlight upon them that shines them into    being  but how lovely to be you creep closer in that    i am more i spread over you how lovely your round head    your arms  your breasts your knees and feet i feel that we are a bonfire of oneness me flame flung leaping    round you you the core of the fire crept into me                        ii  and oh my little one you whom i enfold how quaveringly i depend on you to keep me    alive like a flame on a wick  i the man who enfolds you and holds you close how my soul cleaves to your bosom as i clasp you the very quick of my being  suppose you didnt want me i should sink down like a light that has no sustenance and sinks low  cherish me my tiny one cherish me who enfold    you nourish me and endue me i am only of you i am your issue  how full and big like a robust happy flame when i enfold you and you creep into me and my life is fierce at its quick where it comes off you                        iii  my little one my big one my bird my brown sparrow in my breast my squirrel clutching in to me my pigeon my little one so warm so close breathing so still  my little one my big one i who am so fierce and strong enfolding you if you start away from my breast and leave me how suddenly i shall go down into nothing like a flame that falls of a sudden  and you will be before me tall and towering and i shall be wavering uncertain like a sunken flame that grasps for support                        iv  but now i am full and strong and certain with you there firm at the core of me keeping me  how sure i feel how warm and strong and happy for the future how sure the future is within me i am like a seed with a perfect flower enclosed  i wonder what it will be what will come forth of us what flower my love  no matter i am so happy i feel like a firm rich healthy root rejoicing in what is to come  how i depend on you utterly my little one my big one how everything that will be will not be of me nor of either of us but of both of us                        v  and think there will something come forth from    us we two folded so small together there will something come forth from us children acts utterance perhaps only happiness  perhaps only happiness will come forth from us old sorrow and new happiness only that one newness  but that is all i want and i am sure of that we are sure of that                        vi  and yet all the while you are you you are not me and i am i i am never you how awfully distinct and far off from each others    being we are  yet i am glad i am so glad there is always you beyond my scope something that stands over something i shall never be that i shall always wonder over and wait for look for like the breath of life as long as i live still waiting for you however old you are and i    am i shall always wonder over you and look for you  and you will always be with me i shall never cease to be filled with newness having you near me   history  the listless beauty of the hour when snow fell on the apple trees and the woodash gathered in the fire and we faced our first miseries  then the sweeping sunshine of noon when the mountains like chariot cars were ranked to blue battleand you and i counted our scars  and then in a strange grey hour we lay mouth to mouth with your face under mine like a star on the lake and i covered the earth and all space  the silent drifting hours of morn after morn and night drifting up to the night yet no pathway worn  your life and mine my love passing on and on the hate fusing closer and closer with love till at length they mate   the cearne   song of a man who has come through  not i not i but the wind that blows through me a fine wind is blowing the new direction of time if only i let it bear me carry me if only it carry    me if only i am sensitive subtle oh delicate a    winged gift if only most lovely of all i yield myself and am    borrowed by the fine fine wind that takes its course through    the chaos of the world like a fine an exquisite chisel a wedgeblade    inserted if only i am keen and hard like the sheer tip of a    wedge driven by invisible blows the rock will split we shall come at the wonder    we shall find the hesperides  oh for the wonder that bubbles into my soul i would be a good fountain a good wellhead would blur no whisper spoil no expression     what is the knocking    what is the knocking at the door in the night    it is somebody wants to do us harm     no no it is the three strange angels    admit them admit them   one woman to all women  i dont care whether i am beautiful to you         you other women nothing of me that you see is my own a man balances bone unto bone balances everything thrown         in the scale you other women  you may look and say to yourselves i do         not show like the rest my face may not please you nor my stature yet    if you knew how happy i am how my heart in the wind rings    true like a bell that is chiming each stroke as a stroke    falls due         you other women  you would draw your mirror towards you you    would wish         to be different theres the beauty you cannot see myself and    him balanced in glorious equilibrium the swinging beauty of equilibrium         you other women  theres this other beauty the way of the stars         you straggling women if you knew how i swerve in peace in the equi    poise with the man if you knew how my flesh enjoys the swinging bliss no shattering ever destroys         you other women  you would envy me you would think me wonder    ful         beyond compare you would weep to be lapsing on such harmony as carries me you would wonder aloud that he who is so strange should correspond with me         everywhere  you see he is different he is dangerous         without pity or love and yet how his separate being liberates me and gives me peace you cannot see how the stars are moving in surety         exquisite high above  we move without knowing we sleep and we    travel on         you other women and this is beauty to me to be lifted and gone in a motion human inhuman two and one encompassed and many reduced to none         you other women   kensington   people  the great gold apples of night hang from the streets long bough          dripping their light on the faces that drift below on the faces that drift and blow down the nighttime out of sight          in the winds sad sough  the ripeness of these apples of night distilling over me          makes sickening the white ghostflux of faces that hie them endlessly endlessly by without meaning or reason why          they ever should be   street lamps  gold with an innermost speck of silver singing afloat     beneath the night like balls of thistledown wandering up and down over the whispering town     seeking where to alight  slowly above the street above the ebb of feet     drifting in flight still in the purple distance the gold of their strange persistence as they cross and part and meet     and pass out of sight  the seedball of the sun is broken at last and done     is the orb of day now to the separate ends seed after dayseed wends     a separate way  no sun will ever rise again on the wonted skies     in the midst of the spheres the globe of the day overripe is shattered at last beneath the stripe of the wind and its oneness veers     out myriadwise  seed after seed after seed drifts over the town in its need     to sink and have done to settle at last in the dark to bury its weary spark     where the end is begun  darkness and depth of sleep nothing to know or to weep     where the seed sinks in to the earth of the undernight where all is silent quite still and the darknesses steep     out all the sin   she said as well to me  she said as well to me why are you ashamed that little bit of your chest that shows between the gap of your shirt why cover it up why shouldnt your legs and your good strong    thighs be rough and hairyim glad they are like    that you are shy you silly you silly shy thing men are the shyest creatures they never will come out of their covers like any snake slipping into its bed of dead leaves you hurry into    your clothes and i love you so straight and clean and all of a    piece is the body of a man such an instrument a spade like a spear or an    oar such a joy to me so she laid her hands and pressed them down my    sides so that i began to wonder over myself and what i    was  she said to me what an instrument your    body single and perfectly distinct from everything else what a tool in the hands of the lord only god could have brought it to its shape it feels as if his handgrasp wearing you had polished you and hollowed you hollowed this groove in your sides grasped you    under the breasts and brought you to the very quick of your form subtler than an old softworn fiddlebow  when i was a child i loved my fathers riding    whip that he used so often i loved to handle it it seemed like a near part of    him so i did his pens and the jasper seal on his desk something seemed to surge through me when i    touched them  so it is with you but here the joy i feel god knows what i feel but it is joy look you are clean and fine and singled out i admire you so you are beautiful this clean    sweep of your sides this firmness this hard    mould i would die rather than have it injured with one    scar i wish i could grip you like the fist of the lord    and have you  so she said and i wondered feeling trammelled and hurt it did not make me free  now i say to her no tool no instrument no    god dont touch me and appreciate me it is an infamy you would think twice before you touched a    weasel on a fence as it lifts its straight white throat your hand would not be so flig and easy nor the adder we saw asleep with her head on her    shoulder curled up in the sunshine like a princess when she lifted her head in delicate startled    wonder you did not stretch forward to caress her though she looked rarely beautiful and a miracle as she glided delicately away with    such dignity and the young bull in the field with his wrinkled    sad face you are afraid if he rises to his feet though he is all wistful and pathetic like a mono    lith arrested static  is there nothing in me to make you hesitate i tell you there is all these and why should you overlook them in me   new heaven and earth                           i  and so i cross into another world shyly and in homage linger for an invitation from this unknown that i would trespass on  i am very glad and all alone in the world all alone and very glad in a new world where i am disembarked at last  i could cry with joy because i am in the new world     just ventured in i could cry with joy and quite freely there is     nobody to know  and whosoever the unknown people of this un     known world may be they will never understand my weeping for joy     to be adventuring among them because it will still be a gesture of the old world i     am making which they will not understand because it is     quite quite foreign to them                           ii  i was so weary of the world i was so sick of it everything was tainted with myself skies trees flowers birds water people houses streets vehicles machines nations armies war peacetalking work recreation governing anarchy it was all tainted with myself i knew it all to start    with because it was all myself  when i gathered flowers i knew it was myself    plucking my own flowering when i went in a train i knew it was myself    travelling by my own invention when i heard the cannon of the war i listened    with my own ears to my own destruction when i saw the torn dead i knew it was my own    torn dead body it was all me i had done it all in my own flesh                           iii  i shall never forget the maniacal horror of it all    in the end when everything was me i knew it all already i    anticipated it all in my soul because i was the author and the result i was the god and the creation at once creator i looked at my creation created i looked at myself the creator it was a maniacal horror in the end  i was a lover i kissed the woman i loved and god of horror i was kissing also myself i was a father and a begetter of children and oh oh horror i was begetting and conceiving in my own body                           iv  at last came death sufficiency of death and that at last relieved me i died i buried my beloved it was good i buried    myself and was gone war came and every hand raised to murder very good very good every hand raised to murder very good very good i am a murderer it is good i can murder and murder and see    them fall the mutilated horrorstruck youths a multitude one on another and then in clusters together smashed all oozing with blood and burned in heaps going up in a foetid smoke to get rid of them the murdered bodies of youths and men in heaps and heaps and heaps and horrible reeking heaps till it is almost enough till i am reduced perhaps thousands and thousands of gaping hideous foul    dead that are youths and men and me being burned with oil and consumed in corrupt    thick smoke that rolls and taints and blackens the sky till at last it is    dark dark as night or death or hell and i am dead and trodden to nought in the    smokesodden tomb dead and trodden to nought in the sour black    earth of the tomb dead and trodden to nought trodden    to nought                           v  god but it is good to have died and been trodden    out trodden to nought in sour dead earth quite to nought absolutely to nothing nothing nothing nothing  for when it is quite quite nothing then it is    everything when i am trodden quite out quite quite out every vestige gone then i am here risen and setting my foot on another world risen accomplishing a resurrection risen not born again but risen body the same as    before new beyond knowledge of newness alive beyond    life proud beyond inkling or furthest conception of    pride living where life was never yet dreamed of nor    hinted at here in the other world still terrestrial myself the same as before yet unaccountably new                           vi  i in the sour black tomb trodden to absolute death i put out my hand in the night one night and my    hand touched that which was verily not me verily it was not me where i had been was a sudden blaze a sudden flaring blaze so i put my hand out further a little further and i felt that which was not i it verily was not i it was the unknown  ha i was a blaze leaping up i was a tiger bursting into sunlight i was greedy i was mad for the unknown i newrisen resurrected starved from the tomb starved from a life of devouring always myself now here was i newawakened with my hand    stretching out and touching the unknown the real unknown    the unknown unknown  my god but i can only say i touch i feel the unknown i am the first comer cortes pisarro columbus cabot they are noth    ing nothing i am the first comer i am the discoverer i have found the other world  the unknown the unknown i am thrown upon the shore i am covering myself with the sand i am filling my mouth with the earth i am burrowing my body into the soil the unknown the new world                           vii  it was the flank of my wife i touched with my hand i clutched with my    hand rising newawakened from the tomb it was the flank of my wife whom i married years ago at whose side i have lain for over a thousand    nights and all that previous while she was i she was i i touched her it was i who touched and i who was    touched  yet rising from the tomb from the black oblivion stretching out my hand my hand flung like a    drowned mans hand on a rock i touched her flank and knew i was carried by the    current in death over to the new world and was climbing out on    the shore risen not to the old world the old changeless i    the old life wakened not to the old knowledge but to a new earth a new i a new knowledge a    new world of time  ah no i cannot tell you what it is the new world i cannot tell you the mad astounded rapture of    its discovery i shall be mad with delight before i have done and whosoever comes after will find me in the    new world a madman in rapture                           viii  green streams that flow from the innermost    continent of the new world what are they green and illumined and travelling for ever dissolved with the mystery of the innermost heart    of the continent mystery beyond knowledge or endurance so sump    tuous out of the wellheads of the new world the other she too has strange green eyes white sands and fruits unknown and perfumes    that never can blow across the dark seas to our usual    world and land that beats with a pulse and valleys that draw close in love and strange ways where i fall into oblivion of    uttermost living also she who is the other has strangemounded    breasts and strange sheer slopes and white    levels  sightless and strong oblivion in utter life takes    possession of me the unknown strong current of life supreme drowns me and sweeps me away and holds me    down to the sources of mystery in the depths extinguishes there my risen resurrected life and kindles it further at the core of utter mystery   greatham   elysium  i have found a place of loneliness lonelier than lyonesse lovelier than paradise  full of sweet stillness that no noise can transgress never a lamp distress  the full moon sank in state i saw her stand and wait for her watchers to shut the gate  then i found myself in a wonderland all of shadow and of bland silence hard to understand  i waited therefore then i knew the presence of the flowers that grew noiseless their wonder noiseless blew  and flashing kingfishers that flew in sightless beauty and the few shadows the passing wildbeast threw  and eve approaching over the ground unheard and subtle never a sound to let me know that i was found  invisible the hands of eve upon me travelling to reeve me from the matrix to relieve  me from the rest ah terribly between the body of life and me her hands slid in and set me free  ah with a fearful strange detection she found the source of my subjection to the all and severed the connection  delivered helpless and amazed from the womb of the all i am waiting dazed for memory to be erased  then i shall know the elysium that lies outside the monstrous womb of time from out of which i come   manifesto                      i  a woman has given me strength and affluence admitted  all the rocking wheat of canada ripening now has not so much of strength as the body of one     woman sweet in ear nor so much to give though it feed nations  hunger is the very satan the fear of hunger is moloch belial the horrible     god it is a fearful thing to be dominated by the fear of     hunger  not bread alone not the belly nor the thirsty     throat i have never yet been smitten through the belly     with the lack of bread no nor even milk and honey  the fear of the want of these things seems to be     quite left out of me for so much i thank the good generations of man     kind                      ii  and the sweet constant balanced heat of the suave sensitive body the hunger for this has never seized me and terrified me here again man has been good in his legacy to us     in these two primary instances                      iii  then the dumb aching bitter helpless need the pining to be initiated to have access to the knowledge that the great dead have opened up for us to know to satisfy the great and dominant hunger of the mind mans sweetest harvest of the centuries sweet     printed books bright glancing exquisite corn of many a stubborn glebe in the upturned darkness i thank mankind with passionate heart that i just escaped the hunger for these that they were given when i needed them because i am the son of man  i have eaten and drunk and warmed and clothed     my body i have been taught the language of understanding i have chosen among the bright and marvellous     books like any prince such stores of the worlds supply were open to me in the wisdom and goodness of     man so far so good wise good provision that makes the heart swell     with love                      iv  but then came another hunger very deep and ravening the very bodys body crying out with a hunger more frightening more profound than stomach or throat or even the mind redder than death more clamorous  the hunger for the woman alas it is so deep a moloch ruthless and strong tis like the unutterable name of the dread lord not to be spoken aloud yet there it is the hunger which comes upon us which we must learn to satisfy with pure real     satisfaction or perish there is no alternative  i thought it was woman indiscriminate woman mere female adjunct of what i was ah that was torment hard enough and a thing to be afraid of a threatening torturing phallic moloch  a woman fed that hunger in me at last what many women cannot give one woman can so i have known it  she stood before me like riches that were mine even then in the dark i was tortured ravening     unfree ashamed and shameful and vicious a man is so terrified of strong hunger and this terror is the root of all cruelty she loved me and stood before me looking to me how could i look when i was mad i looked     sideways furtively being mad with voracious desire                      v  this comes right at last when a man is rich he loses at last the hunger fear i lost at last the fierceness that fears it will starve i could put my face at last between her breasts and know that they were given for ever that i should never starve never perish i had eaten of the bread that satisfies and my bodys body was appeased there was peace and richness fulfilment  let them praise desire who will but only fulfilment will do real fulfilment nothing short it is our ratification our heaven as a matter of fact immortality the heaven is only a projection of     this strange but actual fulfilment here in the flesh  so another hunger was supplied and for this i have to thank one woman not mankind for mankind would have prevented     me but one woman and these are my redletter thanksgivings                      vi  to be or not to be is still the question this ache for being is the ultimate hunger and for myself i can say almost almost oh     very nearly yet something remains something shall not always remain for the main already is fulfilment  what remains in me is to be known even as i     know i know her now or perhaps i know my own     limitation against her  plunging as i have done over over the brink i have dropped at last headlong into nought     plunging upon sheer hard extinction i have come as it were not to know died as it were ceased from knowing surpassed     myself what can i say more except that i know what it is to surpass myself  it is a kind of death which is not death it is going a little beyond the bounds how can one speak where there is a dumbness on     ones mouth i suppose ultimately she is all beyond me she is all notme ultimately it is that that one comes to a curious agony and a relief when i touch that     which is not me in any sense it wounds me to death with my own notbeing     definite inviolable limitation and something beyond quite beyond if you     understand what that means it is the major part of being this having surpassed     oneself this having touched the edge of the beyond and     perished yet not perished                      vii  i want her though to take the same from me she touches me as if i were herself her own she has not realized yet that fearful thing that     i am the other she thinks we are all of one piece it is painfully untrue  i want her to touch me at last ah on the root and     quick of my darkness and perish on me as i have perished on her  then we shall be two and distinct we shall have     each our separate being and that will be pure existence real liberty till then we are confused a mixture unresolved     unextricated one from the other it is in pure unutterable resolvedness distinction     of being that one is free not in mixing merging not in similarity when she has put her hand on my secret darkest     sources the darkest outgoings when it has struck home to her like a death this     is him she has no part in it no part whatever it is the terrible other when she knows the fearful other flesh ah dark     ness unfathomable and fearful contiguous and     concrete when she is slain against me and lies in a heap     like one outside the house when she passes away as i have passed away being pressed up against the other then i shall be glad i shall not be confused with     her i shall be cleared distinct single as if burnished     in silver having no adherence no adhesion anywhere one clear burnished isolated being unique and she also pure isolated complete two of us unutterably distinguished and in     unutterable conjunction  then we shall be free freer than angels ah     perfect                      viii  after that there will only remain that all men     detach themselves and become unique that we are all detached moving in freedom more     than the angels conditioned only by our own pure single being having no laws but the laws of our own being  every human being will then be like a flower     untrammelled every movement will be direct only to be will be such delight we cover our faces     when we think of it lest our faces betray us to some untimely fiend  every man himself and therefore a surpassing     singleness of mankind the blazing tiger will spring upon the deer un     dimmed the hen will nestle over her chickens we shall love we shall hate but it will be like music sheer utterance issuing straight out of the unknown the lightning and the rainbow appearing in us     unbidden unchecked like ambassadors     we shall not look before and after    we shall be now    we shall know in full    we the mystic now   zennor   autumn rain  the plane leaves fall black and wet on the lawn  the cloud sheaves in heavens fields set droop and are drawn  in falling seeds of rain the seed of heaven on my face  fallingi hear again like echoes even that softly pace  heavens muffled floor the winds that tread out all the grain  of tears the store harvested in the sheaves of pain  caught up aloft the sheaves of dead men that are slain  now winnowed soft on the floor of heaven manna invisible  of all the pain here to us given finely divisible falling as rain   frost flowers  it is not long since here among all these folk in london i should have held myself of no account whatever but should have stood aside and made them way thinking that they perhaps had more right than ifor who was i  now i see them just the same and watch them but of what account do i hold them  especially the young women i look at them as they dart and flash before the shops like wagtails on the edge of a     pool  if i pass them close or any man like sharp slim wagtails they flash a little aside pretending to avoid us yet all the time calculating  they think that we adore themalas would it     were true  probably they think all men adore them howsoever they pass by  what is it that from their faces fresh as spring such fair fresh alert firstflower faces like lavender crocuses snowdrops like roman     hyacinths scyllas and yellowhaired hellebore jonquils dim     anemones even the sulphur auriculas flowers that come first from the darkness and feel     cold to the touch flowers scentless or pungent ammoniacal almost what is it that from the faces of the fair young     women comes like a pungent scent a vibration beneath that startles me alarms me stirs up a repulsion  they are the issue of acrid winter these first     flower young women their scent is lacerating and repellant it smells of burning snow of hotache of earth winterpressed strangled in corruption it is the scent of the fierycold dregs of corruption when destruction soaks through the mortified     decomposing earth and the last fires of dissolution burn in the bosom     of the ground  they are the flowers of icevivid mortification thawcold icecorrupt blossoms with a loveliness i loathe for what kind of icerotten hotaching heart     must they need to root in   craving for spring  i wish it were spring in the world  let it be spring come bubbling surging tide of sap come rush of creation come life surge through this mass of mortifica    tion come sweep away these exquisite ghastly first    flowers which are rather lastflowers come thaw down their cool portentousness    dissolve them snowdrops straight deathveined exhalations of    white and purple crocuses flowers of the penumbra issue of corruption    nourished in mortification jets of exquisite finality come spring make havoc of them  i trample on the snowdrops it gives me pleasure    to tread down the jonquils to destroy the chill lent lilies for i am sick of them their faintbloodedness slowblooded icyfleshed portentous  i want the fine kindling winesap of spring gold and of inconceivably fine quintessential    brightness rare almost as beams yet overwhelmingly potent strong like the greatest force of worldbalancing  this is the same that picks up the harvest of wheat and rocks it tons of grain on the ripening wind the same that dangles the globeshaped pleiads of    fruit temptingly in midair between a playful thumb and    finger oh and suddenly from out of nowhere whirls    the pearbloom upon us and apple and almond and apricot    and quinceblossom storms and cumulus clouds of all imaginable    blossom about our bewildered faces though we do not worship  i wish it were spring cunningly blowing on the fallen sparks odds and    ends of the old scattered fire and kindling shapely little conflagrations curious longlegged foals and wideeared calves    and naked sparrowbubs  i wish that spring would start the thundering traffic of feet new feet on the earth beating with impatience  i wish it were spring thundering delicate tender spring i wish these brittle frostlovely flowers of pas    sionate mysterious corruption were not yet to come still more from the still    flickering discontent  oh in the spring the bluebell bows him down for    very exuberance exulting with secret warm excess bowed down with his inner magnificence  oh yes the gush of spring is strong enough to toss the globe of earth like a ball on a waterjet dancing sportfully as you see a tiny celluloid ball tossing on a squint    of water for men to shoot at pennyatime in a booth at a    fair  the gush of spring is strong enough to play with the globe of earth like a ball on a    fountain at the same time it opens the tiny hands of the    hazel with such infinite patience  the power of the rising golden allcreative sap    could take the earth and heave it off among the stars into the in    visible the same sets the throstle at sunset on a bough singing against the blackbird comes out in the hesitating tremor of the primrose and betrays its candour in the round white

cactuses come and lift us to our end to blossom bring us    to our summer we who are winterweary in the winter of the world come making the chaffinch nests hollow and cosy come and soften the willow buds till they are    puffed and furred then blow them over with gold come and cajole the gawky coltsfoot flowers  come quickly and vindicate us against too much death come quickly and stir the rotten

of the heart of man  are the violets already here show me i tremble so much to hear it that even    now on the threshold of spring i fear i shall die show me the violets that are out  oh if it be true and the living darkness of the    blood of man is purpling with violets if the violets are coming out from under the rack    of men winterrotten and fallen we shall have spring pray not to die on this pisgah blossoming with    violets pray to live through  if you catch a whiff of violets from the darkness of    the shadow of man it will be spring in the world it will be spring in the world of the living wonderment organising itself heralding itself with    the violets stirring of new seasons  ah do not let me die on the brink of such    anticipation worse let me not deceive myself   zennor
