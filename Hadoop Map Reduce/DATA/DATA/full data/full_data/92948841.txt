an evil laughsuch a laugh as might fall from the lips of satan in a sardonic moment  he sat within the halo of yellow light shed by two tallow candles whose sconces were two empty bottles and contemptuously he eyed the youth in black standing with white face and quivering lip in a corner of the mean chamber then he laughed again and in a hoarse voice sorely suggestive of the bottle he broke into song he lay back in his chair his long spare legs outstretched his spurs jingling to the lilt of his ditty whose burden ran            on the lip so red of the wench thats sped           his passionate kiss burns stillo           for tis april time and of love and wine           youths way is to take its fillo           down down derrydo            so his cup he drains and he shakes his reins           and rides his rakehelly wayo           she was sweet to woo and most comely too           but that was all yesterdayo           down down derrydo  the lad started forward with something akin to a shiver  have done he cried in a voice of loathing or if croak you must choose a ditty less foul  eh the ruffler shook back the matted hair from his lean harsh face and a pair of eyes that of a sudden seemed ablaze glared at his companion then the lids drooped until those eyes became two narrow slitscatlike and cunningand again he laughed  gads life master stewart you have a temerity that should save you from grey hairs what ist to you what ditty my fancy seizes on swounds man for three weary months have i curbed my moods and worn my throat dry in praising the lord for three months have i been a living monument of covenanting zeal and godliness and now that at last i have shaken the dust of your beggarly scotland from my heels youthe veriest milksop that ever ran tottering from its mothers lap would chide me because yon bottle being done i sing to keep me from waxing sad in the contemplation of its emptiness  there was scorn unutterable on the lads face as he turned aside  when i joined middletons horse and accepted service under you i held you to be at least a gentleman was his daring rejoinder  for an instant that dangerous light gleamed again from his companions eye then as before the lids drooped and as before he laughed  gentleman he mocked on my soul thats good and what may you know of gentlemen sir scot think you a gentleman is a jack presbyter or a droning member of your kirk committee strutting it like a crow in the gutter gadswounds boy when i was your age and george villiers lived  oh have done broke in the youth impetuously suffer me to leave you sir crispin to your bottle your croaking and your memories  aye go your ways sir youd be sorry company for a dead manthe sorriest ever my evil star led me into the door is yonder and should you chance to break your saintly neck on the stairs it is like to be well for both of us  and with that sir crispin galliard lay back in his chair once more and took up the thread of his interrupted song            but heigho she cried at the christmastide           that dead she would rather beo           pale and wan she crept out of sight and wept            tis a sorry  a loud knock that echoed ominously through the mean chamber fell in that instant upon the door and with it came a panting cry of  open cris open for the love of god  sir crispins ballad broke off short whilst the lad paused in the act of quitting the room and turned to look to him for direction  well my master quoth galliard for what do you wait  to learn your wishes sir was the answer sullenly delivered  my wishes rat me theres one without whose wishes brook less waiting open fool  thus rudely enjoined the lad lifted the latch and set wide the door which opened immediately upon the street into the apartment stumbled a roughly clad man of huge frame he was breathing hard and fear was writ large upon his rugged face an instant he paused to close the door after him then turning to galliard who had risen and who stood eyeing him in astonishment  hide me somewhere cris he pantedhis accent proclaiming his irish origin my god hide me or im a dead man this night  slife hogan what is toward has cromwell overtaken us  cromwell quotha would to heaven twere no worse ive killed a man  if hes dead why run  the irishman made an impatient gesture  a party of montgomerys foot is on my heels theyve raised the whole of penrith over the affair and if im taken soul of my body twill be a short shrift theyll give me the king will serve me as poor wrycraft was served two days ago at kendal mother of mercy he broke off as his ear caught the clatter of feet and the murmur of voices from without have you a hole i can creep into  up those stairs and into my room with you said crispin shortly i will try to head them off come man stir yourself they are here  then as with nimble alacrity hogan obeyed him and slipped from the room he turned to the lad who had been a silent spectator of what had passed from the pocket of his threadbare doublet he drew a pack of greasy playing cards  to table he said laconically  but the boy comprehending what was required of him drew back at sight of those cards as one might shrink from a thing unclean  never he began ill not defile  to table fool thundered crispin with a vehemence few men could have withstood is this a time for presbyterian scruples to table and help a me play this game or by the living god ill without completing his threat he leaned forward until kenneth felt his hot wineladen breath upon his cheek cowed by his words his gesture and above all his glance the lad drew up a chair mumbling in explanationintended as an excuse to himself for his weaknessthat he submitted since a mans life was at stake  opposite him galliard resumed his seat with a mocking smile that made him wince taking up the cards he flung a portion of them to the boy whilst those he retained he spread fanwise in his hand as if about to play silently kenneth copied his actions  nearer and louder grew the sounds of the approach lights flashed before the window and the two men feigning to play sat on and waited  have a care master stewart growled crispin sourly then in a louder voicefor his quick eye had caught a glimpse of a face that watched them from the windowi play the king of spades he cried with meaning look  a blow was struck upon the door and with it came the command to open in the kings name softly sir crispin rapped out an oath then he rose and with a last look of warning to kenneth he went to open and as he had greeted hogan he now greeted the crowd mainly of soldiersthat surged about the threshold  sirs why this ado hath the sultan oliver descended upon us  in one hand he still held his cards the other he rested upon the edge of the open door it was a young ensign who stood forward to answer him  one of lord middletons officers hath done a man to death not half an hour agone he is an irishman captain hogan by name  hoganhogan repeated crispin after the manner of one who fumbles in his memory ah yesan irishman with a grey head and a hot temper and he is dead you say  nay he has done the killing  that i can better understand tis not the first time ill be sworn  but it will be the last sir crispin  like enough the king is severe since we crossed the border then in a brisker tone i thank you for bringing me this news said he and i regret that in my poor house there be naught i can offer you wherein to drink his majestys health ere you proceed upon your search give you good night sir and by drawing back a pace he signified his wish to close the door and be quit of them  we thought faltered the young officer thatthat perchance you would assist us by  assist you roared crispin with a fine assumption of anger assist you take a man sink me sir i would have you know i am a soldier not a tipstaff  the ensigns cheeks grew crimson under the sting of that veiled insult  there are some sir crispin that have yet another name for you  like enoughwhen i am not by sneered crispin the world is full of foul tongues in craven heads but sirs the night air is chill and you are come inopportunely for as youll perceive i was at play haply youll suffer me to close the door  a moment sir crispin we must search this house he is believed to have come this way  crispin yawned i will spare you the trouble you may take it from me that he could not be here without my knowledge i have been in this room these two hours past  twill not suffice returned the officer doggedly we must satisfy ourselves  satisfy yourselves echoed the other in tones of deep amazement what better satisfaction can i afford you than my word swounds sir jackanapes he added in a roar that sent the lieutenant back a pace as though he had been struck am i to take it that your errand is a trumpedup business to affront me first you invite me to turn tipstaff then you add your cursed innuendoes of what people say of me and now you end by doubting me you must satisfy yourself he thundered waxing fiercer at every word linger another moment on that threshold and dn me sir ill give you satisfaction of another flavour be off  before that hurricane of passion the ensign recoiled despite himself  i will appeal to general montgomery he threatened  appeal to the devil had you come hither with your errand in a seemly fashion you had found my door thrown wide in welcome and i had received you courteously as it is sir the cause for complaint is on my side and complain i will we shall see whether the king permits an old soldier who has followed the fortunes of his family these eighteen years to be flouted by a malapert bantam of yesterdays brood  the subaltern paused in dismay some demur there was in the gathered crowd then the officer fell back a pace and consulted an elderly trooper at his elbow the trooper was of opinion that the fugitive must have gone farther moreover he could not think from what sir crispin had said that it would have been possible for hogan to have entered the house with this and realizing that much trouble and possible loss of time must result from sir crispins obstinacy did they attempt to force a way into the house and bethinking himself also maybe how well this rascally ruffler stood with lord middleton the ensign determined to withdraw and to seek elsewhere  and so he took his leave with a venomous glance and a parting threat to bring the matter to the kings ears upon which galliard slammed the door before he had finished  there was a curious smile on crispins face as he walked slowly to the table and resumed his seat  master stewart he whispered as he spread his cards anew the comedy is not yet played out there is a face glued to the window at this moment and i make little doubt that for the next hour or so we shall be spied upon that pretty fellow was born to be a thieftaker  the boy turned a glance of sour reproof upon his companion he had not stirred from his chair while crispin had been at the door  you lied to them he said at last  sh not so loud sweet youth was the answer that lost nothing of menace by being subdued tomorrow if you please i will account to you for offending your delicate soul by suggesting a falsehood in your presence tonight we have a mans life to save and that i think is work enough come master stewart we are being watched let us resume our game  his eye fixed in cold command upon the boy compelled obedience and the lad more out of awe of that glance than out of any desire to contribute to the saving of hogan mutely consented to keep up this pretence but in his soul he rebelled he had been reared in an atmosphere of honourable and religious bigotry hogan was to him a coarse ruffler an evil man of the sword such a man as he abhorred and accounted a disgrace to any armyparticularly to an army launched upon england under the auspices of the solemn league and covenant  hogan had been guilty of an act of brutality he had killed a man and kenneth deemed himself little better since he assisted in harbouring instead of discovering him as he held to be his duty but neath the suasion of galliards inexorable eye he sat limp and docile vowing to himself that on the morrow he would lay the matter before lord middleton and thus not only endeavour to make amends for his present guilty silence but rid himself also of the companionship of this ruffianly sir crispin to whom no doubt a hempen justice would be meted  meanwhile he sat on and left his companions occasional sallies unanswered in the street men stirred and lanthorns gleamed fitfully whilst ever and anon a face surmounted by a morion would be pressed against the leaded panes of the window  thus an hour wore itself out during which poor hogan sat above alone with his anxiety and unsavoury thoughts     chapter ii arcades ambo   towards midnight at last sir crispin flung down his cards and rose it was close upon an hour and a half since hogans advent in the streets the sounds had gradually died down and peace seemed to reign again in penrith yet was sir crispin cautiousfor to be cautious and mistrustful of appearances was the lesson life had taught him  master stewart said he it grows late and i doubt me you would be abed give you good night  the lad rose a moment he paused hesitating then  tomorrow sir crispin he began but crispin cut him short  leave tomorrow till it dawn my friend give you good night take one of those noisome tapers with you and go  in sullen silence the boy took up one of the candlebearing bottles and passed out through the door leading to the stairs  for a moment crispin remained standing by the table and in that moment the expression of his face was softened a momentary regret of his treatment of the boy stirred in him master stewart might be a milksop but crispin accounted him leastways honest and had a kindness for him in spite of all he crossed to the window and throwing it wide he leaned out as if to breathe the cool night air what time he hummed the refrain of rubadubdub for the edification of any chance listeners  for a halfhour he lingered there and for all that he used the occasion to let his mind stray over many a theme his eyes were alert for the least movement among the shadows of the street reassured at last that the house was no longer being watched he drew back and closed the lattice  upstairs he found the irishman seated in dejection upon his bed awaiting him  soul of my body cried hogan ruefully i was never nearer being afraid in my life  crispin laughed softly for answer and besought of him the tale of what had passed  tis simple enough faith said hogan coolly the landlord of the angel hath a daughter maybe twas after her he named his innwho owns a pair of the most seductive eyes that ever a man saw perdition in she hath moreover a taste for dalliance and my brave looks and martial trappings did for her what her bold eyes had done for me we were becoming the sweetest friends when like an incarnate fiend that loutish clown her lover sweeps down upon us and with more jealousy than wit struck mestruck me harry hogan soul of my body think of it cris and he grew red with anger at the recollection i took him by the collar of his mean smock and flung him into the kennelthe fittest bed he ever lay in had he remained there it had been well for him but the fool accounting himself affronted came up to demand satisfaction i gave it him and plague on ithes dead  an ugly tale was crispins sour comment  ugly maybe returned hogan spreading out his palms but what choice had i the fool came at me bilbo in hand and i was forced to draw  but not to slay hogan  twas an accident sink me it was i sought his swordarm but the light was bad and my point went through his chest instead  for a moment crispin stood frowning then his brow cleared as though he had put the matter from him  well wellsince hes dead theres an end to it  heaven rest his soul muttered the irishman crossing himself piously and with that he dismissed the subject of the great wrong that through folly he had wroughtthe wanton destruction of a mans life and the poisoning of a womans with a remorse that might be everlasting  it will tax our wits to get you out of penrith said crispin then turning and looking into the irishmans great goodhumoured facei am sorry you leave us hogan he added  not so am i quoth hogan with a shrug such a march as this is little to my taste bah charles stuart or oliver cromwell tis all one to me what care i whether king or commonwealth prevail shall harry hogan be the better or the richer under one than under the other oddslife cris i have trailed a pike or handled a sword in wellnigh every army in europe i know more of the great art of war than all the kings generals rolled into one think you then i can rest content with a miserable company of horse when plunder is forbidden and even our beggarly pay doubtful whilst should things go illas well they may faith with an army ruled by parsonsthe wage will be a swift death on field or gallows or a lingering one in the plantations as fell to the lot of those poor wretches noll drove into england after dunbar soul of my body it is not thus that i had looked to fare when i took service at perth i had looked for plunder rich and plentiful plunder according to the usages of warfare as a fitting reward for a toilsome march and the perils gone through  thus i know war and for this have i followed the trade these twenty years instead we have thirty thousand men marching to battle as prim and orderly as a parcel of acolytes in a corpuschristi procession twas not so bad in scotland haply because the country holds naught a man may profitably plunderbut since we have crossed the border slife theyll hang you if you steal so much as a kiss from a wench in passing  why true laughed crispin the second charles hath an overtender stomach he will not allow that we are marching through an enemys country he insists that england is his kingdom forgetting that he has yet to conquer it and  was it not also his fathers kingdom broke in the impetuous hogan yet times are sorely changed since we followed the fortunes of the martyr in those days you might help yourself to a capon a horse a wench or any other trifle of the enemys without ever a word of censure or a question asked why man it is but two days since his majesty had a poor devil hanged at kendal for laying violent hands upon a pullet pox on it cris my gorge rises at the thought when i saw that wretch strung up i swore to fall behind at the earliest opportunity and tonights affair makes this imperative  and what may your plans be asked crispin  war is my trade not a diversion as it is with wilmot and buckingham and the other pretty gentlemen of our train and since the kings army is like to yield me no profit faith ill turn me to the parliaments if i get out of penrith with my life ill shave my beard and cut my hair to a comely and godly length don a cuckoldy steeple hat and a black coat and carry my sword to cromwell with a line of text  sir crispin fell to pondering noting this and imagining that he guessed aright the reason  i take it cris he put in keenly glancing at the other that you are much of my mind  maybe i am replied crispin carelessly  why then cried hogan need we part company  there was a sudden eagerness in his tone born of the admiration in which this rough soldier of fortune held one whom he accounted his better in that same harsh trade but galliard answered coldly  you forget harry  not so surely on cromwells side your object  tsh i have well considered my fortunes are bound up with the kings in his victory alone lies profit for me not the profit of pillage hogan but the profit of those broad lands that for nigh upon twenty years have been in usurping hands the profit i look for hogan is my restoration to castle marleigh and of this my only hope lies in the restoration of king charles if the king doth not prevailwhich god forfendwhy then i can but die i shall have naught left to hope for from life so you see good hogan he ended with a regretful smile my going with you is not to be dreamed of  still the irishman urged him and a good halfhour did he devote to it but in vain realizing at last the futility of his endeavours he sighed and moved uneasily in his chair whilst the broad tanned face was clouded with regret crispin saw this and approaching him he laid a hand upon his shoulder  i had counted upon your help to clear the ashburns from castle marleigh and to aid me in my grim work when the time is ripe but if you go  faith i may aid you yet who shall say then of a sudden there crept into the voice of this hardened piketrader a note of soft concern think you there be danger to yourself in remaining he inquired  danger to me echoed crispin  ayefor having harboured me that whelp of montgomerys foot suspects you  suspects am i a man of straw to be overset by a breath of suspicion  there is your lieutenant kenneth stewart  who has been a party to your escape and whose only course is therefore silence lest he set a noose about his own neck come harry he added briskly changing his manner the night wears on and we have your safety to think of  hogan rose with a sigh  give me a horse said he and by gods grace tomorrow shall find me in cromwells camp heaven prosper and reward you cris  we must find you clothes more fitting than thesea coat more staid and better attuned to the puritan part you are to play  where have you such a coat  my lieutenant has he affects the godly black from a habit taken in that presbyterian scotland of his  but i am twice his bulk  better a tight coat to your back than a tight rope to your neck harry wait  taking a taper he left the room to return a moment later with the coat that kenneth had worn that day and which he had abstracted from the sleeping lads chamber  off with your doublet he commanded and as he spoke he set himself to empty the pocket of kenneths garment a handkerchief and a few papers he found in them and these he tossed carelessly on the bed next he assisted the irishman to struggle into the stolen coat  may the lord forgive my sins groaned hogan as he felt the cloth straining upon his back and cramping his limbs may he forgive me and see me safely out of penrith and into cromwells camp and never again will i resent the resentment of a clown whose sweetheart i have made too free with  pluck that feather from your hat said crispin  hogan obeyed him with a sigh  truly it is written in scripture that man in his time plays many parts who would have thought to see harry hogan playing the puritan  unless you improve your acquaintance with scripture you are not like to play it long laughed crispin as he surveyed him there man youll do well enough your coat is somewhat tight in the back somewhat short in the skirt but neither so tight nor so short but that it may be preferred to a windingsheet and that is the alternative harry  hogan replied by roundly cursing the coat and his own lucklessness that doneand in no measured termshe pronounced himself ready to set out whereupon crispin led the way below once more and out into a hut that did service as a stable  by the light of a lanthorn he saddled one of the two nags that stood there and led it into the yard opening the door that abutted on to a field beyond he bade hogan mount he held his stirrup for him and cutting short the irishmans voluble expressions of gratitude he gave him god speed and urged him to use all dispatch in setting as great a distance as possible betwixt himself and penrith before the dawn     chapter iii the letter   it was with a countenance sadly dejected that crispin returned to his chamber and sate himself wearily upon the bed with elbows on his knees and chin in his palms he stared straight before him the usual steely brightness of his grey eyes dulled by the despondency that sat upon his face and drew deep furrows down his fine brow  with a sigh he rose at last and idly fingered the papers he had taken from the pocket of kenneths coat as he did so his glance was arrested by the signature at the foot of one gregory ashburn was the name he read  ashen grew his cheeks as his eyes fastened upon that name whilst the hand to which no peril ever brought a tremor shook now like an aspen feverishly he spread the letter on his knee and with a glance from dull that it had been grown of a sudden fierce and cruel he read the contents    dear kenneth  again i write in the hope that i may prevail upon you to quit scotland and your attachment to a king whose fortunes prosper not nor can prosper cynthia is pining and if you tarry longer from castle marleigh she must perforce think you but a laggard lover than this i have no more powerful argument wherewith to draw you from perth to sheringham but this i think should prevail where others have failed me we await you then and whilst we wait we daily drink your health cynthia commends herself to your memory as doth my brother and soon we hope to welcome you at castle marleigh believe my dear kenneth that whilst i am i am yours in affection                                               gregory ashburn  twice crispin read the letter through then with set teeth and straining eyes he sat lost in thought  here indeed was a strange chance this boy whom he had met at perth and enrolled in his company was a friend of ashburnsthe lover of cynthia who might this cynthia be  long and deep were his ponderings upon the unfathomable ways of fatefor fate he now believed was here at work to help him revealing herself by means of this sign even at the very moment when he decried his luck in memory he reviewed his meeting with the lad in the yard of perth castle a fortnight ago something in the boys bearing in his air had caught crispins eye he had looked him over then approached and bluntly asked his name and on what business he was come there the youth had answered him civilly enough that he was kenneth stewart of bailienochy and that he was come to offer his sword to the king thereupon he had interested himself in the lads behalf and had gained him a lieutenancy in his own company why he was attracted to a youth on whom never before had he set eyes was a matter that puzzled him not a little now he held he thought the explanation of it it was the way of fate  this boy was sent into his life by a heaven that at last showed compassion for the deep wrongs he had suffered sent him as a key wherewith should the need occur to open him the gates of castle marleigh  in long strides he paced the chamber turning the matter over in his mind aye he would use the lad should the need arise why scruple had he ever received aught but disdain and scorn at the hands of kenneth  day was breaking ere he sought his bed and already the sun was up when at length he fell into a troubled sleep vowing that he would mend his wild ways and seek to gain the boys favour against the time when he might have need of him  when later he restored the papers to kenneth explaining to what use he had put the coat he refrained from questioning him concerning gregory ashburn the docility of his mood on that occasion came as a surprise to kenneth who set it down to sir crispins desire to conciliate him into silence touching the harbouring of hogan in that same connexion crispin showed him calmly and clearly that he could not now inform without involving himself to an equally dangerous extent and partly through the fear of this partly won over by crispins persuasions the lad determined to hold his peace  nor had he cause to regret it thereafter for throughout that tedious march he found his roystering companion singularly meek and kindly indeed he seemed a different man his old swagger and roaring bluster disappeared he drank less diced less blasphemed less and stormed less than in the old days before the halt at penrith but rode a silent thoughtful figure so selfcontained and of so godly a mien as would have rejoiced the heart of the sourest puritan the wild tantivy boy had vanished and the sobriquet of tavern knight was fast becoming a misnomer  kenneth felt drawn more towards him deeming him a penitent that had seen at last the error of his ways and thus things prevailed until the almost triumphal entry into the city of worcester on the twentythird of august     chapter iv at the sign of the mitre   for a week after the coming of the king to worcester crispins relations with kenneth steadily improved by an evil chance however there befell on the eve of the battle that which renewed with heightened intensity the enmity which the lad had fostered for him but which lately he had almost overcome  the scene of this happeningleastways of that which led to itwas the mitre inn in the high street of worcester  in the commonroom one day sat as merry a company of carousers as ever gladdened the soul of an old tantivy boy youthful ensigns of lesleys scottish horsecaring never a fig for the solemn league and covenantrubbed shoulders with beribboned cavaliers of lord talbots company gay young lairds of pitscotties highlanders unmindful of the kirks harsh commandments of sobriety sat cheek by jowl with rakehelly officers of dalzells brigade and pledged the king in many a stoup of canary and many a can of stout march ale  on every hand spirits ran high and laughter filled the chamber the mirth of some having its source in a neighbours quip that of others having no source at all save in the wine they had taken  at one table sat a gentleman of the name of faversham who had ridden on the previous night in that illfated camisado that should have resulted in the capture of cromwell at spetchley but which owing to a betrayalwhen was a stuart not betrayed and soldmiscarried he was relating to the group about him the details of that disaster  oddslife gentlemen he was exclaiming i tell you that but for that roaring dog sir crispin galliard the whole of middletons regiment had been cut to pieces there we stood on red hill trapped as ever fish in a net with the whole of lilburnes men rising out of the ground to enclose and destroy us a living wall of steel it was and on every hand the call to surrender there was dismay in my heart as ill swear there was dismay in the heart of every man of us and i make little doubt gentlemen that with but scant pressing we had thrown down our arms so disheartened were we by that ambush then of a sudden there arose above the clatter of steel and puritan cries a loud clear defiant shout of hey for cavaliers  i turned and there in his stirrups stood that madman galliard waving his sword and holding his company together with the power of his will his courage and his voice the sight of him was like wine to our blood into them gentlemen follow me he roared and then with a hurricane of oaths he hurled his company against the pikemen the blow was irresistible and above the din of it came that voice of his again up cavaliers slash the cuckolds to ribbons gentlemen the cropears gave way and like a river that has burst its dam we poured through the opening in their ranks and headed back for worcester  there was a roar of voices as faversham ended and around that table the tavern knight was for some minutes the only toast  meanwhile half a dozen merrymakers at a table hard by having drunk themselves out of all sense of fitness were occupied in baiting a palefaced lad sombrely attired who seemed sadly out of place in that wild companyindeed he had been better advised to have avoided it  the matter had been set afoot by a pleasantry of ensign tylers of masseys dragoons with a playful allusion to a letter in a feminine hand which kenneth had let fall and which tyler had restored to him quip had followed quip until in their jests they transcended all bounds livid with passion and unable to endure more kenneth had sprung up  damnation he blazed bringing his clenched hand down upon the table one more of your foul jests and he that utters it shall answer to me  the suddenness of his action and the fierceness of his tone and gesturea fierceness so grotesquely illattuned to his slender frame and clerkly attire left the company for a moment speechless with amazement then a mighty burst of laughter greeted him above which sounded the shrill voice of tyler who held his sides and down whose crimson cheeks two tears of mirth were trickling  oh fie fie good master stewart he gasped what think you would the reverend elders say to this bellicose attitude and this profane tongue of yours  and what think you would the king say to this drunken poltroonery of yours was the hot unguarded answer poltroonery i say he repeated embracing the whole company in his glance  the laughter died down as kenneths insult penetrated their befuddled minds an instants lull there was like the lull in nature that precedes a clap of thunder then as with one accord a dozen of them bore down upon him  it was a vile thing they did perhaps but then they had drunk deep and kenneth stewart counted no friend amongst them in an instant they had him kicking and biting on the floor his doublet was torn rudely open and from his breast tyler plucked the letter whose existence had led to this shameless scene  but ere he could so much as unfold it a voice rang harsh and imperative  hold  pausing they turned to confront a tall gaunt man in a leather jerkin and a broad hat decked by goosequill who came slowly forward  the tavern knight cried one and the shout of a rouse for the hero of red hill was taken up on every hand for despite his sour visage and ungracious ways there was not a roysterer in the royal army to whom he was not dear  but as he now advanced the coldness of his bearing and the forbidding set of his face froze them into silence  give me that letter he demanded sternly of tyler  taken aback tyler hesitated for a second whilst crispin waited with hand outstretched vainly did he look round for sign or word of help or counsel none was afforded him by his fellowrevellers who one and all hung back in silence  seeing himself thus unsupported and far from wishing to try conclusions with galliard tyler with an ill grace surrendered the paper and with a pleasant bow and a word of thanks delivered with never so slight a saturnine smile crispin turned on his heel and left the tavern as abruptly as he had entered it  the din it was that had attracted him as he passed by on his way to the episcopal palace where a part of his company was on guard duty thither he now pursued his way bearing with him the letter which so opportunely he had become possessed of and which he hoped might throw further light upon kenneths relations with the ashburns  but as he reached the palace there was a quick step behind him and a hand fell upon his arm he turned  ah tis you kenneth he muttered and would have passed on but the boys hand took him by the sleeve  sir crispin said he i came to thank you  i have done nothing to deserve your thanks give you good evening and he made shift to mount the steps when again kenneth detained him  you are forgetting the letter sir crispin he ventured and he held out his hand to receive it  galliard saw the gesture and for a moment it crossed his mind in selfreproach that the part he chose to play was that of a bully a second he hesitated should he surrender the letter unread and fight on without the aid of the information it might bring him then the thought of ashburn and of his own deep wrongs that cried out for vengeance overcame and stifled the generous impulse his manner grew yet more frozen as he made answer  there has been too much ado about this letter to warrant my so lightly parting with it first i will satisfy myself that i have been no unconscious abettor of treason you shall have your letter tomorrow master stewart  treason echoed kenneth and before that cold rebuff of crispins his mood changed from conciliatory to resentfulresentful towards the fates that made him this mans debtor  i assure you on my honour said he mastering his feelings that this is but a letter from the lady i hope to make my wife assuredly sir you will not now insist upon reading it  assuredly i shall  but sir  master stewart i am resolved and were you to talk from now till doomsday you would not turn me from my purpose so good night to you  sir crispin cried the boy his voice quavering with passion while i live you shall not read that letter  hoitytoity sir what words what heroics and yet you would have me believe this paper innocent  as innocent as the hand that penned it and if i so oppose your reading it it is because thus much i owe her believe me sir he added his accents returning to a beseeching key when again i swear that it is no more than such a letter any maid may write her lover i thought that you had understood all this when you rescued me from those bullies at the mitre i thought that what you did was a noble and generous deed instead the lad paused  continue sir galliard requested coldly instead  there can be no instead sir crispin you will not mar so good an action now you will give me my letter will you not  callous though he was crispin winced the breeding of earlier daysso sadly warped alascried out within him against the lie that he was acting by pretending to suspect treason in that womans pothooks instincts of gentility and generosity long dead took life again resuscitated by that call of conscience he was conquered  there take your letter boy and plague me no more he growled as he held it out to kenneth and without waiting for reply or acknowledgment he turned on his heel and entered the palace but he had yielded overlate to leave a good impression and as kenneth turned away it was with a curse upon galliard for whom his detestation seemed to increase at every step     chapter v after worcester field   the morn of the third of septemberthat date so propitious to cromwell so disastrous to charlesfound crispin the centre of a company of gentlemen in battleharness assembled at the mitre inn for a toast he gave them the damnation of all cropears  sirs quoth he a fair beginning to a fair day god send the evening find us as merry  it was not to be his good fortune however to be in the earlier work of the day until afternoon he was kept within the walls of worcester chafing to be where hard knocks were being dealtwith montgomery at powick bridge or with pittscottie on bunns hill but he was forced to hold his mood in curb and wait until charles and his advisers should elect to make the general attack  it came at last and with it came the disastrous news that montgomery was routed and pittscottie in full retreat whilst dalzell had surrendered and keith was taken then was it that the main body of the royal army formed up at the sidbury gate and crispin found himself in the centre which was commanded by the king in person in the brilliant charge that followed there was no more conspicuous figure no voice rang louder in encouragement to the men for the first time that day cromwells ironsides gave back before the royalists who in that fierce irresistible charge swept all before them until they had reached the battery on perry wood and driven the roundheads from it helltoleather  it was a glorious moment a moment in which the fortunes of the day hung in the balance the turn of the tide it seemed to them at last  crispin was among the first to reach the guns and with a great shout of hurrah for cavaliers he had cut down two gunners that yet lingered his cry lacked not an echo and a deafening cheer broke upon the clamorous air as the royalists found themselves masters of the position up the hill on either side pressed the duke of hamilton and the earl of derby to support the king it but remained for lesleys scottish horse to follow and complete the rout of the parliamentarian forces had they moved at that supreme moment who shall say what had been the issue of worcester field but they never stirred and the royalists waiting on perry wood cursed lesley for a foul traitor who had sold his king  with bitterness did they then realize that their great effort was to be barren their gallant charge in vain unsupported their position grew fast untenable  and presently when cromwell had gathered his scattered ironsides that gallant host was driven fighting down the hill and back to the shelter of worcester with the roundheads pressing hotly upon them they gained at last the sidbury gate but only to find that an overset ammunition wagon blocked the entrance in this plight and without attempting to move it they faced about to make a last stand against the puritan onslaught  charles had flung himself from his charger and climbed the obstruction and in this he was presently followed by others amongst whom was crispin  in the high street galliard came upon the king mounted on a fresh horse addressing a scottish regiment of foot the soldiers had thrown down their arms and stood sullenly before him refusing to obey his command to take them up again and help him attempt even at that late hour to retrieve the fortunes of the day crispin looked on in scorn and loathing his passions awakened at the sight of lesleys inaction needed but this last breath to fan it into a very blaze of wrath and what he said to them touching themselves their country and the kirk committee that had made sheep of them was so bitter and contemptuous that none but men in the most parlous and pitiable of conditions could have suffered it  he was still hurling vituperations at them when colonel pride with a troop of parliamentarian horsehaving completely overcome the resistance at the sidbury gaterode into the town at the news of this crispin made a last appeal to the infantry  afoot you scottish curs he thundered would you rather be cut to pieces as you stand up you dogs and since you know not how to live die at least without shame  but in vain did he rail in sullen quiet they remained their weapons on the ground before them and then as crispin was turning away to see to his own safety the king rode up again and again he sought to revive the courage that was dead in those scottish hearts if they would not stand by him he cried at last let them slay him there sooner than that he should be taken captive to perish on the scaffold  while he was still urging them crispin unceremoniously seized his bridle  will you stand here until you are taken sire he cried leave them and look to your safety  charles turned a wondering eye upon the resolute battlegrimed face of the man that thus addressed him a faint sad smile parted his lips  you are right sir he made answer attend me and turning about he rode down a side street with galliard following closely in his wake  with the intention of doffing his armour and changing his apparel he made for the house in new street where he had been residing as they drew up before the door crispin chancing to look over his shoulder rapped out an oath  hasten sire he exclaimed here is a portion of colonels prides troop  the king looked round and at sight of the parliamentarians it is ended he muttered despairingly but already crispin had sprung from his horse  dismount sire he roared and he assisted him so vigorously as to appear to drag him out of the saddle  which way demanded charles looking helplessly from left to right which way  but crispins quick mind had already shaped a plan seizing the royal armfor who in such straits would deal ceremoniouslyhe thrust the king across the threshold and following closed the door and shot its only bolt but the shout set up by the puritans announced to them that their movement had been detected  the king turned upon sir crispin and in the halflight of the passage wherein they stood galliard made out the frown that bent the royal brows  and now demanded charles a note almost of reproach in his voice  and now begone sire returned the knight begone ere they come  begone echoed charles in amazement but whither sir whither and how  his last words were almost drowned in the din without as the roundheads pulled up before the house  by the back sire was the impatient answer through door or windowas best you can the back must overlook the cornmarket that is your way but hastenin gods name hastenere they bethink them of it and cut off your retreat  as he spoke a violent blow shook the door  quick your majesty he implored in a frenzy  charles moved to depart then paused but you sir do you not come with me  crispin stamped his foot and turned a face livid with impatience upon his king in that moment all distinction of rank lay forgotten  i must remain he answered speaking quickly that crazy door will not hold for a second once a stout man sets his shoulder to it after the door they will find me and for your sake i trust i may prove of stouter stuff fare you well sire he ended in a softer tone god guard your majesty and send you happier days  and bending his knee crispin brushed the royal hand with his hot lips  a shower of blows clattered upon the timbers of the door and one of its panels was splintered by a musketshot charles saw it and with a muttered word that was not caught by crispin he obeyed the knight and fled  scarce had he disappeared down that narrow passage when the door gave way completely and with a mighty crash fell in over the ruins of it sprang a young puritanscarce more than a boyshouting the lord of hosts  but ere he had taken three strides the point of crispins tucksword gave him pause  halt you cannot pass this way  back son of moab was the roundheads retort hinder me not at your peril  behind him in the doorway pressed others who cried out to him to cut down the amalekite that stood between them and the young man charles stuart but crispin laughed grimly for answer and kept the officer in check with his point  back or i cut you down threatened the roundhead i am seeking the malignant stuart  if by those blasphemous words you mean his sacred majesty learn that he is where you will never bein gods keeping  presumptuous hound stormed the lad giveway  their swords met and for a moment they ground one against the other then crispins blade darted out swift as a lightning flash and took his opponent in the throat  you would have it so rash fool he deprecated  the boy hurtled back into the arms of those behind and as he fell he dropped his rapier which rolled almost to crispins feet the knight stooped and when again he stood erect confronting the rebels in that narrow passage he held a sword in either hand  there was a momentary pause in the onslaught then to his dismay crispin saw the barrel of a musket pointed at him over the shoulder of one of his foremost assailants he set his teeth for what was to come and braced himself with the hope that the king might already have made good his escape  the end was at hand he thought and a fitting end since his last hope of redress was gonedestroyed by that fatal days defeat  but of a sudden a cry rang out in a voice wherein rage and anguish were blended fearfully and simultaneously the musket barrel was dashed aside  take him alive was the cry of that voice take him alive it was colonel pride himself who having pushed his way forward now beheld the bleeding body of the youth crispin had slain take him alive roared the old man then his voice changing to one of exquisite agonymy son my boy he moaned  at a glance crispin caught the situation but the old puritans grief left him unmoved  you must have me alive he laughed grimly gadslife but the honour is like to cost you dear well sirs who will be next to court the distinction of dying by the sword of a gentleman he mocked them come on you sons of dogs  his answer was an angry growl and straightway two men sprang forward more than two could not attack him at once by virtue of the narrowness of the passage again steel clashed on steel crispinlithe as a panther crouched low and took one of their swords on each of his  a disengage and a double he foiled with ease then by a turn of the wrist he held for a second one opponents blade and before the fellow could disengage again he had brought his righthand sword across and stabbed him in the neck simultaneously his other opponent had rushed in and thrust it was a risk crispin was forced to take trusting to his armour to protect him it did him the service he hoped from it the troopers sword glanced harmlessly aside whilst the fellow himself overbalanced by the fury of his onslaught staggered helplessly forward ere he could recover crispin had spitted him from side to side betwixt the straps that held his back and breast together  as the two men went down one after the other the watching troopers set up a shout of rage and pressed forward in a body but the tavern knight stood his ground and his points danced dangerously before the eyes of the two foremost alarmed they shouted to those behind to give them room to handle their swords but too late crispin had seen the advantage and taken it twice he had thrust and another two sank bleeding to the ground  at that there came a pause and somewhere in the street a knot of them expostulated with colonel pride and begged to be allowed to pick off that murderous malignant with their pistols but the griefstricken father was obdurate he would have the amalekite alive that he might cause him to die a hundred deaths in one  and so two more were sent in to try conclusions with the indomitable galliard they went to work more warily he on the left parried crispins stroke then knocking up the knights blade he rushed in and seized his wrist shouting to those behind to follow up but even as he did so crispin sent back his other antagonist howling and writhing with the pain of a transfixed swordarm and turned his full attention upon the foe that clung to him not a second did he waste in thought to have done so would have been fatal instinctively he knew that whilst he shortened his blade others would rush in so turning his wrist he caught the man a crushing blow full in the face with the pommel of his disengaged sword  fulminated by that terrific stroke the man reeled back into the arms of another who advanced  again there fell a pause then silently a roundhead charged sir crispin with a pike he leapt nimbly aside and the murderous lunge shot past him as he did so he dropped his lefthand sword and caught at the halberd exerting his whole strength in a mighty pull he brought the fellow that wielded it toppling forward and received him on his outstretched blade  covered with bloodthe blood of otherscrispin stood before them now he was breathing hard and sweating at every pore but still grim and defiant his strength he realized was ebbing fast yet he shook himself and asked them with a gibing laugh did they not think that they had better shoot him  the roundheads paused again the fight had lasted but a few moments and already five of them were stretched upon the ground and a sixth disabled there was something in the tavern knights attitude and terrific bloodbespattered appearance that deterred them from out of his powderblackened face his eyes flashed fiercely and a mocking diabolical smile played round the corners of his mouth what manner of man they asked themselves was this who could laugh in such an extremity superstition quickened their alarm as they gazed upon his undaunted front and told themselves this was no man they fought against but the foul fiend himself  well sirs he mocked them presently how long am i to await your pleasure  they snarled for answer yet hung back until colonel prides voice shook them into action in a body they charged him now so suddenly and violently that he was forced to give way cunningly did he ply his sword before them but ineffectually they had adopted fresh tactics and engaging his blade they acted cautiously and defensively advancing steadily and compelling him to fall back  sir crispin guessed their scheme at last and vainly did he try to hold his ground his retreat slackened perhaps but it was still a retreat and their defensive action gave him no opening vainly yet by every trick of fence he was master of did he seek to lure the two foremost into attacking him stolidly they pursued the adopted plan and steadily they impelled him backward  at last he reached the staircase and he realized that did he allow himself to go farther he was lost irretrievably yet farther was he driven despite the strenuous efforts he put forth until on his right there was room for a man to slip on to the stairs and take him in the flank twice one of his opponents essayed it and twice did galliards deadly point repel him but at the third attempt the man got through another stepped into his place in front and thus from two crispins immediate assailants became increased to three  he realized that the end was at hand and wildly did he lay about him but to no purpose and presently he who had gained the stairs leaped suddenly upon him sideways and clung to his swordarm before he could make a move to shake himself free the two that faced him had caught at his other arm  like one possessed he struggled then for the sheer lust of striving but they that held him gripped effectively  thrice they bore him struggling to the ground and thrice he rose again and sought to shake them from him as a bull shakes off a pack of dogs but they held fast and again they forced him down others sprang to their aid and the tavern knight could rise no more  disarm the dog cried pride disarm and truss him hand and foot  sirs you need not he answered gasping i yield me take my sword ill do your bidding  the fight was fought and lost but it had been a great homeric struggle and he rejoiced almost that upon so worthy a scene of his life was the curtain to fall and again to hope that thanks to the stand he had made the king should have succeeded in effecting his escape     chapter vi companions in misfortune   through the streets of worcester the roundheads dragged sir crispin and for all that he was as hard and callous a man as any that ever buckled on a cuirass the horrors that in going he beheld caused him more than once to shudder  the place was become a shambles and the very kennels ran with blood the royalist defeat was by now complete and cromwells fanatic butchers overran the town vying to outdo one another in savage cruelty and murder houses were being broken into and plundered and their inmatesresisting or unresisting armed or unarmed men women and children alike were pitilessly being put to the sword charged was the air of worcester with the din of that fierce massacre the crashing of shivered timbers as doors were beaten in mingled with the clatter and grind of sword on sword the crack of musket and pistol the clank of armour and the stamping of men and horses in that troubled hour  and above all rang out the fierce raucous blasphemy of the slayers and the shrieks of agony the groans the prayers and curses of their victims  all this sir crispin saw and heard and in the misery of it all he for the while forgot his own sorry condition and left unheeded the pikebutt wherewith the puritan at his heels was urging him along  they paused at length in a quarter unknown to him before a tolerably large house its doors hung wide and across the threshold in and out moved two continuous streams of officers and men  a while crispin and his captors stood in the spacious hall then they ushered him roughly into one of the abutting rooms here he was brought face to face with a man of middle height red and coarse of countenance and large of nose who stood fully armed in the centre of the chamber his head was uncovered and on the table at his side stood the morion he had doffed he looked up as they entered and for a few seconds rested his glance sourly upon the lank boldeyed prisoner who coldly returned his stare  whom have we here he inquired at length his scrutiny having told him nothing  one whose offence is too heinous to have earned him a soldiers death my lord answered pride  therein you lie you damned rebel cried crispin if accuse you must announce the truth tell master cromwellfor he had guessed the mans identitythat singlehanded i held my own against you and a score of you curs and that not until i had cut down seven of them was i taken tell him that master psalmsinger and let him judge whether you lied or not tell him too that you who  have done cried cromwell at length stamping his foot peace or ill have you gagged now colonel let us hear your accusation  at great length and with endless interlarding of proverbs did pride relate how this impious malignant had been the means of the young man charles stuart making good his escape when otherwise he must have fallen into their hands he accused him also of the murder of his son and of four other stout godfearing troopers and urged cromwell to let him deal with the malignant as he deserved  the lord generals answer took expression in a form that was little puritanical then checking himself  he is the second they have brought me within ten minutes charged with the same offence said he the other one is a young fool who gave charles stuart his horse at saint martins gate but for him again the young man had been taken  so he has escaped cried crispin now god be praised  cromwell stared at him blankly for a moment then  you will do well sir he muttered sourly to address the lord on your own behalf as for that young man of baal your master rejoice not yet in his escape by the same crowning mercy in which the lord hath vouchsafed us victory today shall he also deliver the malignant youth into my hands for your share in retarding his capture your life sir shall pay forfeit you shall hang at daybreak together with that other malignant who assisted charles at the saint martins gate  i shall at least hang in good company said crispin pleasantly and for that sir i give you thanks  you will pass the night with that other fool cromwell continued without heeding the interruption and i pray that you may spend it in such meditation as shall fit you for your end take him away  but my lord exclaimed pride advancing  what now  crispin caught not his answer but his halfwhispered words were earnest and pleading cromwell shook his head  i cannot sanction it let it satisfy you that he dies i condole with you in your bereavement but it is the fortune of war let the thought that your son died in a godly cause be of comfort to you bear in mind colonel pride that abraham hesitated not to offer up his child to the lord and so fare you well  colonel prides face worked oddly and his eyes rested for a second upon the stern unmoved figure of the tavern knight in malice and vindictiveness then shrugging his shoulders in token of unwilling resignation he withdrew whilst crispin was led out  in the hall again they kept him waiting for some moments until at length an officer came up and bidding him follow led the way to the guardroom here they stripped him of his backandbreast and when that was done the officer again led the way and crispin followed between two troopers they made him mount three flights of stairs and hurried him along a passage to a door by which a soldier stood mounting guard at a word from the officer the sentry turned and unfastening the heavy bolts he opened the door roughly the officer bade sir crispin enter and stood aside that he might pass  crispin obeyed him silently and crossed the threshold to find himself within a mean gloomy chamber and to hear the heavy door closed and made fast again behind him his stout heart sank a little as he realized that that closed door shut out to him the world for ever but once again would he cross that threshold and that would be the preface to the crossing of the greater threshold of eternity  then something stirred in one of that rooms dark corners and he started to see that he was not alone remembering that cromwell had said he was to have a companion in his last hours  who are you came a dull voicea voice that was eloquent of misery  master stewart he exclaimed recognizing his companion so it was you gave the king your horse at the saint martins gate may heaven reward you gadswounds he added i had little thought to meet you again this side the grave  would to heaven you had not was the doleful answer what make you here  by your good leave and with your help ill make as merry as a man may whose sands are all but run the lord generalwhom the devil roast in his time will make a pendulum of me at daybreak and gives me the night in which to prepare  the lad came forward into the light and eyed sir crispin sorrowfully  we are companions in misfortune then  were we ever companions in aught else come sir be of better cheer since it is to be our last night in this poor world let us spend it as pleasantly as may be  pleasantly  twill clearly be difficult answered crispin with a laugh were we in christian hands theyd not deny us a black jack over which to relish our last jest and to warm us against the night air which must be chill in this garret but these cropears he paused to peer into the pitcher on the table water pah a scurvy lot these psalmmongers  merciful heaven have you no thought for your end  every thought good youth every thought and i would fain prepare me for the mornings dance in a more jovial and hearty fashion than old noll will afford medamn him  kenneth drew back in horror his old dislike for crispin was all aroused by this indecent flippancy at such a time just then the thought of spending the night in his company almost effaced the horror of the gallows whereof he had been a prey  noting the movement crispin laughed disdainfully and walked towards the window it was a small opening by which two iron bars set crosswise defied escape moreover as crispin looked out he realized that a more effective barrier lay in the height of the window itself the house overlooked the river on that side it was built upon an embankment some thirty feet high around this at the base of the edifice and some forty feet below the window ran a narrow pathway protected by an iron railing but so narrow was it that had a man sprung from the casement of crispins prison it was odds he would have fallen into the river some seventy feet below crispin turned away with a sigh he had approached the window almost in hope he quitted it in absolute despair  ah well said he we will hang and theres the end of it  kenneth had resumed his seat in the corner and wrapped in his cloak he sat steeped in meditation his comely young face seared with lines of pain as crispin looked upon him then his heart softened and went out to the ladwent out as it had done on the night when first he had beheld him in the courtyard of perth castle  he recalled the details of that meeting he remembered the sympathy that had drawn him to the boy and how kenneth had at first appeared to reciprocate that feeling until he came to know him for the rakehelly godless ruffler that he was he thought of the gulf that gradually had opened up between them the lad was righteous and godfearing truthful and sober filled with stern ideals by which he sought to shape his life he had taxed crispin with his dissoluteness and crispin despising him for a milksop had returned to his disgust with mockery and had found a fiendish pleasure in arousing that disgust at every turn  tonight as crispin eyed the youth and remembered that at dawn he was to die in his company he realized that he had used him ill that his behaviour towards him had been that of the dissolute ruffler he was become rather than of the gentleman he had once accounted himself  kenneth he said at length and his voice bore so unusually mild a ring that the lad looked up in surprise i have heard tell that it is no uncommon thing for men upon the threshold of eternity to seek to repair some of the evil they may have done in life  kenneth shuddered crispins words reminded him again of his approaching end the ruffler paused a moment as if awaiting a reply or a word of encouragement then as none came he continued  i am not one of your repentant sinners kenneth i have lived my lifegod what a lifeand as i have lived i shall die unflinching and unchanged dare one to presume that a few hours spent in whining prayers shall atone for years of reckless dissoluteness tis a doctrine of cravens who having lacked in life the strength to live as conscience bade them lack in death the courage to stand by that lifes deeds i am no such traitor to myself if my life has been vile my temptations have been sore and the rest is in gods hands but in my course i have sinned against many men many a tall fellows life have i wantonly wrecked some indeed i have even taken in wantonness or anger they are not by nor were they could i now make amends but you at least are here and what little reparation may lie in asking pardon i can make when i first saw you at perth it was my wish to make you my frienda feeling i have not had these twenty years towards any man i failed how else could it have been the dove may not nest with the carrion bird  say no more sir cried kenneth genuinely moved and still more amazed by this curious humility in one whom he had never known other than arrogant and mocking i beseech you say no more for what trifling wrongs you may have done me i forgive you as freely as i would be forgiven is it not written that it shall be so and he held out his hand  a little more i must say kenneth answered the other leaving the outstretched hand unheeded the feeling that was born in me towards you at perth castle is on me again i seek not to account for it perchance it springs from my recognition of the difference betwixt us perchance i see in you a reflection of what once i was myselfhonourable and true but let that be the sun is setting over yonder and you and i will behold it no more that to me is a small thing i am weary hope is dead and when that is dead what does it signify that the body die also yet in these last hours that we shall spend together i would at least have your esteem i would have you forget my past harshness and the wrongs that i may have done you down to that miserable affair of your sweethearts letter yesterday i would have you realize that if i am vile i am but such as a vile world hath made me and tomorrow when we go forth together i would have you see in me at least a man in whose company you are not ashamed to die  again the lad shuddered  shall i tell you my story kenneth i have a strong desire to go over this poor life of mine again in memory and by giving my thoughts utterance it may be that they will take more vivid shape for the rest my tale may wile away a little of the time thats left and when you have heard me you shall judge me kenneth what say you  despite the parlous condition whereunto the fear of the morrow had reduced him this new tone of galliards so wrought upon him then that he was almost eager in his request that sir crispin should unfold his story and this the tavern knight then set himself to do     chapter vii the tavern knights story   sir crispin walked from the window by which he had been standing to the rough bed and flung himself full length upon it the only chair that dismal room contained was occupied by kenneth galliard heaved a sigh of physical satisfaction  fore george i knew not i was so tired he murmured and with that he lapsed for some moments into silence his brows contracted in the frown of one who collects his thoughts at length he began speaking in calm unemotional tones that held perchance deeper pathos than a more passionate utterance could have endowed them with  long agotwenty years agoi was as i have said an honourable lad to whom the world was a fair garden a place of rosebuds fragrant with hope those kenneth were my illusions they are the illusions of youth they are youth itself for when our illusions are gone we are no longer young no matter what years we count keep your illusions kenneth treasure them hoard them jealously for as long as you may  i dare swear sir answered the lad with bitter humour that such illusions as i have i shall treasure all my life you forget sir crispin  slife i had indeed forgotten for the moment i had gone back twenty years and tomorrow was none so near he laughed softly as though his lapse of memory amused him then he resumed  i was the only son kenneth of the noblest gentleman that ever livedthe heir to an ancient honoured name and to a castle as proud and lands as fair and broad as any in england  they lie who say that from the dawn we may foretell the day never was there a brighter dawn than that of my life never a day so wasted never an evening so dark but let that be  our lands were touched upon the northern side by those of a house with which we had been at feud for two hundred years and more puritans they were stern and haughty in their ungodly righteousness they held us dissolute because we enjoyed the life that god had given us and there i am told the hatred first began  when i was a lad of your years kenneth the hallours was the castle theirs the hallwas occupied by two young sparks who made little shift to keep up the pious reputation of their house they dwelt there with their mothera woman too weak to check their ways and holding mayhap herself views not altogether puritanical they discarded the sober black their forbears had worn for generations and donned gay cavalier garments they let their lovelocks grow set plumes in their castors and jewels in their ears they drank deep ruffled it with the boldest and decked their utterance with great oathsfor to none doth blasphemy come more readily than to lips that in youth have been overmuch shaped in unwilling prayer  me they avoided as they would a plague and when at times we met our salutations were grave as those of men on the point of crossing swords i despised them for their coarse ruffling apostasy more than ever my father had despised their father for a bigot and they guessing or knowing by instinct what was in my mind held me in deeper rancour even than their ancestors had done mine and more galling still and yet a sharper spur to their hatred did those whelps find in the realization that all the countryside held as it had held for ages us to be their betters a hard blow to their pride was that but their revenge was not long in coming  it chanced they had a cousina maid as sweet and fair and pure as they were hideous and foul we met in the meadsshe and i spring was the timegod it seems but yesterdayand each in our bearing towards the other forgot the traditions of the names we bore and as at first we had met by chance so did we meet later by contrivance not once or twice but many times god how sweet she was how sweet was all the world how sweet it was to live and to be young we loved how else could it have been what to us were traditions what to us the hatred that for centuries had held our families asunder in us it lay to set aside all that  and so i sought my father he cursed me at first for an unnatural son who left unheeded the dictates of our blood but anon when on my knees i had urged my cause with all the eloquent fervour that is but of youthyouth that lovesmy father cursed no more his thoughts went back maybe to the days of his own youth and he bade me rise and go awooing as i listed nay more than that he did the first of our name was he out of ten generations to set foot across the threshold of the hall he went on my behalf to sue for their cousins hand  then was their hour to them that had been taught the humiliating lesson that we were their betters one of us came suing they from whom the countryside looked for silence when one of us spoke had it in their hands at length to say us nay and they said it what answer my father made them kenneth i know not but very white was his face when i met him on the castle steps on his return in burning words he told me of the insult they had put upon him then silently he pointed to the toledo that two years before he had brought me out of spain and left me but i had understood softly i unsheathed that virgin blade and read the spanish inscription that through my tears of rage and shame seemed blurred a proud inscription was it instinct with the punctilio of proud spaindraw me not without motive sheathe me not without honour motive there was and to spare honour i swore there should be and with that oath and that brave sword girt to me i set out to my first combat  sir crispin paused and a sigh escaped him followed by a laugh of bitterness  i lost that sword years ago said he musingly the sword and i have been close friends in life but my companion has been a blade of coarser make carrying no inscriptions to prick at a mans conscience and make a craven of him  he laughed again and again he fell amusing till kenneths voice aroused him  your story sir  twilight shadows were gathering in their garret and as he turned his face towards the youth he was unable to make out his features but his tone had been eager and crispin noted that he sat with head bent forward and that his eyes shone feverishly  it interests you eh ah wellhot foot i went to the hall and with burning words i called upon those dogs to render satisfaction for the dishonour they had put upon my house will you believe kenneth that they denied me they sheltered their craven lives behind a shield of mock valour they would not fight a boy they said and bade me get my beard grown when haply they would give ear to my grievance  and so a shame and rage a hundredfold more bitter than that which i had borne thither did i carry thence my father bade me treasure up the memory of it against the time when my riper years should compel them to attend me and this by my every hope of heaven i swore to do he bade me further efface for ever from my mind all thought or hope of union with their cousin and though i made him no answer at the time yet in my heart i promised to obey him in that too but i was youngscarce twenty a week without sight of my mistress and i grew sick with despair then at length i came upon her pale and tearful one evening and in an agony of passion and hopelessness i flung myself at her feet and implored her to keep true to me and wait and she poor maid to her undoing swore that she would you are yourself a lover kenneth and you may guess something of the impatience that anon beset me how could i wait i asked her this  some fifty miles from the castle there was a little farm in the very heart of the country which had been left me by a sister of my mothers thither i now implored her to repair with me i would find a priest to wed us and there we should live a while in happiness in solitude and in love an alluring picture did i draw with all a lovers cunning and to the charms of it she fell a victim we fled three days later  we were wed in the village that pays allegiance to the castle and thereafter we travelled swiftly and undisturbed to that little homestead there in solitude with but two servantsa man and a maid whom i could trustwe lived and loved and for a season brief as all happiness is doomed to be we were happy her cousins had no knowledge of that farm of mine and though they searched the country for many a mile around they searched in vain my father knewas i learned afterwardsbut deeming that what was done might not be undone he held his peace in the following spring a babe was born to us and our bliss made heaven of that cottage  twas a month or so after the birth of our child that the blow descended i was away enjoying alone the pleasures of the chase my man was gone a journey to the nearest town whence he would not return until the morrow oft have i cursed the folly that led me to take my gun and go forth into the woods leaving no protector for my wife but one weak woman  i returned earlier than i had thought to do led mayhap by some angel that sought to have me back in time but i came too late at my gate i found two freshly ridden horses tethered and it was with a dull foreboding in my heart that i sprang through the open door withino god the anguish of itstretched on the floor i beheld my love a gaping swordwound in her side and the ground all bloody about her for a moment i stood dumb in the spell of that horror then a movement beyond against the wall aroused me and i beheld her murderers cowering there one with a naked sword in his hand  in that fell hour kenneth my whole nature changed and one who had ever been gentle was transformed into the violent passionate man that you have known as my eye encountered then her cousins my blood seemed on the instant curdled in my veins my teeth were set hard my nerves and sinews knotted my hands instinctively shifted to the barrel of my fowlingpiece and clutched it with the fierceness that was in methe fierceness of the beast about to spring upon those that have brought it to bay  for a moment i stood swaying there my eyes upon them and holding their craven glances fascinated then with a roar i leapt forward the stock of my fowlingpiece swung high above my head and as god lives kenneth i had sent them straight to hell ere they could have raised a hand or made a cry to stay me but as i sprang my foot slipped in the blood of my beloved and in my fall i came close to her where she lay the fowlingpiece had escaped my grasp and crashed against the wall  i scarce knew what i did but as i lay beside her it came to me that i did not wish to rise againthat already i had lived overlong it came to me that seeing me fallen haply those cowards would seize the chance to make an end of me as i lay i wished it so in that moments frenzy for i made no attempt to rise or to defend myself instead i set my arms about my poor murdered love and against her cold cheek i set my face that was wellnigh as cold  and thus i lay nor did they keep me long a sword was passed through me from back to breast whilst he who did it cursed me with a foul oath the room grew dim methought it swayed and that the walls were tottering there was a buzz of sound in my ears then a piercing cry in a baby voice at the sound of it i vaguely wished for the strength to rise as in the distance i heard one of those butchers cry haste man slit me that squalling bastards throat and then i must have swooned  kenneth shuddered  my god how horrible he cried but you were avenged sir crispin he added eagerly you were avenged  when i regained consciousness crispin continued as if he had not heard kenneths exclamation the cottage was in flames set alight by them to burn the evidence of their foul deed what i did i know not i have tried to urge my memory along from the point of my awakening but in vain by what miracle i crawled forth i cannot tell but in the morning i was found by my man lying prone in the garden half a dozen paces from the blackened ruins of the cottage as near death as man may go and live  god willed that i should not die but it was close upon a year before i was restored to any semblance of my former self and then i was so changed that i was hardly to be recognized as that same joyous vigorous lad who had set out fowlingpiece on shoulder one fine morning a year agone there was grey in my hair as much as there is now though i was but twentyone my face was seared and marked as that of a man who had lived twice my years it was to my faithful servant that i owed my life though i ask myself tonight whether i have cause for gratitude towards him on that score  so soon as i had regained sufficient strength i went secretly home wishing that men might continue to believe me dead my father i found much aged by grief but he was kind and tender with me beyond all words from him i had it that our enemies were gone to france it would seem they had thought it better to remain absent for a while he had learnt that they were in paris and hither i determined forthwith to follow them vainly did my father remonstrate with me vainly did he urge me rather to bear my story to the king at whitehall and seek for justice i had been well advised had i obeyed this counsel but i burned to take my vengeance with my own hands and with this purpose i repaired to france  two nights after my arrival in paris it was my illfortune to be embroiled in a roughandtumble in the streets and by an illchance i killed a manthe first was he of several that i have sent whither i am going tomorrow the affair was like to have cost me my life but by another of those miracles which have prolonged it i was sent instead to the galleys on the mediterranean it was only wanting that after all that already i had endured i should become a galleyslave  for twelve long years i toiled at an oar and waited if i lived i would return to england and if i returned woe unto those that had wrecked my lifemy body and my soul i did live and i did return the civil war had broken out and i came to throw my sword into the balance on the kings side i came too to be avenged but that would wait  meanwhile the score had grown heavier i went home to find the castle in usurping handsin the hands of my enemies my father was dead he died a few months after i had gone to france and those murderers had advanced a claim that through my marriage with their cousin since dead and through my own death there being no next of kin they were the heirsatlaw the parliament allowed their claim and they were installed but when i came they were away following the fortunes of the parliament that had served them so well and so i determined to let my vengeance wait until the war were ended and the parliament destroyed in a hundred engagements did i distinguish myself by my recklessness even as at other seasons i distinguished myself by my debaucheries  ah kenneth you have been hard upon me for my vices for my abuses of the cup and all the rest but can you be hard upon me still knowing what i had suffered and what a weight of misery i bore with me i whose life was wrecked beyond salvation who only lived that i might slit the throats of those that had so irreparably wronged me think you still that it was so vicious a thing so unpardonable an offence to seek the blessed nepenthe of the winecup the heavenly forgetfulness that its abuses brought me is it strange that i became known as the wildest tantivy boy that rode with the king what else had i  in all truth your trials were sore said the lad in a voice that contained a note of sympathy and yet there was a certain restraint that caught the tavern knights ear he turned his head and bent his eyes in the lads direction but it was quite dark by now and he failed to make out his companions face  my tale is told kenneth the rest you can guess the king did not prevail and i was forced to fly from england with those others who escaped from the butchers that had made a martyr of charles i took service in france under the great conde and i saw some mighty battles at length came the council of breda and the invitation to charles the second to receive the crown of scotland i set out again to follow his fortunes as i had followed his fathers realizing that by so doing i followed my own and that did he prevail i should have the redress and vengeance so long awaited today has dashed my last hope tomorrow at this hour it will not signify and yet much would i give to have my fingers on the throats of those two hounds before the hangmans close around my own  there was a spell of silence as the two men sat both breathing heavily in the gloom that enveloped them at length  you have heard my story kenneth said crispin  i have heard sir crispin and god knows i pity you  that was all and galliard felt that it was not enough he had lacerated his soul with those grim memories to earn a yet kinder word he had looked even to hear the lad suing for pardon for the harsh opinions wherein he had held him strange was this yearning of his for the boys sympathy he who for twenty years had gone unloving and unloved sought now in his extremity affection from a fellowman  and so in the gloom he waited for a kinder word that came not thenso urgent was his needhe set himself to beg it  can you not understand now kenneth how i came to fall so low can you not understand this dissoluteness of mine which led them to dub me the tavern knight after the king conferred upon me the honour of knighthood for that stand of mine in fifeshire you must understand kenneth he insisted almost piteously and knowing all you must judge me more mercifully than hitherto  it is not mine to judge sir crispin i pity you with all my heart the lad replied not ungently  still the knight was dissatisfied yours it is to judge as every man may judge his fellowman you mean it is not yours to sentence but if yours it were kenneth what then  the lad paused a moment ere he answered his bigoted presbyterian training was strong within him and although as he said he pitied galliard yet to him whose mind was stuffed with lifes precepts and who knew naught of the trials it brings to some and the temptations to which they were not human did they not succumbit seemed that vice was not to be excused by misfortune out of mercy then he paused and for a moment he had it even in his mind to cheer his fellowcaptive with a lie then remembering that he was to die upon the morrow and that at such a time it was not well to risk the perdition of his soul by an untruth however merciful he answered slowly  were i to judge you since you ask me sir i should be merciful because of your misfortunes and yet sir crispin your profligacy and the evil you have wrought in life must weigh heavily against you had this immaculate bigot this churlish milksop been as candid with himself as he was with crispin he must have recognized that it was mainly crispins offences towards himself that his mind now dwelt on in deeper rancour than became one so well acquainted with the lords prayer  you had not cause enough he added impressively to defile your soul and risk its eternal damnation because the evil of others had wrecked your life  crispin drew breath with the sharp hiss of one in pain and for a moment after all was still then a bitter laugh broke from him  bravely answered reverend sir he cried with biting scorn i marvel only that you left your pulpit to gird on a sword that you doffed your cassock to don a cuirass here is a text for you who deal in texts my brave jack presbyterjudge you your neighbour as you would yourself be judged be merciful as you would hope for mercy chew you the cud of that until the hangmans coming in the morning good night to you  and throwing himself back upon the bed crispin sought comfort in sleep his limbs were heavy and his heart was sick  you misapprehend me sir crispin cried the lad stung almost to shame by galliards reproach and also mayhap into some fear that hereafter he should find little mercy for his own lack of it towards a poor fellowsinner i spoke not as i would judge but as the church teaches  if the church teaches no better i rejoice that i was no churchman grunted crispin  for myself the lad pursued heeding not the irreverent interruption as i have said i pity you with all my heart more than that so deeply do i feel so great a loathing and indignation has your story sown in my heart that were our liberty now restored us i would willingly join hands with you in wreaking vengeance on these evildoers  sir crispin laughed he judged the tone rather than the words and it rang hollow  where are your wits o casuist he cried mockingly where are your doctrines vengeance is mine saith the lord pah  and with that final ejaculation pregnant with contempt and bitterness he composed himself to sleep  he was accursed he told himself he must die alone as he had lived     chapter viii the twisted bar   nature asserted herself and despite his condition crispin slept kenneth sat huddled on his chair and in awe and amazement he listened to his companions regular breathing he had not galliards nerves nor galliards indifference to death so that neither could he follow his example nor yet so much as realize how one should slumber upon the very brink of eternity  for a moment his wonder stood perilously near to admiration then his religious training swayed him and his righteousness almost drew from him a contempt of this mans apathy there was much of the pharisees attitude towards the publican in his mood  anon that regular breathing grew irritating to him it drew so marked a contrast twixt crispins frame of mind and his own whilst crispin had related his story the interest it awakened had served to banish the spectre of fear which the thought of the morrow conjured up now that crispin was silent and asleep that spectre returned and the lad grew numb and sick with the horror of his position  thought followed thought as he sat huddled there with sunken head and hands clasped tight between his knees and they were mostly of his dull uneventful days in scotland and ever and anon of cynthia his beloved would she hear of his end would she weep for himas though it mattered and every train of thought that he embarked upon brought him to the same issuetomorrow shuddering he would clench his hands still tighter and the perspiration would stand out in beads upon his callow brow  at length he flung himself upon his knees to address not so much a prayer as a maudlin grievance to his creator he felt himself a cravendoubly so by virtue of the peaceful breathing of that sinner he despisedand he told himself that it was not in fear a gentleman should meet his end  but i shall be brave tomorrow i shall be brave he muttered and knew not that it was vanity begat the thought and vanity that might uphold him on the morrow when there were others by however broken might be his spirit now  meanwhile crispin slept when he awakened the light of a lanthorn was on his face and holding it stood beside him a tall black figure in a cloak and a slouched hat whose broad brim left the features unrevealed  still half asleep and blinking like an owl he sat up  i have always held burnt sack to be well enough but  he stopped short fully awake at last and suddenly remembering his condition and thinking they were come for him he drew a sharp breath and in a voice as indifferent as he could make it  whats oclock he asked  past midnight miserable wretch was the answer delivered in a deep droning voice hast entered upon thy last day of lifea day whose sun thoult never see but five hours more are left thee  and it is to tell me this that you have awakened me demanded galliard in such a voice that he of the cloak recoiled a step as if he thought a blow must follow out on you for an unmannerly cur to break upon a gentlemans repose  i come returned the other in his droning voice to call upon thee to repent  plague me not answered crispin with a yawn i would sleep  soundly enough shalt thou sleep in a few hours time bethink thee miserable sinner of thy soul  sir cried the tavern knight i am a man of marvellous short endurance but mark you this your ways to heaven are not my ways indeed if heaven be peopled by such croaking things as you i shall be thankful to escape it so go my friend ere i become discourteous  the minister stood in silence for a moment then setting his lanthorn upon the table he raised his hands and eyes towards the low ceiling of the chamber  vouchsafe o lord he prayed to touch yet the callous heart of this obdurate incorrigible sinner this wicked perjured and blasphemous malignant whose  he got no further crispin was upon his feet his harsh countenance thrust into the very face of the minister his eyes ablaze  out he thundered pointing to the door out begone i would not be guilty at the end of my life of striking a man in petticoats but go whilst i can bethink me of it gotake your prayers to hell  the minister fell back before that blaze of passion for a second he appeared to hesitate then he turned towards kenneth who stood behind in silence but the lads presbyterian rearing had taught him to hate a sectarian as he would a papist or as he would the devil and he did no more than echo galliards wordsthough in a gentler key  i pray you go he said but if you would perform an act of charity leave your lanthorn it will be dark enough hereafter  the minister looked keenly at the boy and won over by the humility of his tone he set the lanthorn on the table then moving towards the door he stopped and addressed himself to crispin  i go since you oppose with violence my ministrations but i shall pray for you and i will return anon when perchance your heart shall be softened by the near imminence of your end  sir quoth crispin wearily you would outtalk a woman  ive done ive done he cried in trepidation making shift to depart on the threshold he paused again i leave you the lanthorn he said may it light you to a godlier frame of mind i shall return at daybreak and with that he went  crispin yawned noisily when he was gone and stretched himself then pointing to the pallet  come lad tis your turn said he  kenneth shivered i could not sleep he cried i could not  as you will and shrugging his shoulders crispin sat down on the edge of the bed  for cold comforters commend me to these cropeared cuckolds he grumbled they are all thought for a mans soul but for his body they care nothing here am i who for the last ten hours have had neither meat nor drink not that i mind the meat so much but slife my throat is dry as one of their sermons and i would cheerfully give four of my five hours of life for a posset of sack a paltry lot are they kenneth holding that because a man must die at dawn he need not sup tonight heigho some liar hath said that he who sleeps dines and if i sleep perchance i shall forget my thirst  he stretched himself upon the bed and presently he slept again  it was kenneth who next awakened him he opened his eyes to find the lad shivering as with an ague his face was ashen  now whats amiss oddslife what ails you he cried  is there no way sir crispin is there naught you can do wailed the youth  instantly galliard sat up  poor lad does the thought of the rope affright you  kenneth bowed his head in silence  tis a scurvy death i own look you kenneth there is a dagger in my boot if you would rather have cold steel tis done it is the last service i may render you and ill be as gentle as a mistress just there over the heart and youll know no more until you are in paradise  turning down the leather of his right boot he thrust his hand down the side of his leg but kenneth sprang back with a cry  no no he cried covering his face with his hands not that you dont understand it is death itself i would cheat what odds to exchange one form for another is there no way out of this is there no way sir crispin he demanded with clenched hands  the approach of death makes you maudlin sir quoth the other in whom this pitiful show of fear produced a profound disgust is there no way say you there is the window but tis seventy feet above the river and there is the door but it is locked and there is a sentry on the other side  i might have known it i might have known that you would mock me what is death to you to whom life offers nothing for you the prospect of it has no terrors but for mebethink you sir i am scarce eighteen years of age he added brokenly and life was full of promise for me o god pity me  true lad true the knight returned in softened tones i had forgotten that death is not to you the blessed release that it is to me and yet and yet he mused do i not die leaving a task unfulfilleda task of vengeance and by my soul i know no greater spur to make a man cling to life ah he sighed wistfully if indeed i could find a way  think sir crispin think cried the boy feverishly  to what purpose there is the window but even if the bars were moved which i see no manner of accomplishing the drop to the river is seventy feet at least i measured it with my eyes when first we entered here we have no rope your cloak rent in two and the pieces tied together would scarce yield us ten feet would you care to jump the remaining sixty  at the very thought of it the lad trembled noting which sir crispin laughed softly  there and yet boy it would be taking a risk which if successful would mean lifeif otherwise a speedier end than even the rope will afford you oddslife he cried suddenly springing to his feet and seizing the lanthorn let us look at these bars  he stepped across to the window and held the light so that its rays fell full upon the base of the vertical iron that barred the square  it is much worn by rust kenneth he muttered the removal of this single piece of iron and he touched the lower arm of the cross should afford us passage who knows hum  he walked back to the table and set the lanthorn down in a tremble kenneth watched his every movement but spoke no word  he who throws a main said galliard must set a stake upon the board i set my lifea stake that is already forfeitand i throw for liberty if i win i win all if i lose i lose naught slife i have thrown many a main with fate but never one wherein the odds were more generous come kenneth it is the only way and we will attempt it if we can but move the bar  you mean to leap gasped the lad  into the river it is the only way  o god i dare not it is a fearsome drop  longer i confess than theyll give you in an hours time if you remain but it may lead elsewhere  the boys mouth was parched his eyes burned in their sockets and yet his limbs shook with coldbut not the cold of that september night  ill try it he muttered with a gulp then suddenly clutching galliards arm he pointed to the window  what ails you now quoth crispin testily  the dawn sir crispin the dawn  crispin looked and there like a gash in the blackness of the heavens he beheld a streak of grey  quick sir crispin there is no time to lose the minister said he would return at daybreak  let him come answered galliard grimly as he moved towards the casement  he gripped the lower bar with his lean sinewy hands and setting his knee against the masonry beneath it he exerted the whole of his huge strengththat awful strength acquired during those years of toil as a galleyslave which even his debaucheries had not undermined he felt his sinews straining until it seemed that they must crack the sweat stood out upon his brow his breathing grew stertorous  it gives he panted at last it gives  he paused in his efforts and withdrew his hands  i must breathe a while one other effort such as that and it is done fore george he laughed it is the first time water has stood my friend for the rains have sadly rusted that iron  without their sentry was pacing before the door his steps came nearer passed and receded turned came nigh again and again passed on as once more they grew faint crispin seized the bar and renewed his attempt this time it was easier gradually it ceded to the strain galliard set upon it  nearer came the sentrys footsteps but they went unheeded by him who toiled and by him who watched with bated breath and beating heart he felt it givinggivinggiving crack  with a report that rang through the room like a pistol shot it broke off in its socket both men caught their breath and stood for a second crouching with straining ears the sentry had stopped at their door  galliard was a man of quick action swift to think and as swift to execute the thought to thrust kenneth into a corner to extinguish the light and to fling himself upon the bed was all the work of an instant  the key grated in the lock and crispin answered it with a resounding snore the door opened and on the threshold stood the roundhead trooper holding aloft a lanthorn whose rays were flashed back by his polished cuirass he beheld crispin on the bed with closed eyes and open mouth and he heard his reassuring and melodious snore he saw kenneth seated peacefully upon the floor with his back against the wall and for a moment he was puzzled  heard you aught he asked  aye answered kenneth in a strangled voice i heard something like a shot out there  the gesture with which he accompanied the words was fatal instinctively he had jerked his thumb towards the window thereby drawing the soldiers eyes in that direction the fellows glance fell upon the twisted bar and a sharp exclamation of surprise escaped him  had he been aught but a fool he must have guessed at once how it came so and having guessed it he must have thought twice ere he ventured within reach of a man who could so handle iron but he was a slowreasoning clod and so far thought had not yet taken the place of surprise he stepped into the chamber and across to the window that he might more closely view that broken bar  with eyes that were full of terror and despair kenneth watched him their last hope had failed them then as he looked it seemed to him that in one great leap from his recumbent position on the bed crispin had fallen upon the soldier  the lanthorn was dashed from the fellows hand and rolled to kenneths feet the fellow had begun a cry which broke off suddenly into a gurgle as galliards fingers closed about his windpipe he was a big fellow and in his mad struggles he carried crispin hither and thither about the room together they hurtled against the table which would have gone crashing over had not kenneth caught it and drawn it softly to the wall  both men were now upon the bed crispin had guessed the soldiers intent to fling himself upon the ground so that the ring of his armour might be heard and perchance bring others to his aid to avoid this galliard had swung him towards the bed and hurled him on to it there he pinned him with his knee and with his fingers he gripped the roundheads throat pressing the apple inwards with his thumb  the door kenneth he commanded in a whisper close the door  vain were the troopers struggles to free himself from that throttling grip already his efforts grew his face was purple his veins stood out in ropes upon his brow till they seemed upon the point of bursting his eyes protruded like a lobsters and there was a horrible grin upon his mouth still his heels beat the bed and still he struggled with his fingers he plucked madly at the throttling hands on his neck and tore at them with his nails until the blood streamed from them still galliard held him firmly and with a smilea diabolical smile it seemed to the poor halfstrangled wretchhe gazed upon his choking victim  someone comes gasped kenneth suddenly someone comes sir crispin he repeated shaking his hands in a frenzy  galliard listened steps were approaching the soldier heard them also and renewed his efforts then crispin spoke  why stand you there like a fool he growled quench the lightstay we may want it cast your cloak over it quick man quick  the steps came nearer the lad had obeyed him and they were in darkness  stand by the door whispered crispin fall upon him as he enters and see that no cry escapes him take him by the throat and as you love your life do not let him get away  the footsteps halted kenneth crawled softly to his post the soldiers struggles grew of a sudden still and crispin released his throat at last then calmly drawing the fellows dagger he felt for the straps of his cuirass and these he proceeded to cut as he did so the door was opened  by the light of the lamp burning in the passage they beheld silhouetted upon the threshold a black figure crowned by a steeple hat then the droning voice of the puritan minister greeted them  your hour is at hand he announced  is it time asked galliard from the bed and as he put the question he softly thrust aside the troopers breastplate and set his hand to the fellows heart it still beat faintly  in another hour they will come for you answered the minister and crispin marvelled anxiously what kenneth was about repent then miserable sinners whilst yet  he broke off abruptly awaking out of his religious zeal to a sense of strangeness at the darkness and the absence of the sentry which hitherto he had not remarked  what hath he began then galliard heard a gasp followed by the noise of a fall and two struggling men came rolling across the chamber floor  bravely done boy he cried almost mirthfully cling to him kenneth cling to him a second yet  he leapt from the bed and guided by the faint light coming through the door he sprang across the intervening space and softly closed it then he groped his way along the wall to the spot where he had seen the lanthorn stand when kenneth had flung his cloak over it as he went the two striving men came up against him  hold fast lad he cried encouraging kenneth hold him yet a moment and i will relieve you  he reached the lanthorn at last and pulling aside the cloak he lifted the light and set it upon the table     chapter ix the bargain   by the lanthorns yellow glare crispin beheld the two mena mass of writhing bodies and a bunch of waving legsupon the ground kenneth who was uppermost clung purposefully to the parsons throat the faces of both were alike distorted but whilst the lads breath came in gasping hisses the others came not at all  going over to the bed crispin drew the unconscious troopers tucksword he paused for a moment to bend over the mans face his breath came faintly and crispin knew that ere many moments were sped he would regain consciousness he smiled grimly to see how well he had performed his work of suffocation without yet utterly destroying life  sword in hand he returned to kenneth and the parson the puritans struggles were already becoming mere spasmodic twitchings his face was as ghastly as the troopers had been a while ago  release him kenneth said crispin shortly  he struggles still  release him i say galliard repeated and stooping he caught the lads wrist and compelled him to abandon his hold  he will cry out exclaimed kenneth in apprehension  not he laughed crispin leastways not yet awhile observe the wretch  with mouth wide agape the minister lay gasping like a fish newly taken from the water even now that his throat was free he appeared to struggle for a moment before he could draw breath then he took it in panting gulps until it seemed that he must choke in his gluttony of air  fore george quoth crispin i was no more than in time another second and we should have had him too unconscious there he is recovering  the blood was receding from the swollen veins of the parsons head and his cheeks were paling to their normal hue anon they went yet paler than their wont as galliard rested the point of his sword against the fellows neck  make sound or movement said crispin coldly and ill pin you to the floor like a beetle obey me and no harm shall come to you  i will obey you the fellow answered in a wheezing whisper i swear i will but of your charity good sir i beseech you remove your sword your hand might slip sir he whined a wild terror in his eyes  where now was the deep bass of his whilom accents where now the grotesque majesty of his bearing and the impressive gestures that erstwhile had accompanied his words of denunciation  your hand might slip sir he whined again  it mightand by gad it shall if i hear more from you so that you are discreet and obedient have no fear of my hand then still keeping his eye upon the fellow kenneth he said attend to the cropear yonder he will be recovering truss him with the bedclothes and gag him with his scarf see to it kenneth and do it well but leave his nostrils free that he may breathe  kenneth carried out galliards orders swiftly and effectively what time crispin remained standing over the recumbent minister at length when kenneth announced that it was done he bade the puritan rise  but have a care he added or you shall taste the joys of the paradise you preach of come sir parson afoot  a prey to a fear that compelled unquestioning obedience the fellow rose with alacrity  stand there sir so commanded crispin his point within an inch of the mans geneva bands take your kerchief kenneth and pinion his wrists behind him  that done crispin bade the lad unbuckle and remove the parsons belt next he ordered that man of texts to be seated upon their only chair and with that same belt he commanded kenneth to strap him to it when at length the puritan was safely bound crispin lowered his rapier and seated himself upon the table edge beside him  now sir parson quoth he let us talk a while at your first outcry i shall hurry you into that future world whither it is your mission to guide the souls of others maybe youll find it a better world to preach of than to inhabit and so for your own sake i make no doubt you will obey me to your honour to your good sense and a parsons natural horror of a lie i look for truth in answer to what questions i may set you should i find you deceiving me sir i shall see that your falsehood overtakes you and eloquently raising his blade he intimated the exact course he would adopt now sir attend to me how soon are our friends likely to discover this topsyturvydom  when they come for you answered the parson meekly  and how soon o prophet will they come  in an hours time or thereabout replied the puritan glancing towards the window as he spoke galliard followed his glance and observed that the light was growing perceptibly stronger  aye he commented in an hours time there should be light enough to hang us by is there no chance of anyone coming sooner  none that i can imagine the only other occupants of the house are a party of half a dozen troopers in the guardroom below  where is the lord general  awayi know not where but he will be here at sunrise  and the sentry that was at our dooris he not to a changed twixt this and hangingtime  i cannot say for sure but i think not the guard was relieved just before i came  and the men in the guardroomanswer me truthfully o elijahwhat manner of watch are they keeping  alas sir they have drunk enough this night to put a rakehelly cavalier to shame i was but exhorting them  when kenneth had removed the puritans girdle a small biblesuch as men of his calling were wont to carryhad dropped out this kenneth had placed upon the table galliard now took it up and holding it before the puritans eyes he watched him narrowly the while  will you swear by this book that you have answered nothing but the truth  without a moments hesitation the parson pledged his oath that to the best of his belief he had answered accurately  that is well sir and now though it grieve me to cause you some slight discomfort i must ensure your silence my friend  and placing his sword upon the table he passed behind the puritan and taking the mans own scarf he effectively gagged him with it  now kenneth said he turning to the lad then he stopped abruptly as if smitten by a sudden thought presentlykenneth he continued in a different tone a while ago i mind me you said that were your liberty restored you you would join hands with me in punishing the evildoers who wrecked my life  i did sir crispin  for a moment the knight paused it was a vile thing that he was about to do he told himself and as he realized how vile his impulse was to say no more to abandon the suddenly formed project and to trust to his own unaided wits and hands but as again he thought of the vast use this lad would be to himthis lad who was the betrothed of cynthia ashburnhe saw that the matter was not one hastily to be judged and dismissed carefully he weighed it in the balance of his mind on the one hand was the knowledge that did they succeed in making good their escape kenneth would naturally fly for shelter to his friends the ashburnsthe usurpers of castle marleigh what then more natural than his taking with him the man who had helped him to escape and who shared his own danger of recapture and with so plausible a motive for admission to castle marleigh how easy would not his vengeance become he might at first wean himself into their good graces and afterwards  before his mental eyes there unfolded itself the vista of a great revenge one that should be worthy of him and commensurate with the foul deed that called for it  in the other scale the treacherous flavour of this method weighed heavily he proposed to bind the lad to a promise the shape of whose fulfilment he would withholda promise the lad would readily give and yet one that he must sooner die than enter into did he but know what manner of fulfilment would be exacted it amounted to betraying the lad into a betrayal of his friendsthe people of his future wife whatever the issue for crispin twas odds kenneths prospect of wedding this cynthia would be blighted for all time by the action into which galliard proposed to thrust him all unconscious  so stood the case in galliards mind and the scales fell now on one side now on the other but against his scruples rose the memory of the treatment which the lad had meted out to him that night the harshness of the boys judgment the irrevocable contempt wherein he had clearly seen that he was held by this fatuous milksop all this aroused his rancour now and steeled his heart against the voice of honour what was this boy to him he asked himself that he should forego for him the accomplishing of his designs how had this lad earned any consideration from him what did he owe him naught still he would not decide in haste  it was characteristic of the man whom kenneth held to be destitute of all honourable principles to stand thus in the midst of perils when every second that sped lessened their chances of escape turning over in his mind calmly and collectedly a point of conduct it was in his passions only that crispin was ungovernable in violence only that he was swiftin all things else was he deliberate  of this kenneth had now a proof that set him quaking with impatient fear anxiously his hands clenched and his face pale he watched his companion who stood with brows knit in thought and his grey eyes staring at the ground at length he could brook that to him incomprehensible and mad delay no longer  sir crispin he whispered plucking at his sleeve sir crispin  the knight flashed him a glance that was almost of anger then the fire died out of his eyes he sighed and spoke in that seconds glance he had seen the lads face the fear and impatience written on it had disgusted him and caused the scales to fall suddenly and definitely against the boy  i was thinking how it might be accomplished he said  there is but one way cried the lad  on the contrary there are two and i wish to choose carefully  if you delay your choice much longer none will be left you cried kenneth impatiently  noting the lads growing fears and resolved now upon his course galliard set himself to play upon them until terror should render the boy as wax in his hands  there speaks your callow inexperience said he with a pitying smile when you shall have lived as long as i have done and endured as much when you shall have set your wits to the saving of your life as often as have iyou will have learnt that haste is fatal to all enterprises failure means the forfeiture of something tonight it would mean the forfeiture of our lives and it were a pity to let such good efforts as theseand with a wave of the hand he indicated their two captorsgo wasted  sir exclaimed kenneth wellnigh beside himself if you come not with me i go alone  whither asked crispin dryly  out of this  galliard bowed slightly  fare you well sir ill not detain you your way is clear and it is for you to choose between the door and the window  and with that crispin turned his back upon his companion and crossed to the bed where the trooper lay glaring in mute anger he stooped and unbuckling the soldiers swordbeltto which the scabbard was attachedhe girt himself with it without raising his eyes and keeping his back to kenneth who stood between him and the door he went next to the table and taking up the sword that he had left there he restored it to the sheath as the hilt clicked against the mouth of the scabbard  come sir crispin cried the lad are you ready  galliard wheeled sharply round  how not gone yet said he sardonically  i dare not the lad confessed i dare not go alone  galliard laughed softly then suddenly waxed grave  ere we go master kenneth i would again remind you of your assurance that were we to regain our liberty you would aid me in the task of vengeance that lies before me  once already have i answered you that it is so  and pray are you still of the same mind  i am i am anything sir crispin anything so that you come away  not so fast kenneth the promise that i shall ask of you is not to be so lightly given if we escape i may fairly claim to have saved your life twixt what i have done and what i may yet do is it not so  oh i acknowledge it  then sir in payment i shall expect your aid hereafter to help me in that which i must accomplish that which the hope of accomplishing is the only spur to my own escape  you have my promise cried the lad  do not give it lightly kenneth said crispin gravely it may cause you much discomfort and may be fraught with danger even to your life  i promise  galliard bowed his head then turning he took the bible from the table  with your hand upon this book by your honour your faith and your every hope of salvation swear that if i bear you alive out of this house you will devote yourself to me and to my task of vengeance until it shall be accomplished or until i perish swear that you will set aside all personal matters and inclinations of your own to serve me when i shall call upon you swear that and in return i will give my life if need be to save yours tonight in which case you will be released from your oath without more ado  the lad paused a moment crispin was so impressive the oath he imposed so solemn that for an instant the boy hesitated his cautious timid nature whispered to him that perchance he should know more of this matter ere he bound himself so irrevocably but crispin noting the hesitation stifled it by appealing to the lads fears  resolve yourself he exclaimed abruptly it grows light and the time for haste is come  i swear answered kenneth overcome by his impatience i swear by my honour my faith and my every hope of heaven to lend you my aid when and how you may demand it until your task be accomplished  crispin took the bible from the boys hands and replaced it on the table his lips were pressed tight and he avoided the lads eyes  you shall not find me wanting in my part of the bargain he muttered as he took up the soldiers cloak and hat come take that parsons steeple hat and his cloak and let us be going  he crossed to the door and opening it he peered down the passage a moment he stood listening all was still then he turned again in the chamber the steely light of the breaking day was rendering more yellow still the lanthorns yellow flame  fare you well sir parson he said forgive me the discomfort i have been forced to put upon you and pray for the success of our escape commend me to oliver of the ruby nose fare you well sir come kenneth  he held the door for the lad to pass out as they stood in the dimly lighted passage he closed it softly after them and turned the key in the lock  come he said again and led the way to the stairs kenneth tiptoeing after him with wildly beating heart     chapter x the escape   treading softly and with ears straining for the slightest sound the two men descended to the first floor of the house they heard nothing to alarm them as they crept down and not until they paused on the first landing to reconnoitre did they even catch the murmur of voices issuing from the guardroom below so muffled was the sound that crispin guessed how matters stood even before he had looked over the balusters into the hall beneath the faint grey of the dawn was the only light that penetrated the gloom of that pit  the fates are kind kenneth he whispered those fools sit with closed doors come  but kenneth laid his hand upon galliards sleeve what if the door should open as we pass  someone will die muttered crispin back but pray god that it may not we must run the risk  is there no other way  why yes returned galliard sardonically we can linger here until we are taken but oddslife im not so minded come  and as he spoke he drew the lad along  his foot was upon the topmost stair of the flight when of a sudden the stillness of the house was broken by a loud knock upon the street door instantlyas though they had been awaiting it there was a stir of feet below and the bang of an overturned chair then a shaft of yellow light fell athwart the darkness of the hall as the guardroom door was opened  back growled galliard back man  they were but in time peering over the balusters they saw two troopers pass out of the guardroom and cross the hall to the door a bolt was drawn and a chain rattled then followed the creak of hinges and on the stone flags rang the footsteps and the jingling of spurs of those that entered  is all well came a voice which crispin recognized as colonel prides followed by an affirmative reply from one of the soldiers  hath a minister visited the malignants  master toneleigh is with them even now  in the hall crispin could now make out the figures of colonel pride and of three men who came with him but he had scant leisure to survey them for the colonel was in haste  come sirs he heard him say light me to their garret i would see themleastways one of them before he dies they are to hang where the moabites hanged gives yesterday had i my way but there lead on fellow  oh god gasped kenneth as the soldier set foot upon the stairs under his breath crispin swore a terrific oath for an instant it seemed to him there was naught left but to stand there and await recapture through his mind it flashed that they were five and he but one for his companion was unarmed  with that swiftness which thought alone can compass did he weigh the odds and judge his chances he realized how desperate they were did he remain and even as he thought he glanced sharply round  dim indeed was the light but his sight was keen and quickened by the imminence of danger partly his eyes and partly his instinct told him that not six paces behind him there must be a door and if heaven pleased it should be unlocked behind it they must look for shelter it even crossed his mind in that second of crowding galloping thought that perchance the room might be occupied that was a risk he must takethe lesser risk of the two the choice of one of which was forced upon him he had determined all this ere the soldiers foot was upon the third step of the staircase and before the colonel had commenced the ascent kenneth stood palsied with fear gazing like one fascinated at the approaching peril  then upon his ear fell the fierce whisper come with me and tread lightly as you love your life  in three long strides and by steps that were softer than a cats crispin crossed to the door which he had rather guessed than seen he ran his hand along until he caught the latch softly he tried it it gave and the door opened kenneth was by then beside him he paused to look back  on the opposite wall the light of the troopers lanthorn fell brightly another moment and the fellow would have reached and turned the corner of the stairs and his light must reveal them to him but ere that instant was passed crispin had drawn his companion through and closed the door as softly as he had opened it the chamber was untenanted and almost bare of furniture at which discovery crispin breathed more freely  they stood there and heard the ascending footsteps and the clankclank of a sword against the stairrail a bar of yellow light came under the door that sheltered them stronger it grew and farther it crept along the floor then stopped and receded again as he who bore the lanthorn turned and began to climb to the second floor an instant later and the light had vanished eclipsed by those who followed in the fellows wake  the window sir crispin cried kenneth in an excited whisperthe window  no answered crispin calmly the drop is a long one and we should but light in the streets and be little better than we are here wait  he listened the footsteps had turned the corner leading to the floor above he opened the door partly at first then wide for an instant he stood listening again the steps were well overhead by now soon they would mount the last flight and then discovery must be swift to follow  now was all crispin said and drawing his sword he led the way swiftly yet cautiously to the stairs once more in passing he glanced over the rails the guardroom door stood ajar and he caught the murmurs of subdued conversation but he did not pause had the door stood wide he would not have paused then there was not a second to be lost to wait was to increase the already overwhelming danger cautiously and leaning well upon the stout baluster he began the descent kenneth followed him mechanically with white face and a feeling of suffocation in his throat  they gained the corner and turning they began what was truly the perilous part of their journey not more than a dozen steps were there but at the bottom stood the guardroom door and through the chink of its opening a shaft of light fell upon the nethermost step once a stair creaked and to their quickened senses it sounded like a pistolshot as loud to crispin sounded the indrawn breath of apprehension from kenneth that followed it he had almost paused to curse the lad when thinking him of how time pressed he went on  within three steps of the bottom were they and they could almost distinguish what was being said in the room when crispin stopped and turning his head to attract kenneths attention he pointed straight across the hall to a dimly visible door it was that of the chamber wherein he had been brought before cromwell its position had occurred to him some moments before and he had determined then upon going that way  the lad followed the indication of his finger and signified by a nod that he understood another step galliard descended then from the guardroom came a loud yawn to send the boy cowering against the wall it was followed by the sound of someone rising a chair grated upon the floor and there was a movement of feet within the chamber had kenneth been alone of a certainty terror would have frozen him to the wall  but the calm unmovable crispin proceeded as if naught had chanced he argued that even if he who had risen were coming towards the door there was nothing to be gained by standing still their only chance lay now in passing before it might be opened  they that walk through perils in a brave mans company cannot but gain confidence from the calm of his demeanour so was it now with kenneth the steady onward march of that tall lank figure before him drew him irresistibly after it despite his tremors and well it was for him that this was so they gained the bottom of the staircase at length they stood beside the door of the guardroom they passed it in safety then slowlypainfully slowlyto avoid their steps from ringing upon the stone floor they crept across towards the door that meant safety to sir crispin slowly step by step they moved and with every stride crispin looked behind him prepared to rush the moment he had sign they were discovered but it was not needed in silence and in safety they were permitted to reach the door to crispins joy it was unfastened quietly he opened it then with calm gallantry he motioned to his companion to go first holding it for him as he passed in and keeping watch with eye and ear the while  scarce had kenneth entered the chamber when from above came the sound of loud and excited voices announcing to them that their flight was at last discovered it was responded to by a rush of feet in the guardroom and crispin had but time to dart in after his companion and close the door ere the troopers poured out into the hall and up the stairs with confused shouts that something must be amiss  within the room that sheltered him crispin chuckled as he ran his hand along the edge of the door until he found the bolt and softly shot it home  slife he muttered twas a close thing aye shout you cuckolds he went on yell yourselves hoarse as the crows you are youll hang us where gives are hanged will you  kenneth tugged at the skirts of his doublet what now he inquired  now said crispin well leave by the window if it please you  they crossed the room and a moment or two later they had dropped on to the narrow railed pathway overlooking the river which crispin had observed from their prison window the evening before he had observed too that a small boat was moored at some steps about a hundred yards farther down the stream and towards that spot he now sped along the footpath followed closely by kenneth the path sloped in that direction so that by the time the spot was reached the water flowed not more than six feet or so beneath them half a dozen steps took them down this to the moorings of that boat which fortunately had not been removed  get in kenneth crispin commanded there ill take the oars and ill keep under shelter of the bank lest those blunderers should bethink them of looking out of our prison window oddswounds kenneth i am hungry as a wolf and as dryough as dry as dives when he begged for a sup of water heaven send we come upon some good malignant homestead ere we go far where a christian may find a meal and a stoup of ale tis a miracle i had strength enough to crawl downstairs swounds but an empty stomach is a craven comrade in a desperate enterprise hey have a care boy now sink me if this milksop hasnt fainted      chapter xi the ashburns   gregory ashburn pushed back his chair and made shift to rise from the table at which he and his brother had but dined  he was a tall heavily built man with a coarse florid countenance set in a frame of reddish hair that hung straight and limp in the colour of their hair lay the only point of resemblance between the brothers for the rest joseph was spare and of middle weight pale of face thinlipped and owning a cunning expression that was rendered very evil by virtue of the slight cast in his colourless eyes  in earlier life gregory had not been unhandsome debauchery and sloth had puffed and coarsened him joseph on the other hand had never been aught but illfavoured  tis a week since worcester field was fought grumbled gregory looking lazily sideways at the mullioned windows as he spoke and never a word from the lad  joseph shrugged his narrow shoulders and sneered it was josephs habit to sneer when he spoke and his words were wont to fit the sneer  doth the lack of news trouble you he asked glancing across the table at his brother  gregory rose without meeting that glance  truth to tell it does trouble me he muttered  and yet quoth joseph tis a natural thing enough when battles are fought it is not uncommon for men to die  gregory crossed slowly to the window and stared out at the trees of the park which autumn was fast stripping  if he were among the fallenif he were dead then indeed the matter would be at an end  aye and well ended  you forget cynthia gregory reproved him  forget her not i man listen and he jerked his thumb in the direction of the wainscot  to the two men in that rich chamber of castle marleigh was borne the soundsoftened by distance of a girlish voice merrily singing  joseph laughed a cackle of contempt  is that the song of a maid whose lover comes not back from the wars he asked  but bethink you joseph the child suspects not the possibility of his having fallen  gadswounds sir did your daughter give the fellow a thought she must be anxious a week yesterday since the battle and no word from him i dare swear gregory theres little in that to warrant his mistress singing  cynthia is younga child she reasons not as you and i nor seeks to account for his absence  troubles not to account for it joseph amended  be that as it may returned gregory irritably i would i knew  that which we do not know we may sometimes infer i infer him to be dead and theres the end of it  what if he should not be  then my good fool he would be here  it is unlike you joseph to argue so loosely what if he should be a prisoner  why then the plantations will do that which the battle hath left undone so that dead or captive you see it is all one  and lifting his glass to the light he closed one eye the better to survey with the other the rich colour of the wine not that joseph was curious touching that colour but he was a juggler in gestures and at that moment he could think of no other whereby he might so naturally convey the utter indifference of his feelings in the matter  joseph you are wrong said gregory turning his back upon the window and facing his brother it is not all one what if he return some day  oh what ifwhat ifwhat if cried joseph testily gregory what a casuist you might have been had not nature made you a villain you are as full of what if s as an egg of meat well what if some day he should return i fling your question backwhat if  god only knows  then leave it to him was the flippant answer and joseph drained his glass  nay brother twere too great a risk i must and i will know whether kenneth were slain or not if he is a prisoner then we must exert ourselves to win his freedom  plague take it joseph burst out why all this ado why did you ever loose that graceless whelp from his scottish moor  gregory sighed with an air of resigned patience  i have more reasons than one he answered slowly if you need that i recite them to you i pity your wits look you joseph you have more influence with cromwell morefar morethan have i and if you are minded to do so you can serve me in this  i wait but to learn how  then go to cromwell at windsor or wherever he may be and seek to learn from him if kenneth is a prisoner if he is not then clearly he is dead  joseph made a gesture of impatience  can you not leave fate alone  think you i have no conscience joseph cried the other with sudden vigour  pish you are womanish  nay joseph i am old i am in the autumn of my days and i would see these two wed before i die  and are damned for a croaking maudlin craven added joseph pah you make me sick  there was a moments silence during which the brothers eyed each other gregory with a sternness before which josephs mocking eye was forced at length to fall  joseph you shall go to the lord general  well said joseph weakly we will say that i go but if kenneth be a prisoner what then  you must beg his liberty from cromwell he will not refuse you  will he not i am none so confident  but you can make the attempt and leastways we shall have some definite knowledge of what has befallen the boy  the which definite knowledge seems to me none so necessary moreover gregory bethink you there has been a change and the wind carries an edge that will arouse every devil of rheumatism in my bones i am not a lad gregory and travelling at this season is no small matter for a man of fifty  gregory approached the table and leaning his hand upon it  will you go he asked squarely eyeing his brother  joseph fell apondering he knew gregory to be a man of fixed ideas and he bethought him that were he now to refuse he would be hourly plagued by gregorys speculations touching the boys fate and recriminations touching his own selfishness on the other hand however the journey daunted him he was not a man to sacrifice his creature comforts and to be asked to sacrifice them to a mere whim a shadow added weight to his inclination to refuse the undertaking  since you have the matter so much at heart said he at length does it not occur to you that you could plead with greater fervour and be the likelier to succeed  you know that cromwell will lend a more willing ear to you than to meperchance because you know so well upon occasion how to weave your stock of texts into your discourse he added with a sneer will you go joseph  bethink you that we know not where he is i may have to wander for weeks oer the face of england  will you go gregory repeated  oh a pox on it broke out joseph rising suddenly ill go since naught else will quiet you ill start tomorrow  joseph i am grateful i shall be more grateful yet if you will start today  no sink me no  yes sink me yes returned gregory you must joseph  joseph spoke of the wind again the sky he urged was heavy with rain what signifies a day he whined  but gregory stood his ground until almost out of selfprotection the other consented to do his bidding and set out as soon as he could make ready  this being determined joseph left his brother and cursing master stewart for the amount of discomfort which he was about to endure on his behoof he went to prepare for the journey  gregory lingered still in the chamber where they had dined and sat staring moodily before him at the tablelinen anon with a halflaugh of contempt he filled a glass of muscadine and drained it as he set down the glass the door opened and on the threshold stood a very dainty girl whose age could not be more than twenty gregory looked on the fresh oval face with its wealth of brown hair crowning the low broad forehead and told himself that in his daughter he had just cause for pride he looked again and told himself that his brother was right she had not the air of a maid whose lover returns not from the wars her lips were smiling and the eyeslowlidded and blue as the heavenswere bright with mirth  why sit you there so glum she cried whilst my uncle they tell me is going on a journey  gregory was minded to put her feelings to the test  kenneth he replied with significant emphasis watching her closely  the mirth faded from her eyes and they took on a grave expression that added to their charm but gregory had looked for fear leastways deep concern and in this he was disappointed  what of him father she asked approaching  naught and thats the rub it is time we had news and as none comes your uncle goes to seek it  think you that ill can have befallen him  gregory was silent a moment weighing his answer then  we hope not sweetheart said he he may be a prisoner we last had news of him from worcester and tis a week and more since the battle was fought there should he be a captive your uncle has sufficient influence to obtain his enlargement  cynthia sighed and moved towards the window  poor kenneth she murmured gently he may be wounded  we shall soon learn he answered his disappointment grew keener where he had looked for grief he found no more than an expression of pitying concern nor was his disappointment lessened when after a spell of thoughtful silence she began to comment upon the condition of the trees in the park below gregory had it in his mind to chide her for this lack of interest in the fate of her intended husband but he let the impulse pass unheeded after all if kenneth lived she should marry him hitherto she had been docile and willing enough to be guided by him she had even displayed a kindness for kenneth no doubt she would do so again when joseph returned with himunless he were among the worcester slain in which case perhaps it would prove best that his fate was not to cause her any prostration of grief  the sky is heavy father said cynthia from the window poor uncle he will have rough weather for his journey  i rejoice that someone wastes pity on poor uncle growled joseph who reentered this uncle whom your father drives out of doors in all weathers to look for his daughters truant lover  cynthia smiled upon him  it is heroic of you uncle  there there he grumbled i shall do my best to find the laggard lest those pretty eyes should weep away their beauty  gregorys glance reproved this sneer of josephs whereupon joseph drew close to him  brokenhearted is she not he muttered to which gregory returned no answer  an hour later as joseph climbed into his saddle he turned to his brother again and directing his eyes upon the girl who stood patting the glossy neck of his nag  come now said he you see that matters are as i said  and yet replied gregory sternly i hope to see you return with the boy it will be better so  joseph shrugged his shoulders contemptuously then taking leave of his brother and his niece he rode out with two grooms at his heels and took the road south     chapter xii the house that was roland marleighs   it was high noon next day and gregory ashburn was taking the air upon the noble terrace of castle marleigh when the beat of hoofs rapidly approaching up the avenue arrested his attention he stopped in his walk and turning sought to discover who came his first thought was of his brother his second of kenneth through the halfdenuded trees he made out two mounted figures riding side by side and from the fact of there being two he adduced that this could not be joseph returning  even as he waited he was joined by cynthia who took her stand beside him and voiced the inquiry that was in his mind but her father could no more than answer that he hoped it might be kenneth  then the horsemen passed from behind the screen of trees and came into the clearing before the terrace and unto the waiting glances of ashburn and his daughter was revealed a curiously bedraggled and illassorted pair the one riding slightly in advance looked like a puritan of the meaner sort in his battered steeplehat and cloak of rusty black the other was closely wrapped in a red mantle uptilted behind by a sword of prodigious length and for all that his broad grey hat was unadorned by any feather it was set at a rakish ruffling damnme angle that pronounced him no likely comrade for the piously clad youth beside him  but beneath that brave red cloakalackas was presently seen when they dismounted that gentleman was in a sorry plight he wore a leather jerkin so cut and soiled that any groom might have disdained it a pair of green breeches frayed to their utmost and coarse boots of untanned leather adorned by rusty spurs  on the terrace gregory paused a moment to call his groom to attend the newcomers then he passed down the steps to greet kenneth with boisterous effusion behind him slow and stately as a woman of twice her years came cynthia calm was her greeting of her lover contained in courteous expressions of pleasure at beholding him safe and suffering him to kiss her hand  in the background his sable locks uncovered out of deference to the lady stood sir crispin his face pale and haggard his lips parted and his grey eyes burning as they fell again after the lapse of years upon the stones of this his homethe castle to which he was now come hat in hand to beg for shelter  gregory was speaking his hands resting upon kenneths shoulder  we have been much exercised concerning you lad he was saying we almost feared the worst and yesterday joseph left us to seek news of you at cromwells hands where have you tarried  anon sir you shall learn anon the story is a long one  true you will be tired and perchance you would first rest a while cynthia will see to it but what scarecrow have you there what tatterdemalion is this he cried pointing to galliard he had imagined him a servant but the dull flush that overspread sir crispins face told him of his error  i would have you know sir crispin began with some heat when kenneth interrupted him  tis to this gentleman sir that i owe my presence here he was my fellowprisoner and but for his quick wit and stout arm i should be stiff by now anon sir you shall hear the story of it and i dare swear it will divert you this gentleman is sir crispin galliard lately a captain of horse with whom i served in middletons brigade  crispin bowed low conscious of the keen scrutiny in which gregorys eyes were bent upon him in his heart there arose a fear that haply after all the years that were sped had not wrought sufficient change in him  sir crispin galliard ashburn was saying after the manner of one who is searching his memory galliard galliardnot he whom they called rakehelly galliard and who gave us such trouble in the late kings time  crispin breathed once more ashburns scrutiny was explained  the same sir he answered with a smile and a fresh bow your servant sir and yours madam  cynthia looked with interest at the lank soldierly figure she too had heardas who had notwild stories of this mans achievements but of no feat of his had she been told that could rival that of his escape from worcester and when that same evening kenneth related it as they supped her lowlidded eyes grew very wide and as they fell on crispin admiration had taken now the place of interest  romance swayed as great a portion of her heart as it does of most womens she loved the poets and their songs of great deeds and here was one who in the light of that which they related of him was like an incarnation of some hero out of a romancers ballad  kenneth she never yet had held in over high esteem but of a sudden in the presence of this harshfeatured dog of war this grim fierceeyed ruffler he seemed to fade despite his comeliness of face and form into a poor and puny insignificance and when presently he unwisely related how when in the boat he had fainted the maiden laughed outright for very scorn  at this plain expression of contempt her father shot her a quick uneasy glance kenneth stopped short bringing his narrative abruptly to a close reproachfully he looked at her turning first red then white as anger chased annoyance through his soul galliard looked on with quiet relish her laugh had contained that which for days he had carried in his heart he drained his bumper slowly and made no attempt to relieve the awkward silence that sat upon the company  truth to tell there was emotion enough in the soul of him who was wont to be the life of every board he sat at to hold him silent and even moody  here after eighteen years was he again in his ancestral home of marleigh but how was he returned as one who came under a feigned name to seek from usurping hands a shelter neath his own roof a beggar of that from others which it should have been his to grant or to deny those others as an avenger he came for justice he came and armed with retribution the flame of a hate unspeakable burning in his heart and demanding the livesno lessof those that had destroyed him and his yet was he forced to sit a mendicant almost at that board whose head was his by every right forced to sit and curb his mood giving no outward sign of the volcano that boiled and raged within his soul as his eye fell upon the florid smiling face and portly wellfed frame of gregory ashburn for the time was not yet he must wait wait until josephs return so that he might spend his vengeance upon both together  patient had he been for eighteen years confident that ere he died a just and merciful god would give him this for which he lived and waited yet now that the season was at hand now upon the very eve of that for which he had so long been patient a frenzy of impatience fretted him  he drank deep that night and through deep drinking his manner thawedfor in his cups it was not his to be churlish to friend or foe anon cynthia withdrew next kenneth who went in quest of her still crispin sat on and drank his hosts health above his breath and his perdition under it till in the end gregory who never yet had found his master at the bottle grew numb and drowsy and sat blinking at the tapers  until midnight they remained at table talking of this and that and each understanding little of what the other said as the last hour of night boomed out through the great hall gregory spoke of bed  where do i lie tonight asked crispin  in the northern wing answered gregory with a hiccough  nay sir i protest cried galliard struggling to his feet and swaying somewhat as he stood ill sleep in the kings chamber none other  the kings chamber echoed gregory and his face showed the confused struggles of his brain what know you of the kings chamber  that it faces the east and the sea and that it is the chamber i love best  what can you know of it since i take it you have never seen it  have i not he began in a voice that was awful in its threatening calm then recollecting himself and shaking some of the drunkenness from him in the old days when the marleighs were masters here he mumbled i was often within these walls roland marleigh was my friend the kings chamber was ever accorded me and there for old times sake ill lay these old bones of mine tonight  you were roland marleighs friend gasped gregory he was very white now and there was a sheen of moisture on his face the sound of that name had wellnigh sobered him it was almost as if the ghost of roland marleigh stood before him his knees were loosened and he sank back into the chair from which he had but risen  aye i was his friend assented crispin poor roland he married your sister did he not and it was thus that having no issue and the family being extinct castle marleigh passed to you  he married our cousin gregory amended they were an illfated family  illfated indeed an all accounts be true returned crispin in a maudlin voice poor roland well for old times sake ill sleep in the kings chamber master ashburn  you shall sleep where you list sir answered gregory and they rose  do you look to honour us long at castle marleigh sir crispin was gregorys last question before separating from his guest  nay sir tis likely i shall go hence tomorrow answered crispin unmindful of what he said  i trust not said gregory in accents of relief that belied him a friend of roland marleighs must ever be welcome in the house that was roland marleighs  the house that was roland marleighs crispin muttered heigho life is precarious as the fall of a die at best an ephemeral business tonight you say the house that was roland marleighs presently men will be saying the house that the ashburns livedaye and diedin give you good night master ashburn  he staggered off and stumbled up the broad staircase at the head of which a servant now awaited taper in hand to conduct him to the chamber he demanded  gregory followed him with a dull frightened eye galliards halting thickly uttered words had sounded like a prophecy in his ears     chapter xiii the metamorphosis of kenneth   when the morrow came however sir crispin showed no signs of carrying out his proposal of the night before and departing from castle marleigh nor indeed did he so much as touch upon the subject bearing himself rather as one whose sojourn there was to be indefinite  gregory offered no comment upon this through what he had done for kenneth they were under a debt to galliard and whilst he was a fugitive from the parliaments justice it would ill become gregory to hasten his departure moreover gregory recalled little or nothing of the words that had passed between them in their cups save a vague memory that crispin had said that he had once known roland marleigh  kenneth was content that galliard should lie idle and not call upon him to go forth again to lend him the aid he had pledged himself to render when crispin should demand it he marvelled as the days wore on that galliard should appear to have forgotten that task of his and that he should make no shift to set about it for the rest however it troubled him but little enough preoccupation did he find in cynthias daily increasing coldness upon all the fine speeches that he made her she turned an idle ear or if she replied at all it was but petulantly to interrupt them to call him a man of great words and small deeds all that he did she found ill done and told him of it his sober godly garments of sombre hue afforded her the first weapon of scorn wherewith to wound him a crow she dubbed him a canting psalmchanting hypocrite a scripturemonger and every other contumelious epithet of like import that she should call to mind he heard her in amazement  is it for you cynthia he cried out in his surprise the child of a godfearing house to mock the outward symbols of my faith  a faith she laughed that is all outward symbols and naught besides all texts and mournings and nosetwangings  cynthia he exclaimed in horror  go your ways sir she answered half in jest half in earnest what need hath a true faith of outward symbols it is a matter that lies between your god and yourself and it is your heart he will look at not your coat why then without becoming more acceptable in his eyes shall you but render yourself unsightly in the eyes of man  kenneths cheeks were flushed with anger from the terrace where they walked he let his glance roam towards the avenue that split the park in twain up this at that moment with the least suspicion of a swagger in his gait sir crispin galliard was approaching leisurely he wore a claretcoloured doublet edged with silver lace and a grey hat decked with a drooping red featherwhich garments together with the rest of his apparel he had drawn from the wardrobe of gregory ashburn his advent afforded kenneth the retort he needed pointing him out to cynthia  would you rather he cried hotly have me such a man as that  and pray why not she taunted him leastways you would then be a man  if madam a debauchee a drunkard a profligate a brawler be your conception of a man i would in faith you did not account me one  and what sir would you sooner elect to be accounted  a gentleman madam he answered pompously  i think said she quietly that you are in as little danger of becoming the one as the other a gentleman does not slander a man behind his back particularly when he owes that man his life kenneth i am ashamed of you  i do not slander he insisted hotly you yourself know of the drunken excess wherewith three nights ago he celebrated his coming to castle marleigh nor do i forget what i owe him and payment is to be made in a manner you little know of if i said of him what i did it was but in answer to your taunts think you i could endure comparison with such a man as that know you what name the royalists give him they call him the tavern knight  she looked him over with an eye of quiet scorn  and how sir do they call you the pulpit knight or is it the knight of the white feather mr stewart you weary me i would have a man who with a mans failings hath also a mans redeeming virtues of honesty chivalry and courage and a record of brave deeds rather than one who has nothing of the man save the coatthat outward symbol you lay such store by  his handsome weak face was red with fury  since that is so madam he choked i leave you to your swaggering ruffling cavalier  and without so much as a bow he swung round on his heel and left her it was her turn to grow angry now and well it was for him that he had not tarried she dwelt with scorn upon his parting taunt bethinking herself that in truth she had exaggerated her opinions of galliards merits her feelings towards that ungodly gentleman were rather of pity than aught else a brave readywitted man she knew him for as much from the story of his escape from worcester as for the air that clung to him despite his swagger and she deplored that one possessing these ennobling virtues should have fallen notwithstanding upon such evil ways as those which crispin trod some day perchance when she should come to be better acquainted with him she would seek to induce him to mend his course  such root did this thought take in her mind that soon thereafterand without having waited for that riper acquaintance which at first she had held necessaryshe sought to lead their talk into the channels of this delicate subject but he as sedulously confined it to trivial matter whenever she approached him in this mood fencing himself about with a wall of cold reserve that was not lightly to be overthrown in this his conscience was at work cynthia was the flaw in the satisfaction he might have drawn from the contemplation of the vengeance he was there to wreak he beheld her so pure so sweet and fresh that he marvelled how she came to be the daughter of gregory ashburn his heart smote him at the thought of how shethe innocentmust suffer with the guilty and at the contemplation of the sorrow which he must visit upon her out of this sprang a constraint when in her company for other than stiff and formal he dared not be lest he should deem himself no better than the iscariot  during the first days he had spent at marleigh he had been impatient for joseph ashburns return now he found himself hoping each morning that joseph might not come that day  a courier reached gregory from windsor with a letter wherein his brother told him that the lord general not being at the castle he was gone on to london in quest of him and gregory lacking the means to inform him that the missing kenneth was already returned was forced to possess his soul in patience until his brother having learnt what was to be learnt of cromwell should journey home  and so the days sped on and a week wore itself out in peace at castle marleigh none dreaming of the volcano on which they stood each night crispin and gregory sat together at the board after kenneth and cynthia had withdrawn and both drank deepthe one for the vice of it the other as he had always done to seek forgetfulness  he needed it now more than ever for he feared that the consideration of cynthia might yet unman him had she scorned and avoided him and having such evidences of his ways of life he marvelled that she did nothe might have allowed his considerations of her to weigh less heavily as it was she sought him out nor seemed rebuffed at his efforts to evade her and in every way she manifested a kindliness that drove him almost to the point of despair and wellnigh to hating her  kenneth knowing naught of the womanly purpose that actuated her and seeing but the outward signs which with ready jealousy he misconstrued and magnified grew sullen and churlish to her to galliard and even to gregory  for hours he would mope alone nursing his jealous mood as though in this clownish fashion matters were to be mended did cynthia but speak to crispin he scowled did crispin answer her he grit his teeth at the covert meaning wherewith his fancy invested crispins tones whilst did they chance to laugh togethera contingency that fortunately for his sanity was rarehe writhed in fury he was a man transformed and at times there was murder in his heart had he been a swordsman of more than moderate skill and dared to pit himself against the tavern knight blood would have been shed in marleigh park betwixt them  it seemed at last as if with his insensate jealousy all the evil humours that had lain dormant in the boy were brought to the surface to overwhelm his erstwhile virtuesif qualities that have bigotry for a parent may truly be accounted virtues  he cast off not abruptly but piecemeal those outward symbolshis sombre clothes first twas his hat he exchanged for a feathertrimmed beaver of more sightly hue then those stiff white bands that reeked of sanctity and cant for a collar of fine point next it was his coat that took on a worldly edge of silver lace and so little by little step by step was the metamorphosis effected until by the end of the week he came forth a very butterfly of fashiona gallant dazzling cavalier out of a stern forbidding covenanter he was transformed in a few days into a most outrageous fop he walked in an atmosphere of musk that he himself exhaled his fair hairthat a while ago had hung so straight and limpwas now twisted into monstrous curls a bunch of which were gathered by his right ear in a ribbon of pale blue silk  galliard noted the change in amazement yet knowing to what follies youth is driven when it woos he accounted cynthia responsible for it and laughed in his sardonic way whereat the boy would blush and scowl in one gregory too looked on and laughed setting it down to the same cause even cynthia smiled whereat the tavern knight was driven to ponder  with a courtiers raiment kenneth put on too a courtiers ways he grew mincing and affected in his speech and hewhose utterance a while ago had been marked by a scriptural flavournow set it off with some of galliards less unseemly oaths  since it was a ruffling gallant cynthia required he swore that a ruffling gallant should she find him nor had he wit enough to see that his ribbons his fopperies and his capers served but to make him ridiculous in her eyes he did indeed perceive however that in spite of this wondrous transformation he made no progress in her favour  what signify these fripperies she asked him one day any more than did your coat of decent black are these also outward symbols  you may take them for such madam he answered sulkily you liked me not as i was  and i like you less as you are she broke in  cynthia you mock me he cried angrily  now heaven forbid i do but mark the change she answered airily these scented clothes are but a masquerade even as your coat of black and your cant were a masquerade then you simulated godliness now you simulate heaven knows what but now as then it is no more than a simulation a pretence of something that you are not  he left her in a pet and went in search of gregory into whose ear he poured the story of his woes that had their source in cynthias unkindness from this resulted a stormy interview twixt cynthia and her father in which cynthia at last declared that she would not be wedded to a fop  gregory shrugged his shoulders and laughed cynically replying that it was the way of young men to be fools and that through folly lay the road to wisdom  be that as it may she answered him with spirit this folly transcends all bounds master stewart may return to his scottish heather at castle marleigh he is wasting time  cynthia he cried  father she pleaded why be angry you would not have me marry against the inclinations of my heart you would not have me wedded to a man whom i despise  by what right do you despise him he demanded his brow dark  by the right of the freedom of my thoughtsthe only freedom that a woman knows for the rest it seems she is but a chattel of no more consideration to a man than his ox or his ass with which the scriptures rank hera thing to be given or taken bought or sold as others shall decree  child child what know you of these things he cried you are overwrought sweetheart and with the promise to wait until a calmer frame of mind in her should be more propitious to what he wished to say further on this score he left her  she went out of doors in quest of solitude among the naked trees of the park instead she found sir crispin seated deep in thought upon a fallen trunk  through the trees she espied him as she approached whilst the rustle of her gown announced to him her coming he rose as she drew nigh and doffing his hat made shift to pass on  sir crispin she called detaining him he turned  your servant mistress cynthia  are you afraid of me sir crispin  beauty madam is wont to inspire courage rather than fear he answered with a smile  that sir is an evasion not an answer  if read aright mistress cynthia it is also an answer  that you do not fear me  it is not a habit of mine  why then have you avoided me these three days past  despite himself crispin felt his breath quickeningquickening with a pleasure that he sought not to account forat the thought that she should have marked his absence from her side  because perhaps if i did not he answered slowly you might come to avoid me i am a proud man mistress cynthia  satan sir was proud but his pride led him to perdition  so indeed may mine he answered readily since it leads me from you  nay sir she laughed you go from me willingly enough  not willingly cynthia oh not willingly he began then of a sudden he checked his tongue and asked himself what he was saying with a halflaugh and a courtier manner he continued of two evils madam we must choose the lesser one  madam she echoed disregarding all else that he had said it is an ugly word and but a moment back you called me cynthia  twas a liberty that methought my grey hairs warranted and for which you should have reproved me  you have not grey hairs enough to warrant it sir crispin she answered archly but what if even so i account it no liberty  the heavy lids were lifted from her eyes and as their glance frank and kindly met his he trembled then with a polite smile he bowed  i thank you for the honour  for a moment she looked at him in a puzzled way then moved past him and as he stood stiffly erect watching her graceful figure he thought that she was about to leave him and was glad of it but ere she had taken half a dozen steps  sir crispin said she looking back at him over her shoulder i am walking to the cliffs  never was a man more plainly invited to become an escort but he ignored it a sad smile crept into his harsh face  i shall tell kenneth if i see him said he  at that she frowned  but i do not want him she protested sooner would i go alone  why then madam ill tell nobody  was ever man so dull she asked herself  there is a fine view from the cliffs said she  i have always thought so he agreed  she inclined to call him a fool yet she restrained herself she had an impulse to go her way without him but then she desired his company and cynthia was unused to having her desires frustrated so finding him impervious to suggestion  will you not come with me she asked at last pointblank  why yes if you wish it he answered without alacrity  you may remain sir  her offended tone aroused him now to the understanding that he was impolite contrite he stood beside her in a moment  with your permission mistress i will go with you i am a dull fellow and today i know not what mood is on me so sorry a one that i feared i should be poor company still if youll endure me ill do my best to prove entertaining  by no means she answered coldly i seek not the company of dull fellows and she was gone  he stood where she had left him and breathed a most ungallant prayer of thanks next he laughed softly to himself a laugh that was woeful with bitterness  fore george he muttered it is all that was wanting  he reseated himself upon the fallen tree and there he set himself to reflect and to realize that he warworn and callous come to castle marleigh on such an errand as was his should wax sick at the very thought of it for the sake of a chit of a maid with a mind to make a mock and a toy of him into his mind there entered even the possibility of flight forgetful of the wrongs he had suffered abandoning the vengeance he had sworn then with an oath he stemmed his thoughts  god in heaven am i a boy beardless and green he asked himself am i turned seventeen again that to look into a pair of eyes should make me forget all things but their existence then in a burst of passion would to heaven he muttered they had left me stark on worcester field  he rose abruptly and set out to walk aimlessly along until suddenly a turn in the path brought him face to face with cynthia she hailed him with a laugh  sir laggard i knew that willynilly you would follow me she cried and he taken aback could not but smile in answer and profess that she had conjectured rightly     chapter xiv the heart of cynthia ashburn   side by side stepped that oddly assorted pair alongthe maiden whose soul was as pure and fresh as the breeze that blew upon them from the sea and the man whose life years ago had been marred by a sorrow the quest of whose forgetfulness had led him through the mire of untold sin the girl upon the threshold of womanhood her life all before her and seeming to her untainted mind a joyous wholesome business the man midway on his illstarred career his every hope blighted save the one odious hope of vengeance which made him cling to a life he had proved worthless and ugly and that otherwise he had likely enough cast from him and as they walked  sir crispin she ventured timidly you are unhappy are you not  startled by her words and the tone of them galliard turned his head that he might observe her  i unhappy he laughed and it was a laugh calculated to acknowledge the fitness of her question rather than to refute it as he intended am i a clown cynthia to own myself unhappy at such a season and while you honour me with your company  she made a wry face in protest that he fenced with her  you are happy then she challenged him  what is happiness quoth he much as pilate may have questioned what was truth then before she could reply he hastened to add i have not been quite so happy these many years  it is not of the present moment that i speak she answered reprovingly for she scented no more than a compliment in his words but of your life  now either was he imbued with a sense of modesty touching the deeds of that life of his or else did he wisely realize that no theme could there be less suited to discourse upon with an innocent maid  mistress cynthia said he as though he had not heard her question i would say a word to you concerning kenneth  at that she turned upon him with a pout  but it is concerning yourself that i would have you talk it is not nice to disobey a lady besides i have little interest in master stewart  to have little interest in a future husband augurs ill for the time when he shall come to be your husband  i thought that you at least understood me kenneth will never be husband of mine sir crispin  cynthia he exclaimed  oh lackaday am i to wed a doll she demanded is heis he a man a maid may love sir crispin  indeed had you but seen the half of life that i have seen said he unthinkingly it might amaze you what manner of man a maid may loveor at least may marry come cynthia what fault do you find with him  why every fault  he laughed in unbelief  and whom are we to blame for all these faults that have turned you so against him  whom  yourself cynthia you use him ill child if his behaviour has been extravagant you are to blame you are severe with him and he in his rash endeavours to present himself in a guise that shall render him commendable in your eyes has overstepped discretion  has my father bidden you to tell me this  since when have i enjoyed your fathers confidence to that degree no no cynthia i plead the boys cause to you becausei know not because of what  it is ill to plead without knowing why let us forget the valiant kenneth they tell me sir crispinand she turned her glorious eyes upon him in a manner that must have witched a statue into answering herthat in the royal army you were known as the tavern knight  they tell you truly what of that  well what of it do you blush at the very thought  i blush he blinked and his eyes were full of humour as they met her gravealmost sorrowing glance then a fullhearted peal of laughter broke from him and scared a flight of gulls from the rocks of sheringham hithe below  oh cynthia youll kill me he gasped picture to yourself this crispin galliard blushing and giggling like a schoolgirl beset by her first lover picture it i say as well and as easily might you picture old lucifer warbling a litany for the edification of a nonconformist parson  her eyes were severe in their reproach  it is always so with you you laugh and jest and make a mock of everything such i doubt not has been your way from the commencement and tis thus that you are come to this condition  again he laughed but this time it was in bitterness  nay sweet mistress you are wrongyou are very wrong it was not always thus time was he paused bah tis the coward cries time was leave me the past cynthia it is dead and of the dead we should speak no ill he jested  what is there in your past she insisted despite his words what is there in it so to have warped a character that i am assured was onceis indeed stillof lofty and noble purpose what is it has brought you to the level you occupyyou who were born to lead you who  have done child have done he begged  nay tell me let us sit here and taking hold of his sleeve she sat herself upon a mound and made room for him beside her on the grass with a halflaugh and a sigh he obeyed her and there on the cliff in the glow of the september sun he took his seat at her side  a silence prevailed about them emphasized rather than broken by the droning chant of a fisherman mending his nets on the beach below the intermittent plash of the waves on the shingle and the scream of the gulls that circled overhead before the eyes of his flesh was stretched a wide desert of sky and water and before the eyes of his mind the hopeless desert of his thirtyeight years  he was almost tempted to speak the note of sympathy in her voice allured him and sympathy was to him as drink to one who perishes of thirst a passionate indefinable longing impelled him to pour out the story that in worcester he had related unto kenneth and thus to set himself better in her eyes to have her realize indeed that if he was come so low it was more the fault of others than his own the temptation drew him at a headlong pace to be checked at last by the memory that those others who had brought him to so sorry a condition were her own people the humour passed he laughed softly and shook his head  there is nothing that i can tell you child let us rather talk of kenneth  i do not wish to talk of kenneth  nay but you must willynilly must you think you it is only a warworn harddrinking swashbuckling ruffler that can sin does it not also occur to you that even a frail and tender little maid may do wrong as well  what wrong have i done she cried in consternation  a grievous wrong to this poor lad can you not realize how the only desire that governs him is the laudable one of appearing favourably in your eyes  that desire gives rise then to curious manifestations  he is mistaken in the means he adopts that is all in his heart his one aim is to win your esteem and after all it is the sentiment that matters not its manifestation why then are you unkind to him  but i am not unkind or is it unkindness to let him see that i mislike his capers would it not be vastly more unkind to ignore them and encourage him to pursue their indulgence i have no patience with him  as for those capers i am endeavouring to show you that you yourself have driven him to them  sir crispin she cried out you grow tiresome  aye said he i grow tiresome i grow tiresome because i preach of duty marry it is in truth a tiresome topic  how duty of what do you talk and a flush of incipient anger spread now on her fair cheek  i will be clearer said he imperturbably this lad is your betrothed he is at heart a good lad an honourable and honest ladat times haply overhonest and overhonourable but let that be to please a whim a caprice you set yourself to flout him as is the way of your sex when you behold a man your utter slave from thisbeing all unversed in the obliquity of womanhe conceives poor boy that he no longer finds favour in your eyes and to win back this the only thing that in the world he values he behaves foolishly you flout him anew and because of it he is as jealous with you as a hen with her brood  jealous echoed cynthia  why yes jealous and so far does he go as to be jealous even of me he cried with infinitely derisive relish think of ithe is jealous of me jealous of him they call the tavern knight  she did think of it as he bade her and by thinking she stumbled upon a discovery that left her breathless  strange how we may bear a sentiment in our hearts without so much as suspecting its existence until suddenly a chance word shall so urge it into life that it reveals itself with unmistakable distinctness with her the revelation began in a vague wonder at the scorn with which crispin invested the notion that kenneth should have cause for jealousy on his score was it she asked herself so monstrously unnatural then in a flash the answer cameand it was that far from being a matter for derision such an attitude in kenneth lacked not for foundation  in that moment she knew that it was because of crispin because of this man who spoke with such very scorn of self that kenneth had become in her eyes so mean and unworthy a creature loved him she haply never had but leastways she had toleratedbeen even flattered byhis wooing by contrasting him now with crispin she had grown to despise him his weakness his pusillanimity his meannesses of soul stood out in sharp relief by contrast with the masterful strength and the high spirit of sir crispin  so easily may our ideals change that the very graces of face and form that a while ago had pleased her in kenneth seemed now effeminate attributes wellattuned to a vacillating purposeless mind far greater beauty did her eyes behold in this grimfaced soldier of fortune the man as firm of purpose as he was upright of carriage gloomy proud and reckless still young yet past the callow age of adolescence since the day of his coming to castle marleigh she had brought herself to look upon him as a hero stepped from the romancers tales that in secret she had read the mystery that seemed to envelop him those hints at a past that was not goodbut the measure of whose evil in her pure innocence she could not guess his very melancholy his misfortunes and the deeds she had heard assigned to him all had served to fire her fancy and more besides although until that moment she knew it not  subconsciously all this had long dwelt in her mind and now of a sudden that selfderiding speech of crispins had made her aware of its presence and its meaning  she loved him that men said his life had not been nice that he was a soldier of fortune little better than an adventurer a man of no worldly weight were matters of no moment then to her she loved him she knew it now because he had mockingly bidden her to think whether kenneth had cause to be jealous of him and because upon thinking of it she found that did kenneth know what was in her heart he must have more than cause   she loved him with that rare love that will urge a woman to the last sacrifice a man may ask a love that gives and gives and seeks nothing in return that impels a woman to follow the man at his bidding be his way through the world cast in places never so rugged cleaving to him where all besides shall have abandoned him and however dire his lot asking of god no greater blessing than that of sharing it  and to such a love as this crispin was blindblind to the very possibility of its existence so blind that he laughed to scorn the idea of a puny milksop being jealous of him and so while she sat her soul all mastered by her discovery her face white and still for very awe of it he to whom this wealth was given pursued the odious task of wooing her for another  you have observedyou must have observed this insensate jealousy he was saying and how do you allay it you do not on the contrary you excite it at every turn you are exciting it now by havingand i dare swear for no other purposelured me to walk with you to sit here with you and preach your duty to you and when through jealousy he shall have flown to fresh absurdities shall you regret your conduct and the fruits it has borne shall you pity the lad and by kindness induce him to be wiser no you will mock and taunt him into yet worse displays and through these displays which arethough you may not have bethought you of itof your own contriving you will conclude that he is no fit mate for you and there will be heartburnings and years hence perhaps another tavern knight whose name will not be crispin galliard  she had listened with bent head indeed so deeply rapt by her discovery that she had but heard the half of what he said now of a sudden she looked up and meeting his glance  isis it a womans fault that you are as you are  no it is not but how does that concern the case of kenneth  it does not i was but curious i was not thinking of kenneth  he stared at her dumfounded had he been talking of kenneth to her with such eloquence and such fervour that she should calmly tell him as he paused that it was not of kenneth she had been thinking  you will think of him cynthia he begged you will bethink you too of what i have said and by being kinder and more indulgent with this youth you shall make him grow into a man you may take pride in deal fairly with him child and if anon you find you cannot truly love him then tell him so but tell him kindly and frankly instead of using him as you are doing  she was silent a moment and in their poignancy her feelings went very near to anger presently  i would sir crispin you could hear him talk of you said she  he talks ill not a doubt of it and like enough he has good cause  yet you saved his life  the words awoke crispin the philosopher of love to realities he recalled the circumstances of his saving kenneth and the price the boy was to pay for that service and it suddenly came to him that it was wasted breath to plead kenneths cause with cynthia when by his own future actions he was himself more than likely to destroy the boys every hope of wedding her the irony of his attitude smote him hard and he rose abruptly the sun hung now a round red globe upon the very brink of the sea  hereafter he may have little cause to thank me muttered he come mistress cynthia it grows late  she rose in mechanical obedience and together they retraced their steps in silence save for the stray word exchanged at intervals touching matters of no moment  but he had not advocated kenneths cause in vain for all that he little recked what his real argument had been what influences he had evoked to urge her to make her peace with the lad a melancholy listlessness of mind possessed her now crispin did not see never would see what was in her heart and it might not be hers to show him the life that might have signified was not to be lived and since that was so it seemed to matter little what befell  it was thus that when on the morrow her father returned to the subject she showed herself tractable and docile out of her indifference and to gregory she appeared not averse to listen to what he had to advance in the boys favour anon kenneths own humble pleading allied to his contrite and sorrowful appearance were received by her with that same indifference as also with indifference did she allow him later to kiss her hand and assume the flattering belief that he was rehabilitated in her favour  but pale grew mistress cynthias cheeks and sad her soul wistful she waxed sighing at every turn until it seemed to heras haply it hath seemed to many a maidthat all her life must she waste in vain sighs over a man who gave no single thought to her     chapter xv josephs return   on his side kenneth strove hard during the days that followed to right himself in her eyes but so headlong was he in the attempt and so misguided that presently he overshot his mark by dropping an unflattering word concerning crispin whereby he attributed to the tavern knights influence and example the degenerate change that had of late been wrought in him  cynthias eyes grew hard as he spoke and had he been wise he had better served his cause by talking in another vein but love and jealousy had so addled what poor brains the lord had bestowed upon him that he floundered on unmindful of any warning that took not the blunt shape of words at length however she stemmed the flow of invective that his lips poured forth  have i not told you already kenneth that it better becomes a gentleman not to slander the man to whom he owes his life in fact that a gentleman would scorn such an action  as he had protested before so did he protest now that what he had uttered was no slander and in his rage and mortification at the way she used him and for which he now bitterly upbraided her he was very near the point of tears like the blubbering schoolboy that at heart he was  and as for the debt madam he cried striking the oaken table of the hall with his clenched hand it is a debt that shall be paid a debt which this gentleman whom you defend would not permit me to contract until i had promised paymentaye fore georgeand with interest for in the payment i may risk my very life  i see no interest in that since you risk nothing more than what you owe him she answered with a disdain that brought the impending tears to his eyes but if he lacked the manliness to restrain them he possessed at least the shame to turn his back and hide them from her but tell me sir she added her curiosity awakened if i am to judge what was the nature of this bargain  he was silent for a moment and took a turn in the hallmastering himself to speakhis hands clasped behind his back and his eyes bent towards the polished floor which the evening sunlight filtered through the gules of the leaded windows splashed here and there with a crimson stain she sat in the great leathern chair at the head of the board and watching him waited  he was debating whether he was bound to secrecy in the matter and in the end he resolved that he was not thereupon pausing before her he succinctly told the story crispin had related to him that night in worcesterthe story of a great wrong that none but a craven could have left unavenged he added nothing to it subtracted nothing from it but told the tale as it had been told to him on that dreadful night the memory of which had still power to draw a shudder from him  cynthia sat with parted lips and eager eyes drinking in that touching narrative of suffering that was rather as some romancers fabrication than a true account of what a living man had undergone now with sorrow and pity in her heart and countenance now with anger and loathing she listened until he had done and even when he ceased speaking and flung himself into the nearest chair she sat on in silence for a spell  then of a sudden she turned a pair of flashing eyes upon the boy and in tones charged with a scorn ineffable  you dare she cried to speak of that man as you do knowing all this knowing what he has suffered you dare to rail in his absence against those sins to which his misfortunes have driven him how think you would it have fared with you you fool had you stood in the shoes of this unfortunate had you fallen on your craven knees and thanked the lord for allowing you to keep your miserable life had you succumbed to the blows of fate with a whine of texts upon your lips who are you she went on rising breathless in her wrath which caused him to recoil in sheer affright before her who are you and what are you that knowing what you know of this mans life you dare to sit in judgment upon his actions and condemn them answer me you fool  but never a word had he wherewith to meet that hail of angry contemptuous questions the answer that had been so ready to his lips that night at worcester when in a milder form the tavern knight had set him the same question he dared not proffer now the retort that sir crispin had not cause enough in the evil of others which had wrecked his life to risk the eternal damnation of his soul he dared no longer utter glibly enough had he said to that stern man that which he dared not say now to this sterner beauty perhaps it was fear of her that made him dumb perhaps that at last he knew himself for what he was by contrast with the man whose vices he had so heartily despised a while ago  shrinking back before her anger he racked his shallow mind in vain for a fitting answer but ere he had found one a heavy step sounded in the gallery that overlooked the hall and a moment later gregory ashburn descended his face was ghastly white and a heavy frown furrowed the space betwixt his brows  in the fleeting glance she bestowed upon her father she remarked not the disorder of his countenance whilst as for kenneth he had enough to hold his attention for the time  gregorys advent set an awkward constraint upon them nor had he any word to say as he came heavily up the hall  at the lower end of the long table he paused and resting his hand upon the board he seemed on the point of speaking when of a sudden a sound reached him that caused him to draw a sharp breath it was the rumble of wheels and the crack of a whip  it is joseph he cried in a voice the relief of which was so marked that cynthia noticed it and with that exclamation he flung past them and out through the doorway to meet his brother so opportunely returned  he reached the terrace steps as the coach pulled up and the lean figure of joseph ashburn emerged from it  so gregory he grumbled for greeting it was on a fools errand you sent me after all that knave your messenger found me in london at last when i had outworn my welcome at whitehall but swounds man he cried remarking the pallor of his brothers face what ails thee  i have news for you joseph answered gregory in a voice that shook  it is not cynthia he inquired nay for there she standsand her pretty lover by her side slife what a coxcomb the lads grown  and with that he hastened forward to kiss his niece and congratulate kenneth upon being restored to her  i heard of it lad in london quoth he a leer upon his sallow facethe story of how a fireeater named galliard befriended you trussed a parson and a trooper and dragged you out of jail a short hour before hangingtime  kenneth flushed he felt the sneer in josephs words like a stab the mans tone implied that another had done for him that which he would not have dared do for himself and kenneth felt that this was so said in cynthias presence with malicious purpose  he was right partly it was josephs way to be spiteful and venomous whenever chance afforded him the opportunity partly he had been particularly soured at present by his recent discomforts suffered in a cause wherewith he had no sympathythat of the union gregory desired twixt cynthia and kenneth  there was an evil smile on his thin lips and his crooked eyes rested tormentingly upon the young man a fresh taunt trembled on his viperish tongue when gregory plucked at the skirts of his coat and drew him aside they entered the chamber where they had held their last interview before joseph had set out for news of kenneth with an air of mystery gregory closed the door then turned to face his brother he stayed him in the act of unbuckling his swordbelt  wait joseph he cried dramatically this is no time to disarm keep your sword on your thigh man you will need it as you never yet have needed it he paused took a deep breath and hurled the news at his brother roland marleigh is here and he sat down like a man exhausted  joseph did not start he did not cry out he did not so much as change countenance a slight quiver of the eyelids was the only outward sign he gave of the shock that his brothers announcement had occasioned the hand that had rested on the buckle of his swordbelt slipped quietly to his side and he deliberately stepped up to gregory his eyes set searchingly upon the pale flabby face before him a sudden suspicion darting through his mind he took his brother by the shoulders and shook him vigorously  gregory you fool you have drunk overdeep in my absence  i have i have wailed gregory and my god twas he was my tablefellow and set me the example  like enough like enough returned joseph with a contemptuous laugh my poor gregory the wine has so fouled your worthless wits at last that they conjure up phantoms to sit at the table with you come man what petticoat business is this bestir yourself fool  at that gregory caught the drift of josephs suspicions  tis you are the fool he retorted angrily springing to his feet and towering above his brother  it was no ghost sat with me but roland marleigh himself in the flesh and strangely changed by time so changed that i knew him not nor should i know him now but for that which not ten minutes ago i overheard  his earnestness was too impressive his sanity too obvious and josephs suspicions were all scattered before it  he caught gregorys wrist in a grip that made him wince and forced him back into his seat  gadslife man what is it you mean he demanded through set teeth tell me  and forthwith gregory told him of the manner of kenneths coming to sheringham and to castle marleigh accompanied by one crispin galliard the same that had been known for his mad exploits in the late wars as rakehelly galliard and that was now known to the malignants as the tavern knight for his debauched habits crispins mention of roland marleigh on the night of his arrival now returned vividly to gregorys mind and he repeated it ending with the story that that very evening he had overheard kenneth telling cynthia  and this galliard then is none other than that pup of insolence roland marleigh grown into a dog of war quoth joseph  he was calmsingularly calm for one who had heard such news  there remains no doubt of it  and you saw this man day by day sat with him night by night over your damned sack and knew him not oddswounds man where were your eyes  i may have been blind but he is greatly changed i would defy you joseph to have recognized him  joseph sneered and the flash of his eyes told of the contempt wherein he held his brothers judgment and opinions  think not that gregory i have cause enough to remember him said joseph with an unpleasant laugh then as suddenly changing his tone for one of eager anxiety  but the lad gregory does he suspect think you  not a whit in that lies this fellows diabolical cunning learning of kenneths relations with us he seized the opportunity fate offered him that night at worcester and bound the lad on oath to help him when he should demand it without disclosing the names of those against whom he should require his services the boy expects at any moment to be bidden to go forth with him upon his mission of revenge little dreaming that it is here that that tragedy is to be played out  this comes of your fine matrimonial projects for cynthia muttered joseph acridly he laughed his unpleasant laugh again and for a spell there was silence  to think gregory he broke out at last that for a fortnight he should have been beneath this roof and you should have found no means of doing more effectively that which was done too carelessly eighteen years ago  he spoke as coldly as though the matter were a trivial one gregory shuddered and looked at his brother in alarm  what now fool cried joseph scowling are you as cowardly as you are blind damn me sir it seems well that i am returned ill have no marleigh plague my old age for me he paused a moment then continued in a quieter voice but one whose ring was sinister beyond words tomorrow i shall find a way to draw this your dog of war to some secluded ground i have some skill he pursued tapping his hilt as he spoke besides you shall be there gregory and he smiled darkly is there no other way asked gregory in distress  there was answered joseph there was in parliament at whitehall i met a manone colonel pridea bloodthirsty old puritan soldier who would give his right hand to see this galliard hanged galliard it seems slew the fellows son at worcester had i but known he added regretfullyhad your wits been keener and you had discovered it and sent me word i had found means to help colonel pride to his revenge as it ishe shrugged his shouldersthere is not time  it may be began gregory then stopped abruptly with an exclamation that caused joseph to wheel sharply round the door had opened and on the threshold sir crispin galliard stood deferentially hat in hand  josephs astonished glance played rapidly over him for a second then  who the devil may you be he blurted out  despite his anxiety gregory chuckled at the question the tavern knight came forward i am sir crispin galliard at your service said he bowing i was told that the master of marleigh was returned and that i should find you here and i hasten sir to proffer you my thanks for the generous shelter this house has given me this fortnight past  whilst he spoke he measured joseph with his eyes and his glance was as hateful as his words were civil joseph was lost in amazement little trace was there in this fellow of the roland marleigh he had known moreover he had looked to find an older man forgetting that rolands age could not exceed thirtyeight then again the fading light whilst revealing the straight supple lines of his lank figure softened the haggardness of the face and made him appear yet younger than the light of day would have shown him  in an instant joseph had recovered from his surprise and for all that his mind misgave him tortured by a desire to learn whether crispin was aware of their knowledge concerning himhis smile was serene and his tones level and pleasant as he made answer  sir you are very welcome you have valiantly served one dear to us and the entertainment of our poor house for as long as you may deign to honour it is but the paltriest of returns     chapter xvi the reckoning   sir crispin had heard naught of what was being said as he entered the room wherein the brothers plotted against him and he little dreamt that his identity was discovered he had but hastened to perform that which under ordinary circumstances would have been a natural enough duty towards the master of the house he had been actuated also by an impatience again to behold this joseph ashburnthe man who had dealt him that murderous swordthrust eighteen years ago he watched him attentively and gathering from his scrutiny that here was a dangerous subtle man different indeed to his dullwitted brother he had determined to act at once  and so when he appeared in the hall at suppertime he came armed and booted and equipped as for a journey  joseph was standing alone by the huge fireplace his face to the burning logs and his foot resting upon one of the andirons gregory and his daughter were talking together in the embrasure of a window by the other window across the hall stood kenneth alone and disconsolate gazing out at the drizzling rain that had begun to fall  as galliard descended joseph turned his head and his eyebrows shot up and wrinkled his forehead at beholding the knights equipment  how is this sir crispin said he you are going a journey  too long already have i imposed myself upon the hospitality of castle marleigh crispin answered politely as he came and stood before the blazing logs tonight mr ashburn i go hence  a curious expression flitted across josephs face the next moment his brows still knit as he sought to fathom his sudden action he was muttering the formal regrets that courtesy dictated but crispin had remarked that singular expression on josephs facefleeting though it had beenand it flashed across his mind that joseph knew him and as he moved away towards cynthia and her father he thanked heaven that he had taken such measures as he had thought wise and prudent for the carrying out of his resolve  following him with a glance joseph asked himself whether crispin had discovered that he was recognized and had determined to withdraw leaving his vengeance for another and more propitious season in answerlittle knowing the measure of the man he dealt withhe told himself it must be so and having arrived at that conclusion he there and then determined that crispin should not depart free to return and plague them when he listed since galliard shrank from forcing matters to an issue he himself would do it that very night and thereby settle for all time his business and so ere he sat down to sup joseph looked to it that his sword lay at hand behind his chair at the tablehead  the meal was a quiet one enough kenneth was sulking neath the fresh illusageas he deemed itthat he had suffered at cynthias hands cynthia in her turn was grave and silent that story of sir crispins sufferings gave her much to think of as did also his departure and more than once did galliard find her eyes fixed upon him with a look half of pity half of some other feeling that he was at a loss to interpret gregorys big voice was little heard the sinister glitter in his brothers eye made him apprehensive and ill at ease for him the hour was indeed in travail and like to bring forth strange doingsbut not half so much as it was for crispin and joseph each bent upon forcing matters to a head ere they quitted that board and yet but for these two the meal would have passed off in dismal silence joseph was at pains to keep suspicion from his guest and with that intent he talked gaily of this and that told of slight matters that had befallen him on his recent journey and of the doings that in london he had witnessed investing each trifling incident with a garb of wit that rendered it entertaining  and galliardactuated by the same motives grew reminiscent whenever joseph paused and let his nimble tongueeven nimblest at a table amuse those present or seem to amuse them by a score of drolleries  he drank deeply too and this joseph observed with satisfaction but here again he misjudged his man kenneth who ate but little seemed also to have developed an enormous thirst and crispin grew at length alarmed at that ever empty goblet so often filled he would have need of kenneth ere the hour was out and he rightly feared that did matters thus continue the lads aid was not to be reckoned with had kenneth sat beside him he might have whispered a word of restraint in his eat but the lad was on the other side of the board  at one moment crispin fancied that a look of intelligence passed from joseph to gregory and when presently gregory set himself to ply both him and the boy with wine his suspicions became certainties and he grew watchful and wary  anon cynthia rose upon the instant galliard was also on his feet he escorted her to the foot of the staircase and there  permit me mistress cynthia said he to take my leave of you in an hour or so i shall be riding away from castle marleigh  her eyes sought the ground and had he been observant of her he might have noticed that she paled slightly  fare you well sir said she in a low voice may happiness attend you  madam i thank you fare you well  he bowed low she dropped him a slight curtsey and ascended the stairs once as she reached the gallery above she turned he had resumed his seat at table and was in the act of filling his glass the servants had withdrawn and for half an hour thereafter they sat on sipping their wine and making conversationwhile crispin drained bumper after bumper and grew every instant more boisterous until at length his boisterousness passed into incoherence his eyelids drooped heavily and his chin kept ever and anon sinking forward on to his breast  kenneth flushed with wine yet master of his wits watched him with contempt this was the man cynthia preferred to him contempt was there also in joseph ashburns eye mingled with satisfaction he had not looked to find the task so easy at length he deemed the season ripe  my brother tells me that you were once acquainted with roland marleigh said he  aye he answered thickly i knew the doga merry reckless soul dn me twas his recklessness killed him poor devilthat and your hand mr ashburn so the story goes  what story  what story echoed crispin the story that i heard do you say i lie and swaying in his chair he sought to assume an air of defiance  joseph laughed in a fashion that made kenneths blood run cold  why no i dont deny it it was in fair fight he fell moreover he brought the duel upon himself  crispin spoke no word in answer but rose unsteadily to his feet so unsteadily that his chair was overset and fell with a crash behind him for a moment he surveyed it with a drunken leer then went lurching across the hall towards the door that led to the servants quarters the three men sat on watching his antics in contempt curiosity and amusement they saw him gain the heavy oaken door and close it they heard the bolts rasp as he shot them home and the lock click and they saw him withdraw the key and slip it into his pocket  the cold smile still played round josephs lips as crispin turned to face them again and on josephs lips did that same smile freeze as he saw him standing there erect and firm his drunkenness all vanished and his eyes keen and fierce as he heard the ring of his metallic voice  you lie joseph ashburn it was no fair fight it was no duel it was a foul murderous stroke you dealt him in the back thinking to butcher him as you butchered his wife and his babe but there is a god master ashburn he went on in an everswelling voice and i lived like a salamander i came through the flames in which you sought to destroy all trace of your vile deed i lived and i crispin galliard the debauched tavern knight that was once roland marleigh am here to demand a reckoning  the very incarnation was he then of an avenger as he stood towering before them his grim face livid with the passion into which he had lashed himself as he spoke his blazing eyes watching them in that cunning halfclosed way that was his when his mood was dangerous and yet the only one that quailed was kenneth his ally upon whom comprehension burst with stunning swiftness  joseph recovered quickly from the surprise of crispins suddenly reassumed sobriety he understood the trick that galliard had played upon them so that he might cut off their retreat in the only direction in which they might have sought assistance and he cursed himself for not having foreseen it still anxiety he felt none his sword was to his hand and gregory was armed at the very worst they were two calm and able men opposed to a halfintoxicated boy and a man whom fury he thought must strip of half his power probably indeed the lad would side with them despite his plighted word again he had but to raise his voice and though the door that crispin had fastened was a stout one he never doubted but that his call would penetrate it and bring his servants to his rescue  and so a smile of cynical unconcern returned to his lips and his answer was delivered in a cold incisive voice  the reckoning you have come to demand shall be paid you sir rakehelly galliard is the hero of many a reckless deed but my judgment is much at fault if this prove not his crowning recklessness and his last one gadswounds sir are you mad to come hither singlehanded to beard the lion in his den  rather the cur in his kennel sneered crispin back blood and wounds master joseph think you to affright me with words  still joseph smiled deeming himself master of the situation  were help needed the raising of my voice would bring it me but it is not we are three to one  you reckon wrongly mr stewart belongs to me tonightbound by an oath that twould damn his soul to break to help me when and where i may call upon him and i call upon him now kenneth draw your sword  kenneth groaned as he stood by clasping and unclasping his hands  gods curse on you he burst out you have tricked me you have cheated me  bear your oath in mind was the cold answer if you deem yourself wronged by me hereafter you shall have what satisfaction you demand but first fulfil me what you have sworn out with your blade man  still kenneth hesitated and but for gregorys rash action at that critical juncture it is possible that he would have elected to break his plighted word but gregory fearing that he might determine otherwise resolved there and then to remove the chance of it whipping out his sword he made a vicious pass at the lads breast kenneth avoided it by leaping backwards but in an instant gregory had sprung after him and seeing himself thus beset kenneth was forced to draw that he might protect himself  they stood in the space between the table and that part of the hall that abutted on to the terrace opposite to them by the door which he had closed stood crispin at the tablehead joseph still sat cool selfcontained even amused  he realized the rashness of gregorys attack upon one that might yet have been won over to their side but he never doubted that a few passes would dispose of the lads opposition and he sought not to interfere then he saw crispin advancing towards him slowly his rapier naked in his hand and he was forced to look to himself he caught at the sword that stood behind him and leaping to his feet he sprang forward to meet his grim antagonist galliards eyes flashed out a look of joy he raised his rapier and their blades met  to the clash of their meeting came an echoing clash from beyond the table  hold sir kenneth had cried as gregory bore down upon him but gregorys answer had been a lunge which the boy had been forced to parry taking that crossing of blades for a sign of opposition gregory thrust again more viciously kenneth parried narrowly his blade pointing straight at his aggressor he saw the opening and both instinct and the desire to repel gregorys onslaught drew him into attempting a riposte which drove gregory back until his shoulders touched the panels of the wall simultaneously the boys foot struck the back of the chair which in rising crispin had overset and he stumbled how it happened he scarcely knew but as he hurtled forward his blade slid along his opponents and entering gregorys right shoulder pinned him to the wainscot  joseph heard the tinkle of a falling blade and assumed it to be kenneths for the rest he was just then too busy to dare withdraw for a second his eyes from crispins until that hour joseph ashburn had accounted himself something of a swordsman and more than a match for most masters of the weapon but in crispin he found a fencer of a quality such as he had never yet encountered every feint every botte in his catalogue had he paraded in quick succession yet ever with the same resulthis point was foiled and put aside with ease  desperately he fought now darting that point of his hither and thither in and out whenever the slightest opening offered yet ever did it meet the gentle averting pressure of crispins blade he fought on and marvelled as the seconds went by that gregory came not to his aid then the sickening thought that perhaps gregory was overcome occurred to him in such a case he must reckon upon himself alone he cursed the overconfidence that had led him into that everfatal error of underestimating his adversary he might have known that one who had acquired sir crispins fame was no ordinary man but one accustomed to face great odds and master them he might call for help  he marvelled as the thought occurred to him that the clatter of their blades had not drawn his servants from their quarters fencing still he raised his voice  ho there john stephen  spare your breath growled the knight i dare swear youll have need of it none will hear you call as you will i gave your four henchmen a flagon of wine wherein to drink to my safe journey hence they have emptied it ere this i make no doubt and a single glass of it would set the hardest toper asleep for the round of the clock  an oath was josephs only answera curse it was upon his own folly and assurance a little while ago he had thought to have drawn so tight a net about this ruler and here was he now taken in its very toils wellnigh exhausted and in his enemys power  it occurred to him then that crispin stayed his hand that he fenced only on the defensive and he wondered what might his motive be he realized that he was mastered and that at any moment galliard might send home his blade he was bathed from head to foot in a sweat that was at once of exertion and despair a frenzy seized him might he not yet turn to advantage this hesitancy of crispins to strike the final blow  he braced himself for a supreme effort and turning his wrist from a simulated thrust in the first position he doubled and stretching out lunged vigorously in quarte as he lengthened his arm in the stroke there came a sudden twitch at his wrist the weapon was twisted from his grasp and he stood disarmed at crispins mercy  a gurgling cry broke despite him from his lips and his eyes grew wide in a sickly terror as they encountered the knights sinister glance not three paces behind him was the wall and on it within the hands easy reach hung many a trophied weapon that might have served him then but the fascination of fear was upon him benumbing his wits and paralysing his limbs with the thought that the next pulsation of his tumultuous heart would prove its last the calm unflinching courage that had been josephs only virtue was shattered and his iron will that had unscrupulously held hitherto his very conscience in bondage was turned to water now that he stood face to face with death  eons of time it seemed to him were sped since the sword was wrenched from his hand and still the stroke he awaited came not still crispin stood sinister and silent before him watching him with magnetic fascinating eyesas the snake watches the birdeyes from which joseph could not withdraw his own and yet before which it seemed to him that he quaked and shrivelled  the candles were burning low in their sconces and the corners of that ample gloomy hall were filled with mysterious shadows that formed a setting well attuned to the grim picture made by those two figuresthe one towering stern and vengeful the other crouching palsied and livid  beyond the table and with the wounded gregorylying unconscious and bleedingat his feet stood kenneth looking on in silence in wonder and in some horror too  to him also as he watched the seconds seemed minutes from the time when crispin had disarmed his opponent until with a laughshort and sudden as a stabhe dropped his sword and caught his victim by the throat  however fierce the passion that had actuated crispin it had been held hitherto in strong subjection but now at last it suddenly welled up and mastered him causing him to cast all restraint to the winds to abandon reason and to give way to the lust of rage that rendered ungovernable his mood  like a burst of flame from embers that have been smouldering was the upleaping of his madness transfiguring his face and transforming his whole being a new unconquerable strength possessed him his pulses throbbed swiftly and madly with the quickened coursing of his blood and his soul was filled with the cruel elation that attends a lust about to be indulged the elation of the beast about to rend its prey  he was pervaded by the desire to wreak slowly and with his hands the destruction of his broken enemy to have passed his sword through him would have been too swiftly done the man would have died and crispin would have known nothing of his sufferings but to take him thus by the throat slowly to choke the lifes breath out of him to feel his desperate writhing struggles to be conscious of every agonized twitch of his sinews to watch the purpling face the swelling veins the protruding eyes filled with the dumb horror of his agony to hold him thuseach second becoming a distinct appreciable division of timeand thus to take what payment he could for all the blighted years that lay behind himthis he felt would be something like revenge  meanwhile the shock of surprise at the unlookedfor movement had awakened again the man in joseph for a second even hope knocked at his heart he was sinewy and active and perchance he might yet make galliard repent that he had discarded his rapier the knights reason for doing so he thought he had in crispins contemptuous words  good steel were too great an honour for you mr ashburn  and as he spoke his lean nervous fingers tightened about josephs throat in a grip that crushed the breath from him and with it the newborn hope of proving master in his fresh combat he had not reckoned with this galleyweaned strength of crispins a strength that was a revelation to joseph as he felt himself almost lifted from the ground and swung this way and that like a babe in the hands of a grown man vain were his struggles his strength ebbed fast the blood held overlong in his head was already obscuring his vision when at last the grip relaxed and his breathing was freed as his sight cleared again he found himself back in his chair at the tablehead and beside him sir crispin his left hand resting upon the board his right grasping once more the sword and his eyes bent mockingly and evilly upon his victim  kenneth looking on could not repress a shudder he had known crispin for a tempestuous man quickly moved to wrath and he had oftentimes seen anger make terrible his face and glance but never had he seen aught in him to rival this present frenzy it rendered satanical the baleful glance of his eyes and the awful smile of hate and mockery with which he gazed at last upon the helpless quarry that he had waited eighteen years to bring to earth i would said crispin in a harsh deliberate voice that you had a score of lives master joseph as it is i have done what i could two agonies have you undergone already and i am inclined to mercy the end is at hand if you have prayers to say say them master ashburn though i doubt me it will be wasted breathyou are overripe for hell  you mean to kill me he gasped growing yet a shade more livid  does the suspicion of it but occur to you laughed crispin and yet twice already have i given you a foretaste of death think you i but jested  josephs teeth clicked together in a snap of determination that sneer of crispins acted upon him as a blowbut as a blow that arouses the desire to retaliate rather than lays low he braced himself for fresh resistance not of action for that he realized was futile but of argument  it is murder that you do he cried  no it is justice it has been long on the way but it has come at last  bethink you mr marleigh  call me not by that name cried the other harshly fearfully i have not borne it these eighteen years and thanks to what you have made me it is not meet that i should bear it now there was a pause then joseph spoke again with great calm and earnestness  bethink you sir crispin of what you are about to do it can benefit you in naught  oddslife think you it cannot think you it will benefit me naught to see you earn at last your reward  you may have dearly to pay for what at best must prove a fleeting satisfaction  not a fleeting one joseph he laughed but one the memory of which shall send me rejoicing through what years or days of life be left me a satisfaction that for eighteen years i have been waiting to experience though the moment after it be mine find me stark and cold  sir crispin you are in enmity with the parliamentan outlaw almost i have some influence much influence by exerting it  have done sir cried crispin angrily you talk in vain what to me is life or aught that life can give if i have so long endured the burden of it it has been so that i might draw from it this hour do you think there is any bribe you could offer would turn me from my purpose  a groan from gregory who was regaining consciousness drew his attention aside  truss him up kenneth he commanded pointing to the recumbent figure how do you hesitate now as god lives ill be obeyed or you shall have an unpleasant reminder of the oath you swore me  with a look of loathing the lad dropped on his knees to do as he was bidden then of a sudden  i have not the means he announced  fool does he not wear a swordbelt and a sash come attend to it  why do you force me to do this the lad still protested passionately you have tricked and cheated me yet i have kept my oath and rendered you the assistance you required they are in your power now can you not do the rest yourself  on my soul master stewart i am overpatient with you are we to wrangle at every step before youll take it i will have your assistance through this matter as you swore to give it come truss me that fellow and have done with words  his fierceness overthrew the boys outburst of resistance kenneth had wit enough to see that his mood was not one to brook much opposition and so with an oath and a groan he went to work to pinion gregory  then joseph spoke again weigh well this act of yours sir crispin he cried you are still young much of life lies yet before you do not wantonly destroy it by an act that cannot repair the past  but it can avenge it joseph as for my life you destroyed it years ago the future has naught to offer me the present has this and he drew back his sword to strike     chapter xvii joseph drives a bargain   a new terror leapt into josephs eyes at that movement of crispins and for the third time that night did he taste the agony that is deaths forerunner yet galliard delayed the stroke he held his sword poised the point aimed at josephs breast and holding he watched him marking each phase of the terror reflected upon his livid countenance he was loth to strike for to strike would mean to end this exquisite torture of horror to which he was subjecting him  broken joseph had been before and passive now of a sudden he grew violent again but in a different way he flung himself upon his knees before sir crispin and passionately he pleaded for the sparing of his miserable life  crispin looked on with an eye both of scorn and of cold relish it was thus he wished to see him broken and agonized suffering thus something of all that which he himself had suffered through despair in the years that were sped with satisfaction then he watched his victims agony he watched it too with scorn and some loathingfor a craven was in his eyes an ugly sight and joseph in that moment was truly become as vile a coward as ever man beheld his parchmentlike face was grey and mottled his brow bedewed with sweat his lips were blue and quivering his eyes bloodshot and almost threatening tears  in the silence of one who waits stood crispin listening calm and unmoved as though he heard not until josephs whining prayers culminated in an offer to make reparation then crispin broke in at length with an impatient gesture  what reparation can you make you murderer can you restore to me the wife and child you butchered eighteen years ago  i can restore your child at least returned the other i can and will restore him to you if you but stay your hand that and much more will i do to repair the past  unconsciously crispin lowered his swordarm and for a full minute he stood and stared at joseph his jaw was fallen and the grim firmness all gone from his face and replaced by amazement then unbelief followed by inquiry then unbelief again the pallor of his cheeks seemed to intensify at last however he broke into a hard laugh  what lie is this you offer me zounds man are you not afraid  it is no lie joseph cried in accents so earnest that some of the unbelief passed again from galliards face it is the truthgods truth your son lives  hellhound it is a lie on that fell night as i swooned under your cowardly thrust i heard you calling to your brother to slit the squalling bastards throat those were your very words master joseph  i own i bade him do it but i was not obeyed he swore we should give the babe a chance of life it should never know whose son it was he said and i agreed we took the boy away he has lived and thrived  the knight sank on to a chair as though bereft of strength he sought to think but thinking coherently he could not at last  how shall i know that you are not lying what proof can you advance he demanded hoarsely  i swear that what i have told you is true i swear it by the cross of our redeemer he protested with a solemnity that was not without effect upon crispin nevertheless he sneered  i ask for proofs man not oaths what proofs can you afford me  there are the man and the woman whom the lad was reared by  and where shall i find them  joseph opened his lips to answer then closed them again in his eagerness he had almost parted with the information which he now proposed to make the price of his life he regained confidence at crispins tone and questions gathering from both that the knight was willing to believe if proof were set before him he rose to his feet and when next he spoke his voice had won back much of its habitual calm deliberateness  that said he i will tell you when you have promised to go hence leaving gregory and me unharmed i will supply you with what money you may need and i will give you a letter to those people so couched that what they tell you by virtue of it shall be a corroboration of my words  his elbow resting upon the table and his hand to his brow so that it shaded his eyes sat crispin long in thought swayed by emotions and doubts the like of which he had never yet known in the whole of his chequered life was joseph lying to him  that was the question that repeatedly arose and oddly enough for all his mistrust of the man he was inclined to account true the ring of his words joseph watched him with much anxiety and some hope  at length crispin withdrew his hands from eyes that were grown haggard and rose  let us see the letter that you will write said he there you have pen ink and paper write  you promise asked joseph  i will tell you when you have written  in a hand that shook somewhat joseph wrote a few lines then handed crispin the sheet whereon he read  the bearer of this is sir crispin galliard who is intimately interested in the matter that lies betwixt us and whom i pray you answer fully and accurately the questions he may put you in that connexion  i understand said crispin slowly yes it will serve now the superscription and he returned the paper  ashburn was himself again by now he realized the advantage he had gained and he would not easily relinquish it  i shall add the superscription said he calmly when you swear to depart without further molesting us  crispin paused a moment weighing the position well in his mind if joseph lied to him now he would find means to return he told himself and so he took the oath demanded  joseph dipped his pen and paused meditatively to watch a drop of ink wherewith it was overladen fall back into the horn the briefest of pauses was it yet it was not the accident it appeared to be hitherto joseph had been as sincere as he had been earnest intent alone upon saving his life at all costs and forgetting in his fear of the present the dangers that the future might hold for him were crispin galliard still at large but in that second of dipping his quill assured that the peril of the moment was overcome and that crispin would go forth as he said the devil whispered in his ear a cunning and vile suggestion as he watched the drop of ink roll from his penpoint he remembered that in london there dwelt at the sign of the anchor in thames street one colonel pride whose son this galliard had slain and who did he once lay hands upon him was not like to let him go again in a second was the thought conceived and the determination taken and as he folded the letter and set upon it the superscription joseph felt that he could have cried out in his exultation at the cunning manner in which he was outwitting his enemy  crispin took the package and read thereon  this is to mr henry lane at the sign of the anchor thames street london  the name was a fictitious oneone that joseph had set down upon the spur of the moment his intention being to send a messenger that should outstrip sir crispin and warn colonel pride of his coming  it is well was crispins only comment he too was grown calm again and fully master of himself he placed the letter carefully within the breast of his doublet  if you have lied to me if this is but a shift to win your miserable life rest assured master ashburn that you have but put off the day for a very little while  it was on josephs lips to answer that none of us are immortal but he bethought him that the pleasantry might be illtimed and bowed in silence  galliard took his hat and cloak from the chair on which he had placed them upon descending that evening then he turned again to joseph  you spoke of money a moment ago he said in the tones of one demanding what is his own the tones of a gentleman speaking to his steward i will take two hundred caroluses more i cannot carry in comfort  joseph gasped at the amount for a second it even entered his mind to resist the demand then he remembered that there was a brace of pistols in his study if he could get those he would settle matters there and then without the aid of colonel pride  i will fetch the money said he betraying his purpose by his alacrity  by your leave master ashburn i will come with you  josephs eyes flashed him a quick look of baffled hate  as you will said he with an ill grace  as they passed out crispin turned to kenneth  remember sir you are still in my service see that you keep good watch  kenneth bent his head without replying but master gregory required little watching he lay a helpless halfswooning heap upon the floor which he had smeared with the blood oozing from his wounded shoulder even were he untrussed there was little to be feared from him  during the brief while they were alone together kenneth did not so much as attempt to speak to him he sat himself down upon the nearest chair and with his chin in his hands and his elbows on his knees he pondered over the miserable predicament into which sir crispin had got him and more bitter than ever it had been was his enmity at that moment towards the knight that galliard should be upon the eve of finding his son and a sequel to the story he had heard from him that night in worcester was to kenneth a thing of no interest or moment galliard had ruined him with these ashburns he could never now hope to win the hand of cynthia to achieve which he had been willing to turn both fool and knaveaye had turned both there was naught left him but to return him to the paltry scottish estate of his fathers there to meet the sneers of those who no doubt had heard that he was gone south to marry a great english heiress  that at such a season he could think of this but serves to prove the shallow nature of his feelings a love was his that had gain and vanity for its foundationin fact it was no love at all for what he accounted love for cynthia was but the love of himself which through cynthia he sought to indulge  he cursed the illluck that had brought crispin into his life he cursed crispin for the evil he had suffered from him forgetting that but for crispin he would have been carrion a month ago and more  deep at his bitter musings was he when the door opened again to admit joseph followed by galliard the knight came across the hall and stooped to look at gregory  you may untruss him kenneth when i am gone said he and in a quarter of an hour from now you are released from your oath to me fare you well he added with unusual gentleness and turning a glance that was almost regretful upon the lad we are not like to meet again but should we i trust it may be in happier times if i have harmed you in this business remember that my need was great fare you well and he held out his hand  take yourself to hell sir answered kenneth turning his back upon him the ghost of an evil smile played round joseph ashburns lips as he watched them     chapter xviii counterplot   so soon as sir crispin had taken his departure and whilst yet the beat of his horses hoofs was to be distinguished above the driving storm of rain and wind without joseph hastened across the hall to the servants quarters there he found his four grooms slumbering deeply their faces white and clammy and their limbs twisted into odd helpless attitudes vainly did he rain down upon them kicks and curses arouse them he could not from the stupor in whose thrall they lay  and so seizing a lanthorn he passed out to the stables whence crispin had lately taken his best nag and with his own hands he saddled a horse his lips were screwed into a curious smilea smile that still lingered upon them when presently he retraced his steps to the room where his brother sat with kenneth  in his absence the lad had dressed gregorys wound he had induced him to take a little wine and had set him upon a chair in which he now lay back white and exhausted  the quarter of an hour is passed sir said joseph coldly as he entered  kenneth made no sign that he heard he sat on like a man in a dream his eyes that saw nothing were bent upon gregorys pale flabby face  the quarter of an hour is passed sir joseph repeated in a louder voice  kenneth looked up then rose and sighed passing his hand wearily across his forehead  i understand sir he replied in a low voice you mean that i must go  joseph waited a moment before replying then  it is past midnight he said slowly and the weather is wild you may lie here until morning if you are so minded but go you must then he added sternly i need scarce say sir that you must have no speech with mistress cynthia nor that never again must you set foot within castle marleigh  i understand sir i understand but you deal hardly with me  joseph raised his eyebrows in questioning surprise  i was the victim of my oath given when i knew not against whom my hand was to be lifted oh sir am i to suffer all my life for a fault that was not my own you master gregory he cried turning passionately to cynthias father you are perchance more merciful you understand my positionhow i was forced into it  gregory opened his heavy eyes  a plague on you master stewart he groaned i understand that you have given me a wound that will take a month to heal  it was an accident sir i swear it was an accident  to swear this and that appears to be your chief diversion in life growled gregory for answer you had best go we are not likely to listen to excuses  did you rather suggest a remedy joseph put in quietly we might hear you  kenneth swung round and faced him hope brightening his eyes  what remedy is there how can i undo what i have done show me but the way and ill follow it no matter where it leads  such protestations had joseph looked to hear and he was hard put to it to dissemble his satisfaction for a while he was silent making pretence to ponder at length  kenneth he said you may in some measure repair the evil you have done and if you are ready to undergo some slight discomfort i shall be willing on my side to forget this night  tell me how sir and whatever the cost i will perform it  he gave no thought to the fact that crispins grievance against the ashburns was wellfounded that they had wrecked his life even as they had sought to destroy it even as eighteen years ago they had destroyed his wifes his only thought was cynthia his only wish was to possess her besides that justice and honour itself were of small account  it is but a slight matter answered joseph a matter that i might entrust to one of my grooms  that whilst his grooms lay drugged the matter was so pressing that his messenger must set out that very night joseph did not think of adding  i would sir answered the boy that the task were great and difficult  yes yes answered joseph with biting sarcasm we are acquainted with both your courage and your resource he sat silent and thoughtful for some moments then with a sudden sharp glance at the lad  you shall have this chance of setting yourself right with us he said then abruptly he added  go make ready for a journey you must set out within the hour for london take what you may require and arm yourself then return to me here  gregory who despite his sluggish wits divinedpartly at leastwhat was afoot made shift to speak but his brother silenced him with a glance  go joseph said to the boy and without comment kenneth rose and left them  what would you do asked gregory when the door had closed  make doubly sure of that ruffian answered joseph coldly colonel pride might be absent when he arrives and he might learn that none of the name of lane dwells at the anchor in thames street it would be fatal to awaken his suspicions and bring him back to us  but surely richard or stephen might carry your errand  they might were they not so drugged that they cannot be aroused i might even go myself but it is better so he laughed softly there is even comedy in it kenneth shall outride our bloodthirsty knight to warn pride of his coming and when he comes he will walk into the hands of the hangman it will be a surprise for him for the rest i shall keep my promise concerning his son he shall have news of him from pridebut when too late to be of service  gregory shuddered  fore god joseph tis a foul thing you do he cried sooner would i never set eyes on the lad again let him go his ways as you intended  i never did intend it what trustier messenger could i find now that i have lent him zest by fright to win cynthia we may rely upon him safely to do that in which another might fail  joseph you will roast in hell for it  joseph laughed him to scorn  to bed with you you canting hypocrite your wound makes you lightheaded  it was a halfhour ere kenneth returned booted cloaked and ready for his journey he found joseph alone busily writing and in obedience to a sign he sat him down to wait  a few minutes passed then with a final scratch and splutter joseph flung down his pen with the sandbox tilted in the air like a dicer about to make his throw he looked at the lad  you will spare neither whip nor spur until you arrive in london master kenneth you must ride night and day the matter is of the greatest urgency  kenneth nodded that he understood and joseph sprinkled the sand over the written page  i know not when you should reach london so that you may be in time but he continued and as he spoke he creased the paper and poured the superfluous sand back into the box i should say that by midnight tomorrow your message should be delivered aye he continued in answer to the lads gasp of surprise it is hard riding i know but if you would win cynthia you must do it spare neither money nor horseflesh and keep to the saddle until you are in thames street  he folded the letter sealed it and wrote the superscription this to colonel pride at the sign of the anchor in thames street  he rose and handed the package to kenneth to whom the superscription meant nothing since he had not seen that borne by the letter which crispin had received  you will deliver this intact and with your own hands to colonel pride in personnone other should he be absent from thames street upon your arrival seek him out instantly wherever he may be and give him this upon your faithful observance of these conditions remember that your future depends if you are in time as indeed i trust and think you will be you may account yourself cynthias husband fail andwell you need not return here  i shall not fail sir cried kenneth what man can do to accomplish the journey within twentyfour hours i will do  he would have stopped to thank joseph for the signal favour of this chance of rehabilitation but joseph cut him short  take this purse he cried impatiently you will find a horse ready saddled in the stables ride it hard it will bear you to norton at least there get you a fresh one and when that is done another now be off     chapter xix the interrupted journey   when the tavern knight left the gates of marleigh park behind him on that wild october night he drove deep the rowels of his spurs and set his horse at a perilous gallop along the road to norwich the action was of instinct rather than of thought in the turbulent sea of his mind one clear current there was and one onlythe knowledge that he was bound for london for news of this son of his whom joseph told him lived he paused not even to speculate what manner of man his child was grown nor yet what walk of life he had been reared to tread he lived he was somewhere in the world that for the time sufficed him the ashburns had not it seemed destroyed quite everything that made his life worth enduringthe life that so often and so wantonly he had exposed  his son lived and in london he should have news of him to london then must he get himself with all dispatch and he swore to take no rest until he reached it and with that firm resolve to urge him he ploughed his horses flanks and sped on through the night the rain beat in his face yet he scarce remarked it as again more by instinct than by reasonhe buried his face to the eyes in the folds of his cloak  later the rain ceased and clearer grew the line of light betwixt the hedgerows by which his horse had steered its desperate career fitfully a crescent moon peered out from among the winddriven clouds the poor ruffler was fallen into meditation and noted not that his nag did no more than amble he roused himself of a sudden when halfway down a gentle slope some five miles from norwich and out of temper at discovering the sluggishness of the pace he again gave the horse a taste of the spurs the action was fatal the incline was become a bed of sodden clay and he had not noticed with what misgivings his horse pursued the treacherous footing the sting of the spur made the animal bound forward and the next instant a raucous oath broke from crispin as the nag floundered and dropped on its knees like a stone from a catapult galliard flew over its head and rolled down the few remaining yards of the slope into a very lake of slimy water at the bottom  down this same hill some twenty minutes later came kenneth stewart with infinite precaution he was in hastea haste more desperate far than even crispins but his character held none of galliards recklessness nor were his wits fogged by such news as crispin had heard that night he realized that to be swift he must be cautious in his nightriding and so carefully he came with a firm hand on the reins yet leaving it to his horse to find safe footing  he had reached the level ground in safety and was about to put his nag to a smarter pace when of a sudden from the darkness of the hedge he was hailed by a harsh metallic voice the sound of which sent a tremor through him  sir you are choicely met whoever you may be i have suffered a mischance down that cursed hill and my horse has gone lame  kenneth kept his cloak over his mouth trusting that the muffling would sufficiently disguise his accents as he made answer  i am in haste my master what is your will  why marry so am i in haste my will is your horse sir oh im no robber ill pay you for it and handsomely but have it i must twill be no great discomfort for you to walk to norwich you may do it in an hour  my horse sir is not for sale was kenneths brief answer give you good night  hold man blood and hell stop if youll not sell the worthless beast to serve a gentleman ill shoot it under you make your choice  kenneth caught the gleam of a pistolbarrel pointed at him from the hedge and he shivered what was he to do every instant was precious to him as in a flash it came to him that perchance sir crispin also rode to london and that it was expected of him to arrive there first if he were to be in time swiftly he weighed the odds in his mind and took the determination to dash past sir crispin risking his aim and trusting to the dark to befriend him  but even as he determined thus what moon there was became unveiled and the light of it fell upon his face which was turned towards galliard an exclamation of surprise escaped sir crispin  slife master stewart i knew not your voice whither do you ride  what is it to you have you not wrought enough of evil for me am i never to be rid of you castle marleigh he added with wellfeigned anger has closed its doors upon me what does it signify to you whither i ride suffer me leastways to pass unmolested and to leave you  kenneths passionate reproaches cut galliard keenly he held himself at that moment a very knave for having dragged this boy into his work of vengeance and thereby cast a blight upon his life he sought for words wherein to give expression to something of what he felt then realizing how futile and effete all words must prove he waved his hand in the direction of the road  go master stewart he muttered your way is clear  and kenneth waiting for no second invitation rode on and left him he rode with gratitude in his heart to the providence that had caused him so easily to overcome an obstacle that at first he had held impassable stronger grew in his mind the conviction that to fulfil the mission joseph required of him he must reach london before sir crispin the knowledge that he was ahead of him and that he must derive an ample start from galliards mishap warmed him like wine  his mind thus relieved from its weight of anxiety he little recked fatigue and such excellent use did he make of his horse that he reached newmarket on it an hour before the morrows moon  an hour he rested there and broke his fast then on a fresh horsea powerful and willing animal he set out once more  by halfpast two he was at newport but so hard had he ridden that man and beast alike were in a lather of sweat and whilst he himself felt sick and tired the horse was utterly unfit to bear him farther for half an hour he rested there and made a meal whose chief constituent was brandy then on a third horse he started upon the last stage of his journey  the wind was damp and penetrating the roads veritable morasses of mud and overhead gloomy banks of dark grey clouds moved sluggishly the light that was filtered through them giving the landscape a bleak and dreary aspect in his jaded condition kenneth soon became a prey to the depression of it his lightness of heart of some dozen hours ago was now all gone and not even the knowledge that his mission was wellnigh accomplished sufficed to cheer him to add to his discomfort a fine rain set in towards four oclock and when a couple of hours later he clattered along the road cut through a wooded slope in the direction of waltham he was become a very limp and lifeless individual  he noticed not the horsemen moving cautiously among the closelyset trees on either side of the road it was growing prematurely dark and objects were none too distinct and thus it befell that when from the reverie of dejection into which he had fallen he was suddenly aroused by the thud of hoofs he looked up to find two mounted men barring the road some ten yards in front of him their attitude was unmistakable and it crossed poor kenneths mind that he was beset by robbers but a second glance showed him their red cloaks and military steel caps and he knew them for soldiers of the commonwealth  hearing the beat of hoofs behind him he looked over his shoulder to see four other troopers closing rapidly down upon him clearly he was the object of their attention he had been a fool not to have perceived this earlier and his heart misgave him for all that had he paused to think he must have realized that he had naught to fear and that in this some mistake must lie  halt thundered the deep voice of the sergeant who with a trooper held the road in front  kenneth drew up within a yard of them conscious that the mans dark eyes were scanning him sharply from beneath his morion  who are you sir the bass voice demanded  alas for the vanity of poor human mites even kenneth who never yet had achieved aught for the cause he served grew of a sudden chill to think that perchance this sergeant might recognize his name for one that he had heard before associated with deeds performed on the kings behalf  for a second he hesitated then  blount he stammered jasper blount  he little thought how that fruit of his vanity was to prove his undoing thereafter  verily sneered the sergeant it almost seemed you had forgotten it and from that sneer kenneth gathered with fresh dread that the fellow mistrusted him  whence are you master blount  again kenneth hesitated then recalling ashburns high favour with the parliament and seeing that it could but advance his cause to state the true sum of his journey  from castle marleigh he replied  verily sir you seem yet in some doubt whither do you go  to london  on what errand the sergeants questions fell swift as swordstrokes  with letters for colonel pride  the reply delivered more boldly than kenneth had spoken hitherto was not without its effect  from whom are these letters  from mr joseph ashburn of castle marleigh  produce them  with trembling fingers kenneth complied this the sergeant observed as he took the package  what ails you man quoth he  naught sir tis the cold  the sergeant scanned the package and its seal in a measure it was a passport and he was forced to the conclusion that this man was indeed the messenger he represented himself certainly he had not the air nor the bearing of him for whom they waited nor did the sergeant think that their quarry would have armed himself with a dummy package against such a strait and yet the sergeant was not master after all and did he let this fellow pursue his journey he might reap trouble for it hereafter whilst likewise if he detained him colonel pride he knew was not an overpatient man he was still debating what course to take and had turned to his companion with the muttered question what think you peter when by his precipitancy kenneth ruined his slender chance of being permitted to depart  i pray you sir now that you know my errand suffer me to pass on  there was an eager tremor in his voice that the sergeant mistook for fear he noted it and remembering the boys hesitancy in answering his earlier questions he decided upon his course of action  we shall not delay your journey sir he answered eyeing kenneth sharply and as your way must lie through waltham i will but ask you to suffer us to ride with you thus far so that there you may answer any questions our captain may have to ask ere you proceed  but sir  no more master courier snarled the sergeant then beckoning a trooper to his side he whispered an order in his ear  as the man withdrew they wheeled their horses and at a sharp word of command kenneth rode on towards waltham between the sergeant and a trooper     chapter xx the converted hogan   night black and impenetrable had set in ere kenneth and his escort clattered over the greasy stones of walthams high street and drew up in front of the crusader inn  the door stood wide and hospitable and a warm shaft of light fell from it and set a glitter upon the wet street avoiding the commonroom the sergeant led kenneth through the innyard and into the hostelry by a side entrance he urged the youth along a dimlylighted passage on a door at the end of this he knocked then lifting the latch he ushered kenneth into a roomy oakpanelled chamber  at the far end a huge fire burnt cheerfully and with his back to it his feet planted wide apart upon the hearth stood a powerfully built man of medium height whose youthful face and uprightness of carriage assorted ill with the grey of his hair pronouncing that greyness premature he seemed all clad in leather for where his jerkin stopped his boots began a cuirass and feathered headpiece lay in a corner whilst on the table kenneth espied a broadbrimmed hat a huge sword and a brace of pistols  as the boys eyes came back to the burly figure on the hearth he was puzzled by a familiar intangible something in the fellows face  he was racking his mind to recall where last he had seen it when with slightly elevated eyebrows and a look of recognition in his somewhat prominent blue eyes  soul of my body exclaimed the man in surprise master stewart as i live  stuart cried both sergeant and trooper in a gasp starting forward to scan their prisoners face  at that the burly captain broke into a laugh  not the young man charles stuart said he no no your captive is none so precious it is only master kenneth stewart of bailienochy  then it is not even our man grumbled the soldier  but stewart is not the name he gave cried the sergeant jasper blount he told me he was called it seems that after all we have captured a malignant and that i was well advised to bring him to you  the captain made a gesture of disdain in that moment kenneth recognized him he was harry hoganthe man whose life galliard had saved in penrith  bah a worthless capture beddoes he said  i know not that retorted the sergeant he carries papers which he states are from joseph ashburn of castle marleigh to colonel pride colonel prides name is on the package but may not that be a subterfuge why else did he say he was called blount  hogans brows were of a sudden knit  faith beddoes you are right remove his sword and search him  calmly kenneth suffered them to carry out this order inwardly he boiled at the delay and cursed himself for having so needlessly given the name of blount but for that it was likely hogan would have straightway dismissed him he cheered himself with the thought that after all they would not long detain him their search made and finding nothing upon him but ashburns letter surely they would release him  but their search was very thorough they drew off his boots and wellnigh stripped him naked submitting each article of his apparel to a careful examination at length it was over and hogan held ashburns package turning it over in his hands with a thoughtful expression  surely sir you will now allow me to proceed cried kenneth i assure you the matter is of the greatest urgency and unless i am in london by midnight i shall be too late  too late for what asked hogan  ii dont know  oh the irishman laughed unpleasantly colonel pride and he were on anything but the best of terms the colonel knew him for a godless soldier of fortune bound to the parliaments cause by no interest beyond that of gain and himself a zealot colonel pride had with distasteful frequency shown hogan the quality of his feelings towards him that hogan was not afraid of him was because it was not in hogans nature to be afraid of anyone but he realized at least that he had cause to be and at the present moment it occurred to him that it would be passing sweet to find a flaw in the old puritans armour if the package were harmless his having opened it was still a matter that the discharge of his duty would sanction thus he reasoned and he resolved to break the seal and make himself master of the contents of that letter  hogans unpleasant laugh startled kenneth it suggested to him that perhaps after all his delay was by no means at an end that hogan suspected him of somethinghe could not think of what  then in a flash an idea came to him  may i speak to you privately for a moment captain hogan he inquired in such a tone of importanceimperiousness almostthat the irishman was impressed by it he scented disclosure  faith you may if you have aught to tell me and he signed to beddoes and his companion to withdraw  now master hogan kenneth began resolutely as soon as they were alone i ask you to let me go my way unmolested too long already has the stupidity of your followers detained me here unjustly that i reach london by midnight is to me a matter of the gravest moment and you shall let me  soul of my body mr stewart what a spirit you have acquired since last we met  in your place i should leave our last meeting unmentioned master turncoat  the irishmans eyebrows shot up  by the mass young cockerel i mislike your tone  youll have cause to dislike it more if you detain me he was desperate now what would your saintly cropeared friends say if they knew as much of your past history as i do  tis a matter for conjecture said hogan humouring him  how think you would they welcome the story of the roystering rake and debauchee who deserted the army of king charles because they were about to hang him for murder  ah how indeed sighed hogan  what manner of reputation think you that for a captain of the godly army of the commonwealth  a vile one truly murmured hogan with humility  and now mr hogan he wound up loftily you had best return me that package and be rid of me before i sow mischief enough to bring you a crop of hemp  hogan stared at the lads flushed face with a look of whimsical astonishment and for a brief spell there was silence between them slowly then with his eyes still fixed upon kenneths the captain unsheathed a dagger the boy drew back with a sudden cry of alarm hogan vented a horselaugh and ran the blade under the seal of ashburns letter  be not afraid my man of threats he said pleasantly i have no thought of hurting youleastways not yet he paused in the act of breaking the seal lest you should treasure uncomfortable delusions dear master stewart let me remind you that i am an irishmannot a fool do you conceive my fame to be so narrow a thing that when i left the beggarly army of king charles for that of the commonwealth i did not realize how at any moment i might come face to face with someone who had heard of my old exploits and would denounce me you do not find me masquerading under an assumed name i am here sir as harry hogan a sometime dissolute follower of the egyptian pharaoh charles stuart an erstwhile besotted blinded soldier in the army of the amalekite a whilom erring malignant but converted by a crowning mercy into a zealous faithful servant of israel there were vouchsafings and upliftings and the devil knows what else when this stray lamb was gathered to the fold  he uttered the words with a nasal intonation and a whimsical look at kenneth  now mr stewart tell them what you will and they will tell you yet more in return to show you how signally the light of grace hath been shed over me  he laughed again and broke the seal kenneth crestfallen and abashed watched him without attempting further interference of what avail  you had been better advised young sir had you been less hasty and anxious it is a fatal fault of youths and one of which nothing but timeif indeed you livewill cure you your anxiety touching this package determines me to open it  kenneth sneered at the mans conclusions and shrugging his shoulders turned slightly aside  perchance master wiseacres when you have read it you will appreciate how egotism may also lead men into fatal errors haply too you will be able to afford colonel pride some satisfactory reason for tampering with his correspondence  but hogan heard him not he had unfolded the letter and at the first words he beheld a frown contracted his brows as he read on the frown deepened and when he had done an oath broke from his lips gods life he cried then again was silent and so stood a moment with bent head at last he raised his eyes and let them rest long and searchingly upon kenneth who now observed him in alarm  whatwhat is it the lad asked with hesitancy  but hogan never answered he strode past him to the door and flung it wide  beddoes he called a step sounded in the passage and the sergeant appeared have you a trooper there  there is peter who rode with me  let him look to this fellow tell him to set him under lock and bolt here in the inn until i shall want him and tell him that he shall answer for him with his neck  kenneth drew back in alarm  sircaptain hoganwill you explain  marry you shall have explanations to spare before morning else im a fool but have no fear for we intend you no hurt he added more softly take him away beddoes then return to me here  when beddoes came back from consigning kenneth into the hands of his trooper he found hogan seated in the leathern armchair with ashburns letter spread before him on the table  i was right in my suspicions eh ventured beddoes complacently  you were more than right beddoes you were heaveninspired it is no state matter that you have chanced upon but one that touches a man in whom i am interested very nearly  the sergeants eyes were full of questions but hogan enlightened him no further  you will ride back to your post at once beddoes he commanded should lord oriel fall into your hands as we hope you will send him to me but you will continue to patrol the road and demand the business of all comers i wish one crispin galliard who should pass this way ere long detained and brought to me he is a tall lank man  i know him sir beddoes interrupted the tavern knight they called him in the malignant armya rakehelly dissolute brawler i saw him in worcester when he was taken after the fight  hogan frowned the righteous beddoes knew overmuch that is the man he answered calmly go now and see that he does not ride past you i have great and urgent need of him  beddoes eyes were opened in surprise  he is possessed of valuable information hogan explained away with you man  when alone harry hogan turned his armchair sideways towards the fire then filling himself a pipefor in his foreign campaigning he had acquired the habit of tobaccosmokinghe stretched his sinewy legs across a second chair and composed himself for meditation an hour went by the host looked in to see if the captain required anything another hour sped on and the captain dozed  he awoke with a start the fire had burned low and the hands of the huge clock in the corner pointed to midnight from the passage came to him the sound of steps and angry voices  before hogan could rise the door was flung wide and a tall gaunt man was hustled across the threshold by two soldiers his head was bare and his hair wet and dishevelled his doublet was torn and his shoulder bleeding whilst his empty scabbard hung like a lambent tail behind him  we have brought him captain one of the men announced  aye you cropeared psalmwhining cuckolds youve brought me dn you growled sir crispin whose eyes rolled fiercely  as his angry glance lighted upon hogans impressive face he abruptly stemmed the flow of invective that rushed to his lips  the irishman rose and looked past him at the troopers leave us he commanded shortly  he remained standing by the hearth until the footsteps of his men had died away then he crossed the chamber passed crispin without a word and quietly locked the door that done he turned a friendly smile on his tanned faceand holding out his hand  at last cris it is mine to thank you and to repay you in some measure for the service you rendered me that night at penrith     chapter xxi the message kenneth bore   in bewilderment crispin took the outstretched hand of his old fellowroysterer  oddslife he growled if to have me waylaid dragged from my horse and wounded by those sons of dogs your myrmidons be your manner of expressing gratitude id as lief you had let me go unthanked  and yet cris i dare swear youll thank me before another hour is sped ough man how cold you are theres a bottle of strong waters yonder  then without completing his sentence hogan had seized the black jack and poured half a glass of its contents which he handed crispin  drink man he said briefly and crispin nothing loath obeyed him  next hogan drew the torn and sodden doublet from his guests back pushed a chair over to the table and bade him sit again nothing loath crispin did as he was bidden he was stiff from long riding and so with a sigh of satisfaction he settled himself down and stretched out his long legs  hogan slowly took the seat opposite to him and coughed he was at a loss how to open the parlous subject how to communicate to crispin the amazing news upon which he had stumbled  slife hogan laughed crispin dreamily i little thought it was to you those cropears carried me with such violence i little thought indeed ever to see you again but you have prospered you knave since that night you left penrith  and he turned his head the better to survey the irishman  aye i have prospered hogan assented my life is a sort of parable of the fatted son and the prodigal calf they tell me there is greater joy in heaven over the repentance of a sinner thanthanplague on it how does it go  than over the downfall of a saint suggested crispin  ill swear thats not the text but any of my troopers could quote it you every man of them is an incarnate church militant he paused and crispin laughed softly then abruptly and so you were riding to london said he  how know you that  faith i know moremuch more i can even tell you to what house you rode and on what errand you were for the sign of the anchor in thames street for news of your son whom joseph ashburn hath told you lives  crispin sat bolt upright a look of mingled wonder and suspicion on his face  you are well informed you gentlemen of the parliament he said  on the matter of your errand the irishman returned quietly i am much better informed than are you shall i tell you who lives at the sign of the anchornot whom you have been told lives there but who really does occupy the house hogan paused a second as though awaiting some reply then softly he answered his own question colonel pride and he sat back to await results  there were none for the moment the name awoke no recollections conveyed no meaning to crispin  who may colonel pride be he asked after a pause  hogan was visibly disappointed  a certain powerful and vindictive member of the rump whose son you killed at worcester  this time the shaft went home galliard sprang out of the chair his brows darkening and his cheeks pale beyond their wont  zounds hogan do you mean that joseph ashburn was betraying me into this mans hands  you have said it  but  crispin stopped short the pallor of his face increased it became ashen and his eyes glittered as though a fever consumed him he sank back into his chair and setting both hands upon the table before him he looked straight at hogan  but my son hogan my son he pleaded and his voice was broken as no man had heard it yet oh god in heaven he cried in a sudden frenzy what hells work is this  behind his blue lips his teeth were chattering now his hands shook as he held them still clenched before him then in a dull concentrated voice  hogan he vowed ill kill him for it fool blind pitiful fool that i am  thenhis face distorted by passionhe broke into a torrent of imprecations that was at length stemmed by hogan  wait cris said he laying his hand upon the others arm it is not all false joseph ashburn sought it is true to betray you into the hands of colonel pride sending you to the sign of the anchor with the assurance that there you should have news of your son that was false yet not all false your son does live and at the sign of the anchor it is likely you would have had the news of him you sought but that news would have come when too late to have been of value to you  crispin tried to speak but failed then mastering himself by an effort and in a voice that was oddly shaken  hogan he cried you are torturing me what is the sum of your knowledge  at last the irishman produced ashburns letter to colonel pride  my men said he are patrolling the roads in wait for a malignant that has incurred the parliaments displeasure we have news that he is making for harwich where a vessel lies waiting to carry him to france and we expect that he will ride this way three hours ago a young man unable clearly to account for himself rode into our net and was brought to me he was the bearer of a letter to colonel pride from joseph ashburn he had given my sergeant a wrong name and betrayed such anxiety to be gone that i deemed his errand a suspicious one and broke the seal of that letter you may thank god galliard every night of your life that i did so  was this youth kenneth stewart asked crispin  you have guessed it  dn the lad he began furiously then repressing himself he sighed and in an altered tone no no said he i have grievously wronged him have wrecked his lifeor at least he thinks so now i can hardly blame him for seeking to be quits with me  the lad returned hogan must be himself a dupe he can have had no suspicion of the message he carried let me read it to you it will make all clear  hogan drew a taper nearer and spreading the paper upon the table he smoothed it out and read  honoured sir  the bearer of the present should if he rides well outstrip another messenger i have dispatched to you upon a fools errand with a letter addressed to one mr lane at the sign of the anchor the bearer of that is none other than the notorious malignant sir crispin galliard by whose hand your son was slain under your very eyes at worcester whose capture i know that you warmly desire and with whom i doubt not you will know how to deal to us he has been a source of no little molestation his liberty in fact is a perpetual menace to our lives for some eighteen years this galliard has believed dead a son that my cousin bore him news of this son whom i have just informed him livesas indeed he doesis the bait wherewith i have lured him to your address forewarned by the present i make no doubt you will prepare to receive him fittingly but ere that justice he escaped at worcester be meted out to him at tyburn or on tower hill i would have you give him that news touching his son which i am sending him to you to receive inform him sir that his son jocelyn marleigh  hogan paused and shot a furtive glance at galliard the knight was leaning forward now his eyes strained his forehead beaded with perspiration and his breathing heavy  read on he begged hoarsely  his son jocelyn marleigh is the bearer of this letter the man whom he has injured and who detests him the youth with whom he has by a curious chance been in much close association and whom he has known as kenneth stewart  god gasped crispin then with sudden vigour oh tis a lie he cried a fresh invention of that lying brain to torture me  hogan held up his hand  there is a little more he said and continued  should he doubt this bid him look closely into the lads face and ask him after he has scrutinized it what image it evokes should he still doubt thereafter thinking the likeness to which he has been singularly blind to be no more than accidental bid them strip the lads right foot it bears a mark that i think should convince him for the rest honoured sir i beg you to keep all information touching his parentage from the boy himself wherein i have weighty ends to serve within a few days of your receipt of this letter i look to have the honour of waiting upon you in the meanwhile honoured sir believe that while i am i am your obedient servant  joseph ashburn   across the narrow table the two mens glances methogans full of concern and pity crispins charged with amazement and horror a little while they sat thus then crispin rose slowly to his feet and with steps uncertain as a drunkards he crossed to the window he pushed it open and let the icy wind upon his face and head unconscious of its sting moments passed during which the knight went over the last few months of his turbulent life since his first meeting at perth with kenneth stewart he recalled how strangely and unaccountably he had been drawn to the boy when first he beheld him in the castle yard and how owing to a feeling for which he could not account since the lads character had little that might commend him to such a man as crispin he had contrived that kenneth should serve in his company  he recalled how at firstaye and often afterwards evenhe had sought to win the boys affection despite the fact that there was naught in the boy that he truly admired and much that he despised was it possible that these his feelings were dictated by nature to his unconscious mind it must indeed be so and the written words of joseph ashburn to colonel pride were true kenneth was indeed his son the conviction was upon him he conjured up the lads face and a cry of discovery escaped him how blind he had been not to have seen before the likeness of alicehis poor butchered girlwife of eighteen years ago how dull never before to have realized that that likeness it was had drawn him to the boy  he was calm by now and in his calm he sought to analyse his thoughts and he was shocked to find that they were not joyous he yearnedas he had yearned that night in worcesterfor the lads affection and yet for all his yearning he realized that with the conviction that kenneth was his offspring came a dull sense of disappointment he was not such a son as the rakehelly knight would have had him swiftly he put the thought from him the craven hands that had reared the lad had warped his nature he would guide it henceforth he would straighten it out into a nobler shape  then he smiled bitterly to himself what manner of man was he to train a youth to loftiness and honourhe a debauched ruler with a nickname for which had he any sense of shame he would have blushed again he remembered the lads disposition towards himself but these he thought he hoped he knew that he would now be able to overcome  he closed the window and turned to face his companion he was himself again and calm for all that his face was haggard beyond its wont  hogan where is the boy  i have detained him in the inn will you see him now  at once hogan i am convinced  the irishman crossed the chamber and opening the door he called an order to the trooper waiting in the passage  some minutes they waited standing with no word uttered between them at last steps sounded in the corridor and a moment later kenneth was rudely thrust into the room hogan signed to the trooper who closed the door and withdrew  as kenneth entered crispin advanced a step and paused his eyes devouring the lad and receiving in exchange a glance that was full of malevolence  i might have known sir that you were not far away he exclaimed bitterly forgetting for the moment how he had left crispin behind him on the previous night i might have guessed that my detention was your work  why so asked crispin quietly his eyes ever scanning the lads face with a pathetic look  because it is your way i know not why to work my ruin in all things not satisfied with involving me in that business at castle marleigh you must needs cross my path again when i am about to make amends and so blight my last chance my god sir am i never to be rid of you what harm have i done you  a spasm of pain like a ripple over water crossed the knights swart face  if you but consider kenneth he said speaking very quietly you must see the injustice of your words since when has crispin galliard served the parliament that roundhead troopers should do his bidding as you suggest and touching that business at sheringham you are overhard with me it was a compact you made and but for which you forget that you had been carrion these three weeks  would to heaven that i had been the boy burst out sooner than pay such a price for keeping my life  as for my presence here crispin continued leaving the outburst unheeded it has naught to do with your detention  you lie  hogan caught his breath with a sharp hiss and a dead silence followed that silence struck terror into kenneths heart he encountered crispins eye bent upon him with a look he could not fathom and much would he now have given to recall the two words that had burst from him in the heat of his rage he bethought him of the unscrupulous deadly character attributed to the man to whom he had addressed them and in his cowards fancy he saw already payment demanded already he pictured himself lying cold and stark in the streets of waltham with a swordwound through his middle his face went grey and his lips trembled  then galliard spoke at last and the mildness of his tone filled kenneth with a new dread in his experience of crispins ways he had come to look upon mildness as the mans most dangerous phase  you are mistaken crispin said i spoke the truth it is a habit of minehaply the only gentlemanly habit left me i repeat i have had naught to do with your detention i arrived here half an hour ago as the captain will inform you and i was conducted hither by force having been seized by his men even as you were seized no he added with a sigh it was not my hand that detained you it was the hand of fate then suddenly changing his voice to a more vehement key know you on what errand you rode to london he demanded to betray your father into the hands of his enemies to deliver him up to the hangman  kenneths eyes grew wide his mouth fell open and a frown of perplexity drew his brows together dully uncomprehendingly he met sir crispins sad gaze  my father he gasped at last sdeath sir what is it you mean my father has been dead these ten years i scarce remember him  crispins lips moved but no word did he utter then with a sudden gesture of despair he turned to hogan who stood apart a silent witness  my god hogan he cried how shall i tell him  in answer to the appeal the irishman turned to kenneth  you have been in error sir touching your parentage quoth he bluntly alan stewart of bailienochy was not your father  kenneth looked from one to the other of them  sirs is this a jest he cried reddening then remarking at length the solemnity of their countenances he stopped short crispin came close up to him and placed a hand upon his shoulder the boy shrank visibly beneath the touch and again an expression of pain crossed the poor rufflers face  do you recall kenneth he said slowly almost sorrowfully the story that i told you that night in worcester when we sat waiting for dawn and the hangman  the lad nodded vacantly  do you remember the details do you remember i told you how when i swooned beneath the stroke of joseph ashburns sword the last words i heard were those in which he bade his brother slit the throat of the babe in the cradle you were yourself present yesternight at castle marleigh when joseph ashburn told me gregory had been mercifully inclined that my child had not died that if i gave him his life he would restore him to me you remember  again kenneth nodded a vague numbing fear was creeping round his heart and his blood seemed chilled by it and stagnant with fascinated eyes he watched the knights facedrawn and haggard  it was a trap that joseph ashburn set for me yet he did not altogether lie the child gregory had indeed spared and it seems from what i have learned within the last halfhour that he had entrusted his rearing to alan stewart of bailienochy seeking afterwardsi take itto wed him to his daughter so that should the king come to his own again they should have the protection of a marleigh who had served his king  you mean the lad almost whispered and his accents were unmistakably of horror you mean that i am youroh god ill not believe it he cried out with such sudden loathing and passion that crispin recoiled as though he had been struck a dull flush crept into his cheeks to fade upon the instant and give place to a pallor if possible intenser than before  ill not believe it ill not believe it the boy repeated as if seeking by that reiteration to shut out a conviction by which he was beset ill not believe it he cried again and now his voice had lost its passionate vehemence and was sunk almost to a moan  i found it hard to believe myself was crispins answer and his voice was not free from bitterness but i have a proof here that seems incontestable even had i not the proof of your face to which i have been blind these months blind with the eyes of my body at least the eyes of my soul saw and recognized you when first they fell on you in perth the voice of the blood ordered me then to your side and though i heard its call i understood not what it meant read this letter boythe letter that you were to have carried to colonel pride  with his eyes still fixed in a gaze of stupefaction upon galliards face kenneth took the paper then slowly involuntarily almost it seemed he dropped his glance to it and read he was long in reading as though the writing presented difficulties and his two companions watched him the while and waited at last he turned the paper over and examined seal and superscription as if suspicious that he held a forgery  but in some subtle mysterious waythat voice of the blood perchance to which crispin had alludedhe felt conviction stealing down upon his soul mechanically he moved across to the table and sat down without a word and still holding the crumpled letter in his clenched hand he set his elbows on the table and pressing his temples to his palms he sat there dumb within him a very volcano raged and its fires were fed with loathingloathing for this man whom he had ever hated yet never as he hated him now knowing him to be his father it seemed as if to all the wrongs which crispin had done him during the months of their acquaintanceship he had now added a fresh and culminating wrong by discovering this parentage  he sat and thought and his soul grew sick he probed for some flaw sought for some mistake that might have been made and yet the more he thought the more he dwelt upon his youth in scotland the more convinced was he that crispin had told him the truth preeminent argument of conviction to him was the desire of the ashburns that he should marry cynthia oft he had marvelled that they wealthy and even powerful selfish and ambitious should have selected him the scion of an obscure and impoverished scottish house as a bridegroom for their daughter the news now before him made their motives clear indeed no other motive could exist no other explanation could there be he was the heir of castle marleigh and the usurpers sought to provide against the day when another revolution might oust them and restore the rightful owners  some elation his shallow nature felt at realizing this but that elation was shortlived and dashed by the thought that this ruler this debauchee this drunken swearing roaring tavern knight was his father dashed by the knowledge that meanwhile the parliament was master and that whilst matters stood so the ashburns could defycould even destroy him did they learn how much he knew dashed by the memory that cynthia whom in his selfish wayout of his love for himselfhe loved was lost to him for all time  and here swinging in a circle his thoughts reverted to the cause of thiscrispin galliard the man who had betrayed him into yesternights foul business and destroyed his every chance of happiness the man whom he hated and whom had he possessed the courage as he was possessed by the desire he had risen up and slain the man that now announced himself his father  and thinking thus he sat on in silent resentful vexation he started to feel a hand upon his shoulder and to hear the voice of galliard evidently addressing him yet using a name that was new to him  jocelyn my boy the voice trembled you have thought and you have realizedis it not so i too thought and thought brought me conviction that what that paper tells is true  vaguely then the boy remembered that jocelyn was the name the letter gave him he rose abruptly and brushed the caressing hand from his shoulder his voice was hardpossibly the knowledge that he had gained told him that he had nothing to fear from this man and in that assurance his craven soul grew brave and bold and arrogant  i have realized naught beyond the fact that i owe you nothing but unhappiness and ruin by a trick by a low fraud you enlisted me into a service that has proved my undoing once a cheat always a cheat what credit in the face of that can i give this paper he cried talking wildly to me it is incredible nor do i wish to credit it for though it were true what then what then he repeated raising his voice into accents of defiance  grief and amazement were blended in galliards glance and also maybe some reproach  hogan standing squarely upon the hearth was beset by the desire to kick master kenneth or master jocelyn into the street his lip curled into a sneer of ineffable contempt for his shrewd eyes read to the bottom of the lads mean soul and saw there clearly writ the confidence that emboldened him to voice that insult to the man he must know for his father standing there he compared the two marvelling deeply how they came to be father and son a likeness he saw now between them yet a likeness that seemed but to mark the difference the one harsh resolute and manly for all his reckless living and his misfortunes the other mild effeminate hypocritical and shifty he read it not on their countenances alone but in every line of their figures as they stood and in his heart he cursed himself for having been the instrument to disclose the relationship in which they stood  the youths insolent question was followed by a spell of silence crispin could not believe that he had heard aright at last he stretched out his hands in a gesture of supplicationhe who throughout his thirtyeight years of life and despite the misfortunes that had been his had never yet stooped to plead from any man  jocelyn he cried and the pain in his voice must have melted a heart of steel you are hard have you forgotten the story of my miserable life the story that i told you in worcester can you not understand how suffering may destroy all that is lofty in a man how the forgetfulness of the winecup may come to be his only consolation the hope of vengeance his only motive for living on withholding him from selfdestruction can you not picture such a life and can you not pity and forgive much of the wreck that it may make of a man once virtuous and honourable  pleadingly he looked into the lads face it remained cold and unmoved  i understand he continued brokenly that i am not such a man as any lad might welcome for a father but you who know what my life has been jocelyn you can surely find it in your heart to pity i had naught that was good or wholesome to live for jocelyn naught to curb the evil moods that sent me along evil ways to seek forgetfulness and reparation  but from tonight jocelyn my life in you must find a new interest a new motive i will abandon my old ways for your sake jocelyn i will seek again to become what i was and you shall have no cause to blush for your father  still the lad stood silent  jocelyn my god do i talk in vain cried the wretched man have you no heart no pity boy  at last the youth spoke he was not moved the agony of this strong man the broken pleading of one whom he had ever known arrogant and strong had no power to touch his mean selfish mind consumed as it was by the contemplation of his undoingmagnified a hundredfoldwhich this man had wrought  you have ruined my life was all he said  i will rebuild it jocelyn cried galliard eagerly i have friends in francefriends high in power who lack neither the means nor the will to aid me you are a soldier jocelyn  as much a soldier as im a saint sneered hogan to himself  together we will find service in the armies of louis crispin pursued i promise it service wherein you shall gain honour and renown there we will abide until this england shakes herself out of her rebellious nightmare then when the king shall come to his own castle marleigh will be ours again trust in me jocelyn again his arms went out appealingly jocelyn my son  but the boy made no move to take the outstretched hands gave no sign of relenting his mind nurtured its resentmentcherished it indeed  and cynthia he asked coldly  crispins hands fell to his sides they grew clenched and his eyes lighted of a sudden  forgive me jocelyn i had forgotten i understand you now yes i dealt sorely with you there and you are right to be resentful what after all am i to you what can i be to you compared with her whose image fills your soul what is aught in the world to a man compared with the woman on whom his heart is set do i not know it have i not suffered for it  but mark me jocelynand he straightened himself suddenlyeven in this that which i have done i will undo as i have robbed you of your mistress so will i win her back for you i swear it and when that is done when thus every harm i have caused you is repaired then jocelyn perhaps you will come to look with less repugnance upon your father and to feel less resentment towards him  you promise much sir quoth the boy with an illrepressed sneer how will you accomplish it  hogan grunted audibly crispin drew himself up erect lithe and supplea figure to inspire confidence in the most despairing he placed a hand nervous and strong as steel upon the boys shoulder and the clutch of his fingers made jocelyn wince  low though your father be fallen said he sternly he has never yet broken his word i have pledged you mine and tomorrow i shall set out to perform what i have promised i shall see you ere i start you will sleep here will you not  jocelyn shrugged his shoulders  it signifies little where i lie  crispin smiled sadly and sighed  you have no faith in me yet but i shall earn it orand his voice fell suddenlyor rid you of a loathsome parent hogan can you find him quarters  hogan replied that there was the room he had already been confined in and that he could lie in it and deeming that there was nothing to be gained by waiting he thereupon led the youth from the room and down the passage at the foot of the stairs the irishman paused in the act of descending and raised the taper aloft so that its light might fall full upon the face of his companion  were i your father said he grimly i would kick you from one end of waltham to the other by way of teaching you filial piety and were you not his son i would this night read you a lesson youd never live to practise i would set you to sleep a last long sleep in the kennels of waltham streets but since you aremarvellous though it seemhis offspring and since i love him and may not therefore hurt you i must rest content with telling you that you are the vilest thing that breathes you despise him for a roysterer for a man of loose ways let me who have seen something of men and who read you tonight to the very dregs of your contemptible soul tell you that compared with you he is a very god come you whitelivered cur he ended abruptly i will light you to your chamber  when presently hogan returned to crispin he found the tavern knightthat man of iron in whom none had ever seen a trace of fear or weakness seated with his arms before him on the table and his face buried in them sobbing like a poor weak woman     chapter xxii sir crispins undertaking   through the long october night crispin and hogan sat on and neither sought his bed crispins quick wits his burst of grief once overhad been swift to fasten on a plan to accomplish that which he had undertaken  one difficulty confronted him and until he had mentioned it to hogan seemed unsurmountable he had need of a ship but in this the irishman could assist him he knew of a vessel then at greenwich whose master was in his debt which should suit the purpose money however would be needed but when crispin announced that he was master of some two hundred caroluses hogan with a wave of the hand declared the matter settled less than half that sum would hire the man he knew of that determined crispin unfolded his project to hogan who laughed at the simplicity of it for all that inwardly he cursed the risk sir crispin must run for the sake of one so unworthy  if the maid loves him the thing is as good as done  the maid does not love him leastways i fear not  hogan was not surprised  why then it will be difficult wellnigh impossible and the irishman became grave  but crispin laughed unpleasantly years and misfortune had made him cynical  what is the love of a maid quoth he derisively a caprice a fancy a thing that may be guided overcome or compelled as the occasion shall demand opportunity is loves parent hogan and given that any maid may love any man cynthia shall love my son  but if she prove rebellious if she say nay to your proposals there are such women  how then am i not the stronger in such a case it shall be mine to compel her and as i find her so shall i carry her away it will be none so poor a vengeance on the ashburns after all his brow grew clouded but not what i had dreamed of what i should have taken had he not cheated me to forgo it nowafter all these years of waitingis another sacrifice i make to jocelyn to serve him in this matter i must proceed cautiously cynthia may fret and fume and stamp but willynilly i shall carry her away once she is in france friendless alone i make no doubt that she will see the convenience of loving jocelynleastways of wedding him and thus shall i have more than repaired the injuries i have done him  the irishmans broad face was very grave his reckless merry eye fixed galliard with a look of sorrow and this greyhaired sinning soldier of fortune who had never known a conscience muttered softly  it is not a nice thing you contemplate cris  despite himself galliard winced and his glance fell before hogans for a moment he saw the business in its true light and he wavered in his purpose then with a short bark of laughter  gadso you are sentimental harry said he to add more gravely there is my son and in this lies the only way to his heart  hogan stretched a hand across the table and set it upon crispins arm  is he worth such a stain upon your honour crispin  there was a pause  is it not late in the day hogan for you and me to prate of honour asked crispin bitterly yet with averted gaze god knows my honour is as like honour as a beggars rags are like unto a cloak of ermine what signifies another splash another rent in that which is tattered beyond all semblance of its original condition  i asked you the irishman persisted whether your son was worth the sacrifice that the vile deed you contemplate entails  crispin shook his arm from the others grip and rose abruptly he crossed to the window and drew back the curtain  day is breaking said he gruffly then turning and facing hogan across the room i have pledged my word to jocelyn he said the way i have chosen is the only one and i shall follow it but if your conscience cries out against it hogan i give you back your promise of assistance and i shall shift alone i have done so all my life  hogan shrugged his massive shoulders and reached out for the bottle of strong waters  if you are resolved there is an end to it my conscience shall not trouble me and upon what aid i have promised and what more i can give you may depend i drink to the success of your undertaking  thereafter they discussed the matter of the vessel that crispin would require and it was arranged between them that hogan should send a message to the skipper bidding him come to harwich and there await and place himself at the command of sir crispin galliard for fifty pounds hogan thought that he would undertake to land sir crispin in france the messenger might be dispatched forthwith and the lady jane should be at harwich two days later  by the time they had determined upon this the inmates of the hostelry were astir and from the innyard came to them the noise of bustle and preparation for the day  presently they left the chamber where they had sat so long and at the yard pump the tavern knight performed a rude morning toilet thereafter on a simple fare of herrings and brown ale they broke their fast and ere that meal was done kenneth pale and worn with dark circles round his eyes entered the common room and sat moodily apart but when later hogan went to see to the dispatching of his messenger crispin rose and approached the youth  kenneth watched him furtively without pausing in his meal he had spent a very miserable night pondering over the future which looked gloomy enough and debating whetherforgetting and ignoring what had passedhe should return to the genteel poverty of his scottish home or accept the proffered service of this man who announced himselfand whom he now believedto be his father he had thought but he was far from having chosen between scotland and france when crispin now greeted him not without constraint  jocelyn he said speaking slowly almost humbly in an hours time i shall set out to return to marleigh to fulfil my last nights promise to you how i shall accomplish it i scarce know as yet but accomplish it i shall i have arranged to have a vessel awaiting me and within three daysor four at the mosti look to cross to france bearing your bride with me  he paused for some reply but none came the boy sat on with an impassive face his eyes glued to the table but his mind busy enough upon that which his father was pouring into his ear presently crispin continued  you cannot refuse to do as i suggest jocelyn i shall make you the fullest amends for the harm that i have done you if you but obey my directions you must quit this place as soon as possible and proceed on your way to london there you must find a boat to carry you to france and you will await me at the auberge du soleil at calais you are agreed jocelyn  there was a slight pause and jocelyn took his resolution yet there was still a sullen look in the eyes he lifted to his fathers face  i have little choice sir he made answer and so i must agree if you accomplish what you promise i own that you will have made amends and i shall crave your pardon for my yesternights want of faith i shall await you at calais  crispin sighed and for a second his face hardened it was not the answer to which he held himself entitled and for a moment it rose to the lips of this man of fierce and sudden moods to draw back and let the son whom at the moment he began to detest go his own way which assuredly would lead him to perdition but a seconds thought sufficed to quell that mood of his  i shall not fail you he said coldly have you money for the journey  the boy flushed as he remembered that little was left of what joseph ashburn had given him crispin saw the flush and reading aright its meaning he drew from his pocket a purse that he had been fingering and placed it quietly upon the table there are fifty caroluses in that bag that should suffice to carry you to france fare you well until we meet at calais  and without giving the boy time to utter thanks that might be unwilling he quickly left the room  within the hour he was in the saddle and his horses head was turned northwards once more  he rode through newport some three hours later without drawing rein by the door of the raven inn stood a travelling carriage upon which he did not so much as bestow a look  by the merest thread hangs at times the whole of a mans future life the destinies even of men as yet unborn so much may depend indeed upon a glance that had not crispin kept his eyes that morning upon the grey road before him had he chanced to look sideways as he passed the raven inn at newport and seen the ashburn arms displayed upon the panels of that coach he would of a certainty have paused and had he done so his whole destiny would assuredly have shaped a different course from that which he was unconsciously steering     chapter xxiii gregorys attrition   josephs journey to london was occasioned by his very natural anxiety to assure himself that crispin was caught in the toils of the net he had so cunningly baited for him and that at castle marleigh he would trouble them no more to this end he quitted sheringham on the day after crispins departure  not a little perplexed was cynthia at the topsyturvydom in which that morning she had found her fathers house kenneth was gone he had left in the dead of night and seemingly in haste and suddenness since on the previous evening there had been no talk of his departing her father was abed with a wound that made him feverish their grooms were all sick and wandered in a dazed and witless fashion about the castle their faces deadly pale and their eyes lustreless in the hall she had found a chaotic disorder upon descending and one of the panels of the wainscot she saw was freshly cracked  slowly the idea forced itself upon her mind that there had been brawling the night before yet was she far from surmising the motives that could have led to it the conclusion she came to in the end was that the men had drunk deep that in their cups they had waxed quarrelsome and that swords had been drawn  of joseph then she sought enlightenment and joseph lied right handsomely like the readywitted knave he was a wondrously plausible story had he for her ear a story that played cunningly upon her knowledge of the compact that existed between kenneth and sir crispin  you may not know said hefull well aware that she did knowthat when galliard saved kenneths life at worcester he exacted from the lad the promise that in return kenneth should aid him in some vengeful business he had on hand  cynthia nodded that she understood or that she knew and glibly joseph pursued  last night when on the point of departing crispin who had drunk overfreely as is his custom reminded kenneth of his plighted word and demanded of the boy that he should upon the instant go forth with him kenneth replied that the hour was overlate to be setting out upon a journey and he requested galliard to wait until today when he would be ready to fulfil what he had promised but crispin retorted that kenneth was bound by his oath to go with him when he should require it and again he bade the boy make ready at once words ensued between them the boy insisting upon waiting until today and crispin insisting upon his getting his boots and cloak and coming with him there and then more heated grew the argument till in the end galliard being put out of temper snatched at his sword and would assuredly have spitted the boy had not your father interposed thereby getting himself wounded thereafter in his drunken lust sir crispin went the length of wantonly cracking that panel with his sword by way of showing kenneth what he had to expect unless he obeyed him at that i intervened and using my influence i prevailed upon kenneth to go with galliard as he demanded to this for all his reluctance kenneth ended by consenting and so they are gone  by that most glib and specious explanation cynthia was convinced true she added a question touching the amazing condition of the grooms in reply to which joseph afforded her a part of the truth  sir crispin sent them some wine and they drank to his departure so heartily that they are not rightly sober yet  satisfied with this explanation cynthia repaired to her father  now gregory had not agreed with joseph what narrative they were to offer cynthia for it had never crossed his dull mind that the disorder of the hall and the absence of kenneth might cause her astonishment and so when she touched upon the matter of his wound like the blundering fool he was he must needs let his tongue wag upon a tale which if no less imaginative than josephs was vastly its inferior in plausibility and had yet the quality of differing from it totally in substance  plague on that dog your lover cynthia he growled from the mountain of pillows that propped him if he should come to wed my daughter after pinning me to the wainscot of my own hall may i be for ever damned  how quoth she do you say that kenneth did it  aye did he he ran at me ere i could draw like the coward he is sink him and had me through the shoulder in the twinkling of an eye  here was something beyond her understanding what were they concealing from her she set her wits to the discovery and plied her father with another question  how came you to quarrel  how twastwas concerning you child replied gregory at random and unable to think of a likelier motive  how concerning me  leave me cynthia he groaned in despair go child i am grievously wounded i have the fever girl go let me sleep  but tell me father what passed  unnatural child whined gregory feebly will you plague a sick man with questions would you keep him from the sleep that may mean recovery to him  father dear she murmured softly if i thought it was as you say i would leave you but you know that you are but attempting to conceal something from me something that i should know that i must know bethink you that it is of my lover that you have spoken  by a stupendous effort gregory shaped a story that to him seemed likely  well then since know you must he answered this is what befell we had all drunk overdeep to our shame do i confess itand growing tenderhearted for you and bethinking me of your professed distaste to kenneths suit i told him that for all the results that were likely to attend his sojourn at castle marleigh he might as well bear crispin company in his departure he flared up at that and demanded of me that i should read him my riddle faith i did by telling him that we were like to have snow on midsummers day ere he became your husband that speech of mine so angered him being as he was all addled with wine and ripe for any madness that he sprang up and drew on me there and then the others sought to get between us but he was overquick and before i could do more than rise from the table his sword was through my shoulder and into the wainscot at my back after that it was clear he could not remain here and i demanded that he should leave upon the instant himself he was nothing loath for he realized his folly and he misliked the gleam of josephs eyewhich can be wondrous wicked upon occasion indeed but for my intercession joseph had laid him stark  that both her uncle and her father had lied to herthe one cunningly the other stupidlyshe had never a doubt and vaguely uneasy was cynthia to learn the truth later that day the castle was busy with the bustle of josephs departure and this again was a matter that puzzled her  whither do you journey uncle she asked of him as he was in the act of stepping out to enter the waiting carriage  to london sweet cousin was his brisk reply i am it seems becoming a very vagrant in my old age have you commands for me  what is it you look to do in london  there child let that be for the present i will tell you perhaps when i return the door stephen  she watched his departure with uneasy eyes and uneasy heart a fear pervaded her that in all that had befallen in all that was befalling stillwhat ever it might besome evil was at work and an evil that had crispin for its scope she had neither reason nor evidence from which to draw this inference it was no more than the instinct whose voice cries out to us at times a presage of ill and oftentimes compels our attention in a degree far higher than any evidence could command  the fear that was in her urged her to seek what information she could on every hand but without success from none could she cull the merest scrap of evidence to assist her  but on the morrow she had information as prodigal as it was unlookedfor and from the unlikeliest of sourcesher father himself chafing at his inaction and lured into indiscretions by the subsiding of the pain of his wound gregory quitted his bed and came below that night to sup with his daughter as his wont had been for years he drank freely that done alive to the voice of his conscience and seeking to drown its loudtongued cry he drank more freely still so that in the end his henchman stephen was forced to carry him to bed  this stephen had grown grey in the service of the ashburns and amongst much valuable knowledge that he had amassed was a skill in dealing with wounds and a wide understanding of the ways to go about healing them this knowledge made him realize how unwise at such a season was gregorys debauch and sorrowfully did he wag his head over his masters condition of stupor  stephen had grave fears concerning him and these fears were realized when upon the morrow gregory awoke on fire with the fever they summoned a leech from sheringham and this cunning knave with a view to adding importance to the cure he was come to effect and which in reality presented no alarming difficulty shook his head with ominous gravity and whilst promising to do all that his skill permitted he spoke of a clergyman to help gregory make his peace with god for the leech had no cause to suspect that the whole of the sacred college might have found the task beyond its powers  a wild fear took gregory in its grip how could he die with such a load as that which he now carried upon his soul and the leech seeing how the matter preyed upon his patients mind made shiftbut too lateto tranquillize him with assurances that he was not really like to die and that he had but mentioned a parson so that gregory in any case should be prepared  the storm once raised however was not so easily to be allayed and the conviction remained with gregory that his sands were wellnigh run and that the end could be but a matter of days in coming  realizing as he did how richly he had earned damnation a frantic terror was upon him and all that day he tossed and turned now blaspheming now praying now weeping his life had been indeed one protracted course of wrongdoing and many had suffered by gregorys evil waysmany a man and many a woman but as the stars pale and fade when the sun mounts the sky so too were the lesser wrongs that marked his earthly pilgrimage of sin rendered pale or blotted into insignificance by the greater wrong he had done ronald marleigha wrong which was not ended yet but whose completion joseph was even then working to effect if only he could save crispin even now in the eleventh hour if by some means he could warn him not to repair to the sign of the anchor in thames street his disordered mind took no account of the fact that in the time that was sped since galliards departure the knight should already have reached london  and so it came about that consumed at once by the desire to make confession to whomsoever it might be and the wish to attempt yet to avert the crowning evil of whose planning he was partly guilty inasmuch as he had tacitly consented to josephs schemes gregory called for his daughter she came readily enough hoping for exactly that which was about to take place yet fearing sorely that her hopes would suffer frustration and that she would learn nothing from her father  cynthia he cried in mingled dread and sorrow cynthia my child i am about to die  she knew both from stephen and from the leech that this was far from being his condition nevertheless her filial piety was at that moment a touching sight she smoothed his pillows with a gentle grace that was in itself a soothing caress even as her soft sympathetic voice was a caress she took his hand and spoke to him endearingly seeking to relieve the sombre mood whose prey he was become assuring him that the leech had told her his danger was none so imminent and that with quiet and a little care he would be up and about again ere many days were sped but gregory rejected hopelessly all efforts at consolation  i am on my deathbed cynthia he insisted and when i am gone i know not whom there may be to cheer and comfort your lot in life your lover is away on an errand of josephs and it may well betide that he will never again cross the threshold of castle marleigh unnatural though i may seem sweetheart my dying wish is that this may be so  she looked up in some surprise  father if that be all that grieves you i can reassure you i do not love kenneth  you apprehend me amiss said he tartly do you recall the story of sir crispin galliards life that you had from kenneth on the night of josephs return his voice shook as he put the question  why yes i am not like to forget it and nightly do i pray she went on her tongue outrunning discretion and betraying her feelings for galliard that god may punish those murderers who wrecked his existence  hush girl he whispered in a quavering voice you know not what you say  indeed i do and as there is a just god my prayer shall be answered  cynthia he wailed his eyes were wild and the hand that rested in hers trembled violently do you know that it is against your father and your fathers brother that you invoke gods vengeance  she had been kneeling at his bedside but now when he pronounced those words she rose slowly and stood silent for a spell her eyes seeking his with an awful look that he dared not meet at last  oh you rave she protested it is the fever  nay child my mind is clear and what i have said is true  true she echoed no louder than a whisper and her eyes grew round with horror true that you and my uncle are the butchers who slew their cousin this mans wife and sought to murder him as wellleaving him for dead true that you are the thieves who claiming kinship by virtue of that very marriage have usurped his estates and this his castle during all these years whilst he himself went an outcast homeless and destitute is that what you ask me to believe  even so he assented with a feeble sob  her face was palewhite to the very lips and her blue eyes smouldered behind the shelter of her drooping lids she put her hand to her breast then to her brow pushing back the brown hair by a mechanical gesture that was pathetic in the tale of pain it told for support she was leaning now against the wall by the head of his couch in silence she stood so while you might count to twenty then with a sudden vehemence revealing the passion of anger and grief that swayed her  why she cried why in gods name do you tell me this  why his utterance was thick and his eyes that were grown dull as a snakes stared straight before him daring not to meet his daughters glance i tell it you he said because i am a dying man and he hoped that the consideration of that momentous fact might melt her and might by pity win her back to himthat she was lost to him he realized  i tell you because i am a dying man he repeated i tell it you because in such an hour i fain would make confession and repent that god may have mercy upon my soul i tell it you too because the tragedy begun eighteen years ago is not yet played out and it may yet be mine to avert the end we had preparedjoseph and i thus perhaps a merciful god will place it in my power to make some reparation listen child it was against us as you will have guessed that galliard enlisted kenneths services and here on the night of josephs return he called upon the boy to fulfil him what he had sworn the lad had no choice but to obey indeed i forced him to it by attacking him and compelling him to draw which is how i came by this wound  crispin had of a certainty killed joseph but that your uncle bethought him of telling him that his son lived  he saved his life by a lie that was worthy of him said cynthia scornfully  nay child he spoke the truth and when joseph offered to restore the boy to him he had every intention of so doing but in the moment of writing the superscription to the letter crispin was to bear to those that had reared the child joseph bethought him of a foul scheme for galliards final destruction and so he has sent him to london instead to a house in thames street where dwells one colonel pride who bears sir crispin a heavy grudge and into whose hands he will be thus delivered can aught be done cynthia to arrest thisto save sir crispin from josephs snare  as well might you seek to restore the breath to a dead man she answered and her voice was so oddly calm so cold and bare of expression that gregory shuddered to hear it  do not delude yourself she added sir crispin will have reached london long ere this and by now joseph will be well on his way to see that there is no mistake made and that the life you ruined hopelessly years ago is plucked at last from this unfortunate man merciful god am i truly your daughter she cried is my name indeed ashburn and have i been reared upon the estates that by crime you gained possession of estates that by crime you holdfor they are his every stone every stick that goes to make the place belongs to him and now he has gone to his death by your contriving  a moan escaped her and she covered her face with her hands a moment she stood rocking therea fair lissom plant swept by a gale of ineffable emotion then the breath seemed to go all out of her in one great sigh and gregory who dared not look her way heard the swish of her gown followed by a thud as she collapsed and lay swooning on the ground  so disturbed at that was gregorys spirit that forgetting his wound his fever and the death which he had believed impending he leapt from his couch and throwing wide the door bellowed lustily for stephen in frightened haste came his henchman to answer the petulant summons and in obedience to gregorys commands he went off again as quickly in quest of catherinecynthias woman  between them they bore the unconscious girl to her chamber leaving gregory to curse himself for having been lured into a confession that it now seemed to him had been unnecessary since in his newly found vitality he realized that death was none so near a thing as that scoundrelly fool of a leech had led him to believe     chapter xxiv the wooing of cynthia   cynthias swoon was after all but brief upon recovering consciousness her first act was to dismiss her woman she had need to be alonethe need of the animal that is wounded to creep into its lair and hide itself and so alone with her sorrow she sat through that long day  that her fathers condition was grievous she knew to be untrue so that concerning him there was not even that pity that she might have felt had she believedas he would have had her believe that he was dying  as she pondered the monstrous disclosure he had made her heart hardened against him and even as she had asked him whether indeed she was his daughter so now she vowed to herself that she would be his daughter no longer she would leave castle marleigh never again to set eyes upon her father and she hoped that during the little time she must yet remain therea day or two at mostshe might be spared the ordeal of again meeting a parent for whom respect was dead and who inspired her with just that feeling of horror she must have for any man who confessed himself a murderer and a thief  she resolved to repair to london to a sister of her mothers where for her dead mothers sake she would find a haven extended readily  at eventide she came at last from her chamber  she had need of air need of the balm that nature alone can offer in solitude to poor wounded human souls  it was a mild and sunny evening worthy rather of august than of october and aimlessly mistress cynthia wandered towards the cliffs overlooking sheringham hithe there she sate herself in sad dejection upon the grass and gazed wistfully seaward her mind straying now from the sorry theme that had held dominion in it to the memories that very spot evoked  it was there sitting as she sat now her eyes upon the shimmering waste of sea and the gulls circling overhead that she had awakened to the knowledge of her love for crispin and so to him strayed now her thoughts and to the fate her father had sent him to and thus back again to her father and the evil he had wrought it is matter for conjecture whether her loathing for gregory would have been as intense as it was had another than crispin galliard been his victim  her life seemed at an end as she sat that october evening on the cliffs no single interest linked her to existence nothing it seemed was left her to hope for till the end should comeand no doubt it would be long in coming for time moves slowly when we wait  wistful she sat and thought and every thought begat a sigh and then of a suddensurely her ears had tricked her enslaved by her imaginationa crisp metallic voice rang out close behind her  why are we pensive mistress cynthia  there was a catch in her breath as she turned her head her cheeks took fire and for a second were aflame then they went deadly white and it seemed that time and life and the very world had paused in its relentless progress towards eternity for there stood the object of her thoughts and sighs sudden and unexpected as though the earth had cast him up on to her surface  his thin lips were parted in a smile that softened wondrously the harshness of his face and his eyes seemed then to her alight with kindness a moments pause there was during which she sought her voice and when she had found it all that she could falter was  sir how came you here they told me that you rode to london  why so i did but on the road i chanced to halt and having halted i discovered reason why i should return  he had discovered a reason she asked herself breathlessly what might that reason be and finding herself no answer to the question she put it next to him  he drew near to her before replying may i sit with you awhile cynthia  she moved aside to make room for him as though the broad cliff had been a narrow ledge and with the sigh of a weary man finding a restingplace at last he sank down beside her  there was a tenderness in his voice that set her pulses stirring wildly did she guess aright the reason that had caused him to break his journey and return that he had done sono matter what the reasonshe thanked god from her inmost heart as for a miracle that had saved him from the doom awaiting him in london town  am i presumptuous child to think that haply the meditation in which i found you rapt was for one unworthy though he be who went hence but some few days since  the ambiguous question drove every thought from her mind filling it to overflowing with the supreme good of his presence and the frantic hope that she had read aright the reason of it  have i conjectured rightly he asked since she kept silence  mayhap you have she whispered in return and then marvelling at her boldness blushed he glanced sharply at her from narrowing eyes it was not the answer he had looked to hear  as a father might have done he took the slender hand that rested upon the grass beside him and she poor child mistaking the promptings of that action suffered it to lie in his strong grasp with averted head she gazed upon the sea below until a mist of tears rose up to blot it out the breeze seemed full of melody and gladness god was very good to her and sent her in her hour of need this great consolationa consolation indeed that must have served to efface whatever sorrow could have beset her  why then sweet lady is my task that i had feared to find all fraught with difficulty grown easy indeed  and hearing him pause  what task is that sir crispin she asked intent on helping him  he did not reply at once he found it difficult to devise an answer to tell her brutally that he was come to bear her away willing or unwilling on behalf of another was not easy indeed it was impossible and he was glad that inclinations in her which he had little dreamt of put the necessity aside  my task mistress cynthia is to bear you hence to ask you to resign this peaceful life this quiet home in a little corner of the world and to go forth to bear lifes hardships with one who whatever be his shortcomings has the allredeeming virtue of loving you beyond aught else in life  he gazed intently at her as he spoke and her eyes fell before his glance he noted the warm red blood suffusing her cheeks her brow her very neck and he could have laughed aloud for joy at finding so simple that which he had feared would prove so hard some pity too crept unaccountably into his stern heart fathered by the little faith which in his inmost soul he reposed in jocelyn and where had she resisted him he would have grown harsh and violent her acquiescence struck the weapons from his hands and he caught himself wellnigh warning her against accompanying him  it is much to ask he said but love is selfish and love asks much  no no she protested softly it is not much to ask rather is it much to offer  at that he was aghast yet he continued  bethink you mistress cynthia i have ridden back to sheringham to ask you to come with me into france where my son awaits us  he forgot for the moment that she was in ignorance of his relationship to him he looked upon as her lover whilst she gave this mention of his son of whose existence she had already heard from her father little thought at that moment the hour was too full of other things that touched her more nearly  i ask you to abandon the ease and peace of sheringham for a life as a soldiers bride that may be rough and precarious for a while though truth to tell i have some influence at the luxembourg and friends upon whose assistance i can safely count to find your husband honourable employment and set him on the road to more and how guided by so sweet a saint can he but mount to fame and honour  she spoke no word but the hand resting in his entwined his fingers in an answering pressure  dare i then ask so much cried he and as if the ambiguity which had marked his speech were not enough he must needs as he put this question bend in his eagerness towards her until her brown tresses touched his swart cheek was it then strange that the eagerness wherewith he urged anothers suit should have been by her interpreted as her heart would have had it  she set her hands upon his shoulders and meeting his eager gaze with the frank glance of the maid who out of trust is fearless in her surrender  throughout my life i shall thank god that you have dared it she made answer softly  a strange reply he deemed it yet pondering he took her meaning to be that since jocelyn had lacked the courage to woo boldly she was glad that he had sent an ambassador less timid  a pause followed and for a spell they sat silent he thinking of how to frame his next words she happy and content to sit beside him without speech  she marvelled somewhat at the strangeness of his wooing which was like unto no wooing her romancers tales had told her of but then she reflected how unlike he was to other men and therein she saw the explanation  i wish he mused that matters were easier that it might be mine to boldly sue your hand from your father but it may not be even had events not fallen out as they have done it had been difficult as it is it is impossible  again his meaning was obscure and when he spoke of suing for her hand from her father he did not think of adding that he would have sued it for his son  i have no father she replied this very day have i disowned him and observing the inquiry with which his eyes were of a sudden charged would you have me own a thief a murderer my father she demanded with a fierceness of defiant shame  you know then he ejaculated  yes she answered sorrowfully i know all there is to be known i learnt it all this morning all day have i pondered it in my shame to end in the resolve to leave sheringham i had intended going to london to my mothers sister you are very opportunely come she smiled up at him through the tears that were glistening in her eyes you come even as i was despairingnay when already i had despaired  sir crispin was no longer puzzled by the readiness of her acquiescence here was the explanation of it forced by the honesty of her pure soul to abandon the house of a father she knew at last for what he was the refuge crispin now offered her was very welcome she had determined before he came to quit castle marleigh and timely indeed was his offer of the means of escape from a life that was grown impossible a great pity filled his heart she was selling herself he thought accepting the proposal which on his sons behalf he made and from which at any other season he feared she would have shrunk in detestation  that pity was reflected on his countenance now and noting its solemnity and misconstruing it she laughed outright despite herself he did not ask her why she laughed he did not notice it his thoughts were busy already upon another matter  when next he spoke it was to describe to her the hollow of the road where on the night of his departure from the castle he had been flung from his horse she knew the spot she told him and there at dusk upon the following day she would come to him her woman must accompany her and for all that he feared such an addition to the party might retard their flight yet he could not gainsay her resolution her uncle he learnt from her was absent from sheringham he had set out four days ago for london for her father she would leave a letter and in this matter crispin urged her to observe circumspection giving no indication of the direction of her journey  in all he said now that matters were arranged he was calm practical and unloverlike and for all that she would he had been less selfpossessed her faith in him caused her upon reflection even to admire this which she conceived to be restraint yet when at parting he did no more than courteously bend before her and kiss her hand as any simpering gallant might have done she was all but vexed and not to be outdone in coldness she grew frigid but it was lost upon him he had not a lovers discernment quickened by anxious eyes that watch for each flitting change upon his mistresss face  they parted thus and into the heart of mistress cynthia there crept that night a doubt that banished sleep was she wise in entrusting herself so utterly to a man of whom she knew but little and that learnt from rumours which had not been good but scarcely was it because of that that doubts assailed her rather was it because of his cool deliberateness which argued not the great love wherewith she fain would fancy him inspired  for consolation she recalled a line that had it great fires were soon burnt out and she sought to reassure herself that the flame of his love if not allconsuming would at least burn bright and steadfastly until the end of life and so she fell asleep betwixt hope and fear yet no longer with any hesitancy touching the morrows course  in the morning she took her woman into her confidence and scared her with it out of what little sense the creature owned yet to such purpose did she talk that when that evening as crispin waited by the coach he had taken in the hollow of the road he saw approaching him a portly middleaged dame with a valise this was cynthias woman and cynthia herself was not long in following muffled in a long black cloak  he greeted her warmlyaffectionately almost yet with none of the rapture to which she held herself entitled as some little recompense for all that on his behalf she left behind  urbanely he handed her into the coach and after her her woman then seeing that he made shift to close the door  how is this she cried do you not ride with us  he pointed to a saddled horse standing by the roadside and which she had not noticed  it will be better so you will be at more comfort in the carriage without me moreover it will travel the lighter and the swifter and speed will prove our best friend  he closed the door and stepped back with a word of command to the driver the whip cracked and cynthia flung herself back almost in a pet what manner of lover she asked herself was thin and what manner of woman she to let herself be borne away by one who made so little use of the arts and wiles of sweet persuasion to carry her off and yet not so much as sit beside her was worthy only of a man who described such a journey as tedious she marvelled greatly at it yet more she marvelled at herself that she did not abandon this mad undertaking  the coach moved on and the flight from sheringham was begun     chapter xxv cynthias flight   throughout the night they went rumbling on their way at a pace whose sluggishness elicited many an oath from crispin as he rode a few yards in the rear ever watchful of the possibility of pursuit but there was none nor none need he have feared since whilst he rode through the cold night gregory ashburn slept as peacefully as a man may with the fever and an evil conscience and imagined his dutiful daughter safely abed  with the first streaks of steely light came a thin rain to heighten crispins discomfort for of late he had been overmuch in the saddle and strong though he was he was yet flesh and blood and subject to its ills towards ten oclock they passed through denham when they were clear of it cynthia put her head from the window she had slept well and her mood was lighter and happier as crispin rode a yard or so behind he caught sight of her fresh smiling face and it affected him curiously the tenderness that two days ago had been his as he talked to her upon the cliffs was again upon him and the thought that anon she would be linked to him by the ties of relationship was pleasurable she gave him good morrow prettily and he spurring his horse to the carriage door was solicitous to know of her comfort nor did he again fall behind until stafford was reached at noon here at the sign of the suffolk arms he called a halt and they broke their fast on the best the house could give them  cynthia was gay and so indeed was crispin yet she noted in him that coolness which she accounted restraint and gradually her spirits sank again before it  to crispins chagrin there were no horses to be had someone in great haste had ridden through before them and taken what relays the hostelry could give leaving four jaded beasts in the stable it seemed indeed that they must remain there until the morrow and in coming to that conclusion sir crispins temper suffered sorely  why need it put you so about cried cynthia in arch reproach since i am with you  blood and fire madam roared galliard it is precisely for that reason that i am exercised what if your father came upon us here  my father sir is abed with a swordwound and a fever she replied and he remembered then how kenneth had spitted gregory through the shoulder  still he returned he will have discovered your flight and i dare swear we shall have his myrmidons upon our heels should they come up with us we shall hardly find them more gentle than he would be  she paled at that and for a second there was silence then her hand stole forth upon his arm and she looked at him with tightened lips and a defiant air  what indeed if they do are you not with me a king had praised his daring and for his valour had dubbed him knight upon a field of stricken battle yet the honour of it had not brought him the elation those wordsexpressive of her utter faith in him and his prowessbegat in his heart upon the instant the delay ceased to fret him  madam he laughed since you put it so i care not who comes the lord protector himself shall not drag you from me  it was the nearest he had gone to a passionate speech since they had left sheringham and it pleased her yet in uttering it he had stood a full two yards away and in that she had taken no pleasure  bidding her remain and get what rest she might he left her and she following his straight lank figureso eloquent of strengthand the familiar poise of his left hand upon the pummel of his sword felt proud indeed that he belonged to her and secure in his protection she sat herself at the window when he was gone and whilst she awaited his return she hummed a gay measure softly to herself her eyes were bright and there was a flush upon her cheeks not even in the wet greasy street could she find any unsightliness that afternoon but as she waited and the minutes grew to hours that flush faded and the sparkle died gradually from her eyes the measure that she had hummed was silenced and her shapely mouth took on a pout of impatience which anon grew into a tighter mould as he continued absent  a frown drew her brows together and mistress cynthias thoughts were much as they had been the night before she left castle marleigh where was he why came he not she took up a book of plays that lay upon the table and sought to while away the time by reading the afternoon faded into dusk and still he did not come her woman appeared to ask whether she should call for lights and at that cynthia became almost violent  where is sir crispin she demanded and to the dames quavering answer that she knew not she angrily bade her go ascertain  in a pet cynthia paced the chamber whilst catherine was gone upon that errand did this man account her a toy to while away the hours for which he could find no more profitable diversion and to leave her to die of ennui when aught else offered was it a small thing that he had asked of her to go with him into a strange land that he should show himself so little sensible of the honour done him  with such questions did she plague herself and finding them either unanswerable or answerable only by affirmatives she had wellnigh resolved upon leaving the inn and making her way back to london to seek out her aunt when the door opened and her woman reappeared  well cried cynthia seeing her alone where is sir crispin  below madam  below echoed she and what pray doth he below  he is at dice with a gentleman from london  in the dim light of the october twilight the woman saw not the sudden pallor of her mistresss cheeks but she heard the gasp of pain that was almost a cry in her mortification cynthia could have wept had she given way to her feelings the man who had induced her to elope with him sat at dice with a gentleman from london oh it was monstrous at the thought of it she broke into a laugh that appalled her tiringwoman then mastering her hysteria she took a sudden determination  call me the host she cried and the frightened catherine obeyed her at a run  when the landlord came bearing lights and bending his aged back obsequiously  have you a pillion she asked abruptly well fool why do you stare have you a pillion  i have madam  and a knave to ride with me and a couple more as escort  i might procure them but  how soon  within half an hour but  then go see to it she broke in her foot beating the ground impatiently  but madam  go go go she cried her voice rising at each utterance of that imperative  but madam the host persisted despairingly and speaking quickly so that he might get the words out i have no horses fit to travel ten miles  i need to go but five she retorted quickly her only thought being to get the beasts no matter what their condition now go and come not back until all is ready use dispatch and i will pay you well and above all not a word to the gentleman who came hither with me  the sorelypuzzled host withdrew to do her bidding won to it by her promise of good payment  alone she sat for half an hour vainly fostering the hope that ere the landlord returned to announce the conclusion of his preparations crispin might have remembered her and come but he did not appear and in her solitude this poor little maid was very miserable and shed some tears that had still more of anger than sorrow in their source at length the landlord came she summoned her woman and bade her follow by post on the morrow the landlord she rewarded with a ring worth twenty times the value of the service and was led by him through a side door into the innyard  here she found three horses one equipped with the pillion on which she was to ride behind a burly stableboy the other two were mounted by a couple of stalwart and wellarmed men one of whom carried a funnelmouthed musketoon with a swagger that promised prodigies of valour  wrapped in her cloak she mounted behind the stableboy and bade him set out and take the road to denham her dream was at an end  master quinn the landlord watched her departure with eyes that were charged with doubt and concern as he made fast the door of the stableyard after she had passed out he ominously shook his hoary head and muttered to himself humble hostelryflavoured philosophies touching the strange ways of men with women and the stranger ways of women with men then taking up his lanthorn he slowly retraced his steps to the buttery where his wife was awaiting him  with sleeves rolled high above her pink and deeplydimpled elbows stood mistress quinn at work upon the fashioning of a pastry when her husband entered and set down his lanthorn with a sigh  to be so plagued he growled to be browbeaten by a slip of a wencha fine gentlemans baggage with the airs and vapours of a lady of quality am i not a fool to have endured it  certainly you are a fool his wife agreed kneading diligently whatever you may have endured what now  his fat face was puckered into a thousand wrinkles his little eyes gazed at her with longsuffering malice  you are my wife he answered pregnantly as who would say thus is my folly clearly proven and seeing that the assertion was not one that admitted of dispute mistress quinn was silent  oh tis ill done he broke out a moment later shame on me for it it is ill done  if you have done it tis sure to be ill done and shame on you in good soothbut for what put in his wife  for sending those poor jaded beasts upon the road  what beasts  what beasts do i keep turtles my horses woman  and whither have you sent them  to denham with the baggage that came hither this morning in the company of that very fierce gentleman who was in such a pet because we had no horses  where is he inquired the hostess  at dice with those other gallants from town  at dice quotha and shes gone you say asked mrs quinn pausing in her labours squarely to face her husband  aye said he  stupid rejoined his docile spouse vexed by his laconic assent do you mean she has run away  tis what anyone might take from what i have told you he answered sweetly  and you have lent her horses and helped her to get away and you leave her husband at play in there  you have seen her marriage lines i make no doubt he sneered irrelevantly  you dolt if the gentleman horsewhips you you will have richly earned it  eh what gasped he and his rubicund cheeks lost something of their high colour for here was a possibility that had not entered into his calculations but mistress quinn stayed not to answer him already she was making for the door wiping the dough from her hands on to her apron as she went a suspicion of her purpose flashed through her husbands mind  what would you do he inquired nervously  tell the gentleman what has taken place  nay he cried resolutely barring her way nay that you shall not would youwould you ruin me  she gave him a look of contempt and dodging his grasp she gained the door and was halfway down the passage towards the common room before he had overtaken her and caught her round the middle  are you mad woman he shouted will you undo me  do you undo me she bade him snatching at his hands but he clutched with the tightness of despair  you shall not go he swore come back and leave the gentleman to make the discovery for himself i dare swear it will not afflict him overmuch he has abandoned her sorely since they came not a doubt of it but that he is weary of her at least he need not know i lent her horses let him think she fled afoot when he discovers her departure  i will go she answered stubbornly dragging him with her a yard or two nearer the door the gentleman shall be warned is a woman to run away from her husband in my house and the husband never be warned of it  i promised her he began  what care i for your promises she asked i will tell him so that he may yet go after her and bring her back  you shall not he insisted gripping her more closely but at that moment a delicately mocking voice greeted their ears  marry tis vastly diverting to hear you it said they looked round to find one of the party of town sparks that had halted at the inn standing arms akimbo in the narrow passage clearly waiting for them to make room a touching sight sir said he sardonically to the landlord a wondrous touching sight to behold a man of your years playing the turtledove to his good wife like the merest fledgeling it grieves me to intrude myself so harshly upon your cooing though if youll but let me pass you may resume your chaste embrace without uneasiness for i give you my word ill never look behind me  abashed the landlord and his dame fell apart then ere the gentleman could pass her mistress quinn like a true opportunist sped swiftly down the passage and into the common room before her husband could again detain her  now within the common room of the suffolk arms sir crispin sat face to face with a very pretty fellow all musk and ribbons and surrounded by some halfdozen gentlemen on their way to london who had halted to rest at stafford  the pretty gentleman swore lustily affected a monstrous wicked look assured that he was impressing all who stood about with some conceit of the rakehelly ways he pursued in town  a game started with crowns to while away the tedium of the enforced sojourn at the inn had grown to monstrous proportions fortune had favoured the youth at first but as the stakes grew her favours to him diminished and at the moment that cynthia rode out of the innyard mr harry foster flung his last gold piece with an oath upon the table  rat me he groaned theres the end of a hundred  he toyed sorrowfully with the red ribbon in his black hair and crispin seeing that no fresh stake was forthcoming made shift to rise but the coxcomb detained him  tarry sir he cried ive not yet done slife well make a night of it  he drew a ring from his finger and with a superb gesture of disdain pushed it across the board  whatll ye stake and in the same breath boy another stoup he cried  crispin eyed the gem carelessly  twenty caroluses he muttered  rat me sir that nose of yours proclaims you a jew without more say twentyfive and ill cast  with a tolerant smile and the shrug of a man to whom twentyfive or a hundred are of like account crispin consented they threw crispin passed and won  whatll ye stake cried mr foster and a second ring followed the first  before crispin could reply the door leading to the interior of the inn was flung open and mrs quinn breathless with exertion and excitement came scurrying across the room in the doorway stood the host in hesitancy and fear bending to crispins ear mrs quinn delivered her message in a whisper that was heard by most of those who were about  gone cried crispin in consternation  the woman pointed to her husband and crispin understanding from this that she referred him to the host called to him  what know you landlord he shouted come hither and tell me whither is she gone  i know not replied the quaking host adding the particulars of cynthias departure and the information that the lady seemed in great anger  saddle me a horse cried crispin leaping to his feet and pitching mr fosters trinket upon the table as though it were a thing of no value towards denham you say they rode quick man and as the host departed he swept the gold and the ring he had won into his pockets preparing to depart  hoity toity cried mr foster what sudden haste is this  i am sorry sir that fortune has been unkind to you but i must go circumstances have arisen which  dn your circumstances roared foster get ting on his feet youll not leave me thus  with your permission sir i will  but you shall not have my permission  then i shall be so unfortunate as to go without it but i shall return  sir tis an old legend that  crispin turned about in despair to be embroiled now might ruin everything and by a miracle he kept his temper he had a moment to spare while his horse was being saddled  sir he said if you have upon your pretty person trinkets to half the value of what i have won from you ill stake the whole against them on one throw after which no matter what the result i take my departure are you agreed  there was a murmur of admiration from those present at the recklessness and the generosity of the proposal and foster was forced to accept it two more rings he drew forth a diamond from the ruffles at his throat and a pearl that he wore in his ear the lot he set upon the board and crispin threw the winning cast as the host entered to say that his horse was ready  he gathered the trinkets up and with a polite word of regret he was gone leaving mr harry foster to meditate upon the pledging of one of his horses to the landlord in discharge of his lodging  and so it fell out that before cynthia had gone six miles along the road to denham one of her attendants caught a rapid beat of hoofs behind them and drew her attention to it suggesting that they were being followed faster cynthia bade them travel but the pursuer gained upon them at every stride again the man drew her attention to it and proposed that they should halt and face him who followed the possession of the musketoon gave him confidence touching the issue but cynthia shuddered at the thought and again with promises of rich reward urged them to go faster another mile they went but every moment brought the pursuing hoofbeats nearer and nearer until at last a hoarse challenge rang out behind them and they knew that to go farther would be vain within the next halfmile ride as they might their pursuer would be upon them  the night was moonless yet sufficiently clear for objects to be perceived against the sky and presently the black shadow of him who rode behind loomed up upon the road not a hundred paces off  despite cynthias orders not to fire he of the musketoon raised his weapon under cover of the darkness and blazed at the approaching shadow  cynthia cried outa shriek of dismay it was the horses plunged and sir crispin laughed aloud as he bore down upon them he of the musketoon heard the swish of a sword being drawn and saw the glitter of the blade in the dark a second later there was a shock as crispins horse dashed into his and a crushing blow across the forehead which galliard delivered with the hilt of his rapier sent him hurtling from the saddle his comrade clapped spurs to his horse at that and was running a race with the night wind in the direction of denham  before cynthia quite knew what had happened the seat on the pillion in front of her was empty and she was riding back to stafford with crispin beside her his hand upon the bridle of her horse  you little fool he said halfangrily halfgibingly and thereafter they rode in silenceshe too mortified with shame and anger to venture upon words  that journey back to stafford was a speedy one and soon they stood again in the innyard out of which she had ridden but an hour ago avoiding the common room crispin ushered her through the side door by which she had quitted the house the landlord met them in the passage and looking at crispins face the pallor and fierceness of it drove him back without a word  together they ascended to the chamber where in solitude she had spent the day her feelings were those of a child caught in an act of disobedience and she was angry with herself and her weakness that it should be so yet within the room she stood with bent head never glancing at her companion in whose eyes there was a look of blended anger and amazement as he observed her at length in calm level tones  why did you run away he asked  the question was to her anger as a gust of wind to a smouldering fire she threw back her head defiantly and fixed him with a glance as fierce as his own  i will tell you she cried and suddenly stopped short the fire died from her eyes and they grew wide in wonderin fascinated wonderto see a deep stain overspreading one side of his grey doublet from the left shoulder downwards her wonder turned to horror as she realized the nature of that stain and remembered that one of her men had fired upon him  you are wounded she faltered  a sickly smile came into his face and seemed to accentuate its pallor he made a deprecatory gesture then as if in that gesture he had expended his last grain of strength he swayed suddenly as he stood he made as if to reach a chair but at the second step he stumbled and without further warning he fell prone at her feet his left hand upon his heart his right outstretched straight from the shoulder the loss of blood he had sustained following upon the fatigue and sleeplessness that had been his of late had demanded its due from him man of iron though he was  upon the instant her anger vanished a great fear that he was dead descended upon her and to heighten the horror of it came the thought that he had received his deathwound through her agency with a moan of anguish she went down upon her knees beside him she raised his head and pillowed it in her lap calling to him by name as though her voice alone must suffice to bring him back to life and consciousness instinctively she unfastened his doublet at the neck and sought to draw it away that she might see the nature of his hurt and staunch the wound if possible but her strength ebbed away from her and she abandoned her task unable to do more than murmur his name  crispin crispin crispin  she stooped and kissed the white clammy forehead then his lips and as she did so a tremor ran through her and he opened his eyes a moment they looked dull and lifeless then they waxed questioning  a second ago these two had stood in anger with the width of the room betwixt them now in a flash he found his head on her lap her lips on his how came he there what meant it  crispin crispin she cried thank god you did but swoon  then the awakening of his soul came swift upon the awakening of his body he lay there oblivious of his wound oblivious of his mission oblivious of his son he lay with senses still half dormant and comprehension dulled but with a soul alert he lay and was supremely happy with a happiness such as he had never known in all his illstarred life  in a feeble voice he asked  why did you run away  let us forget it she answered softly  naytell me first  i thoughti thought she stammered then gathering courage i thought you did not really care that you made a toy of me said she when they told me that you sat at dice with a gentleman from london i was angry at your neglect if you loved me i told myself you would not have used me so and left me to mope alone  for a moment crispin let his grey eyes devour her blushing face then he closed them and pondered what she had said realization breaking upon him now like a great flood the light came to him in one blinding yet allilluming flash a hundred things that had puzzled him in the last two days grew of a sudden clear and filled him with a joy unspeakable he dared scarce believe that he was awake and cynthia by himthat he had indeed heard aright what she had said how blind he had been how nescient of himself  then as his thoughts travelled on to the source of the misapprehension he remembered his son and the memory was like an icy hand upon his temples that chilled him through and through lying there with eyes still closed he groaned happiness was within his grasp at last love might be his again did he but ask it and the love of as pure and sweet a creature as ever god sent to chasten a mans life a great tenderness possessed him a burning temptation to cast to the winds his plighted word to make a mock of faith to deride honour and to seize this woman for his own she loved him he knew it now he loved herthe knowledge had come as suddenly upon him compared with this what could his faith his word his honour give him what to him in the face of this was that paltry fellow his son who had spurned him  the hardest fight he ever fought he fought it there lying supine upon the ground his head in her lap  had he fought it out with closed eyes perchance honour and his plighted word had won the day but he opened them and they met cynthias  a while they stayed thus the hungry glance of his grey eyes peering into the clear blue depths of hers and in those depths his soul was drowned his honour stifled  cynthia he cried god pity me i love you and he swooned again     chapter xxvi to france   that cry which she but half understood was still ringing in her ears when the door was of a sudden flung open and across the threshold a very daintily arrayed young gentleman stepped briskly the expostulating landlord following close upon his heels  i tell thee lying dog he cried i saw him ride into the yard and fore george he shall give me the chance of mending my losses be off to your father you devils natural  cynthia looked up in alarm whereupon that merry blood catching sight of her halted in some confusion at what he saw  rat me madam he cried i did not knowi had not looked to he stopped and remembering at last his manners he made her a low bow  your servant madam said he your servant harry foster  she gazed at him her eyes full of inquiry but said nothing whereat the pretty gentleman plucked awkwardly at his ruffles and wished himself elsewhere  i did not know madam that your husband was hurt  he is not my husband sir she answered scarce knowing what she said  gadso he ejaculated yet you ran away from him  her cheeks grew crimson  the door sir is behind you  so madam is that thief the landlord he made answer no whit abashed come hither you bladder of fat the gentleman is hurt  thus courteously summoned the landlord shuffled forward and mr foster begged cynthia to allow him with the fellows aid to see to the gentlemans wound between them they laid crispin on a couch and the town spark went to work with a dexterity little to have been expected from his flippant exterior he dressed the wound which was in the shoulder and not in itself of a dangerous character the loss of blood it being that had brought some gravity to the knights condition they propped his head upon a pillow and presently he sighed and opening his eyes complained of thirst and was manifestly surprised at seeing the coxcomb turned leech  i came in search of you to pursue our game foster explained when they had ministered to him and fore george i am vastly grieved to find you in this condition  pish sir my condition is none so grievousa scratch no more and were my heart itself pierced the knowledge that i have gained he stopped short but there sir he added presently i am grateful beyond words for your timely ministration and if to my debt you will add that of leaving me awhile to rest i shall appreciate it  his glance met cynthias and he smiled the host coughed significantly and shuffled towards the door but master foster made no shift to move but stood instead beside galliard though in apparent hesitation  i should like a word with you ere i go he said at length then turning and perceiving the landlord standing by the door in an attitude of eloquent waiting take yourself off he cried to him crush me may not one gentleman say a word to another without being forced to speak into your inquisitive ears as well you will forgive my heat madam but god amercy that greasy rascal tries me sorely  now sir he resumed when the host was gone i stand thus i have lost to you today a sum of money which though some might account considerable is in itself no more than a trifle  i am however greatly exercised at the loss of certain trinkets which have to me a peculiar value and which to be frank i staked in a moment of desperation i had hoped sir to retrieve my losses oer a friendly main this evening for i have still to stake a coach and four horsesas noble a set of beasts as youll find in england aye rat me your wound sir renders it impossible for me to ask you to give yourself the fatigue of obliging me i come then to propose that you return me those trinkets against my note of hand for the amount that was staked on them i am well known in town sir he added hurriedly and you need have no anxiety  crispin stopped him with a wave of the hand  i have none sir in that connexion and i am willing to do as you suggest he thrust his hand into his pocket and drew forth the rings the brooch and the earring he had won here sir are your trinkets  sir cried mr foster thrown into some confusion by galliards unquestioning generosity i am indebted to you rat me sir i am indeed you shall have my note of hand on the instant how much shall we say  one moment mr foster said crispin an idea suddenly occurring to him you mentioned horses are they fresh  as june roses  and you are returning to london are you not  i am  when do you wish to proceed  tomorrow  why then sir i have a proposal to make which will remove the need of your note of hand lend me your horses sir to reach harwich i wish to set out at once  but your wound cried cynthia you are still faint  faint not i i am awake and strong my wound is no wound for a scratch may not be given that name so there sweetheart he laughed and drawing down her head he whispered the words your father then turning again to foster now sir he continued there are four tolerable posthorses of mine below on which you can follow tomorrow to harwich there exchanging them again for your own which you shall find awaiting you stabled at the garter inn for this service to me of immeasurable value i will willingly cede those gewgaws to you  but rat me sir cried foster in bewilderment tis too generouspon honour it is i cant consent to it no rat me i cant  i have told you how great a boon you will confer believe me sir to me it is worth twice a hundred times the value of those trinkets  you shall have my horses sir and my note of hand as well said foster firmly  your note of hand is of no value to me sir i look to leave england tomorrow and i know not when i may return  thus in the end it came about that the bargain was concluded cynthias maid was awakened and bidden to rise the horses were harnessed to crispins coach and crispin leaning upon harry fosters arm descended and took his place within the carriage  leaving the london blood at the door of the suffolk arms crushing burning damning and ratting himself at crispins magnificence they rolled away through the night in the direction of ipswich  ten oclock in the morning beheld them at the door of the garter inn at harwich but the jolting of the coach had so hardly used crispin that he had to be carried into the hostelry he was much exercised touching the lady jane and his inability to go down to the quay in quest of her when he was accosted by a burly redfaced individual who bluntly asked him was he called sir crispin galliard ere he could frame an answer the man had added that he was thomas jackson master of the lady janeat which piece of good news crispin felt like to shout for joy  but his reflection upon his present position when at last he lay in the schooners cabin brought him the bitter reverse of pleasure he had set out to bring cynthia to his son he had pledged his honour to accomplish it how was he fulfilling his trust in his despondency during a moment when alone he cursed the knave that had wounded him for his clumsiness in not having taken a lower aim when he fired and thus solved him this ugly riddle of life for all time  vainly did he strive to console himself and endeavour to palliate the wrong he had done with the consideration that he was the man cynthia loved and not his son that his son was nothing to her and that she would never have accompanied him had she dreamt that he wooed her for another  no the deed was foul and rendered fouler still by virtue of those other wrongs in whose extenuation it had been undertaken for a moment he grew almost a coward he was on the point of bidding master jackson avoid calais and make some other port along the coast but in a moment he had scorned the craven argument of flight and determined that come what might he would face his son and lay the truth before him leaving him to judge how strong fate had been as he lay feverish and fretful in the vessels cabin he came wellnigh to hating kenneth he remembered him only as a poor mean creature now a bigot now a fop now a psalmmonger now a roysterer but ever a hypocrite ever a coward and never such a man as he could have taken pride in presenting as his offspring  they had a fair wind and towards evening cynthia who had been absent from his side a little while came to tell him that the coast of france grew nigh  his answer was a sigh and when she chid him for it he essayed a smile that was yet more melancholy for a second he was tempted to confide in her to tell her of the position in which he found himself and to lighten his load by sharing it with her but this he dared not do cynthia must never know     chapter xxvii the auberge du soleil   in a room of the first floor of the auberge du soleil at calais the host inquired of crispin if he were milord galliard at that question crispin caught his breath in apprehension and felt himself turn pale what it portended he guessed and it stifled the hope that had been rising in him since his arrival and because he had not found his son awaiting him either on the jetty or at the inn he dared ask no questions fearing that the reply would quench that hope which rose despite himself and begotten of a desire of which he was hardly conscious  he sighed before replying and passing his brown nervous hand across his brow he found it moist  my name m lhote is crispin galliard what news have you for me  a gentlemana countryman of milordshas been here these three days awaiting him  for a little while crispin sat quite still stripped of his last rag of hope then suddenly bracing himself he sprang up despite his weakness  bring him to me i will see him at once  toutalheure monsieur replied the landlord at the moment he is absent he went out to take the air a couple of hours ago and is not yet returned  heaven send he has walked into the sea crispin broke out passionately then as passionately he checked himself no no my godnot that i meant not that  monsieur will sup  at once and let me have lights the host withdrew to return a moment later with a couple of lighted tapers which he set upon the table  as he was retiring a heavy step sounded on the stair accompanied by the clank of a scabbard against the baluster  here comes milords countryman the landlord announced  and crispin looking up in apprehension saw framed in the doorway the burly form of harry hogan  he sat bolt upright staring as though he beheld an apparition with a sad smile hogan advanced and set his hand affectionately upon galliards shoulder  welcome to france crispin said he if not him whom you looked to find you have at least a loyal friend to greet you  hogan gasped the knight what make you here how came you here where is jocelyn  the irishman looked at him gravely for a moment then sighed and sank down upon a chair you have brought the lady he asked  she is here she will be with us presently  hogan groaned and shook his grey head sorrowfully  but where is jocelyn cried galliard again and his haggard face looked very wan and white as he turned it inquiringly upon his companion why is he not here  i have bad news  bad news muttered crispin as though he understood not the meaning of the words bad news he repeated musingly then bracing himself what is this news  and you have brought the lady too hogan complained faith i had hoped that you had failed in that at least  sdeath harry crispin exclaimed will you tell me the news  hogan pondered a moment then  i will relate the story from the very beginning said he some four hours after your departure from waltham my men brought in the malignant we were hunting i dispatched my sergeant and the troop forthwith to london with the prisoner keeping just two troopers with me an hour or so later a coach clattered into the yard and out of it stepped a short lean man in black with a very evil face and a crooked eye who bawled out that he was joseph ashburn of castle marleigh a friend of the lord generals and that he must have horses on the instant to proceed upon his journey to london i was in the yard at the time and hearing the full announcement i guessed what his business in london was he entered the inn to refresh himself and i followed him in the common room the first man his eyes lighted on was your son he gasped at sight of him and when he had recovered his breath he let fly as round a volley of blasphemy as ever i heard from the lips of a puritan when that was over fool he yells what make you here the lad stammered and grew confused at lasti was detained here says he detained thunders the other and by whom by my father you murdering villain was the hot answer  at that master ashburn grows very white and very evillooking so he says in a playful voice you have learnt that have you well by god the lesson shall profit neither you nor that rascal your father but ill begin with you you cur and with that he seizes a jug of ale that stood on the table and empties it over the boys face soul of my body the lad showed such spirit then as i had never looked to find in him outside yells he tugging at his sword with one hand and pointing to the door with the other outside you hound where i can kill you ashburn laughed and cursed him and together they flung past me into the yard the place was empty at the moment and there before the clash of their blades had drawn interference the thing was overand ashburn had sent his sword through jocelyns heart  hogan paused and crispin sat very still and white his soul in torment  and ashburn he asked presently in a voice that was singularly hoarse and low what became of him was he not arrested  no said hogan grimly he was not arrested he was buried before he had wiped his blade i had stepped up to him and accused him of murdering a beardless boy i remembered the reckoning he owed you i remembered that he had sought to send you to your death i saw the boys body still warm and bleeding upon the ground and i struck him with my knuckles on the mouth like the cowardly ruffian he was he made a pass at me with his sword before i had got mine out i avoided it narrowly and we set to work  people rushed in and would have stopped us but i cursed them so whilst i fenced swearing to kill any man that came between us that they held off and waited i didnt keep them overlong i was no raw youngster fresh from the hills of scotland i put the point of my sword through joseph ashburns throat within a minute of our engaging  it was then as i stood in that shambles and looked down upon my handiwork that i recalled in what favour master ashburn was held by the parliament and i grew sick to think of what the consequences might be to avoid them i got me there and then to horse and rode in a straight line for greenwich hoping to find the lady jane still there but my messenger had already sent her to harwich for you i was well ahead of possible pursuit and so i pushed on to dover and thence i crossed arriving here three days ago  crispin rose and stepped up to hogan the last time you came to me after killing a man harry i was of some service to you you shall find me no less useful now you will come to paris with me  but the lady gasped hogan amazed at crispins lack of thought for her  i hear her step upon the stairs leave me now harry but as you go desire the landlord to send for a priest the lady remains  one look of utter bewilderment did hogan bestow upon sir crispin and for once his glib irish tongue could shape no other words than  soul of my body  he wrung crispins hand and in a state of ineffable perplexity he hurried from the room to do what was required of him  for a moment crispin stood by the window and looking out into the night he thanked god from his heart for his solution of the monstrous riddle that had been set him  then the rustle of a gown drew his attention and he swung round to find cynthia smiling upon him from the threshold  he advanced to meet her and setting his hands upon her shoulders he held her at arms length looking down into her eyes  cynthia my cynthia he cried and she breaking past the barrier of his grasp nestled up to him with a sigh of sweet and unalloyed content
