70010010	lincoln letters  by abraham lincoln   published by the bibilophile society     note  the letters herein by lincoln are so thoroughly characteristic of the man and are in themselves so completely selfexplanatory that it requires no comment to enable the reader fully to understand and appreciate them it will be observed that the philosophical admonitions in the letter to his brother johnston were written on the same sheet with the letter to his father  the promptness and decision with which lincoln despatched the multitudinous affairs of his office during the most turbulent scenes of the civil war are exemplified in his unequivocal order to the attorneygeneral indorsed on the back of the letter of hon austin a king requesting a pardon for john b corner the indorsement bears even date with the letter itself and corner was pardoned on the following day   the originals from which the within facsimiles were made are in the collection of mr william k bixby and through his courtesy they are reproduced for members of the bibliophile society   illustration 01 to his father   illustration 02 to his brother   illustration 03 to his brother     washington dec 24th 1848  my dear father  your letter of the 7th was received night before last i very cheerfully send you the twenty dollars which sum you say is necessary to save your land from sale it is singular that you should have forgotten a judgment against you and it is more singular that the plaintiff should have let you forget it so long particularly as i suppose you have always had property enough to satisfy a judgment of that amount before you pay it it would be well to be sure you have not paid it or at least that you can not prove you have paid it give my love to mother and all the connections  affectionately your son  a lincoln   written on same page with above  dear johnston  your request for eighty dollars i do not think it best to comply with now at the various times when i have helped you a little you have said to me we can get along very well now but in a very short time i find you in the same difficulty again now this can only happen by some defect in your conduct what that defect is i think i know you are not lazy and still you are an idler i doubt whether since i saw you you have done a good whole days work in any one day you do not very much dislike to work and still you do not work much merely because it does not seem to you that you could get much for it this habit of uselessly wasting time is the whole difficulty and it is vastly important to you and still more so to your children that you should break this habit it is more important to them because they have longer to live and can keep out of an idle habit before they are in it easier than they can get out after they are in  you are now in need of some ready money and what i propose is that you shall go to work tooth and nail for somebody who will give you money for it let father and your boys take charge of things at homeprepare for a crop and make the crop and you go to work for the best money wages or in discharge of any debt you owe that you can get and to secure you a fair reward for your labor i now promise you that for every dollar you will between this and the first of next may get for your own labor either in money or in your own indebtedness i will then give you one other dollar by this if you hire yourself at ten dollars a month from me you will get ten more making twenty dollars a month for your work in this i do not mean you shall go off to st louis or the lead mines or the gold mines in california but i mean for you to go at it for the best wages you can get close to home in coles county now if you will do this you will soon be out of debt and what is better you will have a habit that will keep you from getting in debt again but if i should now clear you out next year you will be just as deep in as ever you say you would almost give your place in heaven for 70 or 80 then you value your place in heaven very cheaply for i am sure you can with the offer i make you get the seventy or eighty dollars for four or five months work you say if i furnish you the money you will deed me the land and if you dont pay the money back you will deliver possessionnonsense if you cant now live with the land how will you then live without it you have always been kind to me and i do not now mean to be unkind to you on the contrary if you will but follow my advice you will find it worth more than eight times eighty dollars to you  affectionately your brother  a lincoln   illustration 04 to general grant     washington april 30 1864  executive mansion  lieutenantgeneral grant  not expecting to see you again before the spring campaign opens i wish to express in this way my entire satisfaction with what you have done up to this time so far as i understand it the particulars of your plans i neither know or seek to know you are vigilant and self reliant and pleased with this i wish not to obtrude any constraints or restraints upon you while i am very anxious that any great disaster or the capture of our men in great numbers shall be avoided i know these points are less likely to escape your attention than they would be mine if there is anything wanting which is within my power to give do not fail to let me know it  and now with a brave army and a just cause may god sustain you  yours very truly  a lincoln    illustration 05 request for a pardon   illustration 06 request for a pardon   illustration 07 approval of a pardon
