28880884	in the carquinez woods  by bret harte     chapter i   the sun was going down on the carquinez woods the few shafts of sunlight that had pierced their pillared gloom were lost in unfathomable depths or splintered their ineffectual lances on the enormous trunks of the redwoods for a time the dull red of their vast columns and the dull red of their castoff bark which matted the echoless aisles still seemed to hold a faint glow of the dying day but even this soon passed light and color fled upwards the dark interlaced treetops that had all day made an impenetrable shade broke into fire here and there their lost spires glittered faded and went utterly out a weird twilight that did not come from the outer world but seemed born of the wood itself slowly filled and possessed the aisles the straight tall colossal trunks rose dimly like columns of upward smoke the few fallen trees stretched their huge length into obscurity and seemed to lie on shadowy trestles the strange breath that filled these mysterious vaults had neither coldness nor moisture a dry fragrant dust arose from the noiseless foot that trod their barkstrewn floor the aisles might have been tombs the fallen trees enormous mummies the silence the solitude of a forgotten past  and yet this silence was presently broken by a recurring sound like breathing interrupted occasionally by inarticulate and stertorous gasps it was not the quick panting listening breath of some stealthy feline or canine animal but indicated a larger slower and more powerful organization whose progress was less watchful and guarded or as if a fragment of one of the fallen monsters had become animate at times this life seemed to take visible form but as vaguely as misshapenly as the phantom of a nightmare now it was a square object moving sideways endways with neither head nor tail and scarcely visible feet then an arched bulk rolling against the trunks of the trees and recoiling again or an upright cylindrical mass but always oscillating and unsteady and striking the trees on either hand the frequent occurrence of the movement suggested the figures of some weird rhythmic dance to music heard by the shape alone suddenly it either became motionless or faded away  there was the frightened neighing of a horse the sudden jingling of spurs a shout and outcry and the swift apparition of three dancing torches in one of the dark aisles but so intense was the obscurity that they shed no light on surrounding objects and seemed to advance of their own volition without human guidance until they disappeared suddenly behind the interposing bulk of one of the largest trees beyond its eighty feet of circumference the light could not reach and the gloom remained inscrutable but the voices and jingling spurs were heard distinctly  blast the mare shes shied off that cursed trail again  ye aint lost it again hev ye growled a second voice  thats jist what i hev and these blasted pineknots dont give light an inch beyond em dd if i dont think they make this cursed hole blacker  there was a laugha womans laughhysterical bitter sarcastic exasperating the second speaker without heeding it went on  what in thunder skeert the hosses did you see or hear anything  nothin the wood is like a graveyard  the womans voice again broke into a hoarse contemptuous laugh the man resumed angrily  if you know anything why in hll dont you say so instead of cackling like a dd squaw there praps you reckon you ken find the trail too  take this rope off my wrist said the womans voice untie my hands let me down and ill find it she spoke quickly and with a spanish accent  it was the mens turn to laugh and give you a show to snatch that sixshooter and blow a hole through me as you did to the sheriff of calaveras eh not if this court understands itself said the first speaker dryly  go to the devil then she said curtly  not before a lady responded the other there was another laugh from the men the spurs jingled again the three torches reappeared from behind the tree and then passed away in the darkness  for a time silence and immutability possessed the woods the great trunks loomed upwards their fallen brothers stretched their slow length into obscurity the sound of breathing again became audible the shape reappeared in the aisle and recommenced its mystic dance presently it was lost in the shadow of the largest tree and to the sound of breathing succeeded a grating and scratching of bark suddenly as if riven by lightning a flash broke from the center of the treetrunk lit up the woods and a sharp report rang through it after a pause the jingling of spurs and the dancing of torches were revived from the distance  hallo  no answer  who fired that shot  but there was no reply a slight veil of smoke passed away to the right there was the spice of gunpowder in the air but nothing more  the torches came forward again but this time it could be seen they were held in the hands of two men and a woman the womans hands were tied at the wrist to the horsehair reins of her mule while a riata passed around her waist and under the mules girth was held by one of the men who were both armed with rifles and revolvers their frightened horses curveted and it was with difficulty they could be made to advance  ho stranger what are you shooting at  the woman laughed and shrugged her shoulders look yonder at the roots of the tree youre a dd smart man for a sheriff aint you  the man uttered an exclamation and spurred his horse forward but the animal reared in terror he then sprang to the ground and approached the tree the shape lay there a scarcely distinguishable bulk  a grizzly by the living jingo shot through the heart  it was true the strange shape lit up by the flaring torches seemed more vague unearthly and awkward in its dying throes yet the small shut eyes the feeble nose the ponderous shoulders and halfhuman foot armed with powerful claws were unmistakable the men turned by a common impulse and peered into the remote recesses of the wood again  hi mister come and pick up your game hallo there  the challenge fell unheeded on the empty woods  and yet said he whom the woman had called the sheriff he cant be far off it was a close shot and the bear hez dropped in his tracks why wots this sticking in his claws  the two men bent over the animal why its sugar brown sugarlook there was no mistake the huge beasts fore paws and muzzle were streaked with the unromantic household provision and heightened the absurd contrast of its incongruous members the woman apparently indifferent had taken that opportunity to partly free one of her wrists  if we hadnt been cavorting round this yer spot for the last half hour id swear there was a shanty not a hundred yards away said the sheriff  the other man without replying remounted his horse instantly  if there is and its inhabited by a gentleman that kin make centre shots like that in the dark and dont care to explain how i reckon i wont disturb him  the sheriff was apparently of the same opinion for he followed his companions example and once more led the way the spurs tinkled the torches danced and the cavalcade slowly reentered the gloom in another moment it had disappeared  the wood sank again into repose this time disturbed by neither shape nor sound what lower forms of life might have crept close to its roots were hidden in the ferns or passed with deadened tread over the barkstrewn floor towards morning a coolness like dew fell from above with here and there a dropping twig or nut or the crepitant awakening and stretchingout of cramped and weary branches later a dull lurid dawn not unlike the last evenings sunset filled the aisles this faded again and a clear gray light in which every object stood out in sharp distinctness took its place morning was waiting outside in all its brilliant youthful coloring but only entered as the matured and sobered day  seen in that stronger light the monstrous tree near which the dead bear lay revealed its age in its denuded and scarred trunk and showed in its base a deep cavity a foot or two from the ground partly hidden by hanging strips of bark which had fallen across it suddenly one of these strips was pushed aside and a young man leaped lightly down  but for the rifle he carried and some modern peculiarities of dress he was of a grace so unusual and unconventional that he might have passed for a faun who was quitting his ancestral home he stepped to the side of the bear with a light elastic movement that was as unlike customary progression as his face and figure were unlike the ordinary types of humanity even as he leaned upon his rifle looking down at the prostrate animal he unconsciously fell into an attitude that in any other mortal would have been a pose but with him was the picturesque and unstudied relaxation of perfect symmetry  hallo mister  he raised his head so carelessly and listlessly that he did not otherwise change his attitude stepping from behind the tree the woman of the preceding night stood before him her hands were free except for a thong of the riata which was still knotted around one wrist the end of the thong having been torn or burnt away her eyes were bloodshot and her hair hung over her shoulders in one long black braid  i reckoned all along it was you who shot the bear she said at least some one hiding yer and she indicated the hollow tree with her hand it wasnt no chance shot observing that the young man either from misconception or indifference did not seem to comprehend her she added we came by here last night a minute after you fired  oh that was you kicked up such a row was it said the young man with a shade of interest  i reckon said the woman nodding her head and them that was with me  and who are they  sheriff dunn of yolo and his deputy  and where are they now  the deputyin hll i reckon i dont know about the sheriff  i see said the young man quietly and you  igot away she said savagely but she was taken with a sudden nervous shiver which she at once repressed by tightly dragging her shawl over her shoulders and elbows and folding her arms defiantly  and youre going  to follow the deputy may be she said gloomily but come i say aint you going to treat its cursed cold here  wait a moment the young man was looking at her with his arched brows slightly knit and a half smile of curiosity aint you teresa  she was prepared for the question but evidently was not certain whether she would reply defiantly or confidently after an exhaustive scrutiny of his face she chose the latter and said you can bet your life on it johnny  i dont bet and my name isnt johnny then youre the woman who stabbed dick curson over at lagranges  she became defiant again  thats me all the time what are you going to do about it  nothing and you used to dance at the alhambra she whisked the shawl from her shoulders held it up like a scarf and made one or two steps of the sembicuacua there was not the least gayety recklessness or spontaneity in the action it was simply mechanical bravado it was so ineffective even upon her own feelings that her arms presently dropped to her side and she coughed embarrassedly wheres that whiskey pardner she asked  the young man turned toward the tree he had just quitted and without further words assisted her to mount to the cavity it was an irregularshaped vaulted chamber pierced fifty feet above by a shaft or cylindrical opening in the decayed trunk which was blackened by smoke as if it had served the purpose of a chimney in one corner lay a bearskin and blanket at the side were two alcoves or indentations one of which was evidently used as a table and the other as a cupboard in another hollow near the entrance lay a few small sacks of flour coffee and sugar the sticky contents of the latter still strewing the floor from this storehouse the young man drew a wicker flask of whiskey and handed it with a tin cup of water to the woman she waved the cup aside placed the flask to her lips and drank the undiluted spirit yet even this was evidently bravado for the water started to her eyes and she could not restrain the paroxysm of coughing that followed  i reckon thats the kind that kills at forty rods she said with a hysterical laugh but i say pardner you look as if you were fixed here to stay and she stared ostentatiously around the chamber but she had already taken in its minutest details even to observing that the hanging strips of bark could be disposed so as to completely hide the entrance  well yes he replied it wouldnt be very easy to pull up the stakes and move the shanty further on  seeing that either from indifference or caution he had not accepted her meaning she looked at him fixedly and said  what is your little game  eh  what are you hiding forhere in this tree  but im not hiding  then why didnt you come out when they hailed you last night  because i didnt care to  teresa whistled incredulously all rightthen if youre not hiding im going to as he did not reply she went on if i can keep out of sight for a couple of weeks this thing will blow over here and i can get across into yolo i could get a fair show there where the boys know me just now the trails are all watched but no one would think of lookin here  then how did you come to think of it he asked carelessly  because i knew that bear hadnt gone far for that sugar because i know he hadnt stole it from a cacheit was too fresh and wed have seen the tornup earth because we had passed no camp and because i knew there was no shanty here and besides she added in a low voice maybe i was huntin a hole myself to die inand spotted it by instinct  there was something in this suggestion of a hunted animal that unlike anything she had previously said or suggested was not exaggerated and caused the young man to look at her again she was standing under the chimneylike opening and the light from above illuminated her head and shoulders the pupils of her eyes had lost their feverish prominence and were slightly suffused and softened as she gazed abstractedly before her the only vestige of her previous excitement was in her lefthand fingers which were incessantly twisting and turning a diamond ring upon her right hand but without imparting the least animation to her rigid attitude suddenly as if conscious of his scrutiny she stepped aside out of the revealing light and by a swift feminine instinct raised her hand to her head as if to adjust her straggling hair it was only for a moment however for as if aware of the weakness she struggled to resume her aggressive pose  well she said speak up am i goin to stop here or have i got to get up and get  you can stay said the young man quietly but as ive got my provisions and ammunition here and havent any other place to go to just now i suppose well have to share it together  she glanced at him under her eyelids and a halfbitter halfcontemptuous smile passed across her face all right old man she said holding out her hand its a go well start in housekeeping at once if you like  ill have to come here once or twice a day he said quite composedly to look after my things and get something to eat but ill be away most of the time and what with camping out under the trees every night i reckon my share wont incommode you  she opened her black eyes upon him at this original proposition then she looked down at her torn dress i suppose this style of thing aint very fancy is it she said with a forced laugh  i think i know where to beg or borrow a change for you if you cant get any he replied simply  she stared at him again are you a family man  no  she was silent for a moment well she said you can tell your girl im not particular about its being in the latest fashion  there was a slight flush on his forehead as he turned toward the little cupboard but no tremor in his voice as he went on youll find tea and coffee here and if youre bored theres a book or two you read dont youi mean english  she nodded but cast a look of undisguised contempt upon the two worn coverless novels he held out to her you havent got last weeks sacramento union have you i hear they have my case all in only them lying reporters made it out against me all the time  i dont see the papers he replied curtly  they say theres a picture of me in the police gazette taken in the act and she laughed  he looked a little abstracted and turned as if to go i think youll do well to rest a while just now and keep as close hid as possible until afternoon the trail is a mile away at the nearest point but some one might miss it and stray over here youre quite safe if youre careful and stand by the tree you can build a fire here he stepped under the chimneylike opening without its being noticed even the smoke is lost and cannot be seen so high  the light from above was falling on his head and shoulders as it had on hers she looked at him intently  you travel a good deal on your figure pardner dont you she said with a certain admiration that was quite sexless in its quality but i dont see how you pick up a living by it in the carquinez woods so youre going are you you might be more sociable goodby  goodby he leaped from the opening  i say pardner  he turned a little impatiently she had knelt down at the entrance so as to be nearer his level and was holding out her hand but he did not notice it and she quietly withdrew it  if anybody dropped in and asked for you what name will they say  he smiled dont wait to hear  but suppose i wanted to sing out for you what will i call you  he hesitated call melo  lo the poor indian  exactly        the first word of popes familiar apostrophe is humorously      used in the far west as a distinguishing title for the      indian  it suddenly occurred to the woman teresa that in the young mans height supple yet erect carriage color and singular gravity of demeanor there was a refined aboriginal suggestion he did not look like any indian she had ever seen but rather as a youthful chief might have looked there was a further suggestion in his fringed buckskin shirt and moccasins but before she could utter the halfsarcastic comment that rose to her lips he had glided noiselessly away even as an indian might have done  she readjusted the slips of hanging bark with feminine ingenuity dispersing them so as to completely hide the entrance yet this did not darken the chamber which seemed to draw a purer and more vigorous light through the soaring shaft that pierced the roof than that which came from the dim woodland aisles below nevertheless she shivered and drawing her shawl closely around her began to collect some halfburnt fragments of wood in the chimney to make a fire but the preoccupation of her thoughts rendered this a tedious process as she would from time to time stop in the middle of an action and fall into an attitude of rapt abstraction with faroff eyes and rigid mouth when she had at last succeeded in kindling a fire and raising a film of pale blue smoke that seemed to fade and dissipate entirely before it reached the top of the chimney shaft she crouched beside it fixed her eyes on the darkest corner of the cavern and became motionless  what did she see through that shadow  nothing at first but a confused medley of figures and incidents of the preceding night things to be put away and forgotten things that would not have happened but for another thingthe thing before which everything faded a ballroom the sounds of music the one man she had cared for insulting her with the flaunting ostentation of his unfaithfulness herself despised put aside laughed at or worse jilted and then the moment of delirium when the light danced the one wild act that lifted her the despised one above them allmade her the supreme figure to be glanced at by frightened women stared at by halfstartled halfadmiring men yes she laughed but struck by the sound of her own voice moved twice round the cavern nervously and then dropped again into her old position  as they carried him away he had laughed at herlike a hound that he was he who had praised her for her spirit and incited her revenge against others he who had taught her to strike when she was insulted and it was only fit he should reap what he had sown she was what he what other men had made her and what was she now what had she been once  she tried to recall her childhood the man and woman who might have been her father and mother who fought and wrangled over her precocious little life abused or caressed her as she sided with either and then left her with a circus troupe where she first tasted the power of her courage her beauty and her recklessness she remembered those flashes of triumph that left a fever in her veinsa fever that when it failed must be stimulated by dissipation by anything by everything that would keep her name a wonder in mens mouths an envious fear to women she recalled her transfer to the strolling players her cheap pleasures and cheaper rivalries and hatredbut always teresa the daring teresa the reckless teresa audacious as a woman invincible as a boy dancing flirting fencing shooting swearing drinking smoking fighting teresa oh yes she had been loved perhapswho knowsbut always feared why should she change now ha he should see  she had lashed herself in a frenzy as was her wont with gestures ejaculations oaths adjurations and passionate apostrophes but with this strange and unexpected result heretofore she had always been sustained and kept up by an audience of some kind or quality if only perhaps a humble companion there had always been some one she could fascinate or horrify and she could read her power mirrored in their eyes even the halfabstracted indifference of her strange host had been something but she was alone now her words fell on apathetic solitude she was acting to viewless space she rushed to the opening dashed the hanging bark aside and leaped to the ground  she ran forward wildly a few steps and stopped  hallo she cried look tis i teresa  the profound silence remained unbroken her shrillest tones were lost in an echoless space even as the smoke of her fire had faded into pure ether she stretched out her clenched fists as if to defy the pillared austerities of the vaults around her  come and take me if you dare  the challenge was unheeded if she had thrown herself violently against the nearest treetrunk she could not have been stricken more breathless than she was by the compact embattled solitude that encompassed her the hopelessness of impressing these cold and passive vaults with her selfish passion filled her with a vague fear in her rage of the previous night she had not seen the wood in its profound immobility left alone with the majesty of those enormous columns she trembled and turned faint the silence of the hollow tree she had just quitted seemed to her less awful than the crushing presence of these mute and monstrous witnesses of her weakness like a wounded quail with lowered crest and trailing wing she crept back to her hiding place  even then the influence of the wood was still upon her she picked up the novel she had contemptuously thrown aside only to let it fall again in utter weariness for a moment her feminine curiosity was excited by the discovery of an old book in whose blank leaves were pressed a variety of flowers and woodland grasses as she could not conceive that these had been kept for any but a sentimental purpose she was disappointed to find that underneath each was a sentence in an unknown tongue that even to her untutored eye did not appear to be the language of passion finally she rearranged the couch of skins and blankets and imparting to it in three clever shakes an entirely different character lay down to pursue her reveries but nature asserted herself and ere she knew it she was asleep  so intense and prolonged had been her previous excitement that the tension once relieved she passed into a slumber of exhaustion so deep that she seemed scarce to breathe high noon succeeded morning the central shaft received a single ray of upper sunlight the afternoon came and went the shadows gathered below the sunset fires began to eat their way through the groined roof and she still slept she slept even when the bark hangings of the chamber were put aside and the young man reentered  he laid down a bundle he was carrying and softly approached the sleeper for a moment he was startled from his indifference she lay so still and motionless but this was not all that struck him the face before him was no longer the passionate haggard visage that confronted him that morning the feverish air the burning color the strained muscles of mouth and brow and the staring eyes were gone wiped away perhaps by the tears that still left their traces on cheek and dark eyelash it was the face of a handsome woman of thirty with even a suggestion of softness in the contour of the cheek and arching of her upper lip no longer rigidly drawn down in anger but relaxed by sleep on her white teeth  with the lithe soft tread that was habitual to him the young man moved about examining the condition of the little chamber and its stock of provisions and necessaries and withdrew presently to reappear as noiselessly with a tin bucket of water this done he replenished the little pile of fuel with an armful of bark and pine cones cast an approving glance about him which included the sleeper and silently departed  it was night when she awoke she was surrounded by a profound darkness except where the shaftlike opening made a nebulous mist in the corner of her wooden cavern providentially she struggled back to consciousness slowly so that the solitude and silence came upon her gradually with a growing realization of the events of the past twentyfour hours but without a shock she was alone here but safe still and every hour added to her chances of ultimate escape she remembered to have seen a candle among the articles on the shelf and she began to grope her way towards the matches suddenly she stopped what was that panting  was it her own breathing quickened with a sudden nameless terror or was there something outside her heart seemed to stop beating while she listened yes it was a panting outsidea panting now increased multiplied redoubled mixed with the sounds of rustling tearing craunching and occasionally a quick impatient snarl she crept on her hands and knees to the opening and looked out at first the ground seemed to be undulating between her and the opposite tree but a second glance showed her the black and gray bristling tossing backs of tumbling beasts of prey charging the carcass of the bear that lay at its roots or contesting for the prize with gluttonous choked breath sidelong snarls arched spines and recurved tails one of the boldest had leaped upon a buttressing root of her tree within a foot of the opening the excitement awe and terror she had undergone culminated in one wild maddened scream that seemed to pierce even the cold depths of the forest as she dropped on her face with her hands clasped over her eyes in an agony of fear  her scream was answered after a pause by a sudden volley of firebrands and sparks into the midst of the panting crowding pack a few smothered howls and snaps and a sudden dispersion of the concourse in another moment the young man with a blazing brand in either hand leaped upon the body of the bear  teresa raised her head uttered a hysterical cry slid down the tree flew wildly to his side caught convulsively at his sleeve and fell on her knees beside him  save me save me she gasped in a voice broken by terror save me from those hideous creatures no no she implored as he endeavored to lift her to her feet nolet me stay here close beside you so clutching the fringe of his leather huntingshirt and dragging herself on her knees nearer himsodont leave me for gods sake  they are gone he replied gazing down curiously at her as she wound the fringe around her hand to strengthen her hold theyre only a lot of cowardly coyotes and wolves that dare not attack anything that lives and can move  the young woman responded with a nervous shudder yes thats it she whispered in a broken voice its only the dead they want promise meswear to me if im caught or hung or shot you wont let me be left here to be torn andah my god whats that  she had thrown her arms around his knees completely pinioning him to her frantic breast something like a smile of disdain passed across his face as he answered its nothing they will not return get up  even in her terror she saw the change in his face i know i know she cried im frightenedbut i cannot bear it any longer hear me listen listenbut dont move i didnt mean to kill cursonno i swear to god no i didnt mean to kill the sheriffand i didnt i was only braggingdo you hear i lied i lieddont move i swear to god i lied ive made myself out worse than i was i have only dont leave me nowand if i dieand its not far off may beget me away from hereand from them swear it  all right said the young man with a scarcely concealed movement of irritation but get up now and go back to the cabin  no not there alone nevertheless he quietly but firmly released himself  i will stay here he replied i would have been nearer to you but i thought it better for your safety that my campfire should be further off but i can build it here and that will keep the coyotes off  let me stay with youbeside you she said imploringly  she looked so broken crushed and spiritless so unlike the woman of the morning that albeit with an ill grace he tacitly consented and turned away to bring his blankets but in the next moment she was at his side following him like a dog silent and wistful and even offering to carry his burden when he had built the fire for which she had collected the pinecones and broken branches near them he sat down folded his arms and leaned back against the tree in reserved and deliberate silence  humble and submissive she did not attempt to break in upon a reverie she could not help but feel had little kindliness to herself as the fire snapped and sparkled she pillowed her head upon a root and lay still to watch it  it rose and fell and dying away at times to a mere lurid glow and again agitated by some breath scarcely perceptible to them quickening into a roaring flame when only the embers remained a dead silence filled the wood then the first breath of morning moved the tangled canopy above and a dozen tiny sprays and needles detached from the interlocked boughs winged their soft way noiselessly to the earth a few fell upon the prostrate woman like a gentle benediction and she slept but even then the young man looking down saw that the slender fingers were still aimlessly but rigidly twisted in the leather fringe of his huntingshirt     chapter ii   it was a peculiarity of the carquinez wood that it stood apart and distinct in its gigantic individuality even where the integrity of its own singular species was not entirely preserved it admitted no inferior trees nor was there any diminishing fringe on its outskirts the sentinels that guarded the few gateways of the dim trails were as monstrous as the serried ranks drawn up in the heart of the forest consequently the red highway that skirted the eastern angle was bare and shadeless until it slipped a league off into a watered valley and refreshed itself under lesser sycamores and willows it was here the newly born city of excelsior still in its cradle had like an infant hercules strangled the serpentine north fork of the american river and turned its life current into the ditches and flumes of the excelsior mines  newest of the new houses that seemed to have accidentally formed its single straggling street was the residence of the rev winslow wynn not unfrequently known as father wynn pastor of the first baptist church the pastorage as it was cheerfully called had the glaring distinction of being built of brick and was as had been wickedly pointed out by idle scoffers the only fireproof structure in town this sarcasm was not however supposed to be particularly distasteful to father wynn who enjoyed the reputation of being hail fellow well met with the rough mining element who called them by their christian names had been known to drink at the bar of the polka saloon while engaged in the conversion of a prominent citizen and was popularly said to have no gospel starch about him certain conscious outcasts and transgressors were touched at this apparent unbending of the spiritual authority the rigid tenets of father wynns faith were lost in the supposed catholicity of his humanity a preacher that can jine a man when hes histin liquor into him without jawin about it ought to be allowed to wrestle with sinners and splash about in as much cold water as he likes was the criticism of one of his converts nevertheless it was true that father wynn was somewhat loud and intolerant in his tolerance it was true that he was a little more rough a little more frank a little more hearty a little more impulsive than his disciples it was true that often the proclamation of his extreme liberality and brotherly equality partook somewhat of an apology it is true that a few who might have been most benefited by this kind of gospel regarded him with a singular disdain it is true that his liberality was of an ornamental insinuating quality accompanied with but little sacrifice his acceptance of a collection taken up in a gambling saloon for the rebuilding of his church destroyed by fire gave him a popularity large enough it must be confessed to cover the sins of the gamblers themselves but it was not proven that he had ever organized any form of relief but it was true that local history somehow accepted him as an exponent of mining christianity without the least reference to the opinions of the christian miners themselves  the rev mr wynns liberal habits and opinions were not however shared by his only daughter a motherless young lady of eighteen nellie wynn was in the eye of excelsior an unapproachable divinity as inaccessible and cold as her father was impulsive and familiar an atmosphere of chaste and proud virginity made itself felt even in the starched integrity of her spotless skirts in her neatly gloved fingertips in her clear amber eyes in her imperious red lips in her sensitive nostrils need it be said that the youth and middle age of excelsior were madly because apparently hopelessly in love with her for the rest she had been expensively educated was profoundly ignorant in two languages with a trained misunderstanding of music and painting and a natural and faultless taste in dress  the rev mr wynn was engaged in a characteristic hearty parting with one of his latest converts upon his own doorstep with admirable al fresco effect he had just clapped him on the shoulder goodby goodby charley my boy and keep in the right path not up or down or round the gulch you knowha habut straight across lots to the shining gate he had raised his voice under the stimulus of a few admiring spectators and backed his convert playfully against the wall you see were goin in to win you bet goodby id ask you to step in and have a chat but ive got my work to do and so have you the gospel mustnt keep us from that must it charley ha ha  the convert who elsewhere was a profane expressman and had become quite imbecile under mr wynns active heartiness and brotherly horseplay before spectators managed however to feebly stammer with a blush something about miss nellie  ah nellie she too is at her taskstrimming her lampyou know the parable of the wise virgins continued father wynn hastily fearing that the convert might take the illustration literally there theregoodby keep in the right path and with a parting shove he dismissed charley and entered his own house  that wise virgin nellie had evidently finished with the lamp and was now going out to meet the bridegroom as she was fully dressed and gloved and had a pink parasol in her hand as her father entered the sittingroom his bluff heartiness seemed to fade away as he removed his soft broadbrimmed hat and glanced across the too freshlooking apartment there was a smell of mortar still in the air and a faint suggestion that at any moment green grass might appear between the interstices of the redbrick hearth the room yielding a little in the point of coldness seemed to share miss nellies fresh virginity and barring the pink parasol set her off as in a vestals cell  i supposed you wouldnt care to see brace the expressman so i got rid of him at the door said her father drawing one of the new chairs towards him slowly and sitting down carefully as if it were a hitherto untried experiment  miss nellies face took a tint of interest then he doesnt go with the coach to indian spring today  no why  i thought of going over myself to get the burnham girls to come to choirmeeting replied miss nellie carelessly and he might have been company  hed go now if he knew you were going said her father but its just as well he shouldnt be needlessly encouraged i rather think that sheriff dunn is a little jealous of him by the way the sheriff is much better i called to cheer him up today mr wynn had in fact tumultuously accelerated the sick mans pulse and he talked of you as usual in fact he said he had only two things to get well for one was to catch and hang that woman teresa who shot him the othercant you guess the other he added archly with a faint suggestion of his other manner  miss nellie coldly could not  the rev mr wynns archness vanished dont be a fool he said dryly he wants to marry you and you know it  most of the men here do responded miss nellie without the least trace of coquetry is the wedding or the hanging to take place first or together so he can officiate at both  his share in the union ditch is worth a hundred thousand dollars continued her father and if he isnt nominated for district judge this fall hes bound to go to the legislature anyway i dont think a girl with your advantages and education can afford to throw away the chance of shining in sacramento san francisco or in good time perhaps even washington  miss nellies eyes did not reflect entire disapproval of this suggestion although she replied with something of her fathers practical quality  mr dunn is not out of his bed yet and they say teresas got away to arizona so there isnt any particular hurry  perhaps not but see here nellie ive some important news for you you know your young friend of the carquinez woodsdorman the botanist eh well brace knows all about him and what do you think he is  miss nellie took upon herself a few extra degrees of cold and didnt know  an injin yes an outandout cherokee you see he calls himself dormanlow dorman thats only french for sleeping water his injin namelow dorman  you mean leau dormante said nellie  thats what i said the chief called him sleeping water when he was a boy and one of them french canadian trappers translated it into french when he brought him to california to school but hes an injin sure no wonder he prefers to live in the woods  well said nellie  well echoed her father impatiently hes an injin i tell you and you cant of course have anything to do with him he mustnt come here again  but you forget said nellie imperturbably that it was you who invited him here and were so much exercised over him you remember you introduced him to the bishop and those eastern clergymen as a magnificent specimen of a young californian you forget what an occasion you made of his coming to church on sunday and how you made him come in his buckskin shirt and walk down the street with you after service  yes yes said the rev mr wynn hurriedly  and continued nellie carelessly how you made us sing out of the same book children of our fathers fold and how you preached at him until he actually got a color  yes said her father but it wasnt known then he was an injin and they are frightfully unpopular with those southwestern men among whom we labor indeed i am quite convinced that when brace said the only good indian was a dead one his expression though extravagant perhaps really voiced the sentiments of the majority it would be only kindness to the unfortunate creature to warn him from exposing himself to their rude but conscientious antagonism  perhaps youd better tell him then in your own popular way which they all seem to understand so well responded the daughter mr wynn cast a quick glance at her but there was no trace of irony in her facenothing but a halfbored indifference as she walked toward the window  i will go with you to the coachoffice said her father who generally gave these simple paternal duties the pronounced character of a public christian example  its hardly worth while replied miss nellie ive to stop at the watsons at the foot of the hill and ask after the baby so i shall go on to the crossing and pick up the coach when it passes goodby  nevertheless as soon as nellie had departed the rev mr wynn proceeded to the coachoffice and publicly grasping the hand of yuba bill the driver commended his daughter to his care in the name of the universal brotherhood of man and the christian fraternity carried away by his heartiness he forgot his previous caution and confided to the expressman miss nellies regrets that she was not to have that gentlemans company the result was that miss nellie found the coach with its passengers awaiting her with uplifted hats and wreathed smiles at the crossing and the box seat from which an unfortunate stranger who had expensively paid for it had been summarily ejected at her service beside yuba bill who had thrown away his cigar and donned a new pair of buckskin gloves to do her honor but a more serious result to the young beauty was the effect of the rev mr wynns confidences upon the impulsive heart of jack brace the expressman it has been already intimated that it was his day off unable to summarily reassume his usual functions beside the driver without some practical reason and ashamed to go so palpably as a mere passenger he was forced to let the coach proceed without him discomfited for the moment he was not however beaten he had lost the blissful journey by her side which would have been his professional right butshe was going to indian spring could he not anticipate her there might they not meet in the most accidental manner and what might not come from that meeting away from the prying eyes of their own town mr brace did not hesitate but saddling his fleet buckskin by the time the stagecoach had passed the crossing in the highroad he had mounted the hill and was dashing along the cutoff in the same direction a full mile in advance arriving at indian spring he left his horse at a mexican posada on the confines of the settlement and from the piled debris of a tunnel excavation awaited the slow arrival of the coach on mature reflection he could give no reason why he had not boldly awaited it at the express office except a certain bashful consciousness of his own folly and a belief that it might be glaringly apparent to the bystanders when the coach arrived and he had overcome this consciousness it was too late yuba bill had discharged his passengers for indian spring and driven away miss nellie was in the settlement but where as time passed he became more desperate and bolder he walked recklessly up and down the main street glancing in at the open doors of shops and even in the windows of private dwellings it might have seemed a poor compliment to miss nellie but it was an evidence of his complete preoccupation when the sight of a female face at a window even though it was plain or perhaps painted caused his heart to bound or the glancing of a skirt in the distance quickened his feet and his pulses had jack contented himself with remaining at excelsior he might have vaguely regretted but as soon become as vaguely accustomed to miss nellies absence but it was not until his hitherto quiet and passive love took this first step of action that it fully declared itself when he had made the tour of the town a dozen times unsuccessfully he had perfectly made up his mind that marriage with nellie or the speedy death of several people including possibly himself was the only alternative he regretted he had not accompanied her he regretted he had not demanded where she was going he contemplated a course of future action that two hours ago would have filled him with bashful terror there was clearly but one thing to doto declare his passion the instant he met her and return with her to excelsior an accepted suitor or not to return at all  suddenly he was vexatiously conscious of hearing his name lazily called and looking up found that he was on the outskirts of the town and interrogated by two horsemen  got down to walk and the coach got away from you jack eh  a little ashamed of his preoccupation brace stammered something about collections he did not recognize the men but his own face name and business were familiar to everybody for fifty miles along the stageroad  well you can settle a bet for us i reckon bill dacre thar bet me five dollars and the drinks that a young gal we met at the edge of the carquinez woods dressed in a long brown duster and half muffled up in a hood was the daughter of father wynn of excelsior i did not get a fair look at her but it stands to reason that a hightoned young lady like nellie wynn dont go trapsing along the wood like a pike county tramp i took the bet may be you know if shes here or in excelsior  mr brace felt himself turning pale with eagerness and excitement but the near prospect of seeing her presently gave him back his caution and he answered truthfully that he had left her in excelsior and that in his two hours sojourn in indian spring he had not met her once but he added with a californians reverence for the sanctity of a bet i reckon youd better make it a standoff for twentyfour hours and ill find out and let you know which it is only fair to say he honestly intended to do  with a hurried nod of parting he continued in the direction of the woods when he had satisfied himself that the strangers had entered the settlement and would not follow him for further explanation he quickened his pace in half an hour he passed between two of the gigantic sentinels that guarded the entrance to a trail here he paused to collect his thoughts the woods were vast in extent the trail dim and uncertainat times apparently breaking off or intersecting another trail as faint as itself believing that miss nellie had diverged from the highway only as a momentary excursion into the shade and that she would not dare to penetrate its more sombre and unknown recesses he kept within sight of the skirting plain by degrees the sedate influence of the silent vaults seemed to depress him the ardor of the chase began to flag under the calm of their dim roof the fever of his veins began to subside his pace slackened he reasoned more deliberately it was by no means probable that the young woman in a brown duster was nellie it was not her habitual traveling dress it was not like her to walk unattended in the road there was nothing in her tastes and habits to take her into this gloomy forest allowing that she had even entered it and on this absolute question of her identity the two witnesses were divided he stopped irresolutely and cast a last long halfdespairing look around him hitherto he had given that part of the wood nearest the plain his greatest attention his glance now sought its darker recesses suddenly he became breathless was it a beam of sunlight that had pierced the groined roof above and now rested against the trunk of one of the dimmer more secluded giants no it was moving even as he gazed it slipped away glanced against another tree passed across one of the vaulted aisles and then was lost again brief as was the glimpse he was not mistakenit was the figure of a woman  in another moment he was on her track and soon had the satisfaction of seeing her reappear at a lesser distance but the continual intervention of the massive trunks made the chase by no means an easy one and as he could not keep her always in sight he was unable to follow or understand the one intelligent direction which she seemed to invariably keep nevertheless he gained upon her breathlessly and thanks to the barkstrewn floor noiselessly he was near enough to distinguish and recognize the dress she wore a pale yellow that he had admired when he first saw her it was nellie unmistakably if it were she of the brown duster she had discarded it perhaps for greater freedom he was near enough to call out now but a sudden nervous timidity overcame him his lips grew dry what should he say to her how account for his presence miss nellie one moment he gasped she darted forward andvanished  at this moment he was not more than a dozen yards from her he rushed to where she had been standing but her disappearance was perfect and complete he made a circuit of the group of trees within whose radius she had last appeared but there was neither trace of her nor a suggestion of her mode of escape he called aloud to her the vacant woods let his helpless voice die in their unresponsive depths he gazed into the air and down at the barkstrewn carpet at his feet like most of his vocation he was sparing of speech and epigrammatic after his fashion comprehending in one swift but despairing flash of intelligence the existence of some fateful power beyond his own weak endeavor he accepted its logical result with characteristic grimness threw his hat upon the ground put his hands in his pockets and said  well im dd     chapter iii   out of compliment to miss nellie wynn yuba bill on reaching indian spring had made a slight detour to enable him to ostentatiously set down his fair passenger before the door of the burnhams when it had closed on the admiring eyes of the passengers and the coach had rattled away miss nellie without any undue haste or apparent change in her usual quiet demeanor managed however to dispatch her business promptly and leaving an impression that she would call again before her return to excelsior parted from her friends and slipped away through a side street to the general furnishing store of indian spring in passing this emporium miss nellies quick eye had discovered a cheap brown linen duster hanging in its window to purchase it and put it over her delicate cambric dress albeit with a shivering sense that she looked like a badly folded brownpaper parcel did not take long as she left the shop it was with mixed emotions of chagrin and security that she noticed that her passage through the settlement no longer turned the heads of its male inhabitants she reached the outskirts of indian spring and the highroad at about the time mr brace had begun his fruitless patrol of the main street far in the distance a faint olivegreen table mountain seemed to rise abruptly from the plain it was the carquinez woods gathering her spotless skirts beneath her extemporized brown domino she set out briskly towards them  but her progress was scarcely free or exhilarating she was not accustomed to walking in a country where buggyriding was considered the only genteel youngladylike mode of progression and its regular provision the expected courtesy of mankind always fastidiously booted her lowquartered shoes were charming to the eye but hardly adapted to the dust and inequalities of the highroad it was true that she had thought of buying a coarser pair at indian spring but once face to face with their uncompromising ugliness she had faltered and fled the sun was unmistakably hot but her parasol was too well known and offered too violent a contrast to the duster for practical use once she stopped with an exclamation of annoyance hesitated and looked back in half an hour she had twice lost her shoe and her temper a pink flush took possession of her cheeks and her eyes were bright with suppressed rage dust began to form grimy circles around their orbits with catlike shivers she even felt it pervade the roots of her blond hair gradually her breath grew more rapid and hysterical her smarting eyes became humid and at last encountering two observant horsemen in the road she turned and fled until reaching the wood she began to cry  nevertheless she waited for the two horsemen to pass to satisfy herself that she was not followed then pushed on vaguely until she reached a fallen tree where with a gesture of disgust she tore off her hapless duster and flung it on the ground she then sat down sobbing but after a moment dried her eyes hurriedly and started to her feet a few paces distant erect noiseless with outstretched hand the young solitary of the carquinez woods advanced towards her his hand had almost touched hers when he stopped  what has happened he asked gravely  nothing she said turning half away and searching the ground with her eyes as if she had lost something only i must be going back now  you shall go back at once if you wish it he said flushing slightly but you have been crying why  frank as miss nellie wished to be she could not bring herself to say that her feet hurt her and the dust and heat were ruining her complexion it was therefore with a halfconfident belief that her troubles were really of a moral quality that she answered nothingnothing butbutits wrong to come here  but you did not think it was wrong when you agreed to come at our last meeting said the young man with that persistent logic which exasperates the inconsequent feminine mind it cannot be any more wrong today  but it was not so far off murmured the young girl without looking up  oh the distance makes it more improper then he said abstractedly but after a moments contemplation of her halfaverted face he asked gravely has anyone talked to you about me  ten minutes before nellie had been burning to unburthen herself of her fathers warning but now she felt she would not i wish you wouldnt call yourself low she said at last  but its my name he replied quietly  nonsense its only a stupid translation of a stupid nickname they might as well call you water at once  but you said you liked it  well so i do but dont you seeioh dear you dont understand  low did not reply but turned his head with resigned gravity towards the deeper woods grasping the barrel of his rifle with his left hand he threw his right arm across his left wrist and leaned slightly upon it with the habitual ease of a western hunterdoubly picturesque in his own lithe youthful symmetry miss nellie looked at him from under her eyelids and then half defiantly raised her head and her dark lashes gradually an almost magical change came over her features her eyes grew larger and more and more yearning until they seemed to draw and absorb in their liquid depths the figure of the young man before her her cold face broke into an ecstasy of light and color her humid lips parted in a bright welcoming smile until with an irresistible impulse she arose and throwing back her head stretched towards him two hands full of vague and trembling passion  in another moment he had seized them kissed them and as he drew her closer to his embrace felt them tighten around his neck but what name do you wish to call me he asked looking down into her eyes  miss nellie murmured something confidentially to the third button of his hunting shirt but that he replied with a smile that wouldnt be any more practical and you wouldnt want others to call me dar her fingers loosened around his neck she drew her head back and a singular expression passed over her face which to any calmer observer than a lover would have seemed however to indicate more curiosity than jealousy  who else does call you so she added earnestly how many for instance  lows reply was addressed not to her ear but her lips she did not avoid it but added and do you kiss them all like that taking him by the shoulders she held him a little way from her and gazed at him from head to foot then drawing him again to her embrace she said i dont care at least no woman has kissed you like that happy dazzled and embarrassed he was beginning to stammer the truthful protestation that rose to his lips but she stopped him no dont protest say nothing let me love youthat is all it is enough he would have caught her in his arms again but she drew back we are near the road she said quietly come you promised to show me where you camped let us make the most of our holiday in an hour i must leave the woods  but i shall accompany you dearest  no i must go as i camealone  but nellie  i tell you no she said with an almost harsh practical decision incompatible with her previous abandonment we might be seen together  well suppose we are we must be seen together eventually he remonstrated  the young girl made an involuntary gesture of impatient negation but checked herself dont let us talk of that now come while i am here under your own roof she pointed to the high interlaced boughs above themyou must be hospitable show me your home tell me isnt it a little gloomy sometimes  it never has been i never thought it would be until the moment you leave it today  she pressed his hand briefly and in a halfperfunctory way as if her vanity had accepted and dismissed the compliment take me somewhere she said inquisitively where you stay most i do not seem to see you here she added looking around her with a slight shiver it is so big and so high have you no place where you eat and rest and sleep  except in the rainy season i camp all over the placeat any spot where i may have been shooting or collecting  collecting queried nellie  yes with the herbarium you know  yes said nellie dubiously but you told me oncethe first time we ever talked together she added looking in his eyessomething about your keeping your things like a squirrel in a tree could we not go there is there not room for us to sit and talk without being browbeaten and looked down upon by these supercilious trees  its too far away said low truthfully but with a somewhat pronounced emphasis much too far for you just now and it lies on another trail that enters the wood beyond but come i will show you a spring known only to myself the wood ducks and the squirrels i discovered it the first day i saw you and gave it your name but you shall christen it yourself it will be all yours and yours alone for it is so hidden and secluded that i defy any feet but my own or whoso shall keep step with mine to find it shall that foot be yours nellie  her face beamed with a bright assent it may be difficult to track it from here he said but stand where you are a moment and dont move rustle nor agitate the air in any way the woods are still now he turned at right angles with the trail moved a few paces into the ferns and underbrush and then stopped with his finger on his lips for an instant both remained motionless then with his intent face bent forward and both arms extended he began to sink slowly upon one knee and one side inclining his body with a gentle perfectlygraduated movement until his ear almost touched the ground nellie watched his graceful figure breathlessly until like a bow unbent he stood suddenly erect again and beckoned to her without changing the direction of his face  what is it she asked eagerly  all right i have found it he continued moving forward without turning his head  but how what did you kneel for he did not reply but taking her hand in his continued to move slowly on through the underbrush as if obeying some magnetic attraction how did you find it again asked the halfawed girl her voice unconsciously falling to a whisper still silent low kept his rigid face and forward tread for twenty yards further then he stopped and released the girls halfimpatient hand how did you find it she repeated sharply  with my ears and nose replied low gravely  with your nose  yes i smelt it  still fresh with the memory of his picturesque attitude the young mans reply seemed to involve something more irritating to her feelings than even that absurd anticlimax she looked at him coldly and critically and appeared to hesitate whether to proceed is it far she asked  not more than ten minutes now as i shall go  and you wont have to smell your way again  no it is quite plain now he answered seriously the young girls sarcasm slipping harmlessly from his indian stolidity dont you smell it yourself  but miss nellies thin cold nostrils refused to take that vulgar interest  nor hear it listen  you forget i suffer the misfortune of having been brought up under a roof she replied coldly  thats true repeated low in all seriousness its not your fault but do you know i sometimes think i am peculiarly sensitive to water i feel it miles away at night though i may not see it or even know where it is i am conscious of it it is company to me when i am alone and i seem to hear it in my dreams there is no music as sweet to me as its song when you sang with me that day in church i seemed to hear it ripple in your voice it says to me more than the birds do more than the rarest plants i find it seems to live with me and for me it is my earliest recollection i know it will be my last for i shall die in its embrace do you think nellie he continued stopping short and gazing earnestly in her facedo you think that the chiefs knew this when they called me sleeping water  to miss nellies several gifts i fear the gods had not added poetry a slight knowledge of english verse of a select character unfortunately did not assist her in the interpretation of the young mans speech nor relieve her from the momentary feeling that he was at times deficient in intellect she preferred however to take a personal view of the question and expressed her sarcastic regret that she had not known before that she had been indebted to the great flume and ditch at excelsior for the pleasure of his acquaintance this pert remark occasioned some explanation which ended in the girls accepting a kiss in lieu of more logical argument nevertheless she was still conscious of an inward irritationalways distinct from her singular and perfectly material passionwhich found vent as the difficulties of their undeviating progress through the underbrush increased at last she lost her shoe again and stopped short its a pity your indian friends did not christen you wild mustard or clover she said satirically that you might have had some sympathies and longings for the open fields instead of these horrid jungles i know we will not get back in time  unfortunately low accepted this speech literally and with his remorseless gravity if my name annoys you i can get it changed by the legislature you know and i can find out what my fathers name was and take that my mother who died in giving me birth was the daughter of a chief  then your mother was really an indian said nellie and you are she stopped short  but i told you all this the day we first met said low with grave astonishment dont you remember our long talk coming from church  no said nellie coldly you didnt tell me but she was obliged to drop her eyes before the unwavering undeniable truthfulness of his  you have forgotten he said calmly but it is only right you should have your own way in disposing of a name that i have cared little for and as youre to have a share of it  yes but its getting late and if we are not going forward interrupted the girl impatiently  we are going forward said low imperturbably but i wanted to tell you as we were speaking on that subject nellie looked at her watch ive been offered the place of botanist and naturalist in professor grants survey of mount shasta and if i take itwhy when i come back darlingwell  but youre not going just yet broke in nellie with a new expression in her face  no  then we need not talk of it now she said with animation  her sudden vivacity relieved him i see whats the matter he said gently looking down at her feet these little shoes were not made to keep step with a moccasin we must try another way he stooped as if to secure the erring buskin but suddenly lifted her like a child to his shoulder there he continued placing her arm round his neck you are clear of the ferns and brambles now and we can go on are you comfortable he looked up read her answer in her burning eyes and the warm lips pressed to his forehead at the roots of his straight dark hair and again moved onward as in a mesmeric dream but he did not swerve from his direct course and with a final dash through the undergrowth parted the leafy curtain before the spring  at first the young girl was dazzled by the strong light that came from a rent in the interwoven arches of the wood the breach had been caused by the huge bulk of one of the great giants that had half fallen and was lying at a steep angle against one of its mightiest brethren having borne down a lesser tree in the arc of its downward path two of the roots as large as younger trees tossed their blackened and bare limbs high in the air the springthe insignificant cause of this vast disruptiongurgled flashed and sparkled at the base the limpid baby fingers that had laid bare the foundations of that fallen column played with the still clinging rootlets laved the fractured and twisted limbs and widening filled with sleeping water the graves from which they had been torn  it had been going on for years down there said low pointing to a cavity from which the fresh water now slowly welled but it had been quickened by the rising of the subterranean springs and rivers which always occurs at a certain stage of the dry season i remember that on that very nightfor it happened a little after midnight when all sounds are more audiblei was troubled and oppressed in my sleep by what you would call a nightmare a feeling as if i was kept down by bonds and pinions that i longed to break and then i heard a crash in this direction and the first streak of morning brought me the sound and scent of water six months afterwards i chanced to find my way here as i told you and gave it your name i did not dream that i should ever stand beside it with you and have you christen it yourself  he unloosened the cup from his flask and filling it at the spring handed it to her but the young girl leant over the pool and pouring the water idly back said id rather put my feet in it maynt i  i dont understand you he said wonderingly  my feet are so hot and dusty the water looks deliciously cool may i  certainly  he turned away as nellie with apparent unconsciousness seated herself on the bank and removed her shoes and stockings when she had dabbled her feet a few moments in the pool she said over her shoulder  we can talk just as well cant we  certainly  well then why didnt you come to church more often and why didnt you think of telling father that you were convicted of sin and wanted to be baptized  i dont know hesitated the young man  well you lost the chance of having father convert you baptize you and take you into full church fellowship  i never thought he began  you never thought arent you a christian  i suppose so  he supposes so have you no convictionsno profession  but nellie i never thought that you  never thought that iwhat do you think that i could ever be anything to a man who did not believe in justification by faith or in the covenant of church fellowship do you think father would let me  in his eagerness to defend himself he stepped to her side but seeing her little feet shining through the dark water like outcroppings of delicately veined quartz he stopped embarrassed miss nellie however leaped to one foot and shaking the other over the pool put her hand on his shoulder to steady herself you havent got a towelor she said dubiously looking at her small handkerchief anything to dry them on  but low did not as she perhaps expected offer his own handkerchief  if you take a bath after our fashion he said gravely you must learn to dry yourself after our fashion  lifting her again lightly in his arms he carried her a few steps to the sunny opening and bade her bury her feet in the dried mosses and baked withered grasses that were bleaching in a hollow the young girl uttered a cry of childish delight as the soft ciliated fibres touched her sensitive skin  it is healing too continued low a moccasin filled with it after a day on the trail makes you all right again  but miss nellie seemed to be thinking of something else  is that the way the squaws bathe and dry themselves  i dont know you forget i was a boy when i left them  and youre sure you never knew any  none  the young girl seemed to derive some satisfaction in moving her feet up and down for several minutes among the grasses in the hollow then after a pause said you are quite certain i am the first woman that ever touched this spring  not only the first woman but the first human being except myself  how nice  they had taken each others hands seated side by side they leaned against a curving elastic root that half supported half encompassed them the girls capricious fitful manner succumbed as before to the near contact of her companion looking into her eyes low fell into a sweet selfish lovers monologue descriptive of his past and present feelings towards her which she accepted with a heightened color a slight exchange of sentiment and a strange curiosity the sun had painted their halfembraced silhouettes against the slanting treetrunk and began to decline unnoticed the ripple of the water mingling with their whispers came as one sound to the listening ear even their eloquent silences were as deep and i wot perhaps as dangerous as the darkened pool that filled so noiselessly a dozen yards away so quiet were they that the tremor of invading wings once or twice shook the silence or the quick scamper of frightened feet rustled the dead grass but in the midst of a prolonged stillness the young man sprang up so suddenly that nellie was still half clinging to his neck as he stood erect hush he whispered some one is near  he disengaged her anxious hands gently leaped upon the slanting treetrunk and running halfway up its incline with the agility of a squirrel stretched himself at full length upon it and listened  to the impatient inexplicably startled girl it seemed an age before he rejoined her  you are safe he said he is going by the western trail towards indian spring  who is he she asked biting her lips with a poorly restrained gesture of mortification and disappointment  some stranger replied low  as long as he wasnt coming here why did you give me such a fright she said pettishly are you nervous because a single wayfarer happens to stray here  it was no wayfarer for he tried to keep near the trail said low he was a stranger to the wood for he lost his way every now and then he was seeking or expecting some one for he stopped frequently and waited or listened he had not walked far for he wore spurs that tinkled and caught in the brush and yet he had not ridden here for no horses hoofs passed the road since we have been here he must have come from indian spring  and you heard all that when you listened just now asked nellie half disdainfully  impervious to her incredulity low turned his calm eyes on her face certainly ill bet my life on what i say tell me do you know anybody in indian spring who would likely spy upon you  the young girl was conscious of a certain illdefined uneasiness but answered no  then it was not you he was seeking said low thoughtfully miss nellie had not time to notice the emphasis for he added you must go at once and lest you have been followed i will show you another way back to indian spring it is longer and you must hasten take your shoes and stockings with you until we are out of the bush  he raised her again in his arms and strode once more out through the covert into the dim aisles of the wood they spoke but little she could not help feeling that some other discordant element affecting him more strongly than it did her had come between them and was half perplexed and half frightened at the end of ten minutes he seated her upon a fallen branch and telling her he would return by the time she had resumed her shoes and stockings glided from her like a shadow she would have uttered an indignant protest at being left alone but he was gone ere she could detain him for a moment she thought she hated him but when she had mechanically shod herself once more not without nervous shivers at every falling needle he was at her side  do you know anyone who wears a frieze coat like that he asked handing her a few torn shreds of wool affixed to a splinter of bark  miss nellie instantly recognized the material of a certain sporting coat worn by mr jack brace on festive occasions but a strange yet infallible instinct that was part of her nature made her instantly disclaim all knowledge of it  no she said  not anyone who scents himself with some doctors stuff like cologne continued low with the disgust of keen olfactory sensibilities  again miss nellie recognized the perfume with which the gallant expressman was wont to make redolent her little parlor but again she avowed no knowledge of its possessor well returned low with some disappointment such a man has been here be on your guard let us go at once  she required no urging to hasten her steps but hurried breathlessly at his side he had taken a new trail by which they left the wood at right angles with the highway two miles away following an almost effaced mule track along a slight depression of the plain deep enough however to hide them from view he accompanied her until rising to the level again she saw they were beginning to approach the highway and the distant roofs of indian spring nobody meeting you now he whispered would suspect where you had been good night until next weekremember  they pressed each others hands and standing on the slight ridge outlined against the paling sky in full view of the highway parting carelessly as if they had been chance met travelers but nellie could not restrain a parting backward glance as she left the ridge low had descended to the deserted trail and was running swiftly in the direction of the carquinez woods     chapter iv   teresa awoke with a start it was day already but how far advanced the even unchanging soft twilight of the woods gave no indication her companion had vanished and to her bewildered senses so had the campfire even to its embers and ashes was she awake or had she wandered away unconsciously in the night one glance at the tree above her dissipated the fancy there was the opening of her quaint retreat and the hanging strips of bark and at the foot of the opposite tree lay the carcass of the bear it had been skinned and as teresa thought with an inward shiver already looked half its former size  not yet accustomed to the fact that a few steps in either direction around the circumference of those great trunks produced the sudden appearance or disappearance of any figure teresa uttered a slight scream as her young companion unexpectedly stepped to her side you see a change here he said the stampedout ashes of the campfire lie under the brush and he pointed to some cleverly scattered boughs and strips of bark which completely effaced the traces of last nights bivouac we cant afford to call the attention of any packer or hunter who might straggle this way to this particular spot and this particular tree the more naturally he added as they always prefer to camp over an old fire accepting this explanation meekly as partly a reproach for her caprice of the previous night teresa hung her head  im very sorry she said but wouldnt that pointing to the carcass of the bear have made them curious  but lows logic was relentless  by this time there would have been little left to excite curiosity if you had been willing to leave those beasts to their work  im very sorry repeated the woman her lips quivering  they are the scavengers of the wood he continued in a lighter tone if you stay here you must try to use them to keep your house clean  teresa smiled nervously  i mean that they shall finish their work tonight he added and i shall build another campfire for us a mile from here until they do  but teresa caught his sleeve  no she said hurriedly dont please for me you must not take the trouble nor the risk hear me do please i can bear it i will bear ittonight i would have borne it last night but it was so strangeandshe passed her hands over her foreheadi think i must have been half mad but i am not so foolish now  she seemed so broken and despondent that he replied reassuringly perhaps it would be better that i should find another hidingplace for you until i can dispose of that carcass so that it will not draw dogs after the wolves and men after them besides your friend the sheriff will probably remember the bear when he remembers anything and try to get on its track again  hes a conceited fool broke in teresa in a high voice with a slight return of her old fury or hed have guessed where that shot came from and she added in a lower tone looking down at her limp and nerveless fingers he wouldnt have let a poor weak nervous wretch like me get away  but his deputy may put two and two together and connect your escape with it  teresas eyes flashed it would be like the dog just to save his pride to swear it was an ambush of my friends and that he was overpowered by numbers oh yes i see it all she almost screamed lashing herself into a rage at the bare contemplation of this diminution of her glory thats the dirty lie he tells everywhere and is telling now  she stamped her feet and glanced savagely around as if at any risk to proclaim the falsehood low turned his impassive truthful face towards her  sheriff dunn he began gravely is a politician and a fool when he takes to the trail as a hunter of man or beast but he is not a coward nor a liar your chances would be better if he wereif he laid your escape to an ambush of your friends than if his pride held you alone responsible  if hes such a good man why do you hesitate she replied bitterly why dont you give me up at once and do a service to one of your friends  i do not even know him returned low opening his clear eyes upon her ive promised to hide you here and i shall hide you as well from him as from anybody  teresa did not reply but suddenly dropping down upon the ground buried her face in her hands and began to sob convulsively low turned impassively away and putting aside the bark curtain climbed into the hollow tree in a few moments he reappeared laden with provisions and a few simple cooking utensils and touched her lightly on the shoulder she looked up timidly the paroxysm had passed but her lashes yet glittered  come he said come and get some breakfast i find you have eaten nothing since you have been heretwentyfour hours  i didnt know it she said with a faint smile then seeing his burden and possessed by a new and strange desire for some menial employment she said hurriedly let me carry somethingdo please and even tried to disencumber him  half annoyed low at last yielded and handing his rifle said there then take that but be carefulits loaded  a cruel blush burnt the womans face to the roots of her hair as she took the weapon hesitatingly in her hand  no she stammered hurriedly lifting her shamesuffused eyes to his no no  he turned away with an impatience which showed her how completely gratuitous had been her agitation and its significance and said well then give it back if you are afraid of it but she as suddenly declined to return it and shouldering it deftly took her place by his side silently they moved from the hollow tree together  during their walk she did not attempt to invade his taciturnity nevertheless she was as keenly alive and watchful of his every movement and gesture as if she had hung enchanted on his lips the unerring way with which he pursued a viewless undeviating path through those trackless woods his quick reconnaissance of certain trees or openings his mute inspection of some almost imperceptible footprint of bird or beast his critical examination of certain plants which he plucked and deposited in his deerskin haversack were not lost on the quickwitted woman as they gradually changed the clear unencumbered aisles of the central woods for a more tangled undergrowth teresa felt that subtle admiration which culminates in imitation and simulating perfectly the step tread and easy swing of her companion followed so accurately his lead that she won a gratified exclamation from him when their goal was reacheda broken blackened shaft splintered by longforgotten lightning in the centre of a tangled carpet of woodclover  i dont wonder you distanced the deputy he said cheerfully throwing down his burden if you can take the huntingpath like that in a few days if you stay here i can venture to trust you alone for a little pasear when you are tired of the tree  teresa looked pleased but busied herself with arrangements for the breakfast while he gathered the fuel for the roaring fire which soon blazed beside the shattered tree  teresas breakfast was a success it was a revelation to the young nomad whose ascetic habits and simple tastes were usually content with the most primitive forms of frontier cookery it was at least a surprise to him to know that without extra trouble kneaded flour water and saleratus need not be essentially heavy that coffee need not be boiled with sugar to the consistency of syrup that even that rarest delicacy small shreds of venison covered with ashes and broiled upon the end of a ramrod boldly thrust into the flames would be better and even more expeditiously cooked upon burning coals moved in his practical nature he was surprised to find this curious creature of disorganized nerves and useless impulses informed with an intelligence that did not preclude the welfare of humanity or the existence of a soul he respected her for some minutes until in the midst of a culinary triumph a big tear dropped and spluttered in the saucepan but he forgave the irrelevancy by taking no notice of it and by doing full justice to that particular dish  nevertheless he asked several questions based upon these recently discovered qualities it appeared that in the old days of her wanderings with the circus troupe she had often been forced to undertake this nomadic housekeeping but she despised it had never done it since and always had refused to do it for himthe personal pronoun referring as low understood to her lover curson not caring to revive these memories further low briefly concluded i dont know what you were or what you may be but from what i see of you youve got all the sabe of a frontiermans wife  she stopped and looked at him and then with an impulse of imprudence that only half concealed a more serious vanity asked do you think i might have made a good squaw  i dont know he replied quietly i never saw enough of them to know  teresa confident from his clear eyes that he spoke the truth but having nothing ready to follow this calm disposal of her curiosity relapsed into silence  the meal finished teresa washed their scant table equipage in a little spring near the campfire where catching sight of her disordered dress and collar she rapidly threw her shawl after the national fashion over her shoulder and pinned it quickly low cached the remaining provisions and the few cooking utensils under the dead embers and ashes obliterating all superficial indication of their campfire as deftly and artistically as he had before  there isnt the ghost of a chance he said in explanation that anybody but you or i will set foot here before we come back to supper but its well to be on guard ill take you back to the cabin now though i bet you could find your way there as well as i can  on their way back teresa ran ahead of her companion and plucking a few tiny leaves from a hidden oasis in the barkstrewn trail brought them to him  thats the kind youre looking for isnt it she said half timidly  it is responded low in gratified surprise but how did you know it youre not a botanist are you  i reckon not said teresa but you picked some when we came and i noticed what they were  here was indeed another revelation low stopped and gazed at her with such frank open utterly unabashed curiosity that her black eyes fell before him  and do you think he asked with logical deliberation that you could find any plant from another i should give you  yes  or from a drawing of it  yes perhaps even if you described it to me  a halfconfidential halffraternal silence followed  i tell you what ive got a book  i know it interrupted teresa full of these things  yes do you think you could  of course i could broke in teresa again  but you dont know what i mean said the imperturbable low  certainly i do why find em and preserve all the different ones for you to write underthats it isnt it  low nodded his head gratified but not entirely convinced that she had fully estimated the magnitude of the endeavor  i suppose said teresa in the feminine postscriptum voice which it would seem entered even the philosophical calm of the aisles they were treadingi suppose that she places great value on them  low had indeed heard science personified before nor was it at all impossible that the singular woman walking by his side had also he said yes but added in mental reference to the linnean society of san francisco that they were rather particular about the rarer kinds  content as teresa had been to believe in lows tender relations with some favored one of her sex this frank confession of a plural devotion staggered her  they she repeated  yes he continued calmly the botanical society i correspond with are more particular than the government survey  then you are doing this for a society demanded teresa with a stare  certainly im making a collection and classification of specimens i intendbut what are you looking at  teresa had suddenly turned away putting his hand lightly on her shoulder the young man brought her face to face him again  she was laughing  i thought all the while it was for a girl she said and but here the mere effort of speech sent her off into an audible and genuine outburst of laughter it was the first time he had seen her even smile other than bitterly characteristically unconscious of any humor in her error he remained unembarrassed but he could not help noticing a change in the expression of her face her voice and even her intonation it seemed as if that fit of laughter had loosed the last ties that bound her to a selfimposed character had swept away the last barrier between her and her healthier nature had dispossessed a painful unreality and relieved the morbid tension of a purely nervous attitude the change in her utterance and the resumption of her softer spanish accent seemed to have come with her confidences and low took leave of her before their sylvan cabin with a comrades heartiness and a complete forgetfulness that her voice had ever irritated him  when he returned that afternoon he was startled to find the cabin empty but instead of bearing any appearance of disturbance or hurried flight the rude interior seemed to have magically assumed a decorous order and cleanliness unknown before fresh bark hid the inequalities of the floor the skins and blankets were folded in the corners the rude shelves were carefully arranged even a few tall ferns and bright but quickly fading flowers were disposed around the blackened chimney she had evidently availed herself of the change of clothing he had brought her for her late garments were hanging from the hastilydevised wooden pegs driven in the wall the young man gazed around him with mixed feelings of gratification and uneasiness his presence had been dispossessed in a single hour his ten years of lonely habitation had left no trace that this woman had not effaced with a deft move of her hand more than that it looked as if she had always occupied it and it was with a singular conviction that even when she should occupy it no longer it would only revert to him as her dwelling that he dropped the bark shutters athwart the opening and left it to follow her  to his quick ear fine eye and abnormal senses this was easy enough she had gone in the direction of this mornings camp once or twice he paused with a halfgesture of recognition and a characteristic good at the place where she had stopped but was surprised to find that her main course had been as direct as his own deviating from this direct line with indian precaution he first made a circuit of the camp and approached the shattered trunk from the opposite direction he consequently came upon teresa unawares but the momentary astonishment and embarrassment were his alone  he scarcely recognized her she was wearing the garments he had brought her the day beforea certain discarded gown of miss nellie wynn which he had hurriedly begged from her under the pretext of clothing the wife of a distressed overland emigrant then on the way to the mines although he had satisfied his conscience with the intention of confessing the pious fraud to her when teresa was gone and safe from pursuit it was not without a sense of remorse that he witnessed the sacrilegious transformation the two women were nearly the same height and size and although teresas maturer figure accented the outlines more strongly it was still becoming enough to increase his irritation  of this becomingness she was doubtless unaware at the moment that he surprised her she was conscious of having a change and this had emboldened her to do her hair and otherwise compose herself after their greeting she was the first to allude to the dress regretting that it was not more of a rough disguise and that as she must now discard the national habit of wearing her shawl manta fashion over her head she wanted a hat but you must not she said borrow any more dresses for me from your young woman buy them for me at some shop they left me enough money for that low gently put aside the few pieces of gold she had drawn from her pocket and briefly reminded her of the suspicion such a purchase by him would produce thats so she said with a laugh caramba what a mule im becoming ah wait a moment i have it buy me a common felt hata mans hatas if for yourself as a change to that animal pointing to the foxtailed cap he wore summer and winter and ill show you a trick i havent run a theatrical wardrobe for nothing nor had she for the hat thus procured a few days later became by the aid of a silk handkerchief and a bluejays feather a fascinating pork pie  whatever cause of annoyance to low still lingered in teresas dress it was soon forgotten in a palpable evidence of teresas value as a botanical assistant it appeared that during the afternoon she had not only duplicated his specimens but had discoverd one or two rare plants as yet unclassified in the flora of the carquinez woods he was delighted and in turn over the campfire yielded up some details of his present life and some of his earlier recollections  you dont remember anything of your father she asked did he ever try to seek you out  no why should he replied the imperturbable low he was not a cherokee  no he was a beast responded teresa promptly and your motherdo you remember her  no i think she died  you think she died dont you know  no  then youre another said teresa notwithstanding this frankness they shook hands for the night teresa nestling like a rabbit in a hollow by the side of the campfire low with his feet towards it indianwise and his head and shoulders pillowed on his haversack only half distinguishable in the darkness beyond  with such trivial details three uneventful days slipped by their retreat was undisturbed nor could low detect by the least evidence to his acute perceptive faculties that any intruding feet had since crossed the belt of shade the echoes of passing events at indian spring had recorded the escape of teresa as occurring at a remote and purely imaginative distance and her probable direction the county of yolo  can you remember he one day asked her what time it was when you cut the riata and got away  teresa pressed her hands upon her eyes and temples  about three i reckon  and you were here at seven you could have covered some ground in four hours  perhapsi dont know she said her voice taking up its old quality again dont ask mei ran all the way  her face was quite pale as she removed her hands from her eyes and her breath came as quickly as if she had just finished that race for life  then you think i am safe here she added after a pause  perfectlyuntil they find you are not in yolo then theyll look here and thats the time for you to go there teresa smiled timidly  it will take them some time to search yolounless she added youre tired of me here the charming non sequitur did not however seem to strike the young man ive got time yet to find a few more plants for you she suggested  oh certainly  and give you a few more lessons in cooking  perhaps  the conscientious and literal low was beginning to doubt if she were really practical how otherwise could she trifle with such a situation  it must be confessed that that day and the next she did trifle with it she gave herself up to a grave and delicious languor that seemed to flow from shadow and silence and permeate her entire being she passed hours in a thoughtful repose of mind and spirit that seemed to fall like balm from those steadfast guardians and distill their gentle ether in her soul or breathed into her listening ear immunity from the forgotten past and security for the present if there was no dream of the future in this calm even recurrence of placid existence so much the better the simple details of each succeeding day the quaint housekeeping the brief companionship and coming and going of her young hosthimself at best a crystallized personification of the sedate and hospitable woodssatisfied her feeble cravings she no longer regretted the inferior position that her fears had obliged her to take the first night she came she began to look up to this young manso much younger than herselfwithout knowing what it meant it was not until she found that this attitude did not detract from his picturesqueness that she discovered herself seeking for reasons to degrade him from this seductive eminence  a week had elapsed with little change on two days he had been absent all day returning only in time to sup in the hollow tree which thanks to the final removal of the dead bear from its vicinity was now considered a safer retreat than the exposed campfire on the first of these occasions she received him with some preoccupation paying but little heed to the scant gossip he brought from indian spring and retiring early under the plea of fatigue that he might seek his own distant campfire which thanks to her stronger nerves and regained courage she no longer required so near on the second occasion he found her writing a letter more or less blotted with her tears when it was finished she begged him to post it at indian spring where in two days an answer would be returned under cover to him  i hope you will be satisfied then she added  satisfied with what queried the young man  youll see she replied giving him her cold hand goodnight  but cant you tell me now he remonstrated retaining her hand  wait two days longerit isnt much was all she vouchsafed to answer  the two days passed their former confidence and good fellowship were fully restored when the morning came on which he was to bring the answer from the postoffice at indian spring he had talked again of his future and had recorded his ambition to procure the appointment of naturalist to a government surveying expedition she had even jocularly proposed to dress herself in mans attire and enlist as his assistant  but you will be safe with your friends i hope by that time responded low  safe with my friends she repeated in a lower voice safe with my friendsyes an awkward silence followed teresa broke it gayly but your girl your sweetheart my benefactorwill she let you go  i havent told her yet said low gravely but i dont see why she should object  object indeed interrupted teresa in a high voice and a sudden and utterly gratuitous indignation how should she id like to see her do it  she accompanied him some distance to the intersection of the trail where they parted in good spirits on the dusty plain without a gale was blowing that rocked the high treetops above her but tempered and subdued entered the low aisles with a fluttering breath of morning and a sound like the cooing of doves never had the wood before shown so sweet a sense of security from the turmoil and tempest of the world beyond never before had an intrusion from the outer lifeeven in the shape of a letterseemed so wicked a desecration tempted by the solicitation of air and shade she lingered with lows herbarium slung on her shoulder  a strange sensation like a shiver suddenly passed across her nerves and left them in a state of rigid tension with every sense morbidly acute with every faculty strained to its utmost the subtle instincts of lows woodcraft transformed and possessed her she knew it now a new element was in the wooda strange beinganother lifeanother man approaching she did not even raise her head to look about her but darted with the precision and fleetness of an arrow in the direction of her tree but her feet were arrested her limbs paralzyed her very existence suspended by the sound of a voice  teresa  it was a voice that had rung in her ears for the last two years in all phases of intensity passion tenderness and anger a voice upon whose modulations rude and unmusical though they were her heart and soul had hung in transport or anguish but it was a chime that had rung its last peal to her senses as she entered the carquinez woods and for the last week had been as dead to her as a voice from the grave it was the voice of her loverdick curson     chapter v   the wind was blowing towards the stranger so that he was nearly upon her when teresa first took the alarm he was a man over six feet in height strongly built with a slight tendency to a roundness of bulk which suggested reserved rather than impeded energy his thick beard and mustache were closely cropped around a small and handsome mouth that lisped except when he was excited but always kept fellowship with his blue eyes in a perpetual smile of halfcynical goodhumor his dress was superior to that of the locality his general expression that of a man of the world albeit a world of san francisco sacramento and murderers bar he advanced towards her with a laugh and an outstretched hand  you here she gasped drawing back  apparently neither surprised nor mortified at this reception he answered frankly yeth you didnt expect me i know but doloreth showed me the letter you wrote her andwellhere i am ready to help you with two men and a thpare horthe waiting outside the woodth on the blind trail  youyouhere she only repeated  curson shrugged his shoulders yeth of courth you never expected to thee me again and leatht of all here ill admit that ill thay i wouldnt if id been in your plathe ill go further and thay you didnt want to thee me againanywhere but it all cometh to the thame thing here i am i read the letter you wrote doloreth i read how you were hiding here under dunnth very nothe with his whole pothe out cavorting round and barkin up the wrong tree i made up my mind to come down here with a few nathty friends of mine and cut you out under dunnth nothe and run you over into yubathatth all  how dared she show you my letteryou of all men how dared she ask your help continued teresa fiercely  but she didnt athk my help he responded coolly dd if i dont think she jutht calculated id be glad to know you were being hunted down and thtarving that i might put dunn on your track  you lie said teresa furiously she was my friend a better friend than those who professedmore she added with a contemptuous drawing away of her skirt as if she feared cursons contamination  all right thettle that with her when you go back continued curson philosophically we can talk of that on the way the thing now ith to get up and get out of thethe woods come  teresas only reply was a gesture of scorn  i know all that continued curson half soothingly but theyre waiting  let them wait i shall not go  what will you do  stay heretill the wolves eat me  teresa listen d it allteresatita see here he said with sudden energy i swear to god its all right im willing to let bygones be bygones and take a new deal you shall come back as if nothing had happened and take your old place as before i dont mind doing the square thing all round if thats what you mean if thats all that stands in the way why look upon the thing as settled there tita old girl come  careless or oblivious of her stony silence and starting eyes he attempted to take her hand but she disengaged herself with a quick movement drew back and suddenly crouched like a wild animal about to spring curson folded his arms as she leaped to her feet the little dagger she had drawn from her garter flashed menacingly in the air but she stopped  the man before her remained erect impassive and silent the great trees around and beyond her remained erect impassive and silent there was no sound in the dim aisles but the quick panting of her mad passion no movement in the calm motionless shadow but the trembling of her uplifted steel her arm bent and slowly sank her fingers relaxed the knife fell from her hand  thatth quite enough for a thow he said with a return to his former cynical ease and a perceptible tone of relief in his voice itth the thame old theretha well then if you wont go with me go without me take the led horthe and cut away dick athley and petereth will follow you over the county line if you want thome money there it ith he took a buckskin purse from his pocket if you wont take it from mehe hesitated as she made no replyathleyth flush and ready to lend you thome  she had not seemed to hear him but had stooped in some embarrassment picked up the knife and hastily hid it then with averted face and nervous fingers was beginning to tear strips of loose bark from the nearest trunk  well what do you thay  i dont want any money and i shall stay here she hesitated looked around her and then added with an effort i suppose you meant well be it so let bygones be bygones you said just now its the same old teresa so she is and seeing shes the same shes better here than anywhere else  there was enough bitterness in her tone to call for cursons halfperfunctory sympathy  that be dd he responded quickly jutht thay youll come tita and  she stopped his halfspoken sentence with a negative gesture you dont understand i shall stay here  but even if they dont theek you here you cant live here forever the friend that you wrote about who wath tho good to you you know cant keep you here alwayth and are you thure you can alwayth trutht her  it isnt a woman its a man she stopped short and colored to the line of her forehead who said it was a woman she continued fiercely as if to cover her confusion with a burst of gratuitous anger is that another of your lies  cursons lips which for a moment had completely lost their smile were now drawn together in a prolonged whistle he gazed curiously at her gown at her hat at the bow of bright ribbon that tied her black hair and said ah  a poor man who has kept my secret she went on hurriedlya man as friendless and lonely as myself yes disregarding cursons cynical smile a man who has shared everything  naturally suggested curson  and turned himself out of his only shelter to give me a roof and covering she continued mechanically struggling with the new and horrible fancy that his words awakened  and thlept every night at indian thpring to save your reputation said curson of courthe  teresa turned very white curson was prepared for an outburst of furyperhaps even another attack but the crushed and beaten woman only gazed at him with frightened and imploring eyes for gods sake dick dont say that  the amiable cynic was staggered his goodhumor and a certain chivalrous instinct he could not repress got the better of him he shrugged his shoulders what i thay and what you do teretha neednt make us quarrel ive no claim on youi know it only a vivid sense of the ridiculous powerful in men of his stamp completed her victoryonly dont thay anything about my coming down here to cut you out from thethethe sheriff he gave utterance to a short but unaffected laugh made a slight grimace and turned to go  teresa did not join in his mirth awkward as it would have been if he had taken a severer view of the subject she was mortified even amidst her fears and embarrassment at his levity just as she had become convinced that his jealousy had made her overconscious his apparent goodhumored indifference gave that overconsciousness a guilty significance yet this was lost in her sudden alarm as her companion looking up uttered an exclamation and placed his hand upon his revolver with a sinking conviction that the climax had come teresa turned her eyes from the dim aisles beyond low was approaching the catastrophe seemed complete  she had barely time to utter an imploring whisper in the name of god not a word to him but a change had already come over her companion it was no longer a parley with a foolish woman he had to deal with a man like himself as lows dark face and picturesque figure came nearer mr cursons proposed method of dealing with him was made audible  ith it a mulatto or a thircuth or both he asked with affected anxiety  lows indian phlegm was impervious to such assault he turned to teresa without apparently noticing her companion i turned back he said quietly as soon as i knew there were strangers here i thought you might need me she noticed for the first time that in addition to his rifle he carried a revolver and hunting knife in his belt  yeth returned curson with an ineffectual attempt to imitate lows phlegm but ath i didnt happen to be a sthranger to this lady perhaps it wathnt nethethary particularly ath i had two friends  waiting at the edge of the wood with a led horse interrupted low without addressing him but apparently continuing his explanation to teresa but she turned to low with feverish anxiety  thats sohe is an old friend she gave a quick imploring glance at cursonan old friend who came to help me awayhe is very kind she stammered turning alternately from the one to the other but i told him there was no hurryat least todaythat youwerevery goodtoo and would hide me a little longer until your planyou know your plan she added with a look of beseeching significance to lowcould be tried and then with a helpless conviction that her excuses motives and emotions were equally and perfectly transparent to both men she stopped in a tremble  perhapth it th jutht ath well then that the gentleman came thtraight here and didnt tackle my two friendth when he pathed them observed curson half sarcastically  i have not passed your friends nor have i been near them said low looking at him for the first time with the same exasperating calm or perhaps i should not be here or they there i knew that one man entered the wood a few moments ago and that two men and four horses remained outside  thats true said teresa to curson excitedlythats true he knows all he can see without looking hear without listening hehe she stammered colored and stopped  the two men had faced each other curson after his first goodnatured impulse had retained no wish to regain teresa whom he felt he no longer loved and yet who for that very reason perhaps had awakened his chivalrous instincts low equally on his side was altogether unconscious of any feeling which might grow into a passion and prevent him from letting her go with another if for her own safety they were both men of a certain taste and refinement yet in spite of all this some vague instinct of the baser male animal remained with them and they were moved to a mutually aggressive attitude in the presence of the female  one word more and the opening chapter of a sylvan iliad might have begun but this modern helen saw it coming and arrested it with an inspiration of feminine genius without being observed she disengaged her knife from her bosom and let it fall as if by accident it struck the ground with the point of its keen blade bounded and rolled between them the two men started and looked at each other with a foolish air curson laughed  i reckon she can take care of herthelf he said extending his hand to low im off but if im wanted shell know where to find me low took the proffered hand but neither of the two men looked at teresa the reserve of antagonism once broken a few words of caution advice and encouragement passed between them in apparent obliviousness of her presence or her personal responsibility as curson at last nodded a farewell to her low insisted upon accompanying him as far as the horses and in another moment she was again alone  she had saved a quarrel between them at the sacrifice of herself for her vanity was still keen enough to feel that this exhibition of her old weakness had degraded her in their eyes and worse had lost the respect her late restraint had won from low they had treated her like a child or a crazy woman perhaps even now were exchanging criticisms upon herperhaps pitying her yet she had prevented a quarrel a fight possibly the death of either one or the other of these men who despised her for none better knew than she the trivial beginning and desperate end of these encounters would theywould low ever realize it and forgive her her small dark hands went up to her eyes and she sank upon the ground she looked through tearveiled lashes upon the mute and giant witnesses of her deceit and passion and tried to draw from their immovable calm strength and consolation as before but even they seemed to stand apart reserved and forbidding  when low returned she hoped to gather from his eyes and manner what had passed between him and her former lover but beyond a mere gentle abstraction at times he retained his usual calm she was at last forced to allude to it herself with simulated recklessness  i suppose i didnt get a very good character from my last place she said with a laugh  i dont understand you he replied in evident sincerity  she bit her lip and was silent but as they were returning home she said gently i hope you were not angry with me for the lie i told when i spoke of your plan i could not give the real reason for not returning withwiththat man but its not all a lie i have a planif you havent when you are ready to go to sacramento to take your place dress me as an indian boy paint my face and let me go with you you can leave methereyou know  its not a bad idea he responded gravely we will see  on the next day and the next the rencontre seemed to be forgotten the herbarium was already filled with rare specimens teresa had even overcome her feminine repugnance to bugs and creeping things so far as to assist in his entomological collection he had drawn from a sacred cache in the hollow of a tree the few worn textbooks from which he had studied  they seem very precious she said with a smile  very he replied gravely there was one with plates that the ants ate up and it will be six months before i can afford to buy another  teresa glanced hurriedly over his wellworn buckskin suit at his calico shirt with its pattern almost obliterated by countless washings and became thoughtful  i suppose you couldnt buy one at indian spring she said innocently  for once low was startled out of his phlegm indian spring he ejaculated perhaps not even in san francisco these came from the states  how did you get them persisted teresa  i bought them for skins i got over the ridge  i didnt mean thatbut no matter then you mean to sell that bearskin dont you she added  low had in fact already sold it the proceeds having been invested in a gold ring for miss nellie which she scrupulously did not wear except in his presence in his singular truthfulness he would have frankly confessed it to teresa but the secret was not his own he contented himself with saying that he had disposed of it at indian spring  teresa started and communicated unconsciously some of her nervousness to her companion they gazed in each others eyes with a troubled expression  do you think it was wise to sell that particular skin which might be identified she asked timidly  low knitted his arched brows but felt a strange sense of relief perhaps not he said carelessly but its too late now to mend matters  that afternoon she wrote several letters and tore them up one however she retained and handed it to low to post at indian spring whither he was going she called his attention to the superscription being the same as the previous letter and added with affected gayety but if the answer isnt as prompt perhaps it will be pleasanter than the last her quick feminine eye noticed a little excitement in his manner and a more studious attention to his dress only a few days before she would not have allowed this to pass without some mischievous allusion to his mysterious sweetheart it troubled her greatly now to find that she could not bring herself to this household pleasantry and that her lip trembled and her eye grew moist as he parted from her  the afternoon passed slowly he had said he might not return to supper until late nevertheless a strange restlessness took possession of her as the day wore on she put aside her work the darning of his stockings and rambled aimlessly through the woods she had wandered she knew not how far when she was suddenly seized with the same vague sense of a foreign presence which she had felt before could it be curson again with a word of warning no she knew it was not he so subtle had her sense become that she even fancied that she detected in the invisible aura projected by the unknown no significance or relation to herself or low and felt no fear nevertheless she deemed it wisest to seek the protection of her sylvan bower and hurried swiftly thither  but not so quickly nor directly that she did not once or twice pause in her flight to examine the newcomer from behind a friendly trunk he was a strangera young fellow with a brown mustache wearing heavy mexican spurs in his ridingboots whose tinkling he apparently did not care to conceal he had perceived her and was evidently pursuing her but so awkwardly and timidly that she eluded him with ease when she had reached the security of the hollow tree and pulled the curtain of bark before the narrow opening with her eye to the interstices she waited his coming he arrived breathlessly in the open space before the tree where the bear once lay the dazed bewildered and halfawed expression of his face as he glanced around him and through the openings of the forest aisles brought a faint smile to her saddened face at last he called in a halfembarrassed voice  miss nellie  the smile faded from teresas cheek who was miss nellie she pressed her ear to the opening miss wynn the voice again called but was lost in the echoless woods devoured with a new gratuitous curiosity in another moment teresa felt she would have disclosed herself at any risk but the stranger rose and began to retrace his steps long after his tinkling spurs were lost in the distance teresa remained like a statue staring at the place where he had stood then she suddenly turned like a mad woman glanced down at the gown she was wearing tore it from her back as if it had been a polluted garment and stamped upon it in a convulsion of rage and then with her beautiful bare arms clasped together over her head she threw herself upon her couch in a tempest of tears     chapter vi   when miss nellie reached the first mining extension of indian spring which surrounded it like a fosse she descended for one instant into one of its trenches opened her parasol removed her duster hid it under a bowlder and with a few shivers and catlike strokes of her soft hands not only obliterated all material traces of the stolen cream of carquinez woods but assumed a feline demureness quite inconsistent with any moral dereliction unfortunately she forgot to remove at the same time a certain ring from her third finger which she had put on with her duster and had worn at no other time with this slight exception the benignant fate which always protected that young person brought her in contact with the burnham girls at one end of the main street as the returning coach to excelsior entered the other and enabled her to take leave of them before the coach office with a certain ostentation of parting which struck mr jack brace who was lingering at the doorway into a state of utter bewilderment  here was miss nellie wynn the belle of excelsior calm quiet selfpossessed her chaste cambric skirts and dainty shoes as fresh as when she had left her fathers house but where was the woman of the brown duster and where the yellowdressed apparition of the woods he was feebly repeating to himself his mental adjuration of a few hours before when he caught her eye and was taken with a blush and a fit of coughing could he have been such an egregious fool and was it not plainly written on his embarrassed face for her to read  are we going down together asked miss nellie with an exceptionally gracious smile  there was neither affectation nor coquetry in this advance the girl had no idea of braces suspicion of her nor did any uneasy desire to placate or deceive a possible rival of lows prompt her graciousness she simply wished to shake off in this encounter the already stale excitement of the past two hours as she had shaken the dust of the woods from her clothes it was characteristic of her irresponsible nature and transient susceptibilities that she actually enjoyed the relief of change more than that i fear she looked upon this infidelity to a past dubious pleasure as a moral principle a mild open flirtation with a recognized man like brace after her secret passionate tryst with a nameless nomad like low was an ethical equipoise that seemed proper to one of her religious education  brace was only too happy to profit by miss nellies condescension he at once secured the seat by her side and spent the four hours and a half of their return journey to excelsior in blissful but timid communion with her if he did not dare to confess his past suspicions he was equally afraid to venture upon the boldness he had premeditated a few hours before he was therefore obliged to take a middle course of slightly egotistical narration of his own personal adventures with which he beguiled the young girls ear this he only departed from once to describe to her a valuable grizzly bearskin which he had seen that day for sale at indian spring with a view to divining her possible acceptance of it for a buggy robe and once to comment upon a ring which she had inadvertently disclosed in pulling off her glove  its only an old family keepsake she added with easy mendacity and affecting to recognize in mr braces curiosity a not unnatural excuse for toying with her charming fingers she hid them in chaste and virginal seclusion in her lap until she could recover the ring and resume her glove  a week passeda week of peculiar and desiccating heat for even those dry sierra tablelands the long days were filled with impalpable dust and acrid haze suspended in the motionless air the nights were breathless and dewless the cold wind which usually swept down from the snow line was laid to sleep over a dark monotonous level whose horizon was pricked with the eating fires of burning forest crests the lagging coach of indian spring drove up at excelsior and precipitated its passengers with an accompanying cloud of dust before the excelsior hotel as they emerged from the coach mr brace standing in the doorway closely scanned their begrimed and almost unrecognizable faces they were the usual type of travelers a single professional man in dusty black a few traders in tweeds and flannels a sprinkling of miners in red and gray shirts a chinaman a negro and a mexican packer or muleteer this latter for a moment mingled with the crowd in the barroom and even penetrated the corridor and diningroom of the hotel as if impelled by a certain semicivilized curiosity and then strolled with a lazy dragging stephalf impeded by the enormous leather leggings chains and spurs peculiar to his classdown the main street the darkness was gathering but the muleteer indulged in the same childish scrutiny of the dimly lighted shops magazines and saloons and even of the occasional groups of citizens at the street corners apparently young as far as the outlines of his figure could be seen he seemed to show even more than the usual concern of masculine excelsior in the charms of womankind the few female figures about at that hour or visible at window or veranda received his marked attention he respectfully followed the two auburnhaired daughters of deacon johnson on their way to choir meeting to the door of the church not content with that act of discreet gallantry after they had entered he managed to slip unperceived behind them  the memorial of the excelsior gamblers generosity was a modern building large and pretentious for even mr wynns popularity and had been goodhumoredly known in the characteristic language of the generous donors as one of the biggest religious bluffs on record its groined rafters which were so new and spicy that they still suggested their native forest aisles seldom covered more than a hundred devotees and in the rambling choir with its bare space for the future organ the few choristers gathered round a small harmonium were lost in the deepening shadow of that summer evening the muleteer remained hidden in the obscurity of the vestibule after a few moments desultory conversation in which it appeared that the unexpected absence of miss nellie wynn their leader would prevent their practicing the choristers withdrew the stranger who had listened eagerly drew back in the darkness as they passed out and remained for a few moments a vague and motionless figure in the silent church then coming cautiously to the window the flapping broadbrimmed hat was put aside and the faint light of the dying day shone in the black eyes of teresa despite her face darkened with dye and disfigured with dust the matted hair piled and twisted around her head the strange dress and boyish figure one swift glance from under her raised lashes betrayed her identity  she turned aside mechanically into the first pew picked up and opened a hymnbook her eyes became riveted on a name written on the titlepage nellie wynn her name and her book the instinct that had guided her here was right the slight gossip of her fellowpassengers was right this was the clergymans daughter whose praise filled all mouths this was the unknown girl the stranger was seeking but who in turn perhaps had been seeking lowthe girl who absorbed his fancythe secret of his absences his preoccupation his coldness this was the girl whom to see perhaps in his arms she was now periling her liberty and her life unknown to him a slight odor some faint perfume of its owner came from the book it was the same she had noticed in the dress low had given her she flung the volume to the ground and throwing her arms over the back of the pew before her buried her face in her hands  in that light and attitude she might have seemed some rapt acolyte abandoned to selfcommunion but whatever yearning her soul might have had for higher sympathy or deeper consolation i fear that the spiritual tabernacle of excelsior and the reverend mr wynn did not meet that requirement she only felt the dry ovenlike heat of that vast shell empty of sentiment and beauty hollow in its pretense and dreary in its desolation she only saw in it a chief altar for the glorification of this girl who had absorbed even the pure worship of her companion and converted and degraded his sublime paganism to her petty creed with a womans withering contempt for her own art displayed in another woman she thought how she herself could have touched him with the peace that the majesty of their woodland aislesso unlike this pillared shamhad taught her own passionate heart had she but dared mingling with this imperfect theology she felt she could have proved to him also that a brunette and a woman of her experience was better than an immature blonde she began to loathe herself for coming hither and dreaded to meet his face here a sudden thought struck her what if he had not come here what if she had been mistaken what if her rash interpretation of his absence from the wood that night was simple madness what if he should returnif he had already returned she rose to her feet whitening yet joyful with the thought she could return at once what was the girl to her now yet there was time to satisfy herself if he were at her house she had been told where it was she could find it in the dark an open door or window would betray some sign or sound of the occupants she rose replaced her hat over her eyes knotted her flaunting scarf around her throat groped her way to the door and glided into the outer darkness     chapter vii   it was quite dark when mr jack brace stopped before father wynns open door the windows were also invitingly open to the wayfarer as were the pastoral counsels of father wynn delivered to some favored guest within in a tone of voice loud enough for a pulpit jack brace paused the visitor was the convalescent sheriff jim dunn who had publicly commemorated his recovery by making his first call upon the father of his inamorata the reverend mr wynn had been expatiating upon the unremitting heat of a possible precursor of forest fires and exhibiting some catholic knowledge of the designs of a deity in that regard and what should be the policy of the legislature when mr brace concluded to enter mr wynn and the wounded man who occupied an armchair by the window were the only occupants of the room but in spite of the formers ostentatious greeting brace could see that his visit was inopportune and unwelcome the sheriff nodded a quick impatient recognition which had it not been accompanied by an anathema on the heat might have been taken as a personal insult neither spoke of miss nellie although it was patent to brace that they were momentarily expecting her all of which went far to strengthen a certain wavering purpose in his mind  ah ha strong language mr dunn said father wynn referring to the sheriffs adjuration but out of the fullness of the heart the mouth speaketh job sir cursed we are told and even expressed himself in vigorous hebrew regarding his birthday ha ha im not opposed to that when i have often wrestled with the spirit i confess i have sometimes said dn you yes sir dn you  there was something so unutterably vile in the reverend gentlemans utterance and emphasis of this oath that the two men albeit both easy and facile blasphemers felt shocked as the purest of actresses is apt to overdo the rakishness of a gay lothario father wynns immaculate conception of an imprecation was something terrible but he added the law ought to interfere with the reckless use of campfires in the woods in such weather by packers and prospectors  it isnt so much the work of white men broke in brace as it is of greasers chinamen and diggers especially diggers theres that blasted low ranges the whole carquinez woods as if they were his i reckon he aint particular just where he throws his matches  but hes not a digger hes a cherokee and only a halfbreed at that interpolated wynn unless he added with the artful suggestion of the betrayed trust of a too credulous christian he deceived me in this as in other things  in what other things low had deceived him he did not say but to the astonishment of both men dunn growled a dissent to braces proposition either from some secret irritation with that possible rival or impatience at the prolonged absence of nellie he had had enough of that sort of hogwash ladled out to him for genuine liquor as to the carquinez woods he dunn didnt know why low hadnt as much right there as if hed grabbed it under a preemption law and didnt live there with this hint at certain speculations of father wynn in public lands for a homestead he added that if they brace and wynn could bring him along any older american settler than an indian they might rake down his dunns pile unprepared for this turn in the conversation wynn hastened to explain that he did not refer to the pure aborigine whose gradual extinction no one regretted more than himself but to the mongrel who inherited only the vices of civilization there should be a law sir against the mingling of races there are men sir who violate the laws of the most high by living with indian womensquaw men sir as they are called  dunn rose with a face livid with weakness and passion who dares say that they are a dd sight better than sneaking northern abolitionists who married their daughters to buck niggers like but a spasm of pain withheld this parthian shot at the politics of his two companions and he sank back helplessly in his chair  an awkward silence ensued the three men looked at each other in embarrassment and confusion dunn felt that he had given way to a gratuitous passion wynn had a vague presentiment that he had said something that imperiled his daughters prospects and brace was divided between an angry retort and the secret purpose already alluded to  its all the blasted heat said dunn with a forced smile pushing away the whisky which wynn had ostentatiously placed before him  of course said wynn hastily only its a pity nellie aint here to give you her smellingsalts she ought to be back now he added no longer mindful of braces presence the coach is overdue now though i reckon the heat made yuba bill take it easy at the up grade  if you mean the coach from indian spring said brace quietly its in already but miss nellie didnt come on it  may be she got out at the crossing said wynn cheerfully she sometimes does  she didnt take the coach at indian spring returned brace because i saw it leave and passed it on buckskin ten minutes ago coming up the hills  shes stopped over at burnhams said wynn reflectively then in response to the significant silence of his guests he added in a tone of chagrin which his forced heartiness could not disguise well boys its a disappointment all round but we must take the lesson as it comes ill go over to the coach office and see if shes sent any word make yourselves at home until i return  when the door had closed behind him brace arose and took his hat as if to go with his hand on the lock he turned to his rival who half hidden in the gathering darkness still seemed unable to comprehend his illluck  if youre waiting for that baldheaded fraud to come back with the truth about his daughter said brace coolly youd better send for your things and take up your lodgings here  what do you mean said dunn sternly  i mean that shes not at the burnhams i mean that he either does or does not know where she is and that in either case he is not likely to give you information but i can  you can  yes  then where is she  in the carquinez woods in the arms of the man you were just defendinglow the halfbreed  the room had become so dark that from the road nothing could be distinguished only the momentary sound of struggling feet was heard  sit down said braces voice and dont be a fool youre too weak and it aint a fair fight let go your hold im not lyingi wish to god i was  there was silence and brace resumed weve been rivals i know may be i thought my chance as good as yours if what i say aint truth well stand as we stood before and if youre on the shoot im your man when you like where you like or on sight if you choose but i cant bear to see another man played upon as ive been played upongiven dead away as ive been it aint on the square  there he continued after a pause thats right now steady listen a week ago that girl went down just like this to indian spring it was given out like this that she went to the burnhams i dont mind saying dunn that i went down myself all on the square thinking i might get a show to talk to her just as you might have done you know if you had my chance i didnt come across her anywhere but two men that i met thought they recognized her in a disguise going into the woods not suspecting anything i went after her saw her at a distance in the middle of the woods in another dress that i can swear to and was just coming up to her when she vanishedwent like a squirrel up a tree or down like a gopher in the ground but vanished  is that all said dunns voice and just because you were a dd fool or had taken a little too much whisky you thought  steady thats just what i said to myself interrupted brace coolly particularly when i saw her that same afternoon in another dress saying goodby to the burnhams as fresh as a rose and as cold as those snowpeaks only one thingshe had a ring on her finger she never wore before and didnt expect me to see  what if she did she might have bought it i reckon she hasnt to consult you broke in dunns voice sternly  she didnt buy it continued brace quietly low gave that jew trader a bearskin in exchange for it and presented it to her i found that out two days afterwards i found out that out of the whole afternoon she spent less than an hour with the burnhams i found out that she bought a duster like the disguise the two men saw her in i found the yellow dress she wore that day hanging up in lows cabinthe place where i saw her gothe rendezvous where she meets him oh youre listenin are you stop sit down  i discovered it by accident continued the voice of brace when all was again quiet it was hidden as only a squirrel or an injin can hide when they improve upon nature when i was satisfied that the girl had been in the woods i was determined to find out where she vanished and went there again prospecting around i picked up at the foot of one of the biggest trees this yer old memorandumbook with grasses and herbs stuck in it i remembered that id heard old wynn say that low like the dd digger that he was collected these herbs only he pretended it was for science i reckoned the book was his and that he mightnt be far away i lay low and waited bimeby i saw a lizard running down the root when he got sight of me he stopped  dn the lizard whats that got to do with where she is now  everything that lizard had a piece of sugar in his mouth where did it come from i made him drop it and calculated hed go back for more he did he scooted up that tree and slipped in under some hanging strips of bark i shoved em aside and found an opening to the hollow where they do their housekeeping  but you didnt see her thereand how do you know she is there now  i determined to make it sure when she left today i started an hour ahead of her and hid myself at the edge of the woods an hour after the coach arrived at indian spring she came there in a brown duster and was joined by him id have followed them but the dd hound has the ears of a squirrel and though i was five hundred yards from him he was on his guard  guard be blessed wasnt you armed why didnt you go for him said dunn furiously  i reckoned id leave that for you said brace coolly if hed killed me and if hed even covered me with his rifle hed been sure to let daylight through me at double the distance i shouldnt have been any better off nor you either if id killed him it would have been your duty as sheriff to put me in jail and i reckon it wouldnt have broken your heart jim dunn to have got rid of two rivals instead of one hullo where are you going  going said dunn hoarsely going to the carquinez woods by god to kill him before her ill risk it if you darent let me succeed and you can hang me and take the girl yourself  sit down sit down dont be a fool jim dunn you wouldnt keep the saddle a hundred yards did i say i wouldnt help you no if youre willing well run the risk together but it must be in my way hear me ill drive you down there in a buggy before daylight and well surprise them in the cabin or as they leave the wood but you must come as if to arrest him for some offensesay as an escaped digger from the reservation a dangerous tramp a destroyer of public property in the forests a suspected road agent or anything to give you the right to hunt him the exposure of him and nellie dont you see must be accidental if he resists kill him on the spot and nobodyll blame you if he goes peaceably with you and you once get him in excelsior jail when the story gets out that hes taken the belle of excelsior for his squaw if youd the angels for your posse you couldnt keep the boys from hanging him to the first tree whats that  he walked to the window and looked out cautiously  if it was the old man coming back and listening he said after a pause it cant he helped hell hear it soon enough if he dont suspect something already  look yer brace broke in dunn hoarsely dd if i understand you or you me that dog low has got to answer to me not to the law ill take my risk of killing him on sight and on the square i dont reckon to handicap myself with a warrant and i am not going to draw him out with a lie you hear me thats me all the time  then you calkilate to go down thar said brace contemptuously yell out for him and nellie and let him line you on a rest from the first tree as if you were a grizzly  there was a pause whats that you were saying just now about a bearskin he sold asked dunn slowly as if reflecting  he exchanged a bearskin replied brace with a single hole right over the heart hes a dead shot i tell you  dn his shooting said dunn im not thinking of that how long ago did he bring in that bearskin  about two weeks i reckon why  nothing look yer brace you mean wellthars my hand ill go down with you there but not as the sheriff im going there as jim dunn and you can come along as a white man to see things fixed on the square come  brace hesitated youll think better of my plan before you get there but ive said id stand by you and i will come then theres no time to lose  they passed out into the darkness together  what are you waiting for said dunn impatiently as brace who was supporting him by the arm suddenly halted at the corner of the house  some one was listeningdid you not see him was it the old man asked brace hurriedly  blast the old man it was only one of them mexican packers chockfull of whisky and trying to hold up the house what are you thinking of we shall be late  in spite of his weakness the wounded man hurriedly urged brace forward until they reached the latters lodgings to his surprise the horse and buggy were already before the door  then you reckoned to go any way said dunn with a searching look at his companion  i calkilated somebody would go returned brace evasively patting the impatient buckskin but come in and take a drink before we leave  dunn started out of a momentary abstraction put his hand on his hip and mechanically entered the house they had scarcely raised the glasses to their lips when a sudden rattle of wheels was heard in the street brace set down his glass and ran to the window  its the mare bolted he said with an oath weve kept her too long standing follow me and he dashed down the staircase into the street dunn followed with difficulty when he reached the door he was already confronted by his breathless companion shes gone off on a run and ill swear there was a man in the buggy he stopped and examined the halterstrap still fastened to the fence cut by god  dunn turned pale with passion whos got another horse and buggy he demanded  the new blacksmith in main street but we wont get it by borrowing said brace  how then asked dunn savagely  seize it as the sheriff of yuba and his deputy pursuing a confederate of the injin lowthe horse thief     chapter viii   the brief hour of darkness that preceded the dawn was that night intensified by a dense smoke which after blotting out horizon and sky dropped a thick veil on the high road and the silent streets of indian spring as the buggy containing sheriff dunn and brace dashed through the obscurity brace suddenly turned to his companion  some one ahead  the two men bent forward over the dashboard above the steady plunging of their own horsehoofs they could hear the quicker irregular beat of other hoofs in the darkness before them  its that horse thief said dunn in a savage whisper bear to the right and hand me the whip  a dozen cuts of the cruel lash and their maddened horse bounding at each stroke broke into a wild canter the frail vehicle swayed from side to side at each spring of the elastic shafts steadying himself by one hand on the low rail dunn drew his revolver with the other sing out to him to pull up or well fire my voice is clean gone he added in a husky whisper  they were so near that they could distinguish the bulk of a vehicle careering from side to side in the blackness ahead dunn deliberately raised his weapon sing out he repeated impatiently but brace who was still keeping in the shadow suddenly grasped his companions arm  hush its not buckskin he whispered hurriedly  are you sure  dont you see were gaining on him replied the other contemptuously dunn grasped his companions hand and pressed it silently even in that supreme moment this horsemans tribute to the fugitive buckskin forestalled all baser considerations of pursuit and capture  in twenty seconds they were abreast of the stranger crowding his horse and buggy nearly into the ditch brace keenly watchful dunn suppressed and pale in half a minute they were leading him a length and when their horse again settled down to his steady work the stranger was already lost in the circling dust that followed them but the victors seemed disappointed the obscurity had completely hidden all but the vague outlines of the mysterious driver  hes not our game anyway whispered dunn drive on  but if it was some friend of his suggested brace uneasily what would you do  what i said id do responded dunn savagely i dont want five minutes to do it in either well be half an hour ahead of that dd fool whoever he is look here all youve got to do is to put me in the trail to that cabin stand back of me out of gunshot alone if you like as my deputy or with any number you can pick up as my posse if he gets by me as nellies lover you may shoot him or take him as a horse thief if you like  then you wont shoot him on sight  not till ive had a word with him  but  ive chirped said the sheriff gravely drive on  for a few moments only the plunging hoofs and rattling wheels were heard a dull lurid glow began to define the horizon they were silent until an abatement of the smoke the vanishing of the gloomy horizon line and a certain impenetrability in the darkness ahead showed them they were nearing the carquinez woods but they were surprised on entering them to find the dim aisles alight with a faint mystic aurora the tops of the towering spires above them had caught the gleam of the distant forest fires and reflected it as from a gilded dome  it would be hot work if the carquinez woods should conclude to take a hand in this yer little game thats going on over on the divide yonder said brace securing his horse and glancing at the spires overhead i reckon id rather take a back seat at injin spring when the show commences  dunn did not reply but buttoning his coat placed one hand on his companions shoulder and sullenly bade him lead the way advancing slowly and with difficulty the desperate man might have been taken for a peaceful invalid returning from an early morning stroll his right hand was buried thoughtfully in the side pocket of his coat only brace knew that it rested on the handle of his pistol  from time to time the latter stopped and consulted the faint trail with a minuteness that showed recent careful study suddenly he paused i made a blaze hereabouts to show where to leave the trail there it is he added pointing to a slight notch cut in the trunk of an adjoining tree  but weve just passed one said dunn if thats what you are looking after a hundred yards back  brace uttered an oath and ran back in the direction signified by his companion presently he returned with a smile of triumph  theyve suspected something its a clever trick but it wont hold water that blaze which was done to muddle you was cut with an axe this which i made was done with a bowieknife its the real one were not far off now come on  they proceeded cautiously at right angles with the blazed tree for ten minutes more the heat was oppressive drops of perspiration rolled from the forehead of the sheriff and at times when he attempted to steady his uncertain limbs his hands shrank from the heated blistering bark he touched with ungloved palms  here we are said brace pausing at last do you see that biggest tree with the root stretching out halfway across to the opposite one  no its further to the right and abreast of the dead brush interrupted dunn quickly with a sudden revelation that this was the spot where he had found the dead bear in the night teresa escaped  thats so responded brace in astonishment  and the opening is on the other side opposite the dead brush said dunn  then you know it said brace suspiciously  i reckon responded dunn grimly thats enough fall back  to the surprise of his companion he lifted his head erect and with a strong firm step walked directly to the tree reaching it he planted himself squarely before the opening  halloo he said  there was no reply a squirrel scampered away close to his feet brace far in the distance after an ineffectual attempt to distinguish his companion through the intervening trunks took off his coat leaned against a tree and lit a cigar  come out of that cabin continued dunn in a clear resonant voice come out before i drag you out  all right captain scott dont shoot and ill come down said a voice as clear and as high as his own the hanging strips of bark were dashed aside and a woman leaped lightly to the ground  dunn staggered back teresa by the eternal  it was teresa the old teresa teresa a hundred times more vicious reckless hysterical extravagant and outrageous than before teresa staring with tooth and eye sunburnt and embrowned her hair hanging down her shoulders and her shawl drawn tightly around her neck  teresa it is the same old gal here we are again return of the favorite in her original character for two weeks only houp la tshk and catching her yellow skirt with her fingers she pirouetted before the astounded man and ended in a pose recovering himself with an effort dunn dashed forward and seized her by the wrist  answer me woman is that lows cabin  it is  who occupies it besides  i do  and who else  well drawled teresa slowly with an extravagant affectation of modesty nobody else but us i reckon twos company you know and threes none  stop will you swear that there isnt a young girl hishis sweetheartconcealed there with you  the fire in teresas eye was genuine as she answered steadily well it aint my style to put up with that sort of thing at least it wasnt over at yolo and you know it jim dunn or i wouldnt be here  yes yes said dunn hurriedly but im a dd fool or worse the fool of a fool tell me teresa is this man low your lover  teresa lowered her eyes as if in maidenly confusion well if id known that you had any feeling of your own about itif youd spoken sooner  answer me you devil  he is  and he has been with you hereyesterdaytonight  he has  enough he laughed a weak foolish laugh and turning pale suddenly lapsed against a tree he would have fallen but with a quick instinct teresa sprang to his side and supported him gently to a root the action over they both looked astounded  i reckon that wasnt much like either you or me said dunn slowly was it but if youd let me drop then youd have stretched out the biggest fool in the sierras he paused and looked at her curiously whats come over you blessed if i seem to know you now  she was very pale again and quiet that was all  teresa dn it look here when i was laid up yonder in excelsior i said i wanted to get well for only two things one was to hunt you down the other to marry nellie wynn when i came here i thought that last thing could never be i came here expecting to find her here with low and kill himperhaps kill her too i never once thought of you not once you might have risen up before mebetween me and himand id have passed you by and now that i find its all a mistake and it was you not her i was looking for why  why she interrupted bitterly youll just take me of course to save your time and earn your salary im ready  but im not just yet he said faintly help me up  she mechanically assisted him to his feet  now stand where you are he added and dont move beyond this tree till i return  he straightened himself with an effort clenched his fists until the nails were nearly buried in his palms and strode with a firm steady step in the direction he had come in a few moments he returned and stood before her  ive sent away my deputythe man who brought me here the fool who thought you were nellie he knows now he made a mistake but who it was he mistook for nellie he does not know nor shall ever know nor shall any living being know other than myself and when i leave the wood today i shall know it no longer you are safe here as far as i am concerned but i cannot screen you from others prying let low take you away from here as soon as he can  let him take me away ah yes for what  to save you said dunn look here teresa without knowing it you lifted me out of hell just now and because of the wrong i might have done herfor her sake i spare you and shirk my duty  for her sake gasped the womanfor her sake oh yes go on  well said dunn gloomily i reckon perhaps youd as lieve left me in hell for all the love you bear me and may be youve grudge enough agin me still to wish id found her and him together  you think so she said turning her head away  there dn it i didnt mean to make you cry may be you wouldnt then only tell that fellow to take you out of this and not run away the next time he sees a man coming  he didnt run said teresa with flashing eyes iii sent him away she stammered then suddenly turning with fury upon him she broke out run run from you ha ha you said just now id a grudge against you well listen jim dunn id only to bring you in range of that young mans rifle and youd have dropped in your tracks like  like that bar the other night said dunn with a short laugh so that was your little game he checked his laugh suddenlya cloud passed over his face look here teresa he said with an assumption of carelessness that was as transparent as it was utterly incompatible with his frank open selfishness what became of that bar the skineh that was worth something  yes said teresa quietly low exchanged it and got a ring for me from that trader isaacs it was worth more you bet and the ring didnt fit either  yes interrupted dunn with an almost childish eagerness  and i made him take it back and get the value in money i hear that isaacs sold it again and made another profit but thats like those traders the disingenuous candor of teresas manner was in exquisite contrast to dunn he rose and grasped her hand so heartily she was forced to turn her eyes away  goodby he said  you look tired she murmured with a sudden gentleness that surprised him let me go with you a part of the way  it isnt safe for you just now he said thinking of the possible consequences of the alarm brace had raised  not the way you came she replied but one known only to myself  he hesitated only a moment all right then he said finally let us go at once its suffocating here and i seem to feel this dead bark crinkle under my feet  she cast a rapid glance around her and then seemed to sound with her eyes the faroff depths of the aisles beginning to grow pale with the advancing day but still holding a strange quiver of heat in the air when she had finished her halfabstracted scrutiny of the distance she cast one backward glance at her own cabin and stopped  will you wait a moment for me she asked gently  yesbutno tricks teresa it isnt worth the time  she looked him squarely in the eyes without a word  enough he said go  she was absent for some moments he was beginning to become uneasy when she made her appearance again clad in her old faded black dress her face was very pale and her eyes were swollen but she placed his hand on her shoulder and bidding him not to fear to lean upon her for she was quite strong led the way  you look more like yourself now and yetblast it allyou dont either said dunn looking down upon her youve changed in some way what is it is it on account of that injin couldnt you have found a white man in his place  i reckon hes neither worse nor better for that she replied bitterly and perhaps he wasnt as particular in his taste as a white man might have been but she added with a sudden spasm of her old rage its a lie hes not an indian no more than i am not unless being born of a mother who scarcely knew him of a father who never even saw him and being brought up among white men and wild beastsless cruel than they werecould make him one  dunn looked at her in surprise not unmixed with admiration if nellie he thought could but love me like that but he only said  for all that hes an injin why look at his name it aint low its leau dormante sleeping water an injin name  and what does that prove returned teresa only that indians clap a nickname on any stranger white or red who may camp with them why even his own father a white man the wretch who begot him and abandoned himhe had an indian nameloup noir  what name did you say  le loup noir the black wolf i suppose youd call him an indian too eh whats the matter were walking too fast stop a moment and rest therethere lean on me  she was none too soon for after holding him upright a moment his limbs failed and stooping gently she was obliged to support him half reclining against a tree  its the heat he said give me some whisky from my flask never mind the water he added faintly with a forced laugh after he had taken a draught at the strong spirit tell me more about the other waterthe sleeping wateryou know how do you know all this about him and hisfather  partly from him and partly from curson who wrote to me about him she answered with some hesitation  but dunn did not seem to notice this incongruity of correspondence with a former lover and he told you  yes and i saw the name on an old memorandum book he has which he says belonged to his father its full of old accounts of some trading post on the frontier its been missing for a day or two but it will turn up but i can swear i saw it  dunn attempted to rise to his feet put your hand in my pocket he said in a hurried whisper no therebring out a book there i havent looked at it yet is that it he added handing her the book brace had given him a few hours before  yes said teresa in surprise where did you find it  never mind now let me see it quick open it for my sight is failing therethank youthats all  take more whisky said teresa with a strange anxiety creeping over her you are faint again  wait listen teresalowerput your ear lower listen i came near killing that chap low today wouldnt it have been ridiculous  he tried to smile but his head fell back he had fainted     chapter ix   for the first time in her life teresa lost her presence of mind in an emergency she could only sit staring at the helpless man scarcely conscious of his condition her mind filled with a sudden prophetic intuition of the significance of his last words in the light of that new revelation she looked into his pale haggard face for some resemblance to low but in vain yet her swift feminine instinct met the objection its the mothers blood that would show she murmured not this mans  recovering herself she began to chafe his hands and temples and moistened his lips with the spirit when his respiration returned with a faint color to his cheeks she pressed his hands eagerly and leaned over him  are you sure she asked  of what he whispered faintly  that low is really your son  who said so he asked opening his round eyes upon her  you did yourself a moment ago she said quickly dont you remember  did i  you did is it not so  he smiled faintly i reckon  she held her breath in expectation but only the ludicrousness of the discovery seemed paramount to his weakened faculties isnt it just about the ridiculousest thing all round he said with a feeble chuckle first you nearly kill me before you know i am lows father then im just spoilin to kill him before i know hes my son then that godforsaken fool jack brace mistakes you for nellie and nellie for you aint it just the biggest thing for the boys to get hold of but we must keep it dark until after i marry nellie dont you see then well have a good time all round and ill stand the drinks think of it teresha you don no me i do no you nobody knowsh anybody elsh i try kill lo lo wants kill nellie no thath no ri but the potent liquor overtaking his exhausted senses thickened impeded and at last stopped his speech his head slipped to her shoulder and he became once more unconscious  teresa breathed again in that brief moment she had abandoned herself to a wild inspiration of hope which she could scarcely define not that it was entirely a wild inspiration she tried to reason calmly what if she revealed the truth to him what if she told the wretched man before her that she had deceived him that she had overheard his conversation with brace that she had stolen braces horse to bring low warning that failing to find low in his accustomed haunts or at the campfire she had left a note for him pinned to the herbarium imploring him to fly with his companion from the danger that was coming and that remaining on watch she had seen them bothbrace and dunnapproaching and had prepared to meet them at the cabin would this miserable and maddened man understand her selfabnegation would he forgive low and nellieshe did not ask for herself or would the revelation turn his brain if it did not kill him outright she looked at the sunken orbits of his eyes and hectic on his cheek and shuddered  why was this added to the agony she already suffered she had been willing to stand between them with her life her liberty and eventhe hot blood dyed her cheek at the thoughtwith the added shame of being thought the castoff mistress of that mans son yet all this she had taken upon herself in expiation of somethingshe knew not clearly what no for nothingonly for him and yet this very situation offered her that gleam of hope which had thrilled her a hope so wild in its improbability so degrading in its possibility that at first she knew not whether despair was not preferable to its shame and yet was it unreasonable she was no longer passionate she would be calm and think it out fairly  she would go to low at once she would find him somewhereand even if with that girl what matteredand she would tell him all when he knew that the life and death of his father lay in the scale would he let his brief foolish passion for nellie stand in the way even if he were not influenced by filial affection or mere compassion would his pride let him stoop to a rivalry with the man who had deserted his youth could he take dunns promised bride who must have coquetted with him to have brought him to this miserable plight was this like the calm proud young god she knew yet she had an uneasy instinct that calm proud young gods and goddesses did things like this and felt the weakness of her reasoning flush her own conscious cheek  teresa  she started dunn was awake and was gazing at her curiously  i was reckoning it was the only square thing for low to stop this promiscuous picnicking here and marry you out and out  marry me said teresa in a voice that with all her efforts she could not make cynical  yes he repeated after ive married nellie tote you down to san angeles and there take my name like a man and give it to you nobodyll ask after teresa sureyou bet your life and if they do and he cant stop their jaw just you call on the old man its mighty queer aint it teresa to think of your being my daughterinlaw  it seemed here as if he was about to lapse again into unconsciousness over the purely ludicrous aspect of the subject but he haply recovered his seriousness hell have as much money from me as he wants to go into business with whats his line of business teresa asked this prospective fatherinlaw in a large liberal way  he is a botanist said teresa with a sudden childish animation that seemed to keep up the grim humor of the paternal suggestion and oh he is too poor to buy books i sent for one or two for him myself the other day she hesitatedit was all the money i had but it wasnt enough for him to go on with his studies  dunn looked at her sparkling eyes and glowing cheeks and became thoughtful curson must have been a dd fool he said finally  teresa remained silent she was beginning to be impatient and uneasy fearing some mischance that might delay her dreaded yet longedfor meeting with low yet she could not leave this sick and exhausted man his father now bound to her by more than mere humanity  couldnt you manage she said gently to lean on me a few steps further until i could bring you to a cooler spot and nearer assistance  he nodded she lifted him almost like a child to his feet a spasm of pain passed over his face how far is it he asked  not more than ten minutes she replied  i can make a spurt for that time he said coolly and began to walk slowly but steadily on only his face which was white and set and the convulsive grip of his hand on her arm betrayed the effort at the end of ten minutes she stopped they stood before the splintered lightningscarred shaft in the opening of the woods where low had built her first campfire she carefully picked up the herbarium but her quick eye had already detected in the distance before she had allowed dunn to enter the opening with her that her note was gone low had been there before them he had been warned as his absence from the cabin showed he would not return there they were free from interruptionbut where had he gone  the sick man drew a long breath of relief as she seated him in the clovergrown hollow where she had slept the second night of her stay its cooler than those cursed woods he said i suppose its because its a little like a grave what are you going to do now he added as she brought a cup of water and placed it at his side  i am going to leave you here for a little while she said cheerfully but with a pale face and nervous hands im going to leave you while i seek low  the sick man raised his head im good for a spurt teresa like that ive just got through but i dont think im up to a family party couldnt you issue cards later on  you dont understand she said im going to get low to send some one of your friends to you here i dont think hell begrudge leaving her a moment for that she added to herself bitterly  whats that youre saying he queried with the nervous quickness of an invalid  nothingbut that im going now she turned her face aside to hide her moistened eyes wish me good luck wont you she asked half sadly half pettishly  come here  she came and bent over him he suddenly raised his hands and drawing her face down to his own kissed her forehead  give that to him he whispered from me  she turned and fled happily for her sentiment not hearing the feeble laugh that followed as dunn in sheer imbecility again referred to the extravagant ludicrousness of the situation it is about the biggest thing in the way of a sell all round he repeated lying on his back confidentially to the speck of smokeobscured sky above him he pictured himself repeating it not to nellieher severe propriety might at last overlook the fact but would not tolerate the jokebut to her father it would be one of those characteristic californian jokes father wynn would admire  to his exhaustion fever presently succeeded and he began to grow restless the heat too seemed to invade his retreat and from time to time the little patch of blue sky was totally obscured by clouds of smoke he amused himself with watching a lizard who was investigating a folded piece of paper whose elasticity gave the little creature lively apprehensions of its vitality at last he could stand the stillness of his retreat and his supine position no longer and rolled himself out of the bed of leaves that teresa had so carefully prepared for him he rose to his feet stiff and sore and supporting himself by the nearest tree moved a few steps from the dead ashes of the campfire the movement frightened the lizard who abandoned the paper and fled with a satirical recollection of brace and his ridiculous discovery through the medium of this animal he stooped and picked up the paper like as not he said to himself with grim irony these yer lizards are in the discovery business praps this may lead to another mystery and he began to unfold the paper with a smile but the smile ceased as his eye suddenly caught his own name  a dozen lines were written in pencil on what seemed to be a blank leaf originally torn from some book he trembled so that he was obliged to sit down to read these words   when you get this keep away from the woods dunn and another man are in deadly pursuit of you and your companion i overheard their plan to surprise you in our cabin dont go there and i will delay them and put them off the scent dont mind me god bless you and if you never see me again think sometimes of  teresa   his trembling ceased he did not start but rose in an abstracted way and made a few deliberate steps in the direction teresa had gone even then he was so confused that he was obliged to refer to the paper again but with so little effect that he could only repeat the last words think sometimes of teresa he was conscious that this was not all he had a full conviction of being deceived and knew that he held the proof in his hand but he could not formulate it beyond that sentence teresayes he would think of her she would explain it and here she was returning  in that brief interval her face and manner had again changed her face was pale and quite breathless she cast a swift glance at dunn and the paper he mechanically held out walked up to him and tore it from his hand  well she said hoarsely what are you going to do about it  he attempted to speak but his voice failed him even then he was conscious that if he had spoken he would have only repeated think sometimes of teresa he looked longingly but helplessly at the spot where she had thrown the paper as if it had contained his unuttered words  yes she went on to herself as if he was a mute indifferent spectatoryes theyre gone that ends it all the games played out well suddenly turning upon him now you know it all your nellie was here with him and is with him now do you hear make the most of it youve lost thembut here i am  yes he said eagerlyyes teresa  she stopped stared at him then taking him by the hand led him like a child back to his couch well she said in halfsavage explanation i told you the truth when i said the girl wasnt at the cabin last night and that i didnt know her what are you glowerin at no i havent lied to you i swear to god except in one thing did you know what that was to save him i took upon me a shame i dont deserve i let you think i was his mistress you think so now dont you well before god todayand he may take me when he likesim no more to him than a sister i reckon your nellie cant say as much  she turned away and with the quick impatient stride of some caged animal made the narrow circuit of the opening stopping a moment mechanically before the sick man and again without looking at him continuing her monotonous round the heat had become excessive but she held her shawl with both hands drawn tightly over her shoulders suddenly a woodduck darted out of the covert blindly into the opening struck against the blasted trunk fell half stunned near her feet and then recovering fluttered away she had scarcely completed another circuit before the irruption was followed by a whirring bevy of quail a flight of jays and a sudden tumult of wings swept through the wood like a tornado she turned inquiringly to dunn who had risen to his feet but the next moment she caught convulsively at his wrist a wolf had just dashed through the underbrush not a dozen yards away and on either side of them they could hear the scamper and rustle of hurrying feet like the outburst of a summer shower a cold wind arose from the opposite direction as if to contest this wild exodus but it was followed by a blast of sickening heat teresa sank at dunns feet in an agony of terror  dont let them touch me she gasped keep them off tell me for gods sake what has happened  he laid his hand firmly on her arm and lifted her in his turn to her feet like a child in that supreme moment of physical danger his strength reason and manhood returned in their plenitude of power he pointed coolly to the trail she had quitted and said  the carquinez woods are on fire     chapter x   the nest of the tuneful burnhams although in the suburbs of indian spring was not in ordinary weather and seasons hidden from the longing eyes of the youth of that settlement that night however it was veiled in the smoke that encompassed the great highway leading to excelsior it is presumed that the burnham brood had long since folded their wings for there was no sign of life nor movement in the house as a rapidlydriven horse and buggy pulled up before it fortunately the paternal burnham was an early bird in the habit of picking up the first stirring mining worm and a resounding knock brought him half dressed to the street door he was startled at seeing father wynn before him a trifle flushed and abstracted  ah ha up betimes i see and ready no sluggards hereha ha he said heartily slamming the door behind him and by a series of pokes in the ribs genially backing his host into his own sittingroom im up too and am here to see nellie shes here ehof course he added darting a quick look at burnham  but mr burnham was one of those large liberal western husbands who classified his household under the general title of woman folk for the integers of which he was not responsible he hesitated and then propounded over the balusters to the upper story the direct query  you dont happen to have nellie wynn up there do ye  there was an interval of inquiry proceeding from half a dozen reluctant throats more or less cottony and muffled in those various degrees of grievance and mental distress which indicate too early roused young womanhood the eventual reply seemed to be affirmative albeit accompanied with a suppressed giggle as if the young lady had just been discovered as an answer to an amusing conundrum  all right said wynn with an apparent accession of boisterous geniality tell her i must see her and ive only got a few minutes to spare tell her to slip on anything and come down theres no one here but myself and ive shut the front door on brother burnham ha ha and suiting the action to the word he actually bundled the admiring brother burnham out on his own doorstep there was a light pattering on the staircase and nellie wynn pink with sleep very tall very slim hastily draped in a white counterpane with a blue border and a general classic suggestion slipped into the parlor at the same moment her father shut the door behind her placed one hand on the knob and with the other seized her wrist  where were you yesterday he asked  nellie looked at him shrugged her shoulders and said here  you were in the carquinez woods with low dorman you went there in disguise youve met him there before he is your clandestine lover you have taken pledges of affection from him you have  stop she said  he stopped  did he tell you this she asked with an expression of disdain  no i overheard it dunn and brace were at the house waiting for you when the coach did not bring you i went to the office to inquire as i left our door i thought i saw somebody listening at the parlor windows it was only a drunken mexican muleteer leaning against the house but if he heard nothing i did nellie i heard brace tell dunn that he had tracked you in your disguise to the woodsdo you hear that when you pretended to be here with the girls you were with lowalone that you wear a ring that low got of a trader here that there was a cabin in the woods  stop she repeated  wynn again paused  and what did you do she asked  i heard they were starting down there to surprise you and him together and i harnessed up and got ahead of them in my buggy  and found me here she said looking full into his eyes  he understood her and returned the look he recognized the full importance of the culminating fact conveyed in her words and was obliged to content himself with its logical and worldly significance it was too late now to take her to task for mere filial disobedience they must become allies  yes he said hurriedly but if you value your reputation if you wish to silence both these men answer me fully  go on she said  did you go to the cabin in the woods yesterday  no  did you ever go there with low  no i do not know even where it is  wynn felt that she was telling the truth nellie knew it but as she would have been equally satisfied with an equally efficacious falsehood her face remained unchanged  and when did he leave you  at nine oclock here he went to the hotel  he saved his life then for dunn is on his way to the woods to kill him  the jeopardy of her lover did not seem to affect the young girl with alarm although her eyes betrayed some interest  then dunn has gone to the woods she said thoughtfully  he has replied wynn  is that all she asked  i want to know what you are going to do  i was going back to bed  this is no time for trifling girl  i should think not she said with a yawn its too early or too late  wynn grasped her wrist more tightly hear me put whatever face you like on this affair you are compromisedand compromised with a man you cant marry  i dont know that i ever wanted to marry low if you mean him she said quietly  and dunn wouldnt marry you now  im not so sure of that either  nellie said wynn excitedly do you want to drive me mad have you nothing to saynothing to suggest  oh you want me to help you do you why didnt you say that first well go and bring dunn here  are you mad the man has gone already in pursuit of your lover believing you with him  then he will the more readily come and talk with me without him will you take the invitationyes or no  yes but  enough on your way there you will stop at the hotel and give low a letter from me  nellie  you shall read it of course she said scornfully for it will be your text for the conversation you will have with him will you please take your hand from the lock and open the door  wynn mechanically opened the door the young girl flew upstairs in a very few moments she returned with two notes one contained a few lines of formal invitation to dunn the other read as follows   dear mr dormanmy father will tell you how deeply i regret that our recent botanical excursions in the carquinez woods have been a source of serious misapprehensions to those who had a claim to my consideration and that i shall be obliged to discontinue them for the future at the same time he wishes me to express my gratitude for your valuable instruction and assistance in that pleasing study even though approaching events may compel me to relinquish it for other duties may i beg you to accept the inclosed ring as a slight recognition of my obligations to you  your grateful pupil  nellie wynn   when he had finished reading the letter she handed him a ring which he took mechanically he raised his eyes to hers with perfectly genuine admiration youre a good girl nellie he said and in a moment of parental forgetfulness unconsciously advanced his lips towards her cheek but she drew back in time to recall him to a sense of that human weakness  i suppose ill have time for a nap yet she said as a gentle hint to her embarrassed parent he nodded and turned towards the door  if i were you she continued repressing a yawn id manage to be seen on good terms with low at the hotel so perhaps you need not give the letter to him until the last thing goodby  the sittingroom door opened and closed behind her as she slipped upstairs and her father without the formality of leavetaking quietly let himself out by the front door  when he drove into the high road again however an overlooked possibility threatened for a moment to indefinitely postpone his amiable intentions regarding low the hotel was at the further end of the settlement towards the carquinez woods and as wynn had nearly reached it he was recalled to himself by the sounds of hoofs and wheels rapidly approaching from the direction of the excelsior turnpike wynn made no doubt it was the sheriff and brace to avoid recognition at that moment he whipped up his horse intending to keep the lead until he could turn into the first crossroad but the coming travelers had the fleetest horse and finding it impossible to distance them he drove close to the ditch pulling up suddenly as the strange vehicle was abreast of him and forcing them to pass him at full speed with the result already chronicled when they had vanished in the darkness mr wynn with a heart overflowing with christian thankfulness and universal benevolence wheeled round and drove back to the hotel he had already passed to pull up at the veranda with a stentorian shout to thump loudly at the deserted bar to hilariously beat the panels of the landlords door and commit a jocose assault and battery upon that halfdresssed and halfawakened man was eminently characteristic of wynn and part of his amiable plans that morning  something to wash this wood smoke from my throat brother carter and about as much again to prop open your eyes he said dragging carter before the bar and glasses round for as many of the boys as are up and stirring after a hardworking christians rest how goes the honest publicans trade and who have we here  thars judge robinson and two lawyers from sacramento dick curson over from yolo said carter and that ar young injin yarb doctor from the carquinez woods i reckon hes jist upi noticed a light under his door as i passed  hes my man for a friendly chat before breakfast said wynn you neednt come up ill find the way i dont want a light i reckon my eyes aint as bright nor as young as his but theyll see almost as far in the darkhe he and nodding to brother carter he strode along the passage and with no other introduction than a playful and preliminary boo burst into one of the rooms low who by the light of a single candle was bending over the plates of a large quarto merely raised his eyes and looked at the intruder the young mans natural imperturbability always exasperating to wynn seemed accented that morning by contrast with his own overacted animation  ah hawasting the midnight oil instead of imbibing the morning dews said father wynn archly illustrating his metaphor with a movement of his hand to his lips what have we here  an anonymous gift replied low simply recognizing the father of nellie by rising from his chair its a volume ive longed to possess but never could afford to buy i cannot imagine who sent it to me  wynn was for a moment startled by the thought that this recipient of valuable gifts might have influential friends but a glance at the bare room which looked like a camp and the strange unconventional garb of its occupant restored his former convictions there might be a promise of intelligence but scarcely of prosperity in the figure before him  ah we must not forget that we are watched over in the night season he said laying his hand on lows shoulder with an illustration of celestial guardianship that would have been impious but for its palpable grotesqueness no sir we know not what a day may bring forth  unfortunately lows practical mind did not go beyond a mere human interpretation it was enough however to put a new light in his eye and a faint color in his cheek  could it have been miss nellie he asked with halfboyish hesitation  mr wynn was too much of a christian not to bow before what appeared to him the purely providential interposition of this suggestion seizing it and low at the same moment he playfully forced him down again in his chair  ah you rascal he said with infinite archness thats your game is it you want to trap poor father wynn you want to make him say no you want to tempt him to commit himself no sirnever sirno no  firmly convinced that the present was nellies and that her father only goodhumoredly guessed it the young mans simple truthful nature was embarrassed he longed to express his gratitude but feared to betray the young girls trust the reverend mr wynn speedily relieved his mind  no he continued bestriding a chair and familiarly confronting low over its back no sirno and you want me to say no dont you regarding the little walks of nellie and a certain young man in the carquinez woodsha ha youd like me to say that i knew nothing of the botanizings and the herb collectings and the picknickings therehe heyou sly dog perhaps youd like to tempt father wynn further and make him swear he knows nothing of his daughter disguising herself in a duster and meeting another young manisnt it another young manall alone eh perhaps you want poor old father wynn to say no no sir nothing of the kind ever occurred ah you young rascal  slightly troubled in spite of wynns hearty manner low with his usual directness however said i do not want anyone to deny that i have seen miss nellie  certainly certainly said wynn abandoning his method considerably disconcerted by lows simplicity and a certain natural reserve that shook off his familiarity certainly its a noble thing to be able to put your hand on your heart and say to the world come on all of you observe me i have nothing to conceal i walk with miss wynn in the woods as her instructorher teacher in fact we cull a flower here and there we pluck an herb fresh from the hands of the creator we look so to speak from nature to natures god yes my young friend we should be the first to repel the foul calumny that could misinterpret our most innocent actions  calumny repeated low starting to his feet what calumny  my friend my noble young friend i recognize your indignation i know your worth when i said to nellie my only child my perhaps too simple offspringa mere wildflower like yourselfwhen i said to her go my child walk in the woods with this young man hand in hand let him instruct you from the humblest roots for he has trodden in the ways of the almighty gather wisdom from his lips and knowledge from his simple woodmans craft make in fact a collection not only of herbs but of moral axioms and experiencei knew i could trust you and trusting you my young friend i felt i could trust the world perhaps i was weak foolish but i thought only of her welfare i even recall how that to preserve the purity of her garments i bade her don a simple duster that to secure her from the trifling companionship of others i bade her keep her own counsel and seek you at seasons known but to yourselves  but    did nellie    understand you interrupted low hastily  i see you read her simple nature understand me no not at first her maidenly instinctperhaps her duty to anothertook the alarm i remember her words but what will dunn say she asked will he not be jealous  dunn jealous i dont understand said low fixing his eyes on wynn  thats just what i said to nellie jealous i said what dunn your affianced husband jealous of a mere frienda teacher a guide a philosopher it is impossible well sir she was right he is jealous and more than that he has imparted his jealousy to others in other words he has made a scandal  lows eyes flashed where is your daughter now he said sternly  at present in bed suffering from a nervous attack brought on by these unjust suspicions she appreciates your anxiety and knowing that you could not see her told me to give you this he handed low the ring and the letter  the climax had been forced and it must be confessed was by no means the one mr wynn had fully arranged in his own inner consciousness he had intended to take an ostentatious leave of low in the barroom deliver the letter with archness and escape before a possible explosion he consequently backed towards the door for an emergency but he was again at fault that unaffected stoical fortitude in acute suffering which was the one remaining pride and glory of lows race was yet to be revealed to wynns civilized eyes  the young man took the letter and read it without changing a muscle folded the ring in it and dropped it into his haversack then he picked up his blanket threw it over his shoulder took his trusty rifle in his hand and turned towards wynn as if coldly surprised that he was still standing there  are youare yougoing stammered wynn  are you not replied low dryly leaning on his rifle for a moment as if waiting for wynn to precede him the preacher looked at him a moment mumbled something and then shambled feebly and ineffectively down the staircase before low with a painful suggestion to the ordinary observer of being occasionally urged thereto by the moccasin of the young man behind him  on reaching the lower hall however he endeavored to create a diversion in his favor by dashing into the barroom and clapping the occupants on the back with indiscriminate playfulness but here again he seemed to be disappointed to his great discomfiture a large man not only returned his salutation with powerful levity but with equal playfulness seized him in his arms and after an ingenious simulation of depositing him in the horsetrough set him down in affected amazement bletht if i didnt think from the weight of your hand it wath my old friend thacramento bill said curson apologetically with a wink at the bystanders thatth the way bill alwayth uthed to tackle hith friendth till he wath one day bounthed by a prithefighter in frithco whom he had mithtaken for a mithionary as mr cursons reputation was of a quality that made any form of apology from him instantly acceptable the amused spectators made way for him as recognizing low who was just leaving the hotel he turned coolly from them and walked towards him  halloo he said extending his hand youre the man im waiting for did you get a book from the exthpreth offithe latht night  i did why  itth all right ath im rethponthible for it i only wanted to know  did you send it asked low quickly fixing his eyes on his face  well not exactly me but itth not worth making a mythtery of it teretha gave me a commithion to buy it and thend it to you anonymouthly thatth a womanth nonthenth for how could thee get a retheipt for it  then it was her present said low gloomily  of courthe it wathnt mine my boy id have thent you a tharpth rifle in plathe of that muthle loader you carry or thomething thenthible but i thay whatth up you look ath if you had been running all night  low grasped his hand thank you he said hurriedly but its nothing only i must be back to the woods early goodby  but curson retained lows hand in his own powerful grip  ill go with you a bit further he said in fact ive got thomething to thay to you only dont be in thuch a hurry the woodth can wait till you get there quietly compelling low to alter his own characteristic indian stride to keep pace with his he went on i dont mind thaying i rather cottoned to you from the time you acted like a white manno offentheto teretha she thayth you were left when a child lying round jutht ath promithcuouthly ath she wath and if i can do anything towardth putting you on the trail of your people ill do it i know thome of the voyageurth who traded with the cherokeeth and your father wath onewathnt he he glanced at lows utterly abstracted and immobile face i thay you dont theem to take a hand in thith game pardner whatth the row ith anything wrong over there and he pointed to the carquinez woods which were just looming out of the morning horizon in the distance  low stopped the last words of his companion seemed to recall him to himself he raised his eyes automatically to the woods and started  there is something wrong over there he said breathlessly look  i thee nothing said curson beginning to doubt lows sanity nothing more than i thaw an hour ago  look again dont you see that smoke rising straight up it isnt blown over there from the divide its new smoke the fire is in the woods  i reckon thatth so muttered curson shading his eyes with his hand but hullo wait a minute well get hortheth i say he shouted forgetting his lisp in his excitementstop but low had already lowered his head and darted forward like an arrow  in a few moments he had left not only his companion but the last straggling houses of the outskirts far behind him and had struck out in a long swinging trot for the disused cutoff already he fancied he heard the note of clamor in indian spring and thought he distinguished the sound of hurrying hoofs on the great highway but the sunken trail hid it from his view from the column of smoke now plainly visible in the growing morning light he tried to locate the scene of the conflagration it was evidently not a fire advancing regularly from the outer skirt of the wood communicated to it from the divide it was a local outburst near its centre it was not in the direction of his cabin in the tree there was no immediate danger to teresa unless fear drove her beyond the confines of the wood into the hands of those who might recognize her the screaming of jays and ravens above his head quickened his speed as it heralded the rapid advance of the flames and the unexpected apparition of a bounding body flattened and flying over the yellow plain told him that even the secure retreat of the mountain wildcat had been invaded a sudden recollection of teresas uncontrollable terror that first night smote him with remorse and redoubled his efforts alone in the track of these frantic and bewildered beasts to what madness might she not be driven  the sharp crack of a rifle from the high road turned his course momentarily in that direction the smoke was curling lazily over the heads of the party of men in the road while the huge hulk of a grizzly was disappearing in the distance a battue of the escaping animals had commenced in the bitterness of his heart he caught at the horrible suggestion and resolved to save her from them or die with her there  how fast he ran or the time it took him to reach the woods has never been known their outlines were already hidden when he entered them to a sense less keen a courage less desperate and a purpose less unaltered than lows the wood would have been impenetrable the central fire was still confined to the lofty tree tops but the downward rush of wind from time to time drove the smoke into the aisles in blinding and suffocating volumes to simulate the creeping animals and fall to the ground on hands and knees feel his way through the underbrush when the smoke was densest or take advantage of its momentary lifting and without uncertainty mistake or hesitation glide from tree to tree in one undeviating course was possible only to an experienced woodsman to keep his reason and insight so clear as to be able in the midst of this bewildering confusion to shape that course so as to intersect the wild and unknown tract of an inexperienced frightened wanderer belonged to low and low alone he was making his way against the wind towards the fire he had reasoned that she was either in comparative safety to windward of it or he should meet her being driven towards him by it or find her succumbed and fainting at its feet to do this he must penetrate the burning belt and then pass under the blazing dome he was already upon it he could see the falling fire dropping like rain or blown like gorgeous blossoms of the conflagration across his path the space was lit up brilliantly the vast shafts of dull copper cast no shadow below but there was no sign nor token of any human being for a moment the young man was at fault it was true this hidden heart of the forest bore no undergrowth the cool matted carpet of the aisles seemed to quench the glowing fragments as they fell escape might be difficult but not impossible yet every moment was precious he leaned against a tree and sent his voice like a clarion before him teresa there was no reply he called again a faint cry at his back from the trail he had just traversed made him turn only a few paces behind him blinded and staggering but following like a beaten and wounded animal teresa halted knelt clasped her hands and dumbly held them out before her teresa he cried again and sprang to her side  she caught him by the knees and lifted her face imploringly to his  say that again she cried passionately tell me it was teresa you called and no other you have come back for me you would not let me die here alone  he lifted her tenderly in his arms and cast a rapid glance around him it might have been his fancy but there seemed a dull glow in the direction he had come  you do not speak she said tell me you did not come here to seek her  whom he said quickly  nellie  with a sharp cry he let her slip to the ground all the pentup agony rage and mortification of the last hour broke from him in that inarticulate outburst then catching her hands again he dragged her to his level  hear me he cried disregarding the whirling smoke and the fiery baptism that sprinkled themhear me if you value your life if you value your soul and if you do not want me to cast you to the beasts like jezebel of old nevernever take that accursed name again upon your lips seek herher yes seek her to tie her like a witchs daughter of hell to that blazing tree he stopped forgive me he said in a changed voice im mad and forgetting myself and you come  without noticing the expression of halfsavage delight that had passed across her face he lifted her in his arms  which way are you going she asked passing her hands vaguely across his breast as if to reassure herself of his identity  to our camp by the scarred tree he replied  not there not there she said hurriedly i was driven from there just now i thought the fire began there until i came here  then it was as he feared obeying the same mysterious law that had launched this fatal fire like a thunderbolt from the burning mountain crest five miles away into the heart of the carquinez woods it had again leaped a mile beyond and was hemming them between two narrowing lines of fire but low was not daunted retracing his steps through the blinding smoke he strode off at right angles to the trail near the point where he had entered the wood it was the spot where he had first lifted nellie in his arms to carry her to the hidden spring if any recollection of it crossed his mind at that moment it was only shown in his redoubled energy he did not glide through the thick underbrush as on that day but seemed to take a savage pleasure in breaking through it with sheer brute force once teresa insisted upon relieving him of the burden of her weight but after a few steps she staggered blindly against him and would fain have recourse once more to his strong arms and so alternately staggering bending crouching or bounding and crashing on but always in one direction they burst through the jealous rampart and came upon the sylvan haunt of the hidden spring the great angle of the halffallen tree acted as a harrier to the wind and drifting smoke and the cool spring sparkled and bubbled in the almost translucent air he laid her down beside the water and bathed her face and hands as he did so his quick eye caught sight of a womans handkerchief lying at the foot of the disrupted root dropping teresas hand he walked towards it and with the toe of his moccasin gave it one vigorous kick into the ooze at the overflow of the spring he turned to teresa but she evidently had not noticed the act  where are you she asked with a smile  something in her movement struck him he came towards her and bending down looked into her face teresa good godlook at me what has happened  she raised her eyes to his there was a slight film across them the lids were blackened the beautiful lashes gone forever  i see you a little now i think she said with a smile passing her hands vaguely over his face it must have happened when he fainted and i had to drag him through the blazing brush both my hands were full and i could not cover my eyes  drag whom said low quickly  why dunn  dunn he here said low hoarsely  yes didnt you read the note i left on the herbarium didnt you come to the campfire she asked hurriedly clasping his hands tell me quickly  no  then you were not therethen you didnt leave me to die  no i swear it teresa the stoicism that had upheld his own agony breaking down before her strong emotion  thank god she threw her arms around him and hid her aching eyes in his troubled breast  tell me all teresa he whispered in her listening ear dont move stay there and tell me all  with her face buried in his bosom as if speaking to his heart alone she told him part but not all with her eyes filled with tears but a smile on her lips radiant with newfound happiness she told him how she had overheard the plans of dunn and brace how she had stolen their conveyance to warn him in time but here she stopped dreading to say a word that would shatter the hope she was building upon his sudden revulsion of feeling for nellie she could not bring herself to repeat their interviewthat would come later when they were safe and out of danger now not even the secret of his birth must come between them with its distraction to mar their perfect communion she faltered that dunn had fainted from weakness and that she had dragged him out of danger he will never interfere with usi mean she said softly with me again i can promise you that as well as if he had sworn it  let him pass now said low that will come later on he added unconsciously repeating her thought in a tone that made her heart sick but tell me teresa why did you go to excelsior  she buried her head still deeper as if to hide it he felt her broken heart beat against his own he was conscious of a depth of feeling her rival had never awakened in him the possibility of teresa loving him had never occurred to his simple nature he bent his head and kissed her she was frightened and unloosed her clinging arms but he retained her hand and said we will leave this accursed place and you shall go with me as you said you would nor need you ever leave me unless you wish it  she could hear the beating of her own heart through his words she longed to look at the eyes and lips that told her this and read the meaning his voice alone could not entirely convey for the first time she felt the loss of her sight she did not know that it was in this moment of happiness the last blessing vouchsafed to her miserable life  a few moments of silence followed broken only by the distant rumor of the conflagration and the crash of falling boughs  it may be an hour yet he whispered before the fire has swept a path for us to the road below we are safe here unless some sudden current should draw the fire down upon us you are not frightened she pressed his hand she was thinking of the pale face of dunn lying in the secure retreat she had purchased for him at such a sacrifice yet the possibility of danger to him now for a moment marred her present happiness and security you think the fire will not go north of where you found me she asked softly  i think not he said but i will reconnoitre stay where you are  they pressed hands and parted he leaped upon the slanting trunk and ascended it rapidly she waited in mute expectation  there was a sudden movement of the root on which she sat a deafening crash and she was thrown forward on her face  the vast bulk of the leaning tree dislodged from its aerial support by the gradual sapping of the spring at its roots or by the crumbling of the bark from the heat had slipped made a half revolution and falling overbore the lesser trees in its path and tore in its resistless momentum a broad opening to the underbrush  with a cry to low teresa staggered to her feet there was an interval of hideous silence but no reply she called again there was a sudden deepening roar the blast of a fiery furnace swept through the opening a thousand luminous points around her burst into fire and in an instant she was lost in a whirlwind of smoke and flame from the onset of its fury to its culmination twenty minutes did not elapse but in that interval a radius of two hundred yards around the hidden spring was swept of life and light and motion  for the rest of that day and part of the night a pall of smoke hung above the scene of desolation it lifted only towards the morning when the moon rising high picked out in black and silver the shrunken and silent columns of those roofless vaults shorn of base and capital it flickered on the still overflowing pool of the hidden spring and shone upon the white face of low who with a rootlet of the fallen tree holding him down like an arm across his breast seemed to be sleeping peacefully in the sleeping water        contemporaneous history touched him as briefly but not as gently it is now definitely ascertained said the slumgullion mirror that sheriff dunn met his fate in the carquinez woods in the performance of his duty that fearless man having received information of the concealment of a band of horse thieves in their recesses the desperadoes are presumed to have escaped as the only remains found are those of two wretched tramps one of whom is said to have been a digger who supported himself upon roots and herbs and the other a degraded halfwhite woman it is not unreasonable to suppose that the fire originated through their carelessness although father wynn of the first baptist church in his powerful discourse of last sunday pointed at the warning and lesson of such catastrophes it may not be out of place here to say that the rumors regarding an engagement between the pastors accomplished daughter and the late lamented sheriff are utterly without foundation as it has been an on dit for some time in all wellinformed circles that the indefatigable mr brace of wells fargo and cos express will shortly lead the lady to the hymeneal altar
