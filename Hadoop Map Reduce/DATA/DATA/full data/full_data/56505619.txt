emerged from the knightsbridge hotel where he was staying in the afternoon of the 12th of may 1920 with the intention of visiting a collection of pictures in a gallery off cork street and looking into the future he walked since the war he never took a cab if he could help it their drivers were in his view an uncivil lot though now that the war was over and supply beginning to exceed demand again getting more civil in accordance with the custom of human nature still he had not forgiven them deeply identifying them with gloomy memories and now dimly like all members of their class with revolution the considerable anxiety he had passed through during the war and the more considerable anxiety he had since undergone in the peace had produced psychological consequences in a tenacious nature he had mentally so frequently experienced ruin that he had ceased to believe in its material probability paying away four thousand a year in income and supertax one could not very well be worse off a fortune of a quarter of a million encumbered only by a wife and one daughter and very diversely invested afforded substantial guarantee even against that wildcat notiona levy on capital and as to confiscation of war profits he was entirely in favor of it for he had none and serve the beggars right the price of pictures moreover had if anything gone up and he had done better with his collection since the war began than ever before airraids also had acted beneficially on a spirit congenitally cautious and hardened a character already dogged to be in danger of being entirely dispersed inclined one to be less apprehensive of the more partial dispersions involved in levies and taxation while the habit of condemning the impudence of the germans had led naturally to condemning that of labor if not openly at least in the sanctuary of his soul  he walked there was moreover time to spare for fleur was to meet him at the gallery at four oclock and it was as yet but half past two it was good for him to walkhis liver was a little constricted and his nerves rather on edge his wife was always out when she was in town and his daughter would flibbertygibbet all over the place like most young women since the war still he must be thankful that she had been too young to do anything in that war itself not of course that he had not supported the war from its inception with all his soul but between that and supporting it with the bodies of his wife and daughter there had been a gap fixed by something oldfashioned within him which abhorred emotional extravagance he had for instance strongly objected to annette so attractive and in 1914 only thirtyfive going to her native france her chere patrie as under the stimulus of war she had begun to call it to nurse her braves poilus forsooth ruining her health and her looks as if she were really a nurse he had put a stopper on it let her do needlework for them at home or knit she had not gone therefore and had never been quite the same woman since a bad tendency of hers to mock at him not openly but in continual little ways had grown as for fleur the war had resolved the vexed problem whether or not she should go to school she was better away from her mother in her war mood from the chance of airraids and the impetus to do extravagant things so he had placed her in a seminary as far west as had seemed to him compatible with excellence and had missed her horribly fleur he had never regretted the somewhat outlandish name by which at her birth he had decided so suddenly to call hermarked concession though it had been to the french fleur a pretty namea pretty child but restlesstoo restless and wilful knowing her power too over her father soames often reflected on the mistake it was to dote on his daughter to get old and dote sixtyfive he was getting on but he didnt feel it for fortunately perhaps considering annettes youth and good looks his second marriage had turned out a cool affair he had known but one real passion in his lifefor that first wife of hisirene yes and that fellow his cousin jolyon who had gone off with her was looking very shaky they said no wonder at seventytwo after twenty years of a third marriage  soames paused a moment in his march to lean over the railings of the row a suitable spot for reminiscence halfway between that house in park lane which had seen his birth and his parents deaths and the little house in montpellier square where thirtyfive years ago he had enjoyed his first edition of matrimony now after twenty years of his second edition that old tragedy seemed to him like a previous existencewhich had ended when fleur was born in place of the son he had hoped for for many years he had ceased regretting even vaguely the son who had not been born fleur filled the bill in his heart after all she bore his name and he was not looking forward at all to the time when she would change it indeed if he ever thought of such a calamity it was seasoned by the vague feeling that he could make her rich enough to purchase perhaps and extinguish the name of the fellow who married herwhy not since as it seemed women were equal to men nowadays and soames secretly convinced that they were not passed his curved hand over his face vigorously till it reached the comfort of his chin thanks to abstemious habits he had not grown fat and flabby his nose was pale and thin his grey moustache closeclipped his eyesight unimpaired a slight stoop closened and corrected the expansion given to his face by the heightening of his forehead in the recession of his grey hair little change had time wrought in the warmest of the young forsytes as the last of the old forsytestimothynow in his hundred and first year would have phrased it  the shade from the planetrees fell on his neat homburg hat he had given up top hatsit was no use attracting attention to wealth in days like these planetrees his thoughts travelled sharply to madridthe easter before the war when having to make up his mind about that goya picture he had taken a voyage of discovery to study the painter on his spot the fellow had impressed himgreat range real genius highly as the chap ranked he would rank even higher before they had finished with him the second goya craze would be greater even than the first oh yes and he had bought on that visit he hadas never beforecommissioned a copy of a fresco painting called la vendimia wherein was the figure of a girl with an arm akimbo who had reminded him of his daughter he had it now in the gallery at mapledurham and rather poor it wasyou couldnt copy goya he would still look at it however if his daughter were not there for the sake of something irresistibly reminiscent in the light erect balance of the figure the width between the arching eyebrows the eager dreaming of the dark eyes curious that fleur should have dark eyes when his own were greyno pure forsyte had brown eyesand her mothers blue but of course her grandmother lamottes eyes were dark as treacle  he began to walk on again towards hyde park corner no greater change in all england than in the row born almost within hail of it he could remember it from 1860 on brought there as a child between the crinolines to stare at tighttrousered dandies in whiskers riding with a cavalry seat to watch the doffing of curlybrimmed and white top hats the leisurely air of it all and the little bowlegged man in a long red waistcoat who used to come among the fashion with dogs on several strings and try to sell one to his mother king charles spaniels italian greyhounds affectionate to her crinolineyou never saw them now you saw no quality of any sort indeed just working people sitting in dull rows with nothing to stare at but a few young bouncing females in pot hats riding astride or desultory colonials charging up and down on dismallooking hacks with here and there little girls on ponies or old gentlemen jogging their livers or an orderly trying a great galumphing cavalry horse no thoroughbreds no grooms no bowing no scraping no gossipnothing only the trees the samethe trees indifferent to the generations and declensions of mankind a democratic englanddishevelled hurried noisy and seemingly without an apex and that something fastidious in the soul of soames turned over within him gone for ever the close borough of rank and polish wealth there wasoh yes wealthhe himself was a richer man than his father had ever been but manners flavour quality all gone engulfed in one vast ugly shoulderrubbing petrolsmelling cheerio little halfbeaten pockets of gentility and caste lurking here and there dispersed and chetif as annette would say but nothing ever again firm and coherent to look up to and into this new hurlyburly of bad manners and loose morals his daughterflower of his lifewas flung and when those labour chaps got powerif they ever didthe worst was yet to come  he passed out under the archway at last no longerthank goodnessdisfigured by the gungrey of its searchlight theyd better put a searchlight on to where theyre all going he thought and light up their precious democracy and he directed his steps along the club fronts of piccadilly george forsyte of course would be sitting in the bay window of the iseeum the chap was so big now that he was there nearly all his time like some immovable sardonic humorous eye noting the decline of men and things and soames hurried ever constitutionally uneasy beneath his cousins glance george who as he had heard had written a letter signed patriot in the middle of the war complaining of the governments hysteria in docking the oats of racehorses yes there he was tall ponderous neat cleanshaven with his smooth hair hardly thinned smelling no doubt of the best hairwash and a pink paper in his hand well he didnt change and for perhaps the first time in his life soames felt a kind of sympathy tapping in his waistcoat for that sardonic kinsman with his weight his perfectly parted hair and bulllike gaze he was a guarantee that the old order would take some shifting yet he saw george move the pink paper as if inviting him to ascendthe chap must want to ask something about his property it was still under soamess control for in the adoption of a sleeping partnership at that painful period twenty years back when he had divorced irene soames had found himself almost insensibly retaining control of all purely forsyte affairs  hesitating for just a moment he nodded and went in since the death of his brotherinlaw montague dartie in paris which no one had quite known what to make of except that it was certainly not suicidethe iseeum club had seemed more respectable to soames george too he knew had sown the last of his wild oats and was committed definitely to the joys of the table eating only of the very best so as to keep his weight down and owning as he said just one or two old screws to give me an interest in life he joined his cousin therefore in the bay window without the embarrassing sense of indiscretion he had been used to feel up there george put out a wellkept hand  havent seen you since the war he said hows your wife  thanks said soames coldly well enough  some hidden jest curved for a moment georges fleshy face and gloated from his eye  that belgian chap profond he said is a member here now hes a rum customer  quite muttered soames what did you want to see me about  old timothy he might go off the hooks at any moment i suppose hes made his will  yes  well you or somebody ought to give him a look uplast of the old lot hes a hundred you know they say hes like a mummy where are you goin to put him he ought to have a pyramid by rights  soames shook his head highgate the family vault  well i suppose the old girls would miss him if he was anywhere else they say he still takes an interest in food he might last on you know dont we get anything for the old forsytes ten of themaverage age eightyeighti worked it out that ought to be equal to triplets  is that all said soames i must be getting on  you unsociable devil georges eyes seemed to answer  yes thats all look him up in his mausoleumthe old chap might want to prophesy the grin died on the rich curves of his face and he added havent you attorneys invented a way yet of dodging this damned income tax it hits the fixed inherited income like the very deuce i used to have two thousand five hundred a year now ive got a beggarly fifteen hundred and the price of living doubled  ah murmured soames the turfs in danger  over georges face moved a gleam of sardonic selfdefence  well he said they brought me up to do nothing and here i am in the sere and yellow getting poorer every day these labour chaps mean to have the lot before theyve done what are you going to do for a living when it comes i shall work a sixhour day teaching politicians how to see a joke take my tip soames go into parliament make sure of your four hundredand employ me  and as soames retired he resumed his seat in the bay window  soames moved along piccadilly deep in reflections excited by his cousins words he himself had always been a worker and a saver george always a drone and a spender and yet if confiscation once began it was hethe worker and the saverwho would be looted that was the negation of all virtue the overturning of all forsyte principles could civilisation be built on any other he did not think so well they wouldnt confiscate his pictures for they wouldnt know their worth but what would they be worth if these maniacs once began to milk capital a drug on the market i dont care about myself he thought i could live on five hundred a year and never know the difference at my age but fleur this fortune so wisely invested these treasures so carefully chosen and amassed were all for her and if it should turn out that he couldnt give or leave them to herwell life had no meaning and what was the use of going in to look at this crazy futuristic stuff with the view of seeing whether it had any future  arriving at the gallery off cork street however he paid his shilling picked up a catalogue and entered some ten persons were prowling round soames took steps and came on what looked to him like a lamppost bent by collision with a motor omnibus it was advanced some three paces from the wall and was described in his catalogue as jupiter he examined it with curiosity having recently turned some of his attention to sculpture if thats jupiter he thought i wonder what junos like and suddenly he saw her opposite she appeared to him like nothing so much as a pump with two handles lightly clad in snow he was still gazing at her when two of the prowlers halted on his left epatant he heard one say  jargon growled soames to himself  the others boyish voice replied  missed it old bean hes pulling your leg when jove and juno created he them he was saying ill see how much these fools will swallow and theyve lapped up the lot  you young duffer vospovitch is an innovator dont you see that hes brought satire into sculpture the future of plastic art of music painting and even architecture has set in satiric it was bound to people are tiredthe bottoms tumbled out of sentiment  well im quite equal to taking a little interest in beauty i was through the war youve dropped your handkerchief sir  soames saw a handkerchief held out in front of him he took it with some natural suspicion and approached it to his nose it had the right scentof distant eau de cologneand his initials in a corner slightly reassured he raised his eyes to the young mans face it had rather fawnlike ears a laughing mouth with half a toothbrush growing out of it on each side and small lively eyes above a normally dressed appearance  thank you he said and moved by a sort of irritation added glad to hear you like beauty thats rare nowadays  i dote on it said the young man but you and i are the last of the old guard sir  soames smiled  if you really care for pictures he said heres my card i can show you some quite good ones any sunday if youre down the river and care to look in  awfully nice of you sir ill drop in like a bird my names montmichael and he took off his hat  soames already regretting his impulse raised his own slightly in response with a downward look at the young mans companion who had a purple tie dreadful little sluglike whiskers and a scornful lookas if he were a poet  it was the first indiscretion he had committed for so long that he went and sat down in an alcove what had possessed him to give his card to a rackety young fellow who went about with a thing like that and fleur always at the back of his thoughts started out like a filagree figure from a clock when the hour strikes on the screen opposite the alcove was a large canvas with a great many square tomatocolored blobs on it and nothing else so far as soames could see from where he sat he looked at his catalogue no 32the future townpaul post i suppose thats satiric too he thought what a thing but his second impulse was more cautious it did not do to condemn hurriedly there had been those stripey streaky creations of monets which had turned out such trumps and then the stippled school and gauguin why even since the postimpressionists there had been one or two painters not to be sneezed at during the thirtyeight years of his connoisseurs life indeed he had marked so many movements seen the tides of taste and technique so ebb and flow that there was really no telling anything except that there was money to be made out of every change of fashion this too might quite well be a case where one must subdue primordial instinct or lose the market he got up and stood before the picture trying hard to see it with the eyes of other people above the tomato blobs was what he took to be a sunset till some one passing said hes got the airplanes wonderfully dont you think below the tomato blobs was a band of white with vertical black stripes to which he could assign no meaning whatever till some one else came by murmuring what expression he gets with his foreground expression of what soames went back to his seat the thing was rich as his father would have said and he wouldnt give a damn for it expression ah they were all expressionists now he had heard on the continent so it was coming here too was it he remembered the first wave of influenza in 1887or 8hatched in china so they said he wondered where thisthis expressionismhad been hatched the thing was a regular disease  he had become conscious of a woman and a youth standing between him and the future town their backs were turned but very suddenly soames put his catalogue before his face and drawing his hat forward gazed through the slit between no mistaking that back elegant as ever though the hair above had gone grey irene his divorced wifeirene and this no doubt was her sonby that fellow jolyon forsytetheir boy six months older than his own girl and mumbling over in his mind the bitter days of his divorce he rose to get out of sight but quickly sat down again she had turned her head to speak to her boy her profile was still so youthful that it made her grey hair seem powdery as if fancydressed and her lips were smiling as soames first possessor of them had never seen them smile grudgingly he admitted her still beautiful and in figure almost as young as ever and how that boy smiled back at her emotion squeezed soames heart the sight infringed his sense of justice he grudged her that boys smileit went beyond what fleur gave him and it was undeserved their son might have been his son fleur might have been her daughter if she had kept straight he lowered his catalogue if she saw him all the better a reminder of her conduct in the presence of her son who probably knew nothing of it would be a salutary touch from the finger of that nemesis which surely must soon or late visit her then halfconscious that such a thought was extravagant for a forsyte of his age soames took out his watch past four fleur was late she had gone to his niece imogen cardigans and there they would keep her smoking cigarettes and gossiping and that he heard the boy laugh and say eagerly i say mum is this one of auntie junes lame ducks  paul posti believe it is darling  the word produced a little shock in soames he had never heard her use it and then she saw him his eyes must have had in them something of george forsytes sardonic look for her gloved hand crisped the folds of her frock her eyebrows rose her face went stony she moved on  it is a caution said the boy catching her arm again  soames stared after them that boy was goodlooking with a forsyte chin and eyes deepgrey deep in but with something sunny like a glass of old sherry spilled over him his smile perhaps his hair better than they deservedthose two they passed from his view into the next room and soames continued to regard the future town but saw it not a little smile snarled up his lips he was despising the vehemence of his own feelings after all these years ghosts and yet as one grew oldwas there anything but what was ghostlike left yes there was fleur he fixed his eyes on the entrance she was due but she would keep him waiting of course and suddenly he became aware of a sort of human breezea short slight form clad in a seagreen djibbah with a metal belt and a fillet binding unruly redgold hair all streaked with grey she was talking to the gallery attendants and something familiar riveted his gazein her eyes her chin her hair her spiritsomething which suggested a thin skye terrier just before its dinner surely june forsyte his cousin juneand coming straight to his recess she sat down beside him deep in thought took out a tablet and made a pencil note soames sat unmoving a confounded thing cousinship disgusting he heard her murmur then as if resenting the presence of an overhearing stranger she looked at him the worst had happened  soames  soames turned his head a very little  how are you he said havent seen you for twenty years  no whatever made you come here  my sins said soames what stuff  stuff oh yesof course it hasnt arrived yet  it never will said soames it must be making a dead loss  of course it is  how dyou know  its my gallery  soames sniffed from sheer surprise  yours what on earth makes you run a show like this  i dont treat art as if it were grocery  soames pointed to the future town look at that whos going to live in a town like that or with it on his walls  june contemplated the picture for a moment its a vision she said  the deuce  there was silence then june rose crazylooking creature he thought  well he said youll find your young stepbrother here with a woman i used to know if you take my advice youll close this exhibition  june looked back at him oh you forsyte she said and moved on about her light flyaway figure passing so suddenly away was a look of dangerous decisions forsyte of course he was a forsyte and so was she but from the time when as a mere girl she brought bosinney into his life to wreck it he had never hit it off with juneand never would and here she was unmarried to this day owning a gallery and suddenly it came to soames how little he knew now of his own family the old aunts at timothys had been dead so many years there was no clearinghouse for news what had they all done in the war young rogers boy had been wounded st john haymans second son killed young nicholas eldest had got an o b e or whatever they gave them they had all joined up somehow he believed that boy of jolyons and irenes he supposed had been too young his own generation of course too old though giles hayman had driven a car for the red crossand jesse hayman been a special constablethose dromios had always been of a sporting type as for himself he had given a motor ambulance read the papers till he was sick of them passed through much anxiety invested in war bonds bought no clothes lost seven pounds in weight he didnt know what more he could have done at his age indeed it struck him that he and his family had taken this war very differently to that affair with the boers which had been supposed to tax all the resources of the empire in that old war of course his nephew val dartie had been wounded that fellow jolyons first son had died of enteric the dromios had gone out on horses and june had been a nurse but all that had seemed in the nature of a portent while in this war everybody had done their bit so far as he could make out as a matter of course it seemed to show the growth of something or otheror perhaps the decline of something else had the forsytes become less individual or more imperial or less provincial or was it simply that one hated germans why didnt fleur come so that he could get away he saw those three return together from the other room and pass back along the far side of the screen the boy was standing before the juno now and suddenly on the other side of her soames sawhis daughter with eyebrows raised as well they might be he could see her eyes glint sideways at the boy and the boy look back at her then irene slipped her hand through his arm and drew him on soames saw him glancing round and fleur looking after them as the three went out  a voice said cheerfully bit thick isnt it sir  the young man who had handed him his handkerchief was again passing soames nodded  i dont know what were coming to  oh thats all right sir answered the young man cheerfully they dont either  fleurs voice said precisely as if he had been keeping her waiting  hallo father there you are  the young man snatching off his hat passed on  well said soames looking her up and down youre a punctual sort of young woman  this treasured possession of his life was of medium height and color with short darkchestnut hair her wideapart brown eyes were set in whites so clear that they glinted when they moved and yet in repose were almost dreamy under very white blacklashed lids held over them in a sort of suspense she had a charming profile and nothing of her father in her face save a decided chin aware that his expression was softening as he looked at her soames frowned to preserve the unemotionalism proper to a forsyte he knew she was only too inclined to take advantage of his weakness  slipping her hand under his arm she said  who was that  he picked up my handkerchief we talked about the pictures  youre not going to buy that father  no said soames grimly nor that juno youve been looking at  fleur dragged at his arm oh lets go its a ghastly show  in the doorway they passed the young man called mont and his partner but soames had hung out a board marked trespassers will be prosecuted and he barely acknowledged the young fellows salute  well he said in the street whom did you meet at imogens  aunt winifred and that monsieur profond  oh muttered soames that chap what does your aunt see in him  i dont know he looks pretty deepmother says she likes him  soames grunted  cousin val and his wife were there too  what said soames i thought they were back in south africa  oh no theyve sold their farm cousin val is going to train racehorses on the sussex downs theyve got a jolly old manorhouse they asked me down there  soames coughed the news was distasteful to him whats his wife like now  very quiet but nice i think  soames coughed again hes a rackety chap your cousin val  oh no father theyre awfully devoted i promised to gosaturday to wednesday next  training racehorses said soames it was bad enough but not the reason for his distaste why the deuce couldnt his nephew have stayed out in south africa his own divorce had been bad enough without his nephews marriage to the daughter of the corespondent a halfsister too of june and of that boy whom fleur had just been looking at from under the pumphandle if he didnt look out fleur would come to know all about that old disgrace unpleasant things they were round him this afternoon like a swarm of bees  i dont like it he said  i want to see the racehorses murmured fleur and theyve promised i shall ride cousin val cant walk much you know but he can ride perfectly hes going to show me their gallops  racing said soames its a pity the war didnt knock that on the head hes taking after his father im afraid  i dont know anything about his father  no said soames grimly he took an interest in horses and broke his neck in paris walking downstairs good riddance for your aunt he frowned recollecting the inquiry into those stairs which he had attended in paris six years ago because montague dartie could not attend it himselfperfectly normal stairs in a house where they played baccarat either his winnings or the way he had celebrated them had gone to his brotherinlaws head the french procedure had been very loose he had had a lot of trouble with it  a sound from fleur distracted his attention look the people who were in the gallery with us  what people muttered soames who knew perfectly well  i think that womans beautiful  come into this pastrycooks said soames abruptly and tightening his grip on her arm he turned into a confectioners it wasfor hima surprising thing to do and he said rather anxiously what will you have  oh i dont want anything i had a cocktail and a tremendous lunch  we must have something now were here muttered soames keeping hold of her arm  two teas he said and two of those nougat things  but no sooner was his body seated than his soul sprang up those threethose three were coming in he heard irene say something to her boy and his answer  oh no mum this place is all right my stunt and the three sat down  at that moment most awkward of his existence crowded with ghosts and shadows from his past in presence of the only two women he had ever lovedhis divorced wife and his daughter by her successorsoames was not so much afraid of them as of his cousin june she might make a sceneshe might introduce those two childrenshe was capable of anything he bit too hastily at the nougat and it stuck to his plate working at it with his finger he glanced at fleur she was masticating dreamily but her eyes were on the boy the forsyte in him said think feel and youre done for and he wiggled his finger desperately plate did jolyon wear a plate did that woman wear a plate time had been when he had seen her wearing nothing that was something anyway which had never been stolen from him and she knew it though she might sit there calm and selfpossessed as if she had never been his wife an acid humor stirred in his forsyte blood a subtle pain divided by hairsbreadth from pleasure if only june did not suddenly bring her hornets about his ears the boy was talking  of course auntie juneso he called his halfsister auntie did hewell she must be fifty if she was a dayits jolly good of you to encourage them onlyhang it all soames stole a glance irenes startled eyes were bent watchfully on her boy sheshe had these devotionsfor bosinneyfor that boys fatherfor this boy he touched fleurs arm and said  well have you had enough  one more father please  she would be sick he went to the counter to pay when he turned round again he saw fleur standing near the door holding a handkerchief which the boy had evidently just handed to her  ff he heard her say fleur forsyteits mine all right thank you ever so  good god she had caught the trick from what hed told her in the gallerymonkey  forsyte whythats my name too perhaps were cousins  really we must be there arent any others i live at mapledurham where do you  robin hill  question and answer had been so rapid that all was over before he could lift a finger he saw irenes face alive with startled feeling gave the slightest shake of his head and slipped his arm through fleurs  come along he said  she did not move  didnt you hear father isnt it queerour names the same are we cousins  whats that he said forsyte distant perhaps  my names jolyon sir jon for short  oh ah said soames yes distant how are you very good of you goodbye  he moved on  thanks awfully fleur was saying au revoir  au revoir he heard the boy reply     ii  fine fleur forsyte   emerging from the pastrycooks soames first impulse was to vent his nerves by saying to his daughter dropping your handkerchief to which her reply might well be i picked that up from you his second impulse therefore was to let sleeping dogs lie but she would surely question him he gave her a sidelong look and found she was giving him the same she said softly  why dont you like those cousins father  soames lifted the corner of his lip  what made you think that  cela se voit  that sees itself what a way of putting it  after twenty years of a french wife soames had still little sympathy with her language a theatrical affair and connected in his mind with all the refinements of domestic irony  how he asked  you must know them and you didnt make a sign i saw them looking at you  ive never seen the boy in my life replied soames with perfect truth  no but youve seen the others dear  soames gave her another look what had she picked up had her aunt winifred or imogen or val dartie and his wife been talking every breath of the old scandal had been carefully kept from her at home and winifred warned many times that he wouldnt have a whisper of it reach her for the world so far as she ought to know he had never been married before but her dark eyes whose southern glint and clearness often almost frightened him met his with perfect innocence  well he said your grandfather and his brother had a quarrel the two families dont know each other  how romantic  now what does she mean by that he thought the word was to him extravagant and dangerousit was as if she had said how jolly  and theyll continue not to know each other he added but instantly regretted the challenge in those words fleur was smiling in this age when young people prided themselves on going their own ways and paying no attention to any sort of decent prejudice he had said the very thing to excite her wilfulness then recollecting the expression on irenes face he breathed again  what sort of a quarrel he heard fleur say  about a house its ancient history for you your grandfather died the day you were born he was ninety  ninety are there many forsytes besides those in the red book  i dont know said soames theyre all dispersed now the old ones are dead except timothy  fleur clasped her hands  timothy isnt that delicious  not at all said soames it offended him that she should think timothy deliciousa kind of insult to his breed this new generation mocked at anything solid and tenacious you go and see the old boy he might want to prophesy ah if timothy could see the disquiet england of his greatnephews and greatnieces he would certainly give tongue and involuntarily he glanced up at the iseeum yesgeorge was still in the window with the same pink paper in his hand  where is robin hill father  robin hill robin hill round which all that tragedy had centred what did she want to know for  in surrey he muttered not far from richmond why  is the house there  what house  that they quarrelled about  yes but whats all that to do with you were going home tomorrowyoud better be thinking about your frocks  bless you theyre all thought about a family feud its like the bible or mark twainawfully exciting what did you do in the feud father  never you mind  oh but if im to keep it up  who said you were to keep it up  you darling  i i said it had nothing to do with you  just what i think you know so thats all right  she was too sharp for him fine as annette sometimes called her nothing for it but to distract her attention  theres a bit of rosaline point in here he said stopping before a shop that i thought you might like  when he had paid for it and they had resumed their progress fleur said  dont you think that boys mother is the most beautiful woman of her age youve ever seen  soames shivered uncanny the way she stuck to it  i dont know that i noticed her  dear i saw the corner of your eye  you see everythingand a great deal more it seems to me  whats her husband like he must be your first cousin if your fathers were brothers  dead for all i know said soames with sudden vehemence i havent seen him for twenty years  what was he  a painter  thats quite jolly  the words if you want to please me youll put those people out of your head sprang to soamess lips but he choked them backhe must not let her see his feelings  he once insulted me he said  her quick eyes rested on his face  i see you didnt avenge it and it rankles poor father you let me have a go  it was really like lying in the dark with a mosquito hovering above his face such pertinacity in fleur was new to him and as they reached the hotel he said grimly  i did my best and thats enough about these people im going up till dinner  i shall sit here  with a parting look at her extended in a chaira look halfresentful halfadoringsoames moved into the lift and was transported to their suite on the fourth floor he stood by the window of the sittingroom which gave view over hyde park and drummed a finger on its pane his feelings were confused tetchy troubled the throb of that old wound scarred over by time and new interests was mingled with displeasure and anxiety and a slight pain in his chest where that nougat stuff had disagreed had annette come in not that she was any good to him in such a difficulty whenever she had questioned him about his first marriage he had always shut her up she knew nothing of it save that it had been the great passion of his life and his marriage with herself but domestic makeshift she had always kept the grudge of that up her sleeve as it were and used it commercially he listened a soundthe vague murmur of a womans movementswas coming through the door she was in he tapped  who  i said soames  she had been changing her frock and was still imperfectly clothed a striking figure before her glass there was a certain magnificence about her arms shoulders hair which had darkened since he first knew her about the turn of her neck the silkiness of her garments her darklashed greyblue eyesshe was certainly as handsome at forty as she had ever been a fine possession an excellent housekeeper a sensible and affectionate enough mother if only she werent always so frankly cynical about the relations between them soames who had no more real affection for her than she had for him suffered from a kind of english grievance in that she had never dropped even the thinnest veil of sentiment over their partnership like most of his countrymen and women he held the view that marriage should be based on mutual love but that when from a marriage love had disappeared or been found never to have really existedso that it was manifestly not based on loveyou must not admit it there it was and the love was notbut there you were and must continue to be thus you had it both ways and were not tarred with cynicism realism and immorality like the french moreover it was necessary in the interests of propriety he knew that she knew that they both knew there was no love between them but he still expected her not to admit in words or conduct such a thing and he could never understand what she meant when she talked of the hypocrisy of the english he said  whom have you got at the shelter next week  annette went on touching her lips delicately with salvehe always wished she wouldnt do that  your sister winifred and the carrdigansshe took up a tiny stick of blackand prosper profond  that belgian chap why him  annette turned her neck lazily touched one eyelash and said  he amuses winifred  i want some one to amuse fleur shes restive  rrestive repeated annette is it the first time you see that my friend she was born rrestive as you call it  would she never get that affected roll out of her rs  he touched the dress she had taken off and asked  what have you been doing  annette looked at him reflected in her glass her justbrightened lips smiled rather full rather ironical  enjoying myself she said  oh answered soames glumly ribbandry i suppose  it was his word for all that incomprehensible running in and out of shops that women went in for has fleur got her summer dresses  you dont ask if i have mine  you dont care whether i do or not  quite right well she has and i have mineterribly expensive  hm said soames what does that chap profond do in england  annette raised the eyebrows she had just finished  he yachts  ah said soames hes a sleepy chap  sometimes answered annette and her face had a sort of quiet enjoyment but sometimes very amusing  hes got a touch of the tarbrush about him  annette stretched herself  tarbrush she said what is that his mother was armenienne  thats it then muttered soames does he know anything about pictures  he knows about everythinga man of the world  well get some one for fleur i want to distract her shes going off on saturday to val dartie and his wife i dont like it  why not  since the reason could not be explained without going into family history soames merely answered  racketing about theres too much of it  i like that little mrs val she is very quiet and clever  i know nothing of her exceptthis things new and soames took up a creation from the bed  annette received it from him  would you hook me she said  soames hooked glancing once over her shoulder into the glass he saw the expression on her face faintly amused faintly contemptuous as much as to say thanks you will never learn no thank god he wasnt a frenchman he finished with a jerk and the words  its too low here and he went to the door with the wish to get away from her and go down to fleur again  annette stayed a powderpuff and said with startling suddenness  que tu es grossier  he knew the expressionhe had reason to the first time she had used it he had thought it meant what a grocer you are and had not known whether to be relieved or not when better informed he resented the wordhe was not coarse if he was coarse what was that chap in the room beyond his who made those horrible noises in the morning when he cleared his throat or those people in the lounge who thought it wellbred to say nothing but what the whole world could hear at the top of their voicesquacking inanity coarse because he had said her dress was low well so it was he went out without reply  coming into the lounge from the far end he at once saw fleur where he had left her she sat with crossed knees slowly balancing a foot in silk stocking and grey shoe sure sign that she was dreaming her eyes showed it toothey went off like that sometimes and then in a moment she would come to life and be as quick and restless as a monkey and she knew so much so selfassured and not yet nineteen what was that odious word flapper dreadful young creaturessquealing and squawking and showing their legs the worst of them bad dreams the best of them powdered angels fleur was not a flapper not one of those slangy illbred young females and yet she was frighteningly selfwilled and full of life and determined to enjoy it enjoy the word brought no puritan terror to soames but it brought the terror suited to his temperament he had always been afraid to enjoy today for fear he might not enjoy tomorrow so much and it was terrifying to feel that his daughter was divested of that safeguard the very way she sat in that chair showed itlost in her dream he had never been lost in a dream himselfthere was nothing to be had out of it and where she got it from he did not know certainly not from annette and yet annette as a young girl when he was hanging about her had once had a flowery look well she had lost it now  fleur rose from her chairswiftly restlessly and flung herself down at a writingtable seizing ink and writingpaper she began to write as if she had not time to breathe before she got her letter written and suddenly she saw him the air of desperate absorption vanished she smiled waved a kiss made a pretty face as if she were a little puzzled and a little bored  ah she was finefine     iii  at robin hill   jolyon forsyte had spent his boys nineteenth birthday at robin hill quietly going into his affairs he did everything quietly now because his heart was in a poor way and like all his family he disliked the idea of dying he had never realised how much till one day two years ago he had gone to his doctor about certain symptoms and been told  at any moment on any overstrain  he had taken it with a smilethe natural forsyte reaction against an unpleasant truth but with an increase of symptoms in the train on the way home he had realised to the full the sentence hanging over him to leave irene his boy his home his workthough he did little enough work now to leave them for unknown darkness for the unimaginable state for such nothingness that he would not even be conscious of wind stirring leaves above his grave nor of the scent of earth and grass of such nothingness that however hard he might try to conceive it he never could and must still hover on the hope that he might see again those he loved to realise this was to endure very poignant spiritual anguish before he reached home that day he had determined to keep it from irene he would have to be more careful than man had ever been for the least thing would give it away and make her as wretched as himself almost his doctor had passed him sound in other respects and seventy was nothing of an agehe would last a long time yet if he could  such a conclusion followed out for nearly two years develops to the full the subtler side of character naturally not abrupt except when nervously excited jolyon had become control incarnate the sad patience of old people who cannot exert themselves was masked by a smile which his lips preserved even in private he devised continually all manner of cover to conceal his enforced lack of exertion mocking himself for so doing he counterfeited conversion to the simple life gave up wine and cigars drank a special kind of coffee with no coffee in it in short he made himself as safe as a forsyte in his condition could under the rose of his mild irony secure from discovery since his wife and son had gone up to town he had spent the fine may day quietly arranging his papers that he might die tomorrow without inconveniencing any one giving in fact a final polish to his terrestrial state having docketed and enclosed it in his fathers old chinese cabinet he put the key into an envelope wrote the words outside key of the chinese cabinet wherein will be found the exact state of me jf and put it in his breastpocket where it would be always about him in case of accident then ringing for tea he went out to have it under the old oaktree  all are under sentence of death jolyon whose sentence was but a little more precise and pressing had become so used to it that he thought habitually like other people of other things he thought of his son now  jon was nineteen that day and jon had come of late to a decision educated neither at eton like his father nor at harrow like his dead halfbrother but at one of those establishments which designed to avoid the evil and contain the good of the public school system may or may not contain the evil and avoid the good jon had left in april perfectly ignorant of what he wanted to become the war which had promised to go on for ever had ended just as he was about to join the army six months before his time it had taken him ever since to get used to the idea that he could now choose for himself he had held with his father several discussions from which under a cheery show of being ready for anythingexcept of course the church army law stage stock exchange medicine business and engineeringjolyon had gathered rather clearly that jon wanted to go in for nothing he himself had felt exactly like that at the same age with him that pleasant vacuity had soon been ended by an early marriage and its unhappy consequences forced to become an underwriter at lloyds he had regained prosperity before his artistic talent had outcropped but havingas the simple saylearned his boy to draw pigs and other animals he knew that jon would never be a painter and inclined to the conclusion that his aversion from everything else meant that he was going to be a writer holding however the view that experience was necessary even for that profession there seemed to jolyon nothing in the meantime for jon but university travel and perhaps the eating of dinners for the bar after that one would see or more probably one would not in face of these proffered allurements however jon had remained undecided  such discussions with his son had confirmed in jolyon a doubt whether the world had really changed people said that it was a new age with the profundity of one not too long for any age jolyon perceived that under slightly different surfaces the era was precisely what it had been mankind was still divided into two species the few who had speculation in their souls and the many who had none with a belt of hybrids like himself in the middle jon appeared to have speculation it seemed to his father a bad lookout  with something deeper therefore than his usual smile he had heard the boy say a fortnight ago i should like to try farming dad if it wont cost you too much it seems to be about the only sort of life that doesnt hurt anybody except art and of course thats out of the question for me  jolyon subdued his smile and answered  all right you shall skip back to where we were under the first jolyon in 1760 itll prove the cycle theory and incidentally no doubt you may grow a better turnip than he did  a little dashed jon had answered  but dont you think its a good scheme dad  twill serve my dear and if you should really take to it youll do more good than most men which is little enough  to himself however he had said but he wont take to it i give him four years still its healthy and harmless  after turning the matter over and consulting with irene he wrote to his daughter mrs val dortie asking if they knew of a farmer near them on the downs who would take jon as an apprentice hollys answer had been enthusiastic there was an excellent man quite close she and val would love jon to live with them  the boy was due to go tomorrow  sipping weak tea with lemon in it jolyon gazed through the leaves of the old oaktree at that view which had appeared to him desirable for thirtytwo years the tree beneath which he sat seemed not a day older so young the little leaves of brownish gold so old the whiteygreygreen of its thick rough trunk a tree of memories which would live on hundreds of years yet unless some barbarian cut it downwould see old england out at the pace things were going he remembered a night three years before when looking from his window with his arm close round irene he had watched a german aeroplane hovering it seemed right over the old tree next day they had found a bomb hole in a field on gages farm that was before he knew that he was under sentence of death he could almost have wished the bomb had finished him it would have saved a lot of hanging about many hours of cold fear in the pit of his stomach he had counted on living to the normal forsyte age of eightyfive or more when irene would be seventy as it was she would miss him still there was jon more important in her life than himself jon who adored his mother  under that tree where old jolyonwaiting for irene to come to him across the lawnhad breathed his last jolyon wondered whimsically whether having put everything in such perfect order he had not better close his own eyes and drift away there was something undignified in parasitically clinging on to the effortless close of a life wherein he regretted two things onlythe long division between his father and himself when he was young and the lateness of his union with irene  from where he sat he could see a cluster of appletrees in blossom nothing in nature moved him so much as fruittrees in blossom and his heart ached suddenly because he might never see them flower again spring decidedly no man ought to have to die while his heart was still young enough to love beauty blackbirds sang recklessly in the shrubbery swallows were flying high the leaves above him glistened and over the fields was every imaginable tint of early foliage burnished by the level sunlight away to where the distant smokebush blue was trailed along the horizon irenes flowers in their narrow beds had startling individuality that evening little deep assertions of gay life only chinese and japanese painters and perhaps leonardo had known how to get that startling little ego into each painted flower and bird and beastthe ego yet the sense of species the universality of life as well they were the fellows ive made nothing that will live thought jolyon ive been an amateura mere lover not a creator still i shall leave jon behind me when i go what luck that the boy had not been caught by that ghastly war he might so easily have been killed like poor jolly twenty years ago out in the transvaal jon would do something some dayif the age didnt spoil himan imaginative chap his whim to take up farming was but a bit of sentiment and about as likely to last and just then he saw them coming up the field irene and the boy walking from the station with their arms linked and getting up he strolled down through the new rose garden to meet them  irene came into his room that night and sat down by the window she sat there without speaking till he said  what is it my love  we had an encounter today  with whom  soames  soames he had kept that name out of his thoughts these last two years conscious that it was bad for him and now his heart moved in a disconcerting manner as if it had sideslipped within his chest  irene went on quietly  he and his daughter were in the gallery and afterwards at the confectioners where we had tea  jolyon went over and put his hand on her shoulder  how did he look  grey but otherwise much the same  and the daughter  pretty at least jon thought so  jolyons heart sideslipped again his wifes face had a strained and puzzled look  you didnt he began  no but jon knows their name the girl dropped her handkerchief and he picked it up  jolyon sat down on his bed an evil chance  june was with you did she put her foot into it  no but it was all very queer and strained and jon could see it was  jolyon drew a long breath and said  ive often wondered whether weve been right to keep it from him hell find out some day  the later the better jolyon the young have such cheap hard judgment when you were nineteen what would you have thought of your mother if she had done what i have yes there it was jon worshipped his mother and knew nothing of the tragedies the inexorable necessities of life nothing of the prisoned grief in an unhappy marriage nothing of jealousy or passionknew nothing at all as yet  what have you told him he said at last  that they were relations but we didnt know them that you had never cared much for your family or they for you i expect he will be asking you  jolyon smiled this promises to take the place of airraids he said after all one misses them  irene looked up at him  weve known it would come some day  he answered her with sudden energy  i could never stand seeing jon blame you he shant do that even in thought he has imagination and hell understand if its put to him properly i think i had better tell him before he gets to know otherwise  not yet jolyon  that was like hershe had no foresight and never went to meet trouble stillwho knewshe might be right it was ill going against a mothers instinct it might be well to let the boy go on if possible till experience had given him some touchstone by which he could judge the values of that old tragedy till love jealousy longing had deepened his charity all the same one must take precautionsevery precaution possible and long after irene had left him he lay awake turning over those precautions he must write to holly telling her that jon knew nothing as yet of family history holly was discreet she would make sure of her husband she would see to it jon could take the letter with him when he went tomorrow  and so the day on which he had put the polish on his material estate died out with the chiming of the stable clock and another began for jolyon in the shadow of a spiritual disorder which could not be so rounded off and polished  but jon whose room had once been his day nursery lay awake too the prey of a sensation disputed by those who have never known it love at first sight he had felt it beginning in him with the glint of those dark eyes gazing into his athwart the junoa conviction that this was his dream so that what followed had seemed to him at once natural and miraculous fleur her name alone was almost enough for one who was terribly susceptible to the charm of words in a homoeopathic age when boys and girls were coeducated and mixed up in early life till sex was almost abolished jon was singularly oldfashioned his modern school took boys only and his holidays had been spent at robin hill with boy friends or his parents alone he had never therefore been inoculated against the germs of love by small doses of the poison and now in the dark his temperature was mounting fast he lay awake featuring fleuras they called itrecalling her words especially that au revoir so soft and sprightly  he was still so wideawake at dawn that he got up slipped on tennis shoes trousers and a sweater and in silence crept downstairs and out through the study window it was just light there was a smell of grass fleur he thought fleur it was mysteriously white outofdoors with nothing awake except the birds just beginning to chirp ill go down into the coppice he thought he ran down through the fields reached the pond just as the sun rose and passed into the coppice bluebells carpeted the ground there among the larchtrees there was mysterythe air as it were composed of that romantic quality jon sniffed its freshness and stared at the bluebells in the sharpening light fleur it rhymed with her and she lived at mapledurhama jolly name too on the river somewhere he could find it in the atlas presently he would write to her but would she answer oh she must she had said au revoir not goodbye what luck that she had dropped her handkerchief he would never have known her but for that and the more he thought of that handkerchief the more amazing his luck seemed fleur it certainly rhymed with her rhythm thronged his head words jostled to be joined together he was on the verge of a poem  jon remained in this condition for more than half an hour then returned to the house and getting a ladder climbed in at his bedroom window out of sheer exhilaration then remembering that the study window was open he went down and shut it first removing the ladder so as to obliterate all traces of his feeling the thing was too deep to be revealed to mortal souleven to his mother     iv  the mausoleum   there are houses whose souls have passed into the limbo of time leaving their bodies in the limbo of london such was not quite the condition of timothys on the bayswater road for timothys soul still had one foot in timothy forsytes body and smither kept the atmosphere unchanging of camphor and port wine and house whose windows are only opened to air it twice a day  to forsyte imagination that house was now a sort of chinese pillbox a series of layers in the last of which was timothy one did not reach him or so it was reported by members of the family who out of oldtime habit or absentmindedness would drive up once in a blue moon and ask after their surviving uncle such were francie now quite emancipated from god she frankly avowed atheism euphemia emancipated from old nicholas and winifred dartie from her man of the world but after all everybody was emancipated now or said they wereperhaps not quite the same thing  when soames therefore took it on his way to paddington station on the morning after that encounter it was hardly with the expectation of seeing timothy in the flesh his heart made a faint demonstration within him while he stood in full south sunlight on the newly whitened doorstep of that little house where four forsytes had once lived and now but one dwelt on like a winter fly the house into which soames had come and out of which he had gone times without number divested of or burdened with fardels of family gossip the house of the old people of another century another age  the sight of smitherstill corseted up to the armpits because the new fashion which came in as they were going out about 1903 had never been considered nice by aunts juley and hesterbrought a pale friendliness to soamess lips smither still faithfully arranged to old pattern in every detail an invaluable servantnone such leftsmiling back at him with the words why its mr soames after all this time and how are you sir mr timothy will be so pleased to know youve been  how is he  oh he keeps fairly bobbish for his age sir but of course hes a wonderful man as i said to mrs dartie when she was here last it would please miss forsyte and mrs juley and miss hester to see how he relishes a baked apple still but hes quite deaf and a mercy i always think for what we should have done with him in the airraids i dont know  ah said soames what did you do with him  we just left him in his bed and had the bell run down into the cellar so that cook and i could hear him if he rang it would never have done to let him know there was a war on as i said to cook if mr timothy rings they may do what they likeim going up my dear mistresses would have a fit if they could see him ringing and nobody going to him but he slept through them all beautiful and the one in the daytime he was having his bath it was a mercy because he might have noticed the people in the street all looking uphe often looks out of the window  quite murmured soames smither was getting garrulous i just want to look round and see if theres anything to be done  yes sir i dont think theres anything except a smell of mice in the diningroom that we dont know how to get rid of its funny they should be there and not a crumb since mr timothy took to not coming down just before the war but theyre nasty little things you never know where theyll take you next  does he leave his bed  oh yes sir he takes nice exercise between his bed and the window in the morning not to risk a change of air and hes quite comfortable in himself has his will out every day regular its a great consolation to himthat  well smither i want to see him if i can in case he has anything to say to me  smither coloured up above her corsets  it will be an occasion she said shall i take you round the house sir while i send cook to break it to him  no you go to him said soames i can go round the house by myself  one could not confess to sentiment before another and soames felt that he was going to be sentimental nosing round those rooms so saturated with the past when smither creaking with excitement had left him soames entered the diningroom and sniffed in his opinion it wasnt mice but incipient woodrot and he examined the panelling whether it was worth a coat of paint at timothys age he was not sure the room had always been the most modern in the house and only a faint smile curled soamess lips and nostrils walls of a rich green surmounted the oak dado a heavy metal chandelier hung by a chain from a ceiling divided by imitation beams the pictures had been bought by timothy a bargain one day at jobsons sixty years agothree snyder still lifes two faintly coloured drawings of a boy and a girl rather charming which bore the initials jrtimothy had always believed they might turn out to be joshua reynolds but soames who admired them had discovered that they were only john robinson and a doubtful morland of a white pony being shod deepred plush curtains ten highbacked dark mahogany chairs with deepred plush seats a turkey carpet and a mahogany diningtable as large as the room was small such was an apartment which soames could remember unchanged in soul or body since he was four years old he looked especially at the two drawings and thought i shall buy those at the sale  from the diningroom he passed into timothys study he did not remember ever having been in that room it was lined from floor to ceiling with volumes and he looked at them with curiosity one wall seemed devoted to educational books which timothys firm had published two generations backsometimes as many as twenty copies of one book soames read their titles and shuddered the middle wall had precisely the same books as used to be in the library at his own fathers in park lane from which he deduced the fancy that james and his youngest brother had gone out together one day and bought a brace of small libraries the third wall he approached with more excitement here surely timothys own taste would be found it was the books were dummies the fourth wall was all heavily curtained window and turned towards it was a large chair with a mahogany readingstand attached on which a yellowish and folded copy of the times dated july 6 1914 the day timothy first failed to come down as if in preparation for the war seemed waiting for him still in a corner stood a large globe of that world never visited by timothy deeply convinced of the unreality of everything but england and permanently upset by the sea on which he had been very sick one sunday afternoon in 1836 out of a pleasure boat off the pier at brighton with juley and hester swithin and hatty chessman all due to swithin who was always taking things into his head and who thank goodness had been sick too soames knew all about it having heard the tale fifty times at least from one or other of them he went up to the globe and gave it a spin it emitted a faint creak and moved about an inch bringing into his purview a daddylonglegs which had died on it in latitude 44  mausoleum he thought george was right and he went out and up the stairs on the half landing he stopped before the case of stuffed hummingbirds which had delighted his childhood they looked not a day older suspended on wires above pampasgrass if the case were opened the birds would not begin to hum but the whole thing would crumble he suspected it wouldnt be worth putting that into the sale and suddenly he was caught by a memory of aunt anndear old aunt annholding him by the hand in front of that case and saying look soamey arent they bright and pretty dear little hummingbirds soames remembered his own answer they dont hum auntie he must have been six in a black velveteen suit with a lightblue collarhe remembered that suit well aunt ann with her ringlets and her spidery kind hands and her grave old aquiline smilea fine old lady aunt ann he moved on up to the drawingroom door there on each side of it were the groups of miniatures those he would certainly buy in the miniatures of his four aunts one of his uncle swithin adolescent and one of his uncle nicholas as a boy they had all been painted by a young lady friend of the family at a time 1830 about when miniatures were considered very genteel and lasting too painted as they were on ivory many a time had he heard the tale of that young lady very talented my dear she had quite a weakness for swithin and very soon after she went into a consumption and died so like keatswe often spoke of it  well there they were ann juley hester susanquite a small child swithin with skyblue eyes pink cheeks yellow curls white waistcoatlarge as life and nicholas like cupid with an eye on heaven now he came to think of it uncle nick had always been rather like thata wonderful man to the last yes she must have had talent and miniatures had a certain backwatered cachet of their own little subject to the currents of competition on aesthetic change soames opened the drawingroom door the room was dusted the furniture uncovered the curtains drawn back precisely as if his aunts still dwelt there patiently waiting and a thought came to him when timothy diedwhy not would it not be almost a duty to preserve this houselike carlylesand put up a tablet and show it specimen of midvictorian abodeentrance one shilling with catalogue after all it was the completest thing and perhaps the deadest in the london of today perfect in its special taste and culture if that is he took down and carried over to his own collection the four barbizon pictures he had given them the still skyblue walls the green curtains patterned with red flowers and ferns the crewelworked firescreen before the castiron grate the mahogany cupboard with glass windows full of little knickknacks the beaded footstools keats shelley southey cowper coleridge byrons corsair but nothing else and the victorian poets in a bookshelf row the marqueterie cabinet lined with dim red plush full of family relics hesters first fan the buckles of their mothers fathers shoes three bottled scorpions and one very yellow elephants tusk sent home from india by greatuncle edgar forsyte who had been in jute a yellow bit of paper propped up with spidery writing on it recording god knew what and the pictures crowding on the wallsall watercolours save those four barbizons looking like the foreigners they were and doubtful customers at thatpictures bright and illustrative telling the bees hey for the ferry and two in the style of frith all thimblerig and crinolines given them by swithin oh many many pictures at which soames had gazed a thousand times in supercilious fascination a marvellous collection of bright smooth gilt frames  and the boudoirgrand piano beautifully dusted hermetically sealed as ever and aunt juleys album of pressed seaweed on it and the giltlegged chairs stronger than they looked and on one side of the fireplace the sofa of crimson silk where aunt ann and after her aunt juley had been wont to sit facing the light and bolt upright and on the other side of the fire the one really easy chair back to the light for aunt hester soames screwed up his eyes he seemed to see them sitting there ah and the atmosphereeven now of too many stuffs and washed lace curtains lavender in bags and dried bees wings no he thought theres nothing like it left it ought to be preserved and by george they might laugh at it but for a standard of gentle life never departed from for fastidiousness of skin and eye and nose and feeling it beat today hollowtoday with its tubes and cars its perpetual smoking its crosslegged barenecked girls visible up to the knees and down to the waist if you took the trouble agreeable to the satyr within each forsyte but hardly his idea of a lady with their feet too screwed round the legs of their chairs while they ate and their so longs and their old beans and their laughtergirls who gave him the shudders whenever he thought of fleur in contact with them and the hardeyed capable older women who managed life and gave him the shudders too no his old aunts if they never opened their minds their eyes or very much their windows at least had manners and a standard and reverence for past and future  with rather a choky feeling he closed the door and went tiptoeing upstairs he looked in at a place on the way hm in perfect order of the eighties with a sort of yellow oilskin paper on the walls at the top of the stairs he hesitated between four doors which of them was timothys and he listened a sound as of a child slowly dragging a hobbyhorse about came to his ears that must be timothy he tapped and a door was opened by smither very red in the face  mr timothy was taking his walk and she had not been able to get him to attend if mr soames would come into the back room he could see him through the door  soames went into the back room and stood watching  the last of the old forsytes was on his feet moving with the most impressive slowness and an air of perfect concentration on his own affairs backward and forward between the foot of his bed and the window a distance of some twelve feet the lower part of his square face no longer cleanshaven was covered with snowy beard clipped as short as it could be and his chin looked as broad as his brow where the hair was also quite white while nose and cheeks and brow were a good yellow one hand held a stout stick and the other grasped the skirt of his jaeger dressinggown from under which could be seen his bedsocked ankles and feet thrust into jaeger slippers the expression on his face was that of a crossed child intent on something that he has not got each time he turned he stumped the stick and then dragged it as if to show that he could do without it  he still looks strong said soames under his breath  oh yes sir you should see him take his bathits wonderful he does enjoy it so  those quite loud words gave soames an insight timothy had resumed his babyhood  does he take any interest in things generally he said also aloud  oh yes sir his food and his will its quite a sight to see him turn it over and over not to read it of course and every now and then he asks the price of consols and i write it on a slate for himvery large of course i always write the same what they were when he last took notice in 1914 we got the doctor to forbid him to read the paper when the war broke out oh he did take on about that at first but he soon came round because he knew it tired him and hes a wonder to conserve energy as he used to call it when my dear mistresses were alive bless their hearts how he did go on at them about that they were always so active if you remember mr soames  what would happen if i were to go in asked soames would he remember me i made his will you know after miss hester died in 1907  oh that sir replied smither doubtfully i couldnt take on me to say i think he might he really is a wonderful man for his age  soames moved into the doorway and waiting for timothy to turn said in a loud voice uncle timothy  timothy trailed back halfway and halted  eh he said  soames cried soames at the top of his voice holding out his hand soames forsyte  no said timothy and stumping his stick loudly on the floor he continued his walk  it doesnt seem to work said soames  no sir replied smither rather crestfallen you see he hasnt finished his walk it always was one thing at a time with him i expect hell ask me this afternoon if you came about the gas and a pretty job i shall have to make him understand  do you think he ought to have a man about him  smither held up her hands a man oh no cook and me can manage perfectly a strange man about would send him crazy in no time and my mistresses wouldnt like the idea of a man in the house besides were so proud of him  i suppose the doctor comes  every morning he makes special terms for such a quantity and mr timothys so used he doesnt take a bit of notice except to put out his tongue  well said soames turning away its rather sad and painful to me  oh sir returned smither anxiously you mustnt think that now that he cant worry about things he quite enjoys his life really he does as i say to cook mr timothy is more of a man than he ever was you see when hes not walkin or takin his bath hes eatin and when hes not eatin hes sleeping and there it is there isnt an ache or a care about him anywhere  well said soames theres something in that ill go down by the way let me see his will  i should have to take my time about that sir he keeps it under his pillow and hed see me while hes active  i only want to know if its the one i made said soames you take a look at its date some time and let me know  yes sir but im sure its the same because me and cook witnessed you remember and theres our names on it still and weve only done it once  quite said soames he did remember smither and jane had been proper witnesses having been left nothing in the will that they might have no interest in timothys death it had beenhe fully admittedan almost improper precaution but timothy had wished it and after all aunt hester had provided for them amply  very well he said goodbye smither look after him and if he should say anything at any time put it down and let me know  oh yes mr soames ill be sure to do that its been such a pleasant change to see you cook will be quite excited when i tell her  soames shook her hand and went downstairs he stood for fully two minutes by the hatstand whereon he had hung his hat so many times so it all passes he was thinking passes and begins again poor old chap and he listened if perchance the sound of timothy trailing his hobbyhorse might come down the well of the stairs or some ghost of an old face show over the banisters and an old voice say why its dear soames and we were only saying that we hadnt seen him for a week  nothingnothing just the scent of camphor and dustmotes in a sunbeam through the fanlight over the door the little old house a mausoleum and turning on his heel he went out and caught his train     v  the native heath       his foots upon his native heath     his namesval dartie  with some such feeling did val dartie in the fortieth year of his age set out that same thursday morning very early from the old manorhouse he had taken on the north side of the sussex downs his destination was newmarket and he had not been there since the autumn of 1899 when he stole over from oxford for the cambridgeshire he paused at the door to give his wife a kiss and put a flask of port into his pocket  dont overtire your leg val and dont bet too much  with the pressure of her chest against his own and her eyes looking into his val felt both leg and pocket safe he should be moderate holly was always rightshe had a natural aptitude it did not seem so remarkable to him perhaps as it might to others thathalf dartie as he washe should have been perfectly faithful to his young first cousin during the twenty years since he married her romantically out in the boer war and faithful without any feeling of sacrifice or boredomshe was so quick so slyly always a little in front of his mood being first cousins they had decided or rather holly had to have no children and though a little sallower she had kept her looks her slimness and the colour of her dark hair val particularly admired the life of her own she carried on besides carrying on his and riding better every year she kept up her music she read an awful lotnovels poetry all sorts of stuff out on their farm in cape colony she had looked after all the nigger babies and women in a miraculous manner she was in factclever yet made no fuss about it and had no side though not remarkable for humility val had come to have the feeling that she was his superior and he did not grudge ita great tribute it might be noted that he never looked at holly without her knowing of it but that she looked at him sometimes unawares  he has kissed her in the porch because he should not be doing so on the platform though she was going to the station with him to drive the car back tanned and wrinkled by colonial weather and the wiles inseparable from horses and handicapped by the leg which weakened in the boer war had probably saved his life in the war just past val was still much as he had been in the days of his courtship his smile as wide and charming his eyelashes if anything thicker and darker his eyes screwed up under them as bright a grey his freckles rather deeper his hair a little grizzled at the sides he gave the impression of one who has lived actively with horses in a sunny climate  twisting the car sharp round at the gate he said  when is young jon coming  today  is there anything you want for him i could bring it down on saturday  no but you might come by the same train as fleurone forty  val gave the ford full rein he still drove like a man in a new country on bad roads who refuses to compromise and expects heaven at every hole  thats a young woman who knows her way about he said i say has it struck you  yes said holly  uncle soames and your dadbit awkward isnt it  she wont know and he wont know and nothing must be said of course its only for five days val  stable secret righto if holly thought it safe it was glancing slyly round at him she said did you notice how beautifully she asked herself  no  well she did what do you think of her val  pretty and clever but she might run out at any corner if she got her monkey up i should say  im wondering holly murmured whether she is the modern young woman one feels at sea coming home into all this  you you get the hang of things so quick  holly slid her hand into his coatpocket  you keep one in the know said val encouraged what do you think of that belgian fellow profond  i think hes rather a good devil  val grinned  he seems to me a queer fish for a friend of our family in fact our family is in pretty queer waters with uncle soames marrying a frenchwoman and your dad marrying soamess first our grandfathers would have had fits  so would anybodys my dear  this car said val suddenly wants rousing she doesnt get her hind legs under her uphill i shall have to give her her head on the slope if im to catch that train  there was that about horses which had prevented him from ever really sympathising with a car and the running of the ford under his guidance compared with its running under that of holly was always noticeable he caught the train  take care going home shell throw you down if she can goodbye darling  goodbye called holly and kissed her hand  in the train after quarter of an hours indecision between thoughts of holly his morning paper the look of the bright day and his dim memory of newmarket val plunged into the recesses of a small square book all names pedigrees taproots and notes about the make and shape of horses the forsyte in him was bent on the acquisition of a certain strain of blood and he was subduing resolutely as yet the dartie hankering for a flutter on getting back to england after the profitable sale of his south african farm and stud and observing that the sun seldom shone val had said to himself ive absolutely got to have an interest in life or this country will give me the blues huntings not enough ill breed and ill train with just that extra pinch of shrewdness and decision imparted by long residence in a new country val had seen the weak point of modern breeding they were all hypnotised by fashion and high price he should buy for looks and let names go hang and here he was already hypnotised by the prestige of a certain strain of blood half consciously he thought theres something in this damned climate which makes one go round in a ring all the same i must have a strain of mayfly blood  in this mood he reached the mecca of his hopes it was one of those quiet meetings favorable to such as wish to look into horses rather than into the mouths of bookmakers and val clung to the paddock his twenty years of colonial life divesting him of the dandyism in which he had been bred had left him the essential neatness of the horseman and given him a queer and rather blighting eye over what he called the silly hawhaw of some englishmen the flapping cockatoory of some englishwomenholly had none of that and holly was his model observant quick resourceful val went straight to the heart of a transaction a horse a drink and he was on his way to the heart of a mayfly filly when a slow voice said at his elbow  mr val dartie hows mrs val dartie shes well i hope and he saw beside him the belgian he had met at his sister imogens  prosper profondi met you at lunch added the voice how are you murmured val  im very well replied monsieur profond smiling with a certain inimitable slowness a good devil holly had called him well he looked a little like a devil with his dark clipped pointed beard a sleepy one though and goodhumoured with fine eyes unexpectedly intelligent  heres a gentleman wants to know youcousin of yoursmr george forsyde  val saw a large form and a face cleanshaven bulllike a little lowering with sardonic humour bubbling behind a full grey eye he remembered it dimly from old days when he used to dine with his father at the iseeum club  i was a racing pal of your fathers george was saying hows the stud like to buy one of my screws  val grinned to hide the sudden feeling that the bottom had fallen out of breeding they believed in nothing over here not even in horses george forsyte prosper profond the devil himself was not more disillusioned than those two  didnt know you were a racing man he said to monsieur profond  im not i don care for it im a yachtin man i don care for yachtin either but i like to see my friends ive got some lunch mr val dartie just a small lunch if youd like to ave some not muchjust a small onein my car  thanks said val very good of you ill come along in about quarter of an hour  over there mr forsydes comin and monsieur profond poinded with a yellowgloved finger small car with a small lunch he moved on groomed sleepy and remote george forsyte following neat huge and with his jesting air  val remained gazing at the mayfly filly george forsyte of course was an old chap but this profond might be about his own age val felt extremely young as if the mayfly filly were a toy at which those two had laughed the animal had lost reality  that small marehe seemed to hear the voice of monsieur profondwhat do you see in herwe must all die  and george forsyte crony of his father racing still the mayfly strainwas it any better than any other he might just as well have a flutter with his money instead  no by gum he muttered suddenly if its no good breeding horses its no good doing anything what did i come for ill buy her  he stood back and watched the ebb of the paddock visitors towards the stand natty old chips shrewd portly fellows jews trainers looking as if they had never been guilty of seeing a horse in their lives tall flapping languid women or brisk loudvoiced women young men with an air as if trying to take it seriouslytwo or three of them with only one arm  life over heres a game thought val muffin bell rings horses run money changes hands ring again run again money changes back  but alarmed at his own philosophy he went to the paddock gate to watch the mayfly filly canter down she moved well and he made his way over to the small car the small lunch was the sort a man dreams of but seldom gets and when it was concluded monsieur profond walked back with him to the paddock  your wifes a nice woman was his surprising remark  nicest woman i know returned val dryly  yes said monsieur profond she has a nice face i admire nice women  val looked at him suspiciously but something kindly and direct in the heavy diabolism of his companion disarmed him for the moment  any time you like to come on my yacht ill give her a small cruise  thanks said val in arms again she hates the sea  so do i said monsieur profond  then why do you yacht  the belgians eyes smiled oh i don know ive done everything its the last thing im doin  it must be dd expensive i should want more reason than that  monsieur prosper profond raised his eyebrows and puffed out a heavy lower lip  im an easygoin man he said  were you in the war asked val  yees ive done that too i was gassed it was a small bit unpleasant he smiled with a deep and sleepy air of prosperity as if he had caught it from his name whether his saying small when he ought to have said little was genuine mistake or affectation val could not decide the fellow was evidently capable of anything among the ring of buyers round the mayfly filly who had won her race monsieur profond said you goin to bid  val nodded with this sleepy satan at his elbow he felt in need of faith though placed above the ultimate blows of providence by the forethought of a grandfather who had tied him up a thousand a year to which was added the thousand a year tied up for holly by her grandfather val was not flush of capital that he could touch having spent most of what he had realised from his south african farm on his establishment in sussex and very soon he was thinking dash it shes going beyond me his limitsix hundredexceeded he dropped out of the bidding the mayfly filly passed under the hammer at seven hundred and fifty guineas he was turning away vexed when the slow voice of monsieur profond said in his ear  well ive bought that small filly but i dont want her you take her and give her to your wife  val looked at the fellow with renewed suspicion but the good humour in his eyes was such that he really could not take offence  i made a small lot of money in the war began monsieur profond in answer to that look i ad armament shares i like to give it away im always makin money i want very small lot myself i like my friends to ave it  ill buy her of you at the price you gave said val with sudden resolution  no said monsieur profond you take her i don want her  hang it one doesnt  why not smiled monsieur profond im a friend of your family  seven hundred and fifty guineas is not a box of cigars said val impatiently  all right you keep her for me till i want her and do what you like with her  so long as shes yours said val i dont mind that thats all right murmured monsieur profond and moved away  val watched he might be a good devil but then again he might not he saw him rejoin george forsyte and thereafter saw him no more  he spent those nights after racing at his mothers house in green street  winifred dartie at sixtytwo was marvellously preserved considering the threeandthirty years during which she had put up with montague dartie till almost happily released by a french staircase it was to her a vehement satisfaction to have her favourite son back from south africa after all this time to feel him so little changed and to have taken a fancy to his wife winifred who in the late seventies before her marriage had been in the vanguard of freedom pleasure and fashion confessed her youth outclassed by the donzellas of the day they seemed for instance to regard marriage as an incident and winifred sometimes regretted that she had not done the same a second third fourth incident might have secured her a partner of less dazzling inebriety though after all he had left her val imogen maud benedict almost a colonel and unharmed by the warnone of whom had been divorced as yet the steadiness of her children often amazed one who remembered their father but as she was fond of believing they were really all forsytes favouring herself with the exception perhaps of imogen her brothers little girl fleur frankly puzzled winifred the child was as restless as any of these modern young womenshes a small flame in a draught prosper profond had said one day after dinnerbut she did not flop or talk at the top of her voice the steady forsyteism in winifreds own character instinctively resented the feeling in the air the modern girls habits and her motto alls much of a muchness spend tomorrow we shall be poor she found it a saving grace in fleur that having set her heart on a thing she had no change of heart until she got itthough what happened after fleur was of course too young to have made evident the child was a very pretty little thing too and quite a credit to take about with her mothers french taste and gift for wearing clothes everybody turned to look at fleurgreat consideration to winifred a lover of the style and distinction which had so cruelly deceived her in the case of montague dartie  in discussing her with val at breakfast on saturday morning winifred dwelt on the family skeleton  that little affair of your fatherinlaw and your aunt irene valits old as the hills of course fleur need know nothing about itmaking a fuss your uncle soames is very particular about that so youll be careful  yes but its dashed awkwardhollys young halfbrother is coming to live with us while he learns farming hes there already  oh said winifred that is a gaff what is he like  only saw him onceat robin hill when we were home in 1909 he was naked and painted blue and yellow in stripesa jolly little chap  winifred thought that rather nice and added comfortably well hollys sensible shell know how to deal with it i shant tell your uncle itll only bother him its a great comfort to have you back my dear boy now that im getting on  getting on why youre as young as ever by the way that chap profond mother is he all right  prosper profond oh the most amusing man i know  val grunted and recounted the story of the mayfly filly  thats so like him murmured winifred he does all sorts of things  well said val shrewdly our family havent been too lucky with that kind of cattle theyre too lighthearted for us  it was true and winifreds blue study lasted a full minute before she answered  oh well hes a foreigner val one must make allowances  all right ill use his filly and make it up to him somehow  and soon after he gave her his blessing received a kiss and left her for his bookmakers the iseeum club and victoria station     vi  jon   mrs val dartie after twenty years of south africa had fallen deeply in love fortunately with something of her own for the object of her passion was the prospect in front of her windows the cool clear light on the green downs it was england again at last england more beautiful than she had dreamed chance had in fact guided the val darties to a spot where the south downs had real charm when the sun shone holly had enough of her fathers eye to apprehend the rare quality of their outlines and chalky radiance to go up there by the ravinelike lane and wander along towards chanctonbury or amberley was still a delight which she hardly attempted to share with val whose admiration of nature was confused by a forsytes instinct for getting something out of it such as the condition of the turf for his horses exercise  driving the ford home with a certain humouring smoothness she promised herself that the first use she would make of jon would be to take him up there and show him the view under this mayday sky  she was looking forward to her young halfbrother with a motherliness not exhausted by val a threeday visit to robin hill soon after their arrival home had yielded no sight of himhe was still at school so that her recollection like vals was of a little sunnyhaired boy striped blue and yellow down by the pond  those three days at robin hill had been exciting sad embarrassing memories of her dead brother memories of vals courtship the aging of her father not seen for twenty years something funereal in his ironic gentleness which did not escape one who had much subtle instinct above all the presence of her stepmother whom she could still vaguely remember as the lady in grey of days when she was little and grandfather alive and mademoiselle beauce so cross because that intruder gave her music lessonsall these confused and tantalised a spirit which had longed to find robin hill untroubled but holly was adept at keeping things to herself and all had seemed to go quite well  her father had kissed her when she left him with lips which she was sure had trembled  well my dear he said the war hasnt changed robin hill has it if only you could have brought jolly back with you i say can you stand this spiritualistic racket when the oaktree dies it dies im afraid  from the warmth of her embrace he probably divined that he had let the cat out of his bag for he rode off at once on irony  spiritualismqueer word when the more they manifest the more they prove that theyve got hold of matter  how said holly  why look at their photographs of auric presences you must have something material for light and shade to fall on before you can take a photograph no itll end in our calling all matter spirit or all spirit matteri dont know which  but dont you believe in survival dad  jolyon had looked at her and the sad whimsicality of his face impressed her deeply  well my dear i should like to get something out of death ive been looking into it a bit but for the life of me i cant find anything that telepathy subconsciousness and emanation from the storehouse of this world cant account for just as well wish i could wishes father thoughts but they dont breed evidence  holly had pressed her lips again to his forehead with a feeling that it confirmed his theory that all matter was becoming spirithis brow felt somehow so insubstantial  but the most poignant memory of that little visit had been watching unobserved her stepmother reading to herself a letter from jon it wasshe decidedthe prettiest sight she had ever seen irene lost as it were in the letter of her boy stood at a window where the light fell on her face and her fine grey hair her lips were moving smiling her dark eyes laughing dancing and the hand which did not hold the letter was pressed against her breast holly withdrew as from a vision of perfect love convinced that jon must be nice  when she saw him coming out of the station with a kitbag in either hand she was confirmed in her predisposition he was a little like jolly that longlost idol of her childhood but eagerlooking and less formal with deeper eyes and brightercoloured hair for he wore no hat altogether a very interesting little brother  his tentative politeness charmed one who was accustomed to assurance in the youthful manner he was disturbed because she was to drive him home instead of his driving her shouldnt he have a shot they hadnt a car at robin hill since the war of course and he had only driven once and landed up a bank so she oughtnt to mind his trying his laugh soft and infectious was very attractive though that word she had heard was now quite oldfashioned when they reached the house he pulled out a crumpled letter which she read while he was washinga quite short letter which must have cost her father many a pang to write   my dear  you and val will not forget i trust that jon knows nothing of family history his mother and i think he is too young at present the boy is very dear and the apple of her eye verbum sapientibus  your loving father j f   that was all but it renewed in holly an uneasy regret that fleur was coming  after tea she fulfilled that promise to herself and took jon up the hill they had a long talk sitting above an old chalkpit grown over with brambles and goosepenny milkwort and liverwort starred the green slope the larks sang and thrushes in the brake and now and then a gull flighting inland would wheel very white against the paling sky where the vague moon was coming up delicious fragrance came to them as if little invisible creatures were running and treading scent out of the blades of grass  jon who had fallen silent said rather suddenly i say this is wonderful theres no fat on it at all gulls flight and sheepbells  gulls flight and sheepbells youre a poet my dear  jon sighed  oh golly no go  try i used to at your age  did you mother says try too but im so rotten have you any of yours for me to see  my dear holly murmured ive been married nineteen years i only wrote verses when i wanted to be  oh said jon and turned over on to his face the one cheek she could see was a charming colour was jon touched in the wind then as val would have called it already but if so all the better he would take no notice of young fleur besides on monday he would begin his farming and she smiled was it burns who followed the plough or only piers plowman nearly every young man and most young women seemed to be poets nowadays from the number of their books she had read out in south africa importing them from hatchus and bumphards and quite goodoh quite much better than she had been herself but then poetry had only really come in since her daywith motorcars another long talk after dinner over a wood fire in the low hall and there seemed little left to know about jon except anything of real importance holly parted from him at his bedroom door having seen twice over that he had everything with the conviction that she would love him and val would like him he was eager but did not gush he was a splendid listener sympathetic reticent about himself he evidently loved their father and adored his mother he liked riding rowing and fencing better than games he saved moths from candles and couldnt bear spiders but put them out of doors in screws of paper sooner than kill them in a word he was amiable she went to sleep thinking that he would suffer horribly if anybody hurt him but who would hurt him  jon on the other hand sat awake at his window with a bit of paper and a pencil writing his first real poem by the light of a candle because there was not enough moon to see by only enough to make the night seem fluttery and as if engraved on silver just the night for fleur to walk and turn her eyes and lead onover the hills and far away and jon deeply furrowed in his ingenuous brow made marks on the paper and rubbed them out and wrote them in again and did all that was necessary for the completion of a work of art and he had a feeling such as the winds of spring must have trying their first songs among the coming blossom jon was one of those boys not many in whom a hometrained love of beauty had survived school life he had had to keep it to himself of course so that not even the drawingmaster knew of it but it was there fastidious and clear within him and his poem seemed to him as lame and stilted as the night was winged but he kept it all the same it was a beast but better than nothing as an expression of the inexpressible and he thought with a sort of discomfiture i shant be able to show it to mother he slept terribly well when he did sleep overwhelmed by novelty     vii  fleur   to avoid the awkwardness of questions which could not be answered all that had been told jon was theres a girl coming down with val for the weekend  for the same reason all that had been told fleur was weve got a youngster staying with us  the two yearlings as val called them in his thoughts met therefore in a manner which for unpreparedness left nothing to be desired they were thus introduced by holly  this is jon my little brother fleurs a cousin of ours jon  jon who was coming in through a french window out of strong sunlight was so confounded by the providential nature of this miracle that he had time to hear fleur say calmly oh how do you do as if he had never seen her and to understand dimly from the quickest imaginable little movement of her head that he never had seen her he bowed therefore over her hand in an intoxicated manner and became more silent than the grave he knew better than to speak once in his early life surprised reading by a nightlight he had said fatuously i was just turning over the leaves mum and his mother had replied jon never tell stories because of your facenobody will ever believe them  the saying had permanently undermined the confidence necessary to the success of spoken untruth he listened therefore to fleurs swift and rapt allusions to the jolliness of everything plied her with scones and jam and got away as soon as might be they say that in delirium tremens you see a fixed object preferably dark which suddenly changes shape and position jon saw the fixed object it had dark eyes and passably dark hair and changed its position but never its shape the knowledge that between him and that object there was already a secret understanding however impossible to understand thrilled him so that he waited feverishly and began to copy out his poemwhich of course he would never dare to show hertill the sound of horses hoofs roused him and leaning from his window he saw her riding forth with val it was clear that she wasted no time but the sight filled him with grief he wasted his if he had not bolted in his fearful ecstasy he might have been asked to go too from his window he watched them disappear appear again in the chine of the road vanish and emerge once more for a minute clear on the outline of the down silly brute he thought i always miss my chances  why couldnt he be selfconfident and ready and leaning his chin on his hands he imagined the ride he might have had with her a weekend was but a weekend and he had missed three hours of it did he know any one except himself who would have been such a flat he did not  he dressed for dinner early and was first down he would miss no more but he missed fleur who came down last he sat opposite her at dinner and it was terribleimpossible to say anything for fear of saying the wrong thing impossible to keep his eyes fixed on her in the only natural way in sum impossible to treat normally one with whom in fancy he had already been over the hills and far away conscious too all the time that he must seem to her to all of them a dumb gawk yes it was terrible and she was talking so wellswooping with swift wing this way and that wonderful how she had learned an art which he found so disgustingly difficult she must think him hopeless indeed  his sisters eyes fixed on him with a certain astonishment obliged him at last to look at fleur but instantly her eyes very wide and eager seeming to say oh for goodness sake obliged him to look at val where a grin obliged him to look at his cutletthat at least had no eyes and no grin and he ate it hastily  jon is going to be a farmer he heard holly say a farmer and a poet  he glanced up reproachfully caught the comic lift of her eyebrow just like their fathers laughed and felt better  val recounted the incident of monsieur prosper profond nothing could have been more favourable for in relating it he regarded holly who in turn regarded him while fleur seemed to be regarding with a slight frown some thought of her own and jon was really free to look at her at last she had on a white frock very simple and well made her arms were bare and her hair had a white rose in it in just that swift moment of free vision after such intense discomfort jon saw her sublimated as one sees in the dark a slender white fruittree caught her like a verse of poetry flashed before the eyes of the mind or a tune which floats out in the distance and dies  he wondered giddily how old she wasshe seemed so much more selfpossessed and experienced than himself why mustnt he say they had met he remembered suddenly his mothers face puzzled hurtlooking when she answered yes theyre relations but we dont know them impossible that his mother who loved beauty should not admire fleur if she did know her  alone with val after dinner he sipped port deferentially and answered the advances of this newfound brotherinlaw as to riding always the first consideration with val he could have the young chestnut saddle and unsaddle it himself and generally look after it when he brought it in jon said he was accustomed to all that at home and saw that he had gone up one in his hosts estimation  fleur said val cant ride much yet but shes keen of course her father doesnt know a horse from a cartwheel does your dad ride  he used to but now hesyou know hes he stopped so hating the word old his father was old and yet not old nonever  quite muttered val i used to know your brother up at oxford ages ago the one who died in the boer war we had a fight in new college gardens that was a queer business he added musing a good deal came out of it  jons eyes opened wide all was pushing him towards historical research when his sisters voice said gently from the doorway  come along you two and he rose his heart pushing him towards something far more modern  fleur having declared that it was simply too wonderful to stay indoors they all went out moonlight was frosting the dew and an old sundial threw a long shadow two box hedges at right angles dark and square barred off the orchard fleur turned through that angled opening  come on she called jon glanced at the others and followed she was running among the trees like a ghost all was lovely and foamlike above her and there was a scent of old trunks and of nettles she vanished he thought he had lost her then almost ran into her standing quite still  isnt it jolly she cried and jon answered  rather  she reached up twisted off a blossom and twirling it in her fingers said  i suppose i can call you jon  i should think so just  all right but you know theres a feud between our families  jon stammered feud why  its ever so romantic and silly thats why i pretended we hadnt met shall we get up early tomorrow morning and go for a walk before breakfast and have it out i hate being slow about things dont you  jon murmured a rapturous assent  six oclock then i think your mothers beautiful  jon said fervently yes she is  i love all kinds of beauty went on fleur when its exciting i dont like greek things a bit  what not euripides  euripides oh no i cant bear greek plays theyre so long i think beautys always swift i like to look at one picture for instance and then run off i cant bear a lot of things together look she held up her blossom in the moonlight thats better than all the orchard i think  and suddenly with her other hand she caught jons of all things in the world dont you think cautions the most awful smell the moonlight  she thrust the blossom against his face jon agreed giddily that of all things in the world caution was the worst and bending over kissed the hand which held his  thats nice and oldfashioned said fleur calmly youre frightfully silent jon still i like silence when its swift she let go his hand did you think i dropped my handkerchief on purpose  no cried jon intensely shocked  well i did of course lets get back or theyll think were doing this on purpose too and again she ran like a ghost among the trees jon followed with love in his heart spring in his heart and over all the moonlit white unearthly blossom they came out where they had gone in fleur walking demurely  its quite wonderful in there she said dreamily to holly  jon preserved silence hoping against hope that she might be thinking it swift  she bade him a casual and demure goodnight which made him think he had been dreaming  in her bedroom fleur had flung off her gown and wrapped in a shapeless garment with the white flower still in her hair she looked like a mousme sitting crosslegged on her bed writing by candlelight   dearest cherry  i believe im in love ive got it in the neck only the feeling is really lower down hes a second cousinsuch a child about six months older and ten years younger than i am boys always fall in love with their seniors and girls with their juniors or with old men of forty dont laugh but his eyes are the truest things i ever saw and hes quite divinely silent we had a most romantic first meeting in london under the vospovitch juno and now hes sleeping in the next room and the moonlights on the blossom and tomorrow morning before anybodys awake were going to walk off into down fairyland theres a feud between our families which makes it really exciting yes and i may have to use subterfuge and come on you for invitationsif so youll know why my father doesnt want us to know each other but i cant help that lifes too short hes got the most beautiful mother with lovely silvery hair and a young face with dark eyes im staying with his sisterwho married my cousin its all mixed up but i mean to pump her tomorrow weve often talked about love being a spoilsport well thats all tosh its the beginning of sport and the sooner you feel it my dear the better for you  jon not simplified spelling but short for jolyon which is a name in my family they say is the sort that lights up and goes out about five feet ten still growing and i believe hes going to be a poet if you laugh at me ive done with you for ever i perceive all sorts of difficulties but you know when i really want a thing i get it one of the chief effects of love is that you see the air sort of inhabited like seeing a face in the moon and you feelyou feel dancey and soft at the same time with a funny sensationlike a continual first sniff of orange blossomjust above your stays this is my first and i feel as if it were going to be my last which is absurd of course by all the laws of nature and morality if you mock me i will smite you and if you tell anybody i will never forgive you so much so that i almost dont think ill send this letter anyway ill sleep over it so goodnight my cherryoh  your fleur     viii  idyll on grass   when those two young forsytes emerged from the chine lane and set their faces east towards the sun there was not a cloud in heaven and the downs were dewy they had come at a good bat up the slope and were a little out of breath if they had anything to say they did not say it but marched in the early awkwardness of unbreakfasted morning under the songs of the larks the stealing out had been fun but with the freedom of the tops the sense of conspiracy ceased and gave place to dumbness  weve made one blooming error said fleur when they had gone half a mile im hungry  jon produced a stick of chocolate they shared it and their tongues were loosened they discussed the nature of their homes and previous existences which had a kind of fascinating unreality up on that lonely height there remained but one thing solid in jons pasthis mother but one thing solid in fleursher father and of these figures as though seen in the distance with disapproving faces they spoke little  the down dipped and rose again towards chanctonbury ring a sparkle of far sea came into view a sparrowhawk hovered in the suns eye so that the bloodnourished brown of his wings gleamed nearly red jon had a passion for birds and an aptitude for sitting very still to watch them keensighted and with a memory for what interested him on birds he was almost worth listening to but in chanctonbury ring there were noneits great beech temple was empty of life and almost chilly at this early hour they came out willingly again into the sun on the far side it was fleurs turn now she spoke of dogs and the way people treated them it was wicked to keep them on chains she would like to flog people who did that jon was astonished to find her so humanitarian she knew a dog it seemed which some farmer near her home kept chained up at the end of his chicken run in all weathers till it had almost lost its voice from barking  and the misery is she said vehemently that if the poor thing didnt bark at every one who passes it wouldnt be kept there i do think men are cunning brutes ive let it go twice on the sly its nearly bitten me both times and then it goes simply mad with joy but it always runs back home at last and they chain it up again if i had my way id chain that man up  jon saw her teeth and her eyes gleam id brand him on his forehead with the word brute that would teach him  jon agreed that it would be a good remedy its their sense of property he said which makes people chain things the last generation thought of nothing but property and thats why there was the war  oh said fleur i never thought of that your people and mine quarrelled about property and anyway weve all got itat least i suppose your people have  oh yes luckily i dont suppose i shall be any good at making money  if you were i dont believe i should like you  jon slipped his hand tremulously under her arm  fleur looked straight before her and chanted      jon jon the farmers son     stole a pig and away he run  jons arm crept round her waist  this is rather sudden said fleur calmly do you often do it  jon dropped his arm but when she laughed his arm stole back again and fleur began to sing     o who will oer the downs so free     o who will with me ride     o who will up and follow me  sing jon  jon sang the larks joined in sheepbells and an early morning church far away over in steyning they went on from tune to tune till fleur said  my god i am hungry now  oh i am sorry  she looked round into his face  jon youre rather a darling  and she pressed his hand against her waist jon almost reeled with happiness a yellowandwhite dog coursing a hare startled them apart they watched the two vanish down the slope till fleur said with a sigh hell never catch it thank goodness whats the time mines stopped i never wound it  jon looked at his watch by jove he said mines stopped too  they walked on again but only hand in hand  if the grass is dry said fleur lets sit down for half a minute  jon took off his coat and they shared it  smell actually wild thyme  with his arm round her waist again they sat some minutes in silence  we are goats cried fleur jumping up we shall be most fearfully late and look so silly and put them on their guard look here jon we only came out to get an appetite for breakfast and lost our way see  yes said jon  its serious therell be a stopper put on us are you a good liar  i believe not very but i can try fleur frowned  you know she said i realise that they dont mean us to be friends  why not  i told you why  but thats silly  yes but you dont know my father  i suppose hes fearfully fond of you  you see im an only child and so are youof your mother isnt it a bore theres so much expected of one by the time theyve done expecting ones as good as dead  yes muttered jon lifes beastly short one wants to live for ever and know everything  and love everybody  no cried jon i only want to love onceyou  indeed youre coming on oh look theres the chalkpit we cant be very far now lets run  jon followed wondering fearfully if he had offended her  the chalkpit was full of sunshine and the murmuration of bees fleur flung back her hair  well she said in case of accidents you may give me one kiss jon and she pushed her cheek forward with ecstasy he kissed that hot soft cheek  now remember we lost our way and leave it to me as much as you can im going to be rather beastly to you its safer try and be beastly to me  jon shook his head thats impossible  just to please me till five oclock at all events  anybody will be able to see through it said jon gloomily  well do your best look there they are wave your hat oh you havent got one well ill cooee get a little away from me and look sulky  five minutes later entering the house and doing his utmost to look sulky jon heard her clear voice in the diningroom  oh im simply ravenous hes going to be a farmerand he loses his way the boys an idiot     ix  goya   lunch was over and soames mounted to the picturegallery in his house near mapledurham he had what annette called a grief fleur was not yet home she had been expected on wednesday had wired that it would be friday and again on friday that it would be sunday afternoon and here were her aunt and her cousins the cardigans and this fellow profond and everything flat as a pancake for the want of her he stood before his gauguinsorest point of his collection he had bought the ugly great thing with two early matisses before the war because there was such a fuss about those postimpressionist chaps he was wondering whether profond would take them off his handsthe fellow seemed not to know what to do with his moneywhen he heard his sisters voice say i think thats a horrid thing soames and saw that winifred had followed him up  oh you do he said dryly i gave five hundred for it  fancy women arent made like that even if they are black  soames uttered a glum laugh you didnt come up to tell me that  no do you know that jolyons boy is staying with val and his wife  soames spun round  what  yes drawled winifred hes gone to live with them there while he learns farming  soames had turned away but her voice pursued him as he walked up and down i warned val that neither of them was to be spoken to about old matters  why didnt you tell me before  winifred shrugged her substantial shoulders  fleur does what she likes youve always spoiled her besides my dear boy whats the harm  the harm muttered soames why she he checked himself the juno the handkerchief fleurs eyes her questions and now this delay in her returnthe symptoms seemed to him so sinister that faithful to his nature he could not part with them  i think you take too much care said winifred if i were you i should tell her of that old matter its no good thinking that girls in these days are as they used to be where they pick up their knowledge i cant tell but they seem to know everything  over soamess face closely composed passed a sort of spasm and winifred added hastily  if you dont like to speak of it i could for you soames shook his head unless there was absolute necessity the thought that his adored daughter should learn of that old scandal hurt his pride too much  no he said not yet never if i can help it  nonsense my dear think what people are  twenty years is a long time muttered soames outside our family whos likely to remember  winifred was silenced she inclined more and more to that peace and quietness of which montague dartie had deprived her in her youth and since pictures always depressed her she soon went down again  soames passed into the corner where side by side hung his real goya and the copy of the fresco la vendimia his acquisition of the real goya rather beautifully illustrated the cobweb of vested interests and passions which mesh the brightwinged fly of human life the real goyas noble owners ancestor had come into possession of it during some spanish warit was in a word loot the noble owner had remained in ignorance of its value until in the nineties an enterprising critic discovered that a spanish painter named goya was a genius it was only a fair goya but almost unique in england and the noble owner became a marked man having many possessions and that aristocratic culture which independent of mere sensuous enjoyment is founded on the sounder principle that one must know everything and be fearfully interested in life he had fully intended to keep an article which contributed to his reputation while he was alive and to leave it to the nation after he was dead fortunately for soames the house of lords was violently attacked in 1909 and the noble owner became alarmed and angry if he said to himself they think they can have it both ways they are very much mistaken so long as they leave me in quiet enjoyment the nation can have some of my pictures at my death but if the nation is going to bait me and rob me like this im damned if i wont sell thelot they cant have my private property and my public spiritboth he brooded in this fashion for several months till one morning after reading the speech of a certain statesman he telegraphed to his agent to come down and bring bodkin on going over the collection bodkin than whose opinion on market values none was more sought pronounced that with a free hand to sell to america germany and other places where there was an interest in art a lot more money could be made than by selling in england the noble owners public spirithe saidwas well known but the pictures were unique the noble owner put this opinion in his pipe and smoked it for a year at the end of that time he read another speech by the same statesman and telegraphed to his agents give bodkin a free hand it was at this juncture that bodkin conceived the idea which salved the goya and two other unique pictures for the native country of the noble owner with one hand bodkin proffered the pictures to the foreign market with the other he formed a list of private british collectors having obtained what he considered the highest possible bids from across the seas he submitted pictures and bids to the private british collectors and invited them of their public spirit to outbid in three instances including the goya out of twentyone he was successful and why one of the private collectors made buttonshe had made so many that he desired that his wife should be called lady buttons he therefore bought an unique picture at great cost and gave it to the nation it was part his friends said of his general game the second of the private collectors was an americophobe and bought a unique picture to spite the damned yanks the third of the private collectors was soames whomore sober than either of the othersbought after a visit to madrid because he was certain that goya was still on the up grade goya was not booming at the moment but he would come again and looking at that portrait hogarthian manetesque in its directness but with its own queer sharp beauty of paint he was perfectly satisfied still that he had made no error heavy though the price had beenheaviest he had ever paid and next to it was hanging the copy of la vendimia there she wasthe little wretchlooking back at him in her dreamy mood the mood he loved best because he felt so much safer when she looked like that  he was still gazing when the scent of a cigar impinged on his nostrils and a voice said well mr forsyde what you goin to do with this small lot  that belgian chap whose motheras if flemish blood were not enoughhad been armenian subduing a natural irritation he said are you a judge of pictures  well ive got a few myself  any postimpressionists  yees i rather like them  what do you think of this said soames pointing to the gauguin  monsieur profond protruded his lower lip and short pointed beard rather fine i think he said do you want to sell it  soames checked his instinctive not particularlyhe would not chaffer with this alien  yes he said  what do you want for it  what i gave  all right said monsieur profond ill be glad to take that small picture postimpressioniststheyre awful dead but theyre amusin i don care for pictures much but ive got some just a small lot  what do you care for  monsieur profond shrugged his shoulders lifes awful like a lot of monkeys scramblin for empty nuts  youre young said soames if the fellow must make a generalisation he neednt suggest that the forms of property lacked solidity  i don worry replied monsieur profond smiling were born and we die half the worlds starvin i feed a small lot of babies out in my mothers country but whats the use might as well throw my money in the river  soames looked at him and turned back towards his goya he didnt know what the fellow wanted  what shall i make my cheque for pursued monsieur profond  five hundred said soames shortly but i dont want you to take it if you dont care for it more than that  thats all right said monsieur profond ill be appy to ave that picture  he wrote a cheque with a fountainpen heavily chased with gold soames watched the process uneasily how on earth had the fellow known that he wanted to sell that picture monsieur profond held out the cheque  the english are awful funny about pictures he said so are the french so are my people theyre all awful funny  i dont understand you said soames stiffly  its like hats said monsieur profond enigmatically small or large turnin up or downjust the fashion awful funny and smiling he drifted out of the gallery again blue and solid like the smoke of his excellent cigar  soames had taken the cheque feeling as if the intrinsic value of ownership had been called in question hes a cosmopolitan he thought watching profond emerge from under the verandah with annette and saunter down the lawn towards the river what his wife saw in the fellow he didnt know unless it was that he could speak her language and there passed in soames what monsieur profond would have called a small doubt whether annette was not too handsome to be walking with any one so cosmopolitan even at that distance he could see the blue fumes from profonds cigar wreathe out in the quiet sunlight and his grey buckskin shoes and his grey hatthe fellow was a dandy and he could see the quick turn of his wifes head so very straight on her desirable neck and shoulders that turn of her neck always seemed to him a little too showy and in the queen of all i survey mannernot quite distinguished he watched them walk along the path at the bottom of the garden a young man in flannels joined them down therea sunday caller no doubt from up the river soames went back to his goya he was still staring at that replica of fleur and worrying over winifreds news when his wifes voice said  mr michael mont soames you invited him to see your pictures  there was the cheerful young man of the gallery off cork street  turned up you see sir i live only four miles from pangbourne jolly day isnt it  confronted with the results of his expansiveness soames scrutinised his visitor the young mans mouth was excessively large and curlyhe seemed always grinning why didnt he grow the rest of those idiotic little moustaches which made him look like a musichall buffoon what on earth were young men about deliberately lowering their class with these toothbrushes or little slug whiskers ugh affected young idiots in other respects he was presentable and his flannels very clean  happy to see you he said  the young man who had been turning his head from side to side became transfixed i say he said some picture  soames saw with mixed sensations that he had addressed the remark to the goya copy  yes he said dryly thats not a goya its a copy i had it painted because it reminded me of my daughter  by jove i thought i knew the face sir is she here  the frankness of his interest almost disarmed soames  shell be in after tea he said shall we go round the gallery  and soames began that round which never tired him he had not anticipated much intelligence from one who had mistaken a copy for an original but as they passed from section to section period to period he was startled by the young mans frank and relevant remarks natively shrewd himself and even sensuous beneath his mask soames had not spent thirtyeight years over his one hobby without knowing something more about pictures than their market values he was as it were the missing link between the artist and the commercial public art for arts sake and all that of course was cant but aesthetics and good taste were necessary the appreciation of enough persons of good taste was what gave a work of art its permanent market value or in other words made it a work of art there was no real cleavage and he was sufficiently accustomed to sheeplike and unseeing visitors to be intrigued by one who did not hesitate to say of mauve good old haystacks or of james maris didnt he just paint and paper em mathew was the real swell sir you could dig into his surfaces it was after the young man had whistled before a whistler with the words dyou think he ever really saw a naked woman sir that soames remarked  what are you mr mont if i may ask  i sir i was going to be a painter but the war knocked that then in the trenches you know i used to dream of the stock exchange snug and warm and just noisy enough but the peace knocked that shares seem off dont they ive only been demobbed about a year what do you recommend sir  have you got money  well answered the young man ive got a father i kept him alive during the war so hes bound to keep me alive now though of course theres the question whether he ought to be allowed to hang on to his property what do you think about that sir  soames pale and defensive smiled  the old man has fits when i tell him he may have to work yet hes got land you know its a fatal disease  this is my real goya said soames dryly  by george he was a swell i saw a goya in munich once that bowled me middle stump a most evillooking old woman in the most gorgeous lace he made no compromise with the public taste that old boy was some explosive he must have smashed up a lot of convention in his day couldnt he just paint he makes velasquez stiff dont you think  i have no velasquez said soames  the young man stared no he said only nations or profiteers can afford him i suppose i say why shouldnt all the bankrupt nations sell their velasquezes and titians and other swells to the profiteers by force and then pass a law that any one who holds a picture by an old mastersee schedulemust hang it in a public gallery there seems something in that  shall we go down to tea said soames  the young mans ears seemed to droop on his skull hes not dense thought soames following him off the premises  goya with his satiric and surpassing precision his original line and the daring of his light and shade could have reproduced to admiration the group assembled round annettes teatray in the inglenook below he alone perhaps of painters would have done justice to the sunlight filtering through a screen of creeper to the lovely pallor of brass the old cut glasses the thin slices of lemon in pale amber tea justice to annette in her black lacey dress there was something of the fair spaniard in her beauty though it lacked the spirituality of that rare type to winifreds greyhaired corseted solidity to soames of a certain grey and flatcheeked distinction to the vivacious michael mont pointed in ear and eye to imogen dark luscious of glance growing a little stout to prosper profond with his expression as who should say well mr goya whats the use of paintin this small party finally to jack cardigan with his shining stare and tanned sanguinity betraying the moving principle im english and i live to be fit  curious by the way that imogen who as a girl had declared solemnly one day at timothys that she would never marry a good manthey were so dullshould have married jack cardigan in whom health had so destroyed all traces of original sin that she might have retired to rest with ten thousand other englishmen without knowing the difference from the one she had chosen to repose beside oh she would say of him in her amusing way jack keeps himself so fearfully fit hes never had a days illness in his life he went right through the war without a fingerache you really cant imagine how fit he is indeed he was so fit that he couldnt see when she was flirting which was such a comfort in a way all the same she was quite fond of him so far as one could be of a sportsmachine and of the two little cardigans made after his pattern her eyes just then were comparing him maliciously with prosper profond there was no small sport or game which monsieur profond had not played at too it seemed from skittles to harponfishing and worn out every one imogen would sometimes wish that they had worn out jack who continued to play at them and talk of them with the simple zeal of a schoolgirl learning hockey at the age of greatuncle timothy she well knew that jack would be playing carpet golf in her bedroom and wiping somebodys eye  he was telling them now how he had pipped the proa charmin fellow playin a very good game at the last hole this morning and how he had pulled down to caversham since lunch and trying to incite prosper profond to play him a set of tennis after teado him goodkeep him fit  but whats the use of keepin fit said monsieur profond  yes sir murmured michael mont what do you keep fit for  jack cried imogen enchanted what do you keep fit for  jack cardigan stared with all his health the questions were like the buzz of a mosquito and he put up his hand to wipe them away during the war of course he had kept fit to kill germans now that it was over he either did not know or shrank in delicacy from explanation of his moving principle  but hes right said monsieur profond unexpectedly theres nothin left but keepin fit  the saying too deep for sunday afternoon would have passed unanswered but for the mercurial nature of young mont  good he cried thats the great discovery of the war we all thought we were progressingnow we know were only changing  for the worse said monsieur profond genially  how you are cheerful prosper murmured annette  you come and play tennis said jack cardigan youve got the hump well soon take that down dyou play mr mont  i hit the ball about sir  at this juncture soames rose ruffled in that deep instinct of preparation for the future which guided his existence  when fleur comes he heard jack cardigan say  ah and why didnt she come he passed through drawingroom hall and porch out onto the drive and stood there listening for the car all was still and sundayfied the lilacs in full flower scented the air there were white clouds like the feathers of ducks gilded by the sunlight memory of the day when fleur was born and he had waited in such agony with her life and her mothers balanced in his hands came to him sharply he had saved her then to be the flower of his life and now was she going to give him troublepaingive him trouble he did not like the look of things a blackbird broke in on his reverie with an evening songa great big fellow up in that acaciatree soames had taken quite an interest in his birds of late years he and fleur would walk round and watch them her eyes were sharp as needles and she knew every nest he saw her dog a retriever lying on the drive in a patch of sunlight and called to him hallo old fellowwaiting for her too the dog came slowly with a grudging tail and soames mechanically laid a pat on his head the dog the bird the lilac all were part of fleur for him no more no less too fond of her he thought too fond he was like a man uninsured with his ships at sea uninsured againas in that other time so long ago when he would wander dumb and jealous in the wilderness of london longing for that womanhis first wifehe mother of this infernal boy ah there was the car at last it drew up it had luggage but no fleur  miss fleur is walking up sir by the towingpath  walking all those miles soames stared the mans face had the beginning of a smile on it what was he grinning at and very quickly he turned saying all right sims and went into the house he mounted to the picturegallery once more he had from there a view of the river bank and stood with his eyes fixed on it oblivious of the fact that it would be an hour at least before her figure showed there walking up and that fellows grin the boy he turned abruptly from the window he couldnt spy on her if she wanted to keep things from himshe must he could not spy on her his heart felt empty and bitterness mounted from it into his very mouth the staccato shouts of jack cardigan pursuing the ball the laugh of young mont rose in the stillness and came in he hoped they were making that chap profond run and the girl in la vendimia stood with her arm akimbo and her dreamy eyes looking past him ive done all i could for you he thought since you were no higher than my knee you arent going totohurt me are you  but the goya copy answered not brilliant in colour just beginning to tone down theres no real life in it thought soames why doesnt she come     x  trio   among those four forsytes of the third and as one might say fourth generation at wansdon under the downs a weekend prolonged unto the ninth day had stretched the crossing threads of tenacity almost to snappingpoint never had fleur been so fine holly so watchful val so stablesecretive jon so silent and disturbed what he learned of farming in that week might have been balanced on the point of a penknife and puffed off he whose nature was essentially averse to intrigue and whose adoration of fleur disposed him to think that any need for concealing it was skittles chafed and fretted yet obeyed taking what relief he could in the few moments when they were alone on thursday while they were standing in the bay window of the drawingroom dressed for dinner she said to him  jon im going home on sunday by the 340 from paddington if you were to go home on saturday you could come up on sunday and take me down and just get back here by the last train after you were going home anyway werent you  jon nodded  anything to be with you he said only why need i pretend  fleur slipped her little finger into his palm  you have no instinct jon you must leave things to me its serious about our people weve simply got to be secret at present if we want to be together the door was opened and she added loudly you are a duffer jon  something turned over within jon he could not bear this subterfuge about a feeling so natural so overwhelming and so sweet  on friday night about eleven he had packed his bag and was leaning out of his window half miserable and half lost in a dream of paddington station when he heard a tiny sound as of a fingernail tapping on his door he rushed to it and listened again the sound it was a nail he opened oh what a lovely thing came in  i wanted to show you my fancy dress it said and struck an attitude at the foot of his bed jon drew a long breath and leaned against the door the apparition wore white muslin on its head a fichu round its bare neck over a winecoloured dress fulled out below its slender waist it held one arm akimbo and the other raised rightangled holding a fan which touched its head  this ought to be a basket of grapes it whispered but i havent got it here its my goya dress and this is the attitude in the picture do you like it  its a dream  the apparition pirouetted touch it and see  jon knelt down and took the skirt reverently  grape colour came the whisper all grapesla vendimiathe vintage  jons fingers scarcely touched each side of the waist he looked up with adoring eyes  oh jon it whispered bent kissed his forehead pirouetted again andgliding out was gone  jon stayed on his knees and his head fell forward against the bed how long he stayed like that he did not know the little noises of the tapping nail the feet the skirts rustlingas in a dreamwent on about him and before his closed eyes the figure stood and smiled and whispered a faint perfume of narcissus lingering in the air and his forehead where it had been kissed had a little cool place between the brows like the imprint of a flower love filled his soul that love of boy for girl which knows so little hopes so much would not brush the down off for the world and must become in time a fragrant memorya searing passiona humdrum mateshipor once in many times vintage full and sweet with sunset colour on the grapes  enough has been said about jon forsyte here and in another place to show what long marches lay between him and his greatgreatgrandfather the first jolyon in dorset down by the sea jon was sensitive as a girl more sensitive than nine out of ten girls of the day imaginative as one of his halfsister junes lame duck painters affectionate as a son of his father and his mother naturally would be and yet in his inner tissue there was something of the old founder of his family a secret tenacity of soul a dread of showing his feelings a determination not to know when he was beaten sensitive imaginative affectionate boys get a bad time at school but jon had instinctively kept his nature dark and been but normally unhappy there only with his mother had he up till then been absolutely frank and natural and when he went home to robin hill that saturday his heart was heavy because fleur had said that he must not be frank and natural with her from whom he had never yet kept anything must not even tell her that they had met again unless he found that she knew already so intolerable did this seem to him that he was very near to telegraphing an excuse and staying up in london and the first thing his mother said to him was  so youve had our little friend of the confectioners there jon what is she like on second thoughts  with relief and a high colour jon answered  oh awfully jolly mum  her arm pressed his  jon had never loved her so much as in that minute which seemed to falsify fleurs fears and to release his soul he turned to look at her but something in her smiling facesomething which only he perhaps would have caughtstopped the words bubbling up in him could fear go with a smile if so there was fear in her face and out of jon tumbled quite other words about farming holly and the downs talking fast he waited for her to come back to fleur but she did not nor did his father mention her though of course he too must know what deprivation and killing of reality was in this silence about fleurwhen he was so full of her when his mother was so full of jon and his father so full of his mother and so the trio spent the evening of that saturday  after dinner his mother played she seemed to play all the things he liked best and he sat with one knee clasped and his hair standing up where his fingers had run through it he gazed at his mother while she played but he saw fleurfleur in the moonlit orchard fleur in the sunlit gravelpit fleur in that fancy dress swaying whispering stooping kissing his forehead once while he listened he forgot himself and glanced at his father in that other easy chair what was dad looking like that for the expression on his face was so sad and puzzling it filled him with a sort of remorse so that he got up and went and sat on the arm of his fathers chair from there he could not see his face and again he saw fleurin his mothers hands slim and white on the keys in the profile of her face and her powdery hair and down the long room in the open window where the may night walked outside  when he went up to bed his mother came into his room she stood at the window and said  those cypresses your grandfather planted down there have done wonderfully i always think they look beautiful under a dropping moon i wish you had known your grandfather jon  were you married to father when he was alive asked jon suddenly  no dear he died in 92very oldeightyfive i think  is father like him  a little but more subtle and not quite so solid  i know from grandfathers portrait who painted that  one of junes lame ducks but its quite good  jon slipped his hand through his mothers arm tell me about the family quarrel mum  he felt her arm quivering no dear thats for your father some day if he thinks fit  then it was serious said jon with a catch in his breath  yes and there was a silence during which neither knew whether the arm or the hand within it were quivering most  some people said irene softly think the moon on her back is evil to me shes always lovely look at those cypress shadows jon father says we may go to italy you and i for two months would you like  jon took his hand from under her arm his sensation was so sharp and so confused italy with his mother a fortnight ago it would have been perfection now it filled him with dismay he felt that the sudden suggestion had to do with fleur he stammered out  oh yes onlyi dont know ought inow ive just begun id like to think it over  her voice answered cool and gentle  yes dear think it over but better now than when youve begun farming seriously italy with you it would be nice  jon put his arm round her waist still slim and firm as a girls  do you think you ought to leave father he said feebly feeling very mean  father suggested it he thinks you ought to see italy at least before you settle down to anything  the sense of meanness died in jon he knew yeshe knewthat his father and his mother were not speaking frankly no more than he himself they wanted to keep him from fleur his heart hardened and as if she felt that process going on his mother said  goodnight darling have a good sleep and think it over but it would be lovely  she pressed him to her so quickly that he did not see her face jon stood feeling exactly as he used to when he was a naughty little boy sore because he was not loving and because he was justified in his own eyes  but irene after she had stood a moment in her own room passed through the dressingroom between it and her husbands  well  he will think it over jolyon  watching her lips that wore a little drawn smile jolyon said quietly  you had better let me tell him and have done with it after all jon has the instincts of a gentleman he has only to understand  only he cant understand thats impossible  i believe i could have at his age  irene caught his hand you were always more of a realist than jon and never so innocent  thats true said jolyon its queer isnt it you and i would tell our stories to the world without a particle of shame but our own boy stumps us  weve never cared whether the world approves or not  jon would not disapprove of us  oh jolyon yes hes in love i feel hes in love and hed say my mother once married without love how could she have itll seem to him a crime and so it was  jolyon took her hand and said with a wry smile  ah why on earth are we born young now if only we were born old and grew younger year by year we should understand how things happen and drop all our cursed intolerance but you know if the boy is really in love he wont forget even if he goes to italy were a tenacious breed and hell know by instinct why hes being sent nothing will really cure him but the shock of being told  let me try anyway  jolyon stood a moment without speaking between this devil and this deep seathe pain of a dreaded disclosure and the grief of losing his wife for two monthshe secretly hoped for the devil yet if she wished for the deep sea he must put up with it after all it would be training for that departure from which there would be no return and taking her in his arms he kissed her eyes and said  as you will my love     xi  duet   that small emotion love grows amazingly when threatened with extinction jon reached paddington station half an hour before his time and a full week after as it seemed to him he stood at the appointed bookstall amid a crowd of sunday travellers in a harris tweed suit exhaling as it were the emotion of his thumping heart he read the names of the novels on the bookstall and bought one at last to avoid being regarded with suspicion by the bookstall clerk it was called the heart of the trail which must mean something though it did not seem to he also bought the ladys mirror and the landsman every minute was an hour long and full of horrid imaginings after nineteen had passed he saw her with a bag and a porter wheeling her luggage she came swiftly she came cool she greeted him as if he were a brother  first class she said to the porter corner seats opposite  jon admired her frightful selfpossession  cant we get a carriage to ourselves he whispered  no good its a stopping train after maidenhead perhaps look natural jon  jon screwed his features into a scowl they got inwith two other beastsoh heaven he tipped the porter unnaturally in his confusion the brute deserved nothing for putting them in there and looking as if he knew all about it into the bargain  fleur hid herself behind the ladys mirror jon imitated her behind the landsman the train started fleur let the ladys mirror fall and leaned forward well she said  its seemed about fifteen days  she nodded and jons face lighted up at once  look natural murmured fleur and went off into a bubble of laughter it hurt him how could he look natural with italy hanging over him he had meant to break it to her gently but now he blurted it out  they want me to go to italy with mother for two months  fleur drooped her eyelids turned a little pale and bit her lips  oh she said it was all but it was much  that oh was like the quick drawback of the wrist in fencing ready for riposte it came  you must go  go said jon in a strangled voice  of course  buttwo monthsits ghastly  no said fleur six weeks youll have forgotten me by then well meet in the national gallery the day after you get back  jon laughed  but suppose youve forgotten me he muttered into the noise of the train  fleur shook her head  some other beast murmured jon  her foot touched his  no other beast she said lifting the ladys mirror  the train stopped two passengers got out and one got in  i shall die thought jon if were not alone at all  the train went on and again fleur leaned forward  i never let go she said do you  jon shook his head vehemently  never he said will you write to me  no but you canto my club  she had a club she was wonderful  did you pump holly he muttered  yes but got nothing i didnt dare pump hard  what can it be cried jon  i shall find out all right  a long silence followed till fleur said this is maidenhead stand by jon  the train stopped the remaining passenger got out fleur drew down her blind  quick she cried hang out look as much of a beast as you can  jon blew his nose and scowled never in all his life had he scowled like that an old lady recoiled a young one tried the handle it turned but the lock would not open the train moved the young lady darted to another carriage  what luck cried jon it jammed  yes said fleur i was holding it  the train moved out and jon fell on his knees  look out for the corridor she whispered andquick  her lips met his and though their kiss only lasted perhaps ten seconds jons soul left his body and went so far beyond that when he was again sitting opposite that demure figure he was pale as death he heard her sigh and the sound seemed to him the most precious he had ever heardan exquisite declaration that he meant something to her  six weeks isnt really long she said and you can easily make it six if you keep your head out there and never seem to think of me  jon gasped  this is just whats really wanted jon to convince them dont you see if were just as bad when you come back theyll stop being ridiculous about it only im sorry its not spain theres a girl in a goya picture at madrid whos like me father says only she isntweve got a copy of her  it was to jon like a ray of sunshine piercing through a fog ill make it spain he said mother wont mind shes never been there and my father thinks a lot of goya  oh yes hes a painterisnt he  only watercolour said jon with honesty  when we come to reading jon get out first and go down to caversham lock and wait for me ill send the car home and well walk by the towingpath  jon seized her hand in gratitude and they sat silent with the world well lost and one eye on the corridor but the train seemed to run twice as fast now and its sound was almost lost in that of jons sighing  were getting near said fleur the towingpaths awfully exposed one more oh jon dont forget me  jon answered with his kiss and very soon a flushed distractedlooking youth could have been seenas they sayleaping from the train and hurrying along the platform searching his pockets for his ticket  when at last she rejoined him on the towingpath a little beyond caversham lock he had made an effort and regained some measure of equanimity if they had to part he would not make a scene a breeze by the bright river threw the white side of the willow leaves up into the sunlight and followed those two with its faint rustle  i told our chauffeur that i was traingiddy said fleur did you look pretty natural as you went out i dont know what is natural  its natural to you to look seriously happy when i first saw you i thought you werent a bit like other people  exactly what i thought when i saw you i knew at once i should never love anybody else  fleur laughed  were absurdly young and loves young dream is out of date jon besides its awfully wasteful think of all the fun you might have you havent begun even its a shame really and theres me i wonder  confusion came on jons spirit how could she say such things just as they were going to part  if you feel like that he said i cant go i shall tell mother that i ought to try and work theres always the condition of the world  the condition of the world  jon thrust his hands deep into his pockets  but there is he said think of the people starving  fleur shook her head no no i never never will make myself miserable for nothing  nothing but theres an awful state of things and of course one ought to help  oh yes i know all that but you cant help people jon theyre hopeless when you pull them out of a hole they only get into another look at them still fighting and plotting and struggling though theyre dying in heaps all the time idiots  arent you sorry for them  oh sorryyes but im not going to make myself unhappy about it thats no good  and they were silent disturbed by this first glimpse of each others natures  i think people are brutes and idiots said fleur stubbornly  i think theyre poor wretches said jon it was as if they had quarrelledand at this supreme and awful moment with parting visible out there in that last gap of the willows  well go and help your poor wretches and dont think of me  jon stood still sweat broke out on his forehead and his limbs trembled fleur too had stopped and was frowning at the river  i must believe in things said jon with a sort of agony were all meant to enjoy life  fleur laughed yes and thats what you wont do if you dont take care but perhaps your idea of enjoyment is to make yourself wretched there are lots of people like that of course  she was pale her eyes had darkened her lips had thinned was it fleur thus staring at the water jon had an unreal feeling as if he were passing through the scene in a book where the lover has to choose between love and duty but just then she looked round at him never was anything so intoxicating as that vivacious look it acted on him exactly as the tug of a chain acts on a dogbrought him up to her with his tail wagging and his tongue out  dont lets be silly she said times too short look jon you can just see where ive got to cross the river there round the bend where the woods begin  jon saw a gable a chimney or two a patch of wall through the treesand felt his heart sink  i mustnt dawdle any more its no good going beyond the next hedge it gets all open lets get on to it and say goodbye  they went side by side hand in hand silently towards the hedge where the mayflower both pink and white was in full bloom  my clubs the talisman stratton street piccadilly letters there will be quite safe and im almost always up once a week  jon nodded his face had become extremely set his eyes stared straight before him  todays the twentythird of may said fleur on the ninth of july i shall be in front of the bacchus and ariadne at three oclock will you  i will  if you feel as bad as i its all right let those people pass  a man and woman airing their children went by strung out in sunday fashion  the last of them passed the wicket gate  domesticity said fleur and blotted herself against the hawthorn hedge the blossom sprayed out above her head and one pink cluster brushed her cheek jon put up his hand jealously to keep it off  goodbye jon for a second they stood with hands hard clasped then their lips met for the third time and when they parted fleur broke away and fled through the wicket gate jon stood where she had left him with his forehead against that pink cluster gone for an eternityfor seven weeks all but two days and here he was wasting the last sight of her he rushed to the gate she was walking swiftly on the heels of the straggling children she turned her head he saw her hand make a little flitting gesture then she sped on and the trailing family blotted her out from his view  the words of a comic song      paddington groanworst ever known     he gave a sepulchral paddington groan  came into his head and he sped incontinently back to reading station all the way up to london and down to wansdon he sat with the heart of the trail open on his knee knitting in his head a poem so full of feeling that it would not rhyme     xii  caprice   fleur sped on she had need of rapid motion she was late and wanted all her wits about her when she got in she passed the islands the station and hotel and was about to take the ferry when she saw a skiff with a young man standing up in it and holding to the bushes  miss forsyte he said let me put you across ive come on purpose  she looked at him in blank amazement  its all right ive been having tea with your people i thought id save you the last bit its on my way im just off back to pangbourne my names mont i saw you at the picturegalleryyou rememberwhen your father invited me to see his pictures  oh said fleur yesthe handkerchief  to this young man she owed jon and taking his hand she stepped down into the skiff still emotional and a little out of breath she sat silent not so the young man she had never heard any one say so much in so short a time he told her his age twentyfour his weight ten stone eleven his place of residence not far away described his sensations under fire and what it felt like to be gassed criticised the juno mentioned his own conception of that goddess commented on the goya copy said fleur was not too awfully like it sketched in rapidly the condition of england spoke of monsieur profondor whatever his name wasas an awful sport thought her father had some ripping pictures and some rather dugup hoped he might row down again and take her on the river because he was quite trustworthy inquired her opinion of tchekov gave her his own wished they could go to the russian ballet together some timeconsidered the name fleur forsyte simply topping cursed his people for giving him the name of michael on the top of mont outlined his father and said that if she wanted a good book she should read job his father was rather like job while job still had land  but job didnt have land fleur murmured he only had flocks and herds and moved on  ah answered michael mont i wish my govnor would move on not that i want his land lands an awful bore in these days dont you think  we never have it in my family said fleur we have everything else i believe one of my greatuncles once had a sentimental farm in dorset because we came from there originally but it cost him more than it made him happy  did he sell it  no he kept it  why  because nobody would buy it  good for the old boy  no it wasnt good for him father says it soured him his name was swithin  what a corking name  do you know said fleur that were getting farther off not nearer this river flows  splendid cried mont dipping his sculls vaguely its good to meet a girl whos got wit  but better to meet a young man whos got it in the plural  young mont raised a hand to tear his hair  look out cried fleur your scull  all right its thick enough to bear a scratch  do you mind sculling said fleur severely i want to get in  ah but when you get in you see i shant see you any more today fini as the french girl said when she jumped on her bed after saying her prayers dont you bless the day that gave you a french mother and a name like yours  i like my name but father gave it me mother wanted me called marguerite  which is absurd do you mind calling me m m and letting me call you f f its in the spirit of the age  i dont mind anything so long as i get in mont caught a little crab and answered that was a nasty one  please row  i am and he did for several strokes looking at her with rueful eagerness of course you know he ejaculated pausing that i came to see you not your fathers pictures  fleur rose  if you dont row i shall get out and swim  really and truly then i could come in after you  mr mont im late and tired please put me on shore at once  when she stepped out on to the garden landingstage he rose and grasping his hair with both hands looked at her  fleur smiled  dont cried the irrepressible mont i know youre going to say out damned hair  fleur whisked round threw him a wave of her hand goodbye mr m m she called and was gone among the rosetrees she looked at her wristwatch and the windows of the house it struck her as curiously uninhabited past six the pigeons were just gathering to roost and sunlight slanted on the dovecot on their snowy feathers and beyond in a shower on the top boughs of the woods the click of billiardballs came from the inglenookjack cardigan no doubt a faint rustling too from an eucalyptustree startling southerner in this old english garden she reached the verandah and was passing in but stopped at the sound of voices from the drawingroom to her left mother profond from behind the verandah screen which fenced the inglenook she heard these words  i dont annette  did father know that he called her mother annette always on the side of her fatheras children are ever on one side or the other in houses where relations are a little strainedshe stood uncertain her mother was speaking in her low pleasing slightly metallic voiceone word she caught demain and profonds answer all right fleur frowned a little sound came out into the stillness then profonds voice im takin a small stroll  fleur darted through the window into the morning room there he camefrom the drawingroom crossing the verandah down the lawn and the click of billiardballs which in listening for other sounds she had ceased to hear began again she shook herself passed into the hall and opened the drawingroom door her mother was sitting on the sofa between the windows her knees crossed her head resting on a cushion her lips half parted her eyes half closed she looked extraordinarily handsome  ah here you are fleur your father is beginning to fuss  where is he  in the picturegallery go up  what are you going to do tomorrow mother  tomorrow i go up to london with your aunt why  i thought you might be will you get me a quite plain parasol  what color  green theyre all going back i suppose  yes all you will console your father kiss me then  fleur crossed the room stooped received a kiss on her forehead and went out past the impress of a form on the sofacushions in the other corner she ran upstairs  fleur was by no means the oldfashioned daughter who demands the regulation of her parents lives in accordance with the standard imposed on herself she claimed to regulate her own life not those of others besides an unerring instinct for what was likely to advantage her own case was already at work in a disturbed domestic atmosphere the heart she had set on jon would have a better chance none the less was she offended as a flower by a crisping wind if that man had really been kissing her mother it wasserious and her father ought to know  demain all right and her mother going up to town she turned in to her bedroom and hung out of the window to cool her face which had suddenly grown very hot jon must be at the station by now what did her father know about jon probably everythingpretty nearly  she changed her dress so as to look as if she had been in some time and ran up to the gallery  soames was standing stubbornly still before his alfred stevensthe picture he loved best he did not turn at the sound of the door but she knew he had heard and she knew he was hurt she came up softly behind him put her arms round his neck and poked her face over his shoulder till her cheek lay against his it was an advance which had never yet failed but it failed her now and she augured the worst  well he said stonily so youve come  is that all murmured fleur from a bad parent and rubbed her cheek against his  soames shook his head so far as that was possible  why do you keep me on tenterhooks like this putting me off and off  darling it was very harmless  harmless much you know whats harmless and what isnt  fleur dropped her arms  well then dear suppose you tell me and be quite frank about it  and she went over to the windowseat  her father had turned from his picture and was staring at his feet he looked very grey he has nice small feet she thought catching his eye at once averted from her  youre my only comfort said soames suddenly and you go on like this  fleurs heart began to beat  like what dear  again soames gave her a look which but for the affection in it might have been called furtive  you know what i told you he said i dont choose to have anything to do with that branch of our family  yes ducky but i dont know why i shouldnt  soames turned on his heel  im not going into the reasons he said you ought to trust me fleur  the way he spoke those words affected fleur but she thought of jon and was silent tapping her foot against the wainscot unconsciously she had assumed a modern attitude with one leg twisted in and out of the other with her chin on one bent wrist her other arm across her chest and its hand hugging her elbow there was not a line of her that was not involuted and yetin spite of allshe retained a certain grace  you knew my wishes soames went on and yet you stayed on there four days and i suppose that boy came with you today  fleur kept her eyes on him  i dont ask you anything said soames i make no inquisition where youre concerned  fleur suddenly stood up leaning out at the window with her chin on her hands the sun had sunk behind trees the pigeons were perched quite still on the edge of the dovecot the click of the billiardballs mounted and a faint radiance shone out below where jack cardigan had turned the light up  will it make you any happier she said suddenly if i promise you not to see him for saythe next six weeks she was not prepared for a sort of tremble in the blankness of his voice  six weeks six yearssixty years more like dont delude yourself fleur dont delude yourself  fleur turned in alarm  father what is it  soames came close enough to see her face  dont tell me he said that youre foolish enough to have any feeling beyond caprice that would be too much and he laughed  fleur who had never heard him laugh like that thought then it is deep oh what is it and putting her hand through his arm she said lightly  no of course caprice only i like my caprices and i dont like yours dear  mine said soames bitterly and turned away  the light outside had chilled and threw a chalky whiteness on the river the trees had lost all gaiety of colour she felt a sudden hunger for jons face for his hands and the feel of his lips again on hers and pressing her arms tight across her breast she forced out a little light laugh  o la la what a small fuss as profond would say father i dont like that man  she saw him stop and take something out of his breast pocket  you dont he said why  nothing murmured fleur just caprice  no said soames not caprice and he tore what was in his hands across youre right i dont like him either  look said fleur softly there he goes i hate his shoes they dont make any noise  down in the failing light prosper profond moved his hands in his side pockets whistling softly in his beard he stopped and glanced up at the sky as if saying i dont think much of that small moon  fleur drew back isnt he a great cat she whispered and the sharp click of the billiardballs rose as if jack cardigan had capped the cat the moon caprice and tragedy with in off the red  monsieur profond had resumed his strolling to a teasing little tune in his beard what was it oh yes from rigoletto donna e mobile just what he would think she squeezed her fathers arm  prowling she muttered as he turned the corner of the house it was past that disillusioned moment which divides the day and nightstill and lingering and warm with hawthorn scent and lilac scent clinging on the riverside air a blackbird suddenly burst out jon would be in london by now in the park perhaps crossing the serpentine thinking of her a little sound beside her made her turn her eyes her father was again tearing the paper in his hands fleur saw it was a cheque  i shant sell him my gauguin he said i dont know what your aunt and imogen see in him  or mother  your mother said soames  poor father she thought he never looks happynot really happy i dont want to make him worse but of course i shall have to when jon comes back oh well sufficient unto the night  im going to dress she said  in her room she had a fancy to put on her freak dress it was of gold tissue with little trousers of the same tightly drawn in at the ankles a pages cape slung from the shoulders little gold shoes and a goldwinged mercury helmet and all over her were tiny gold bells especially on the helmet so that if she shook her head she pealed when she was dressed she felt quite sick because jon could not see her it even seemed a pity that the sprightly young man michael mont would not have a view but the gong had sounded and she went down  she made a sensation in the drawingroom winifred thought it most amusing imogen was enraptured jack cardigan called it stunning ripping topping and corking monsieur profond smiling with his eyes said thats a nice small dress her mother very handsome in black sat looking at her and said nothing it remained for her father to apply the test of common sense what did you put on that thing for youre not going to dance  fleur spun round and the bells pealed  caprice  soames stared at her and turning away gave his arm to winifred jack cardigan took her mother prosper profond took imogen fleur went in by herself with her bells jingling  the small moon had soon dropped down and may night had fallen soft and warm enwrapping with its grapebloom colour and its scents the billion caprices intrigues passions longings and regrets of men and women happy was jack cardigan who snored into imogens white shoulder fit as a flea or timothy in his mausoleum too old for anything but babys slumber for so many lay awake or dreamed teased by the crisscross of the world  the dew fell and the flowers closed cattle grazed on in the river meadows feeling with their tongues for the grass they could not see and the sheep on the downs lay quiet as stones pheasants in the tall trees of the pangbourne woods larks on their grassy nests above the gravelpit at wansdon swallows in the eaves at robin hill and the sparrows of mayfair all made a dreamless night of it soothed by the lack of wind the mayfly filly hardly accustomed to her new quarters scraped at her straw a little and the few nightflitting thingsbats moths owlswere vigorous in the warm darkness but the peace of night lay in the brain of all daytime nature colourless and still men and women alone riding the hobbyhorses of anxiety or love burned their wavering tapers of dream and thought into the lonely hours  fleur leaning out of her window heard the hall clocks muffled chime of twelve the tiny splash of a fish the sudden shaking of an aspens leaves in the puffs of breeze that rose along the river the distant rumble of a night train and time and again the sounds which none can put a name to in the darkness soft obscure expressions of uncatalogued emotions from man and beast bird and machine or maybe from departed forsytes darties cardigans taking night strolls back into a world which had once suited their embodied spirits but fleur heeded not these sounds her spirit far from disembodied fled with swift wing from railwaycarriage to flowery hedge straining after jon tenacious of his forbidden image and the sound of his voice which was taboo and she crinkled her nose retrieving from the perfume of the riverside night that moment when his hand slipped between the mayflowers and her cheek long she leaned out in her freak dress keen to burn her wings at lifes candle while the moths brushed her cheeks on their pilgrimage to the lamp on her dressingtable ignorant that in a forsytes house there is no open flame but at last even she felt sleepy and forgetting her bells drew quickly in  through the open window of his room alongside annettes soames wakeful too heard their thin faint tinkle as it might be shaken from stars or the dewdrops falling from a flower if one could hear such sounds  caprice he thought i cant tell shes wilful what shall i do fleur  and long into the small night he brooded     part ii   i  mother and son   to say that jon forsyte accompanied his mother to spain unwillingly would scarcely have been adequate he went as a wellnatured dog goes for a walk with its mistress leaving a choice muttonbone on the lawn he went looking back at it forsytes deprived of their muttonbones are wont to sulk but jon had little sulkiness in his composition he adored his mother and it was his first travel spain had become italy by his simply saying id rather go to spain mum youve been to italy so many times id like it new to both of us  the fellow was subtle besides being naif he never forgot that he was going to shorten the proposed two months into six weeks and must therefore show no sign of wishing to do so for one with so enticing a muttonbone and so fixed an idea he made a good enough travelling companion indifferent to where or when he arrived superior to food and thoroughly appreciative of a country strange to the most travelled englishman fleurs wisdom in refusing to write to him was profound for he reached each new place entirely without hope or fever and could concentrate immediate attention on the donkeys and tumbling bells the priests patios beggars children crowing cocks sombreros cactus hedges old high white villages goats olivetrees greening plains singing birds in tiny cages watersellers sunsets melons mules great churches pictures and swimming greybrown mountains of a fascinating land  it was already hot and they enjoyed an absence of their compatriots jon who so far as he knew had blood in him which was not english was often innately unhappy in the presence of his own countrymen he felt they had no nonsense about them and took a more practical view of things than himself he confided to his mother that he must be an unsociable beastit was jolly to be away from everybody who could talk about the things people did talk about to which irene had replied simply yes jon i know  in this isolation he had unparalleled opportunities of appreciating what few sons can apprehend the wholeheartedness of a mothers love knowledge of something kept from her made him no doubt unduly sensitive and a southern people stimulated his admiration for her type of beauty which he had been accustomed to hear called spanish but which he now perceived to be no such thing her beauty was neither english french spanish nor italianit was special he appreciated too as never before his mothers subtlety of instinct he could not tell for instance whether she had noticed his absorption in that goya picture la vendimia or whether she knew that he had slipped back there after lunch and again next morning to stand before it full half an hour a second and third time it was not fleur of course but like enough to give him heartacheso dear to loversremembering her standing at the foot of his bed with her hand held above her head to keep a postcard reproduction of this picture in his pocket and slip it out to look at became for jon one of those bad habits which soon or late disclose themselves to eyes sharpened by love fear or jealousy and his mothers were sharpened by all three in granada he was fairly caught sitting on a sunwarmed stone bench in a little battlemented garden on the alhambra hill whence he ought to have been looking at the view his mother he had thought was examining the potted stocks between the polled acacias when her voice said  is that your favourite goya jon  he checked too late a movement such as he might have made at school to conceal some surreptitious document and answered yes  it certainly is most charming but i think i prefer the quitasol your father would go crazy about goya i dont believe he saw them when he was in spain in 92  in 92nine years before he had been born what had been the previous existences of his father and his mother if they had a right to share in his future surely he had a right to share in their pasts he looked up at her but something in her facea look of life hardlived the mysterious impress of emotions experience and sufferingseemed with its incalculable depth its purchased sanctity to make curiosity impertinent his mother must have had a wonderfully interesting life she was so beautiful and sosobut he could not frame what he felt about her he got up and stood gazing down at the town at the plain all green with crops and the ring of mountains glamorous in sinking sunlight her life was like the past of this old moorish city full deep remotehis own life as yet such a baby of a thing hopelessly ignorant and innocent they said that in those mountains to the west which rose sheer from the bluegreen plain as if out of a sea phoenicians had dwelta dark strange secret race above the land his mothers life was as unknown to him as secret as that phoenician past was to the town down there whose cocks crowed and whose children played and clamoured so gaily day in day out he felt aggrieved that she should know all about him and he nothing about her except that she loved him and his father and was beautiful his callow ignorancehe had not even had the advantage of the war like nearly everybody elsemade him small in his own eyes  that night from the balcony of his bedroom he gazed down on the roof of the townas if inlaid with honeycomb of jet ivory and gold and long after he lay awake listening to the cry of the sentry as the hours struck and forming in his head these lines      voice in the night crying down in the old sleeping     spanish city darkened under her white stars     what says the voiceits clearlingering anguish      just the watchman telling his dateless tale of safety     just a roadman flinging to the moon his song     no tis one deprived whose lovers heart is weeping     just his cry how long  the word deprived seemed to him cold and unsatisfactory but bereaved was too final and no other word of two syllables shortlong came to him which would enable him to keep whose lovers heart is weeping it was past two by the time he had finished it and past three before he went to sleep having said it over to himself at least twentyfour times next day he wrote it out and enclosed it in one of those letters to fleur which he always finished before he went down so as to have his mind free and companionable  about noon that same day on the tiled terrace of their hotel he felt a sudden dull pain in the back of his head a queer sensation in the eyes and sickness the sun had touched him too affectionately the next three days were passed in semidarkness and a dulled aching indifference to all except the feel of ice on his forehead and his mothers smile she never moved from his room never relaxed her noiseless vigilance which seemed to jon angelic but there were moments when he was extremely sorry for himself and wished terribly that fleur could see him several times he took a poignant imaginary leave of her and of the earth tears oozing out of his eyes he even prepared the message he would send to her by his motherwho would regret to her dying day that she had ever sought to separate themhis poor mother he was not slow however in perceiving that he had now his excuse for going home  towards half past six each evening came a gasgacha of bellsa cascade of tumbling chimes mounting from the city below and falling back chime on chime after listening to them on the fourth day he said suddenly  id like to be back in england mum the suns too hot  very well darling as soon as youre fit to travel and at once he felt better andmeaner  they had been out five weeks when they turned towards home jons head was restored to its pristine clarity but he was confined to a hat lined by his mother with many layers of orange and green silk and he still walked from choice in the shade as the long struggle of discretion between them drew to its close he wondered more and more whether she could see his eagerness to get back to that which she had brought him away from condemned by spanish providence to spend a day in madrid between their trains it was but natural to go again to the prado jon was elaborately casual this time before his goya girl now that he was going back to her he could afford a lesser scrutiny it was his mother who lingered before the picture saying  the face and figure of the girl are exquisite  jon heard her uneasily did she understand but he felt once more that he was no match for her in selfcontrol and subtlety she could in some supersensitive way of which he had not the secret feel the pulse of his thoughts she knew by instinct what he hoped and feared and wished it made him terribly uncomfortable and guilty having beyond most boys a conscience he wished she would be frank with him he almost hoped for an open struggle but none came and steadily silently they travelled north thus did he first learn how much better than men women play a waiting game in paris they had again to pause for a day jon was grieved because it lasted two owing to certain matters in connection with a dressmaker as if his mother who looked beautiful in anything had any need of dresses the happiest moment of his travel was that when he stepped on to the folkestone boat  standing by the bulwark rail with her arm in his she said  im afraid you havent enjoyed it much jon but youve been very sweet to me  jon squeezed her arm  oh yes ive enjoyed it awfullyexcept for my head lately  and now that the end had come he really had feeling a sort of glamour over the past weeksa kind of painful pleasure such as he had tried to screw into those lines about the voice in the night crying a feeling such as he had known as a small boy listening avidly to chopin yet wanting to cry and he wondered why it was that he couldnt say to her quite simply what she had said to him  you were very sweet to me oddone never could be nice and natural like that he substituted the words i expect we shall be sick  they were and reached london somewhat attenuated having been away six weeks and two days without a single allusion to the subject which had hardly ever ceased to occupy their minds     ii  fathers and daughters   deprived of his wife and son by the spanish adventure jolyon found the solitude at robin hill intolerable a philosopher when he has all that he wants is different from a philosopher when he has not accustomed however to the idea if not to the reality of resignation he would perhaps have faced it out but for his daughter june he was a lame duck now and on her conscience having achievedmomentarilythe rescue of an etcher in low circumstances which she happened to have in hand she appeared at robin hill a fortnight after irene and jon had gone the little lady was living now in a tiny house with a big studio at chiswick a forsyte of the best period so far as the lack of responsibility was concerned she had overcome the difficulty of a reduced income in a manner satisfactory to herself and her father the rent of the gallery off cork street which he had bought for her and her increased income tax happening to balance it had been quite simpleshe no longer paid him the rent the gallery might be expected now at any time after eighteen years of barren usufruct to pay its way so that she was sure her father would not feel it through this device she still had twelve hundred a year and by reducing what she ate and in place of two belgians in a poor way employing one austrian in a poorer practically the same surplus for the relief of genius after three days at robin hill she carried her father back with her to town in those three days she had stumbled on the secret he had kept for two years and had instantly decided to cure him she knew in fact the very man he had done wonders with paul postthat painter a little in advance of futurism and she was impatient with her father because his eyebrows would go up and because he had heard of neither of course if he hadnt faith he would never get well it was absurd not to have faith in the man who had healed paul post so that he had only just relapsed from having overworked or overlived himself again the great thing about this healer was that he relied on nature he had made a special study of the symptoms of naturewhen his patient failed in any natural symptom he supplied the poison which caused itand there you were she was extremely hopeful her father had clearly not been living a natural life at robin hill and she intended to provide the symptoms he wasshe feltout of touch with the times which was not natural his heart wanted stimulating in the little chiswick house she and the austriana grateful soul so devoted to june for rescuing her that she was in danger of decease from overworkstimulated jolyon in all sorts of ways preparing him for his cure but they could not keep his eyebrows down asfor examplewhen the austrian woke him at eight oclock just as he was going to sleep or june took the times away from him because it was unnatural to read that stuff when he ought to be taking an interest in life he never failed indeed to be astonished at her resource especially in the evenings for his benefit as she declared though he suspected that she also got something out of it she assembled the age so far as it was satellite to genius and with some solemnity it would move up and down the studio before him in the foxtrot and that more mental form of dancingthe onestepwhich so pulled against the music that jolyons eyebrows would be almost lost in his hair from wonder at the strain it must impose on the dancers willpower aware that hung on the line in the water colour society he was a back number to those with any pretension to be called artists he would sit in the darkest corner he could find and wonder about rhythm on which so long ago he had been raised and when june brought some girl or young man up to him he would rise humbly to their level so far as that was possible and think dear me this is very dull for them having his fathers perennial sympathy with youth he used to get very tired from entering into their points of view but it was all stimulating and he never failed in admiration of his daughters indomitable spirit even genius itself attended these gatherings now and then with its nose on one side and june always introduced it to her father this she felt was exceptionally good for him for genius was a natural symptom he had never hadfond as she was of him  certain as a man can be that she was his own daughter he often wondered whence she got herselfher redgold hair now greyed into a special colour her direct spirited face so different from his own rather folded and subtilised countenance her little light figure when he and most of the forsytes were tall and he would dwell on the origin of species and debate whether she might be danish or celtic celtic he thought from her pugnacity and her taste in fillets and djibbahs it was not too much to say that he preferred her to the age with which she was surrounded youthful though for the greater part it was she took however too much interest in his teeth for he still had some of those natural symptoms her dentist at once found staphylococcus aureus present in pure culture which might cause boils of course and wanted to take out all the teeth he had and supply him with two complete sets of unnatural symptoms jolyons native tenacity was roused and in the studio that evening he developed his objections he had never had any boils and his own teeth would last his time of coursejune admittedthey would last his time if he didnt have them out but if he had more teeth he would have a better heart and his time would be longer his recalcitranceshe saidwas a symptom of his whole attitude he was taking it lying down he ought to be fighting when was he going to see the man who had cured paul post jolyon was very sorry but the fact was he was not going to see him june chafed pondridgeshe saidthe healer was such a fine man and he had such difficulty in making two ends meet and getting his theories recognised it was just such indifference and prejudice as her father manifested which was keeping him back it would be so splendid for both of them  i perceive said jolyon that you are trying to kill two birds with one stone  to cure you mean cried june  my dear its the same thing  june protested it was unfair to say that without a trial  jolyon thought he might not have the chance of saying it after  dad cried june youre hopeless  that said jolyon is a fact but i wish to remain hopeless as long as possible i shall let sleeping dogs lie my child they are quiet at present  thats not giving science a chance cried june youve no idea how devoted pondridge is he puts his science before everything  just replied jolyon puffing the mild cigarette to which he was reduced as mr paul post puts his art eh art for arts sakescience for the sake of science i know those enthusiastic egomaniac gentry they vivisect you without blinking im enough of a forsyte to give them the goby june  dad said june if you only knew how oldfashioned that sounds nobody can afford to be halfhearted nowadays  im afraid murmured jolyon with his smile thats the only natural symptom with which mr pondridge need not supply me we are born to be extreme or to be moderate my dear though if youll forgive my saying so half the people nowadays who believe theyre extreme are really very moderate im getting on as well as i can expect and i must leave it at that  june was silent having experienced in her time the inexorable character of her fathers amiable obstinacy so far as his own freedom of action was concerned  how he came to let her know why irene had taken jon to spain puzzled jolyon for he had little confidence in her discretion after she had brooded on the news it brought a rather sharp discussion during which he perceived to the full the fundamental opposition between her active temperament and his wifes passivity he even gathered that a little soreness still remained from that generationold struggle between them over the body of philip bosinney in which the passive had so signally triumphed over the active principle  according to june it was foolish and even cowardly to hide the past from jon sheer opportunism she called it  which jolyon put in mildly is the working principle of real life my dear  oh cried june you dont really defend her for not telling jon dad if it were left to you you would  i might but simply because i know he must find out which will be worse than if we told him  then why dont you tell him its just sleeping dogs again  my dear said jolyon i wouldnt for the world go against irenes instinct hes her boy  yours too cried june  what is a mans instinct compared with a mothers  well i think its very weak of you  i dare say said jolyon i dare say  and that was all she got from him but the matter rankled in her brain she could not bear sleeping dogs and there stirred in her a tortuous impulse to push the matter towards decision jon ought to be told so that either his feeling might be nipped in the bud or flowering in spite of the past come to fruition and she determined to see fleur and judge for herself when june determined on anything delicacy became a somewhat minor consideration after all she was soames cousin and they were both interested in pictures she would go and tell him that he ought to buy a paul post or perhaps a piece of sculpture by boris strumolowski and of course she would say nothing to her father she went on the following sunday looking so determined that she had some difficulty in getting a cab at reading station the river country was lovely in those days of her own month and june ached at its loveliness she who had passed through this life without knowing what union was had a love of natural beauty which was almost madness and when she came to that choice spot where soames had pitched his tent she dismissed her cab because business over she wanted to revel in the bright water and the woods she appeared at his front door therefore as a mere pedestrian and sent in her card it was in junes character to know that when her nerves were fluttering she was doing something worth while if ones nerves did not flutter she was taking the line of least resistance and knew that nobleness was not obliging her she was conducted to a drawingroom which though not in her style showed every mark of fastidious elegance thinking too much tastetoo many knickknacks she saw in an old lacquerframed mirror the figure of a girl coming in from the verandah clothed in white and holding some white roses in her hand she had reflected in that silverygrey pool of glass a visionlike appearance as if a pretty ghost had come out of the green garden  how do you do said june turning round im a cousin of your fathers  oh yes i saw you in that confectioners  with my young stepbrother is your father in  he will be directly hes only gone for a little walk  june slightly narrowed her blue eyes and lifted her decided chin  your names fleur isnt it ive heard of you from holly what do you think of jon  the girl lifted the roses in her hand looked at them and answered calmly  hes quite a nice boy  not a bit like holly or me is he  not a bit  shes cool thought june  and suddenly the girl said i wish youd tell me why our families dont get on  confronted with the question she had advised her father to answer june was silent either because this girl was trying to get something out of her or simply because what one would do theoretically is not always what one will do when it comes to the point  you know said the girl the surest way to make people find out the worst is to keep them ignorant my fathers told me it was a quarrel about property but i dont believe it weve both got heaps they wouldnt have been so bourgeois as all that  june flushed the word applied to her grandfather and father offended her  my grandfather she said was very generous and my father is too neither of them was in the least bourgeois  well what was it then repeated the girl conscious that this young forsyte meant having what she wanted june at once determined to prevent her and to get something for herself instead  why do you want to know  the girl smelled at her roses i only want to know because they wont tell me  well it was about property but theres more than one kind  that makes it worse now i really must know  junes small and resolute face quivered she was wearing a round cap and her hair had fluffed out under it she looked quite young at that moment rejuvenated by encounter  you know she said i saw you drop your handkerchief is there anything between you and jon because if so youd better drop that too  the girl grew paler but she smiled  if there were that isnt the way to make me  at the gallantry of that reply june held out her hand  i like you but i dont like your father i never have we may as well be frank  did you come down to tell him that  june laughed no i came down to see you  how delightful of you  this girl could fence  im twoandahalf times your age said june but i quite sympathise its horrid not to have ones own way  the girl smiled again i really think you might tell me  how the child stuck to her point  its not my secret but ill see what i can do because i think both you and jon ought to be told and now ill say goodbye  wont you wait and see father  june shook her head how can i get over to the other side  ill row you across  look said june impulsively next time youre in london come and see me this is where i live i generally have young people in the evening but i shouldnt tell your father that youre coming  the girl nodded  watching her scull the skiff across june thought shes awfully pretty and well made i never thought soames would have a daughter as pretty as this she and jon would make a lovely couple  the instinct to couple starved within herself was always at work in june she stood watching fleur row back the girl took her hand off a scull to wave farewell and june walked languidly on between the meadows and the river with an ache in her heart youth to youth like the dragonflies chasing each other and love like the sun warming them through and through her youth so long agowhen phil and she and since nothingno one had been quite what she had wanted and so she had missed it all but what a coil was round those two young things if they really were in love as holly would have itas her father and irene and soames himself seemed to dread what a coil and what a barrier and the itch for the future the contempt as it were for what was overpast which forms the active principle moved in the heart of one who ever believed that what one wanted was more important than what other people did not want from the bank awhile in the warm summer stillness she watched the waterlily plants and willow leaves the fishes rising sniffed the scent of grass and meadowsweet wondering how she could force everybody to be happy jon and fleur two little lame duckscharming callow yellow little ducks a great pity surely something could be done one must not take such situations lying down she walked on and reached a station hot and cross  that evening faithful to the impulse towards direct action which made many people avoid her she said to her father  dad ive been down to see young fleur i think shes very attractive its no good hiding our heads under our wings is it  the startled jolyon set down his barley water and began crumbling his bread  its what you appear to be doing he said do you realise whose daughter she is  cant the dead past bury its dead  jolyon rose  certain things can never be buried  i disagree said june its that which stands in the way of all happiness and progress you dont understand the age dad its got no use for outgrown things why do you think it matters so terribly that jon should know about his mother who pays any attention to that sort of thing now the marriage laws are just as they were when soames and irene couldnt get a divorce and you had to come in weve moved and they havent so nobody cares marriage without a decent chance of relief is only a sort of slaveowning people oughtnt to own each other everybody sees that now if irene broke such laws what does it matter  its not for me to disagree there said jolyon but thats all quite beside the mark this is a matter of human feeling  of course it is cried june the human feeling of those two young things  my dear said jolyon with gentle exasperation youre talking nonsense  im not if they prove to be really fond of each other why should they be made unhappy because of the past  you havent lived that past i havethrough the feelings of my wife through my own nerves and my imagination as only one who is devoted can  june too rose and began to wander restlessly  if she said suddenly she were the daughter of phil bosinney i could understand you better irene loved him she never loved soames  jolyon uttered a deep soundthe sort of noise an italian peasant woman utters to her mule his heart had begun beating furiously but he paid no attention to it quite carried away by his feelings  that shows how little you understand neither i nor jon if i know him would mind a lovepast its the brutality of a union without love this girl is the daughter of the man who once owned jons mother as a negroslave was owned you cant lay that ghost dont try to june its asking us to see jon joined to the flesh and blood of the man who possessed jons mother against her will its no good mincing words i want it clear once for all and now i mustnt talk any more or i shall have to sit up with this all night and putting his hand over his heart jolyon turned his back on his daughter and stood looking at the river thames  june who by nature never saw a hornets nest until she had put her head into it was seriously alarmed she came and slipped her arm through his not convinced that he was right and she herself wrong because that was not natural to her she was yet profoundly impressed by the obvious fact that the subject was very bad for him she rubbed her cheek against his shoulder and said nothing  after taking her elderly cousin across fleur did not land at once but pulled in among the reeds into the sunshine the peaceful beauty of the afternoon seduced for a little one not much given to the vague and poetic in the field beyond the bank where her skiff lay up a machine drawn by a grey horse was turning an early field of hay she watched the grass cascading over and behind the light wheels with fascinationit looked so green and fresh the click and swish blended with the rustle of the willows and the poplars and the cooing of a woodpigeon in a true river song alongside in the greygreen water weeds like yellow snakes were writhing and nosing with the current pied cattle on the farther side stood in the shade lazily swishing their tails it was an afternoon to dream and she took out jons lettersnot flowery effusions but haunted in their recital of things seen and done by a longing very agreeable to her and all ending your devoted j fleur was not sentimental her desires were ever concrete and concentrated but what poetry there was in the daughter of soames and annette had certainly in those weeks of waiting gathered round her memories of jon they all belonged to grass and blossom flowers and running water she enjoyed him in the scents absorbed by her crinkling nose the stars could persuade her that she was standing beside him in the centre of the map of spain and of an early morning the dewy cobwebs the hazy sparkle and promise of the day down in the garden were jon personified to her  two white swans came majestically by while she was reading his letters followed by their brood of six young swans in a line with just so much space between each tail and head a flotilla of grey destroyers fleur thrust her letters back got out her sculls and pulled up to the landingstage crossing the lawn she wondered whether she should tell her father of junes visit if he learned of it from the butler he might think it odd if she did not it gave her too another chance to startle out of him the reason of the feud she went therefore up the road to meet him  soames had gone to look at a patch of ground on which the local authorities were proposing to erect a sanatorium for people with weak lungs faithful to his native individualism he took no part in local affairs content to pay the rates which were always going up he could not however remain indifferent to this new and dangerous scheme the site was not half a mile from his own house he was quite of opinion that the country should stamp out tuberculosis but this was not the place it should be done farther away he took indeed an attitude common to all true forsytes that disability of any sort in other people was not his affair and the state should do its business without prejudicing in any way the natural advantages which he had acquired or inherited francie the most freespirited forsyte of his generation except perhaps that fellow jolyon had once asked him in her malicious way did you ever see the name forsyte in a subscription list soames that was as it might be but a sanatorium would depreciate the neighbourhood and he should certainly sign the petition which was being got up against it returning with this decision fresh within him he saw fleur coming  she was showing him more affection of late and the quiet time down here with her in this summer weather had been making him feel quite young annette was always running up to town for one thing or another so that he had fleur to himself almost as much as he could wish to be sure young mont had formed a habit of appearing on his motorcycle almost every other day thank goodness the young fellow had shaved off his halftoothbrushes and no longer looked like a mountebank with a girl friend of fleurs who was staying in the house and a neighbouring youth or so they made two couples after dinner in the hall to the music of the electric pianola which performed foxtrots unassisted with a surprised shine on its expressive surface annette even now and then passed gracefully up and down in the arms of one or other of the young men and soames coming to the drawingroom door would lift his nose a little sideways and watch them waiting to catch a smile from fleur then move back to his chair by the drawingroom hearth to peruse the times or some other collectors pricelist to his everanxious eyes fleur showed no sign of remembering that caprice of hers  when she reached him on the dusty road he slipped his hand within her arm  who do you think has been to see you dad she couldnt wait guess  i never guess said soames uneasily who  your cousin june forsyte  quite unconsciously soames gripped her arm what did she want  i dont know but it was rather breaking through the feud wasnt it  feud what feud  the one that exists in your imagination dear  soames dropped her arm was she mocking or trying to draw him on  i suppose she wanted me to buy a picture he said at last  i dont think so perhaps it was just family affection  shes only a first cousin once removed muttered soames  and the daughter of your enemy  what dyou mean by that  i beg your pardon dear i thought he was  enemy repeated soames its ancient history i dont know where you get your notions  from june forsyte  it had come to her as an inspiration that if he thought she knew or were on the edge of knowledge he would tell her  soames was startled but she had underrated his caution and tenacity  if you know he said coldly why do you plague me  fleur saw that she had overreached herself  i dont want to plague you darling as you say why want to know more why want to know anything of that small mysteryje men fiche as profond says  that chap said soames profoundly  that chap indeed played a considerable if invisible part this summerfor he had not turned up again ever since the sunday when fleur had drawn attention to him prowling on the lawn soames had thought of him a good deal and always in connection with annette for no reason except that she was looking handsomer than for some time past his possessive instinct subtler less formal more elastic since the war kept all misgiving underground as one looks on some american river quiet and pleasant knowing that an alligator perhaps is lying in the mud with his snout just raised and indistinguishable from a snag of woodso soames looked on the river of his own existence subconscious of monsieur profond refusing to see more than the suspicion of his snout he had at this epoch in his life practically all he wanted and was as nearly happy as his nature would permit his senses were at rest his affections found all the vent they needed in his daughter his collection was well known his money well invested his health excellent save for a touch of liver now and again he had not yet begun to worry seriously about what would happen after death inclining to think that nothing would happen he resembled one of his own giltedged securities and to knock the gilt off by seeing anything he could avoid seeing would be he felt instinctively perverse and retrogressive those two crumpled roseleaves fleurs caprice and monsieur profonds snout would level away if he lay on them industriously  that evening chance which visits the lives of even the bestinvested forsytes put a clue into fleurs hands her father came down to dinner without a handkerchief and had occasion to blow his nose  ill get you one dear she had said and run upstairs in the sachet where she sought for itan old sachet of very faded silkthere were two compartments one held handkerchiefs the other was buttoned and contained something flat and hard by some childish impulse fleur unbuttoned it there was a frame and in it a photograph of herself as a little girl she gazed at it fascinated as one is by ones own presentment it slipped under her fidgeting thumb and she saw that another photograph was behind she pressed her own down further and perceived a face which she seemed to know of a young woman very goodlooking in a very old style of evening dress slipping her own photograph up over it again she took out a handkerchief and went down only on the stairs did she identify that face surelysurely jons mother the conviction came as a shock and she stood still in a flurry of thought why of course jons father had married the woman her father had wanted to marry had cheated him out of her perhaps then afraid of showing by her manner that she had lighted on his secret she refused to think further and shaking out the silk handkerchief entered the diningroom  i chose the softest father  hm said soames i only use those after a cold never mind  that evening passed for fleur in putting two and two together recalling the look on her fathers face in the confectioners shopa look strange and coldly intimate a queer look he must have loved that woman very much to have kept her photograph all this time in spite of having lost her unsparing and matteroffact her mind darted to his relations with her own mother had he ever really loved her she thought not jon was the son of the woman he had really loved surely then he ought not to mind his daughter loving him it only wanted getting used to and a sigh of sheer relief was caught in the folds of her nightgown slipping over her head     iii  meetings   youth only recognises age by fits and starts jon for one had never really seen his fathers age till he came back from spain the face of the fourth jolyon worn by waiting gave him quite a shockit looked so wan and old his fathers mask had been forced awry by the emotion of the meeting so that the boy suddenly realised how much he must have felt their absence he summoned to his aid the thought well i didnt want to go it was out of date for youth to defer to age but jon was by no means typically modern his father had always been so jolly to him and to feel that one meant to begin again at once the conduct which his father had suffered six weeks loneliness to cure was not agreeable  at the question well old man how did the great goya strike you his conscience pricked him badly the great goya only existed because he had created a face which resembled fleurs  on the night of their return he went to bed full of compunction but awoke full of anticipation it was only the fifth of july and no meeting was fixed with fleur until the ninth he was to have three days at home before going back to farm somehow he must contrive to see her  in the lives of men an inexorable rhythm caused by the need for trousers not even the fondest parents can deny on the second day therefore jon went to town and having satisfied his conscience by ordering what was indispensable in conduit street turned his face towards piccadilly stratton street where her club was adjoined devonshire house it would be the merest chance that she should be at her club but he dawdled down bond street with a beating heart noticing the superiority of all other young men to himself they wore their clothes with such an air they had assurance they were old he was suddenly overwhelmed by the conviction that fleur must have forgotten him absorbed in his own feeling for her all these weeks he had mislaid that possibility the corners of his mouth drooped his hands felt clammy fleur with the pick of youth at the beck of her smilefleur incomparable it was an evil moment jon however had a great idea that one must be able to face anything and he braced himself with that dour reflection in front of a bricabrac shop at this highwater mark of what was once the london season there was nothing to mark it out from any other except a grey top hat or two and the sun jon moved on and turning the corner into piccadilly ran into val dartie moving towards the iseeum club to which he had just been elected  hallo young man where are you off to  jon flushed ive just been to my tailors  val looked him up and down thats good im going in here to order some cigarettes then come and have some lunch  jon thanked him he might get news of her from val the condition of england that nightmare of its press and public men was seen in different perspective within the tobacconists which they now entered  yes sir precisely the cigarette i used to supply your father with bless me mr montague dartie was a customer here fromlet me seethe year melton won the derby one of my very best customers he was and a faint smile illumined the tobacconists face manys the tip hes given me to be sure i suppose he took a couple of hundred of these every week year in year out and never changed his cigarette very affable gentleman brought me a lot of custom i was sorry he met with that accident one misses an old customer like him  val smiled his fathers decease had closed an account which had been running longer probably than any other and in a ring of smoke puffed out from that timehonoured cigarette he seemed to see again his fathers face dark goodlooking moustachioed a little puffy in the only halo it had earned his father had his fame here anywaya man who smoked two hundred cigarettes a week who could give tips and run accounts for ever to his tobacconist a hero even that was some distinction to inherit  i pay cash he said how much  to his son sir and cashten and six i shall never forget mr montague dartie ive known him stand talkin to me half an hour we dont get many like him now with everybody in such a hurry the war was bad for manners sirit was bad for manners you were in it i see  no said val tapping his knee i got this in the war before saved my life i expect do you want any cigarettes jon  rather ashamed jon murmured i dont smoke you know and saw the tobacconists lips twisted as if uncertain whether to say good god or nows your chance sir  thats right said val keep off it while you can youll want it when you take a knock this is really the same tobacco then  identical sir a little dearer thats all wonderful staying powerthe british empire i always say  send me down a hundred a week to this address and invoice it monthly come on jon  jon entered the iseeum with curiosity except to lunch now and then at the hotchpotch with his father he had never been in a london club the iseeum comfortable and unpretentious did not move could not so long as george forsyte sat on its committee where his culinary acumen was almost the controlling force the club had made a stand against the newly rich and it had taken all george forsytes prestige and praise of him as a good sportsman to bring in prosper profond  the two were lunching together when the halfbrothersinlaw entered the diningroom and attracted by georges forefinger sat down at their table val with his shrewd eyes and charming smile jon with solemn lips and an attractive shyness in his glance there was an air of privilege around that corner table as though past masters were eating there jon was fascinated by the hypnotic atmosphere the waiter lean in the chaps pervaded with such freemasonical deference he seemed to hang on george forsytes lips to watch the gloat in his eye with a kind of sympathy to follow the movements of the heavy clubmarked silver fondly his liveried arm and confidential voice alarmed jon they came so secretly over ones shoulder  except for georges your grandfather tipped me once he was a deuced good judge of a cigar neither he nor the other past master took any notice of him and he was grateful for this the talk was all about the breeding points and prices of horses and he listened to it vaguely at first wondering how it was possible to retain so much knowledge in a head he could not take his eyes off the dark past masterwhat he said was so deliberate and discouragingsuch heavy queer smiledout words jon was thinking of butterflies when he heard him say  i want to see mr soames forsyde take an interest in orses  old soames hes too dry a file  with all his might jon tried not to grow red while the dark past master went on  his daughters an attractive small girl mr soames forsyde is a bit oldfashioned i want to see him have a pleasure some day  george forsyte grinned dont you worry hes not so miserable as he looks hell never show hes enjoying anythingthey might try and take it from him old soames once bit twice shy  well jon said val hastily if youve finished well go and have coffee  who were those jon asked on the stairs i didnt quite  old george forsyte is a first cousin of your fathers and of my uncle soames hes always been here the other chap profond is a queer fish i think hes hanging round soames wife if you ask me  jon looked at him startled but thats awful he said i meanfor fleur  dont suppose fleur cares very much shes very uptodate  her mother  youre very green jon  jon grew red mothers he stammered angrily are different  youre right said val suddenly but things arent what they were when i was your age theres a tomorrow we die feeling thats what old george meant about my uncle soames he doesnt mean to die tomorrow  jon said quickly whats the matter between him and my father  stable secret jon take my advice and bottle up youll do no good by knowing have a liqueur  jon shook his head  i hate the way people keep things from one he muttered and then sneer at one for being green  well you can ask holly if she wont tell you youll believe its for your own good i suppose  jon got up i must go now thanks awfully for the lunch  val smiled up at him halfsorry and yet amused the boy looked so upset  all right see you on friday  i dont know murmured jon  and he did not this conspiracy of silence made him desperate it was humiliating to be treated like a child he retraced his moody steps to stratton street but he would go to her club now and find out the worst to his inquiry the reply was that miss forsyte was not in the club she might be in perhaps later she was often in on mondaythey could not say jon said he would call again and crossing into the green park flung himself down under a tree the sun was bright and a breeze fluttered the leaves of the young limetree beneath which he lay but his heart ached such darkness seemed gathered round his happiness he heard big ben chime three above the traffic the sound moved something in him and taking out a piece of paper he began to scribble on it with a pencil he had jotted a stanza and was searching the grass for another verse when something hard touched his shouldera green parasol there above him stood fleur  they told me youd been and were coming back so i thought you might be out here and you areits rather wonderful  oh fleur i thought youd have forgotten me  when i told you that i shouldnt  jon seized her arm  its too much luck lets get away from this side  he almost dragged her on through that too thoughtfully regulated park to find some cover where they could sit and hold each others hands  hasnt anybody cut in he said gazing round at her lashes in suspense above her cheeks  there is a young idiot but he doesnt count  jon felt a twitch of compassion for theyoung idiot  you know ive had sunstroke i didnt tell you  really was it interesting  no mother was an angel has anything happened to you  nothing except that i think ive found out whats wrong between our families jon  his heart began beating very fast  i believe my father wanted to marry your mother and your father got her instead  oh  i came on a photo of her it was in a frame behind a photo of me of course if he was very fond of her that would have made him pretty mad wouldnt it  jon thought for a minute not if she loved my father best  but suppose they were engaged  if we were engaged and you found you loved somebody better i might go cracked but i shouldnt grudge it you  i should you mustnt ever do that with me jon  my god not much  i dont believe that hes ever really cared for my mother  jon was silent vals words the two past masters in the club  you see we dont know went on fleur it may have been a great shock she may have behaved badly to him people do  my mother wouldnt  fleur shrugged her shoulders i dont think we know much about our fathers and mothers we just see them in the light of the way they treat us but theyve treated other people you know before we were bornplenty i expect you see theyre both old look at your father with three separate families  isnt there any place cried jon in all this beastly london where we can be alone  only a taxi  lets get one then  when they were installed fleur asked suddenly are you going back to robin hill i should like to see where you live jon im staying with my aunt for the night but i could get back in time for dinner i wouldnt come to the house of course  jon gazed at her enraptured  splendid i can show it you from the copse we shant meet anybody theres a train at four  the god of property and his forsytes great and small leisured official commercial or professional unlike the working classes still worked their seven hours a day so that those two of the fourth generation travelled down to robin hill in an empty firstclass carriage dusty and sunwarmed of that too early train they travelled in blissful silence holding each others hands  at the station they saw no one except porters and a villager or two unknown to jon and walked out up the lane which smelled of dust and honeysuckle  for jonsure of her now and without separation before himit was a miraculous dawdle more wonderful than those on the downs or along the river thames it was loveinamistone of those illumined pages of life where every word and smile and every light touch they gave each other were as little gold and red and blue butterflies and flowers and birds scrolled in among the texta happy communing without afterthought which lasted twentyseven minutes they reached the coppice at the milkinghour jon would not take her as far as the farmyard only to where she could see the field leading up to the gardens and the house beyond they turned in among the larches and suddenly at the winding of the path came on irene sitting on an old log seat  there are various kinds of shocks to the vertebrae to the nerves to moral sensibility and more potent and permanent to personal dignity this last was the shock jon received coming thus on his mother he became suddenly conscious that he was doing an indelicate thing to have brought fleur down openlyyes but to sneak her in like this consumed with shame he put on a front as brazen as his nature would permit  fleur was smiling a little defiantly his mothers startled face was changing quickly to the impersonal and gracious it was she who uttered the first words  im very glad to see you it was nice of jon to think of bringing you down to us  we werent coming to the house jon blurted out i just wanted fleur to see where i lived  his mother said quietly wont you come up and have tea  feeling that he had but aggravated his breach of breeding he heard fleur answer thanks very much i have to get back to dinner i met jon by accident and we thought it would be rather jolly just to see his home  how selfpossessed she was  of course but you must have tea well send you down to the station my husband will enjoy seeing you  the expression of his mothers eyes resting on him for a moment cast jon down level with the grounda true worm then she led on and fleur followed her he felt like a child trailing after those two who were talking so easily about spain and wansdon and the house up there beyond the trees and the grassy slope he watched the fencing of their eyes taking each other inthe two beings he loved most in the world  he could see his father sitting under the oaktree and suffered in advance all the loss of caste he must go through in the eyes of that tranquil figure with his knees crossed thin old and elegant already he could feel the faint irony which would come into his voice and smile  this is fleur forsyte jolyon jon brought her down to see the house lets have tea at onceshe has to catch a train jon tell them dear and telephone to the dragon for a car  to leave her alone with them was strange and yet as no doubt his mother had foreseen the least of evils at the moment so he ran up into the house now he would not see fleur alone againnot for a minute and they had arranged no further meeting when he returned under cover of the maids and teapots there was not a trace of awkwardness beneath the tree it was all within himself but not the less for that they were talking of the gallery off cork street  we backnumbers his father was saying are awfully anxious to find out why we cant appreciate the new stuff you and jon must tell us  its supposed to be satiric isnt it said fleur  he saw his fathers smile  satiric oh i think its more than that what do you say jon  i dont know at all stammered jon his fathers face had a sudden grimness  the young are tired of us our gods and our ideals off with their heads they saysmash their idols and lets get back tonothing and by jove theyve done it jons a poet hell be going in too and stamping on whats left of us property beauty sentimentall smoke we mustnt own anything nowadays not even our feelings they stand in the way ofnothing  jon listened bewildered almost outraged by his fathers words behind which he felt a meaning that he could not reach he didnt want to stamp on anything  nothings the god of today continued jolyon were back where the russians were sixty years ago when they started nihilism  no dad cried jon suddenly we only want to live and we dont know how because of the pastthats all  by george said jolyon thats profound jon is it your own the past old ownerships old passions and their aftermath lets have cigarettes  conscious that his mother had lifted her hand to her lips quickly as if to hush something jon handed the cigarettes he lighted his fathers and fleurs then one for himself had he taken the knock that val had spoken of the smoke was blue when he had not puffed grey when he had he liked the sensation in his nose and the sense of equality it gave him he was glad no one said so youve begun he felt less young  fleur looked at her watch and rose his mother went with her into the house jon stayed with his father puffing at the cigarette  see her into the car old man said jolyon and when shes gone ask your mother to come back to me  jon went he waited in the hall he saw her into the car there was no chance for any word hardly for a pressure of the hand he waited all that evening for something to be said to him nothing was said nothing might have happened he went up to bed and in the mirror on his dressingtable met himself he did not speak nor did the image but both looked as if they thought the more     iv  in green street   uncertain whether the impression that prosper profond was dangerous should be traced to his attempt to give val the mayfly filly to the remark of fleurs isnt he a great cat prowling to his preposterous inquiry of jack cardigan whats the use of keepin fit or more simply to the fact that he was a foreigner or alien as it was now called certain that annette was looking particularly handsome and that soames had sold him a gauguin and then torn up the cheque so that monsieur profond himself had said i didnt get that small picture i bought from mr forsyde  however suspiciously regarded he still frequented winifreds evergreen little house in green street with a goodnatured obtuseness which no one mistook for naivete a word hardly applicable to monsieur prosper profond winifred still found him amusing and would write him little notes saying come and have a jolly with usit was breath of life to her to keep up with the phrases of the day  the mystery with which all felt him to be surrounded was due to his having done seen heard and known everything and found nothing in itwhich was unnatural the english type of disillusionment was familiar enough to winifred who had always moved in fashionable circles it gave a certain cachet or distinction so that one got something out of it but to see nothing in anything not as a pose but because there was nothing in anything was not english and that which was not english one could not help secretly feeling dangerous if not precisely bad form it was like having the mood which the war had left seateddark heavy smiling indifferentin your empire chair it was like listening to that mood talking through thick pink lips above a little diabolic beard it was as jack cardigan expressed itfor the english character at largea bit too thickfor if nothing was really worth getting excited about there were always games and one could make it so even winifred ever a forsyte at heart felt that there was nothing to be had out of a mood of disillusionment it really ought not to be there monsieur profond in fact made the mood too plain in a country which decently veiled such realities  when fleur after her hurried return from robin hill came down to dinner that evening the mood was standing at the window of winifreds little drawingroom looking out into green street with an air of seeing nothing in it and fleur gazed promptly into the fireplace with an air of seeing a fire which was not there  monsieur profond came from the window he was in full fig with a white waistcoat and a white flower in his buttonhole  well miss forsyde he said im awful pleased to see you mr forsyde well i was sayin today i want to see him have some pleasure he worries  you think so said fleur shortly  worries repeated monsieur profond burring the rs  fleur spun round shall i tell you she said what would give him pleasure but the words to hear that you had cleared out died at the expression on his face all his fine white teeth were showing  i was hearin at the club today about his old trouble  what do you mean  monsieur profond moved his sleek head as if to minimise his statement  before you were born he said that small business  though conscious that he had cleverly diverted her from his own share in her fathers worry fleur could not withstand a rush of nervous curiosity what did you hear  why murmured monsieur profond you know all that  i expect i do but i should like to know that you havent heard it all wrong  his first wife murmured monsieur profond  choking back the words he was never married before she said well what about her  mr george forsyde was tellin me about your fathers first wife marryin his cousin jolyon afterwards it was a small bit unpleasant i should think i saw their boynice boy  fleur looked up monsieur profond was swimming heavily diabolical before her thatthe reason with the most heroic effort of her life so far she managed to arrest that swimming figure she could not tell whether he had noticed and just then winifred came in  oh here you both are already imogen and i have had the most amusing afternoon at the babies bazaar  what babies said fleur mechanically  the save the babies i got such a bargain my dear a piece of old armenian workfrom before the flood i want your opinion on it prosper  auntie whispered fleur suddenly  at the tone in the girls voice winifred closed in on her  whats the matter arent you well  monsieur profond had withdrawn into the window where he was practically out of hearing  auntie he told me that father has been married before is it true that he divorced her and she married jon forsytes father  never in all the life of the mother of four little darties had winifred felt more seriously embarrassed her nieces face was so pale her eyes so dark her voice so whispery and strained  your father didnt wish you to hear she said with all the aplomb she could muster these things will happen ive often told him he ought to let you know  oh said fleur and that was all but it made winifred pat her shouldera firm little shoulder nice and white she never could help an appraising eye and touch in the matter of her niece who would have to be married of coursethough not to that boy jon  weve forgotten all about it years and years ago she said comfortably come and have dinner  no auntie i dont feel very well may i go upstairs  my dear murmured winifred concerned youre not taking this to heart why you havent properly come out yet that boys a child  what boy ive only got a headache but i cant stand that man tonight  well well said winifred go and lie down ill send you some bromide and i shall talk to prosper profond what business had he to gossip though i must say i think its much better you should know  fleur smiled yes she said and slipped from the room  she went up with her head whirling a dry sensation in her throat a fluttered frightened feeling in her breast never in her life as yet had she suffered from even momentary fear that she would not get what she had set her heart on the sensations of the afternoon had been full and poignant and this gruesome discovery coming on the top of them had really made her head ache no wonder her father had hidden that photograph so secretly behind her ownashamed of having kept it but could he hate jons mother and yet keep her photograph she pressed her hands over her forehead trying to see things clearly had they told jonhad her visit to robin hill forced them to tell him everything now turned on that she knew they all knew exceptperhapsjon  she walked up and down biting her lip and thinking desperately hard jon loved his mother if they had told him what would he do she could not tell but if they had not told him should she notcould she not get him for herselfget married to him before he knew she searched her memories of robin hill his mothers face so passivewith its dark eyes and as if powdered hair its reserve its smilebaffled her and his fatherskindly sunken ironic instinctively she felt they would shrink from telling jon even now shrink from hurting himfor of course it would hurt him awfully to know  her aunt must be made not to tell her father that she knew so long as neither she herself nor jon were supposed to know there was still a chancefreedom to cover ones tracks and get what her heart was set on but she was almost overwhelmed by her isolation every ones hand was against herevery ones it was as jon had saidhe and she just wanted to live and the past was in their way a past they hadnt shared in and didnt understand oh what a shame and suddenly she thought of june would she help them for somehow june had left on her the impression that she would be sympathetic with their love impatient of obstacle then instinctively she thought i wont give anything away though even to her i darent i mean to have jon in spite of them all  soup was brought up to her and one of winifreds pet headache cachets she swallowed both then winifred herself appeared fleur opened her campaign with the words  you know auntie i do wish people wouldnt think im in love with that boy why ive hardly seen him  winifred though experienced was not fine she accepted the remark with considerable relief of course it was not pleasant for the girl to hear of the family scandal and she set herself to minimise the matter a task for which she was eminently qualified raised fashionably under a comfortable mother and a father whose nerves might not be shaken and for many years the wife of montague dartie her description was a masterpiece of understatement fleurs fathers first wife had been very foolish there had been a young man who had got run over and she had left fleurs father then years after when it might all have come right again she had taken up with their cousin jolyon and of course her father had been obliged to have a divorce nobody remembered anything of it now except just the family and perhaps it had all turned out for the best her father had fleur and jolyon and irene had been quite happy they said and their boy was a nice boy val having holly too is a sort of plaster dont you know with these soothing words winifred patted her nieces shoulder thought shes a nice plump little thing and went back to prosper profond who in spite of his indiscretion was very amusing this evening  for some minutes after her aunt had gone fleur remained under influence of bromide material and spiritual but then reality came back her aunt had left out all that matteredall the feeling the hate the love the unforgivingness of passionate hearts she who knew so little of life and had touched only the fringe of love was yet aware by instinct that words have as little relation to fact and feeling as coin to the bread it buys poor father she thought poor me poor jon but i dont care i mean to have him from the window of her darkened room she saw that man issue from the door below and prowl away if he and her motherhow would that affect her chance surely it must make her father cling to her more closely so that he would consent in the end to anything she wanted or become reconciled the sooner to what she did without his knowledge  she took some earth from the flowerbox in the window and with all her might flung it after that disappearing figure it fell short but the action did her good  and a little puff of air came up from green street smelling of petrol not sweet     v  purely forsyte affairs   soames coming up to the city with the intention of calling in at green street at the end of his day and taking fleur back home with him suffered from rumination sleeping partner that he was he seldom visited the city now but he still had a room of his own at cuthcott kingson  forsytes and one special clerk and a half assigned to the management of purely forsyte affairs they were somewhat in flux just nowan auspicious moment for the disposal of house property and soames was unloading the estates of his father and uncle roger and to some extent of his uncle nicholas his shrewd and matterofcourse probity in all money concerns had made him something of an autocrat in connection with these trusts if soames thought this or thought that one had better save oneself the bother of thinking too he guaranteed as it were irresponsibility to numerous forsytes of the third and fourth generations his fellow trustees such as his cousins roger or nicholas his cousinsinlaw tweetyman and spender or his sister cicelys husband all trusted him he signed first and where he signed first they signed after and nobody was a penny the worse just now they were all a good many pennies the better and soames was beginning to see the close of certain trusts except for distribution of the income from securities as giltedged as was compatible with the period  passing the more feverish parts of the city towards the most perfect backwater in london he ruminated money was extraordinarily tight and morality extraordinarily loose the war had done it banks were not lending people breaking contracts all over the place there was a feeling in the air and a look on faces that he did not like the country seemed in for a spell of gambling and bankruptcies there was satisfaction in the thought that neither he nor his trusts had an investment which could be affected by anything less maniacal than national repudiation or a levy on capital if soames had faith it was in what he called english common senseor the power to have things if not one way then another he mightlike his father james before himsay he didnt know what things were coming to but he never in his heart believed they were if it rested with him they wouldntand after all he was only an englishman like any other so quietly tenacious of what he had that he knew he would never really part with it without something more or less equivalent in exchange take his own case for example he was well off did that do anybody harm he did not eat ten meals a day he ate no more than perhaps not so much as a poor man he spent no money on vice breathed no more air used no more water to speak of than the mechanic or the porter he certainly had pretty things about him but they had given employment in the making and somebody must use them he bought pictures but art must be encouraged he was in fact an accidental channel through which money flowed employing labour what was there objectionable in that in his charge money was in quicker and more useful flux than it would be in charge of the state and a lot of slowfly moneysucking officials and as to what he saved each yearit was just as much in flux as what he didnt save going into water board or council stocks or something sound and useful the state paid him no salary for being trustee of his own or other peoples moneyhe did all that for nothing therein lay the whole case against nationalisationowners of private property were unpaid and yet had every incentive to quicken up the flux under nationalisationjust the opposite in a country smarting from officialism he felt that he had a strong case  it particularly annoyed him entering that backwater of perfect peace to think that a lot of unscrupulous trusts and combinations had been cornering the market in goods of all kinds and keeping prices at an artificial height such abusers of the individualistic system were the ruffians who caused all the trouble and it was some satisfaction to see them getting into a stew at last lest the whole thing might come down with a runand land in the soup  the offices of cuthcott kingson  forsyte occupied the ground and first floors of a house on the righthand side and ascending to his room soames thought time we had a coat of paint  his old clerk gradman was seated where he always was at a huge bureau with countless pigeonholes halftheclerk stood beside him with a brokers note recording investment of the proceeds from sale of the bryanston square house in roger forsytes estate soames took it and said  vancouver city stock hm its down today  with a sort of grating ingratiation old gradman answered him  yees but everythings down mr soames and halftheclerk withdrew  soames skewered the document onto a number of other papers and hung up his hat  i want to look at my will and marriage settlement gradman  old gradman moving to the limit of his swivel chair drew out two drafts from the bottom lefthand drawer recovering his body he raised his grizzlehaired face very red from stooping  copies sir  soames took them it struck him suddenly how like gradman was to the stout brindled yard dog they had been wont to keep on his chain at the shelter till one day fleur had come and insisted it should be let loose so that it had at once bitten the cook and been destroyed if you let gradman off his chair would he bite the cook  checking this frivolous fancy soames unfolded his marriage settlement he had not looked at it for over eighteen years not since he remade his will when his father died and fleur was born he wanted to see whether the words during coverture were in yes they wereodd expression when you thought of it and derived perhaps from horsebreeding interest on fifteen thousand pounds which he paid her without deducting income tax so long as she remained his wife and afterwards during widowhood dum castaoldfashioned and rather pointed words put in to insure the conduct of fleurs mother his will made it up to an annuity of a thousand under the same conditions all right he returned the copies to gradman who took them without looking up swung the chair restored the papers to their drawer and went on casting up  gradman i dont like the condition of the country there are a lot of people about without any common sense i want to find a way by which i can safeguard miss fleur against anything which might arise  gradman wrote the figure 2 on his blottingpaper  yees he said theres a nahsty spirit  the ordinary restraint against anticipation doesnt meet the case  nao said gradman  suppose those labour fellows come in or worse its these people with fixed ideas who are the danger look at ireland  ah said gradman  suppose i were to make a settlement on her at once with myself as beneficiary for life they couldnt take anything but the interest from me unless of course they alter the law  gradman moved his head and smiled  aoh he said they wouldnt do thaat  i dont know muttered soames i dont trust them  itll take two years sir to be valid against death duties  soames sniffed two years he was only sixtyfive  thats not the point draw a form of settlement that passes all my property to miss fleurs children in equal shares with antecedent lifeinterests first to myself and then to her without power of anticipation and add a clause that in the event of anything happening to divert her lifeinterest that interest passes to the trustees to apply for her benefit in their absolute discretion  gradman grated rather extreme at your age sir you lose control  thats my business said soames sharply  gradman wrote on a piece of paper lifeinterestanticipationdivert interestabsolute discretion and said  what trustees theres young mr kingson hes a nice steady young fellow  yes he might do for one i must have three there isnt a forsyte now who appeals to me  not young mr nicholas hes at the bar weve given im briefs  hell never set the thames on fire said soames  a smile oozed out on gradmans face greasy with countless muttonchops the smile of a man who sits all day  you cant expect it at his age mr soames  why what is he forty  yees quite a young fellow  well put him in but i want somebody wholl take a personal interest theres no one that i can see  what about mr valerius now hes come home  val dartie with that father  weell murmured gradman hes been dead seven yearsthe statute runs against him  no said soames i dont like the connection  he rose gradman said suddenly  if they were makin a levy on capital they could come on the trustees sir so there youd be just the same id think it over if i were you  thats true said soames i will what have you done about that dilapidation notice in vere street  i avent served it yet the partys very old she wont want to go out at her age  i dont know this spirit of unrest touches every one  still im lookin at things broadly sir shes eightyone  better serve it said soames and see what she says oh and mr timothy is everything in order in case of accidents  ive got the inventory of his estate all ready had the furniture and pictures valued so that we know what reserves to put on i shall be sorry when he goes though dear me it is a time since i first saw mr timothy  we cant live for ever said soames taking down his hat  nao said gradman but itll be a pitythe last of the old family shall i take up the matter of that nuisance in old compton street those organstheyre nahsty things  do i must call for miss fleur and catch the four oclock goodday gradman  goodday mr soames i hope miss fleur  well enough but gads about too much  yees grated gradman shes young  soames went out musing old gradman if he were younger id put him in the trust theres nobody i can depend on to take a real interest  leaving the bilious and mathematical exactitude the preposterous peace of that backwater he thought suddenly during coverture why cant they exclude fellows like profond instead of a lot of hardworking germans and was surprised at the depth of uneasiness which could provoke so unpatriotic a thought but there it was one never got a moment of real peace always something at the back of everything and he made his way towards green street  two hours later by his watch thomas gradman stirring in his swivel chair closed the last drawer of his bureau and putting into his waistcoat pocket a bunch of keys so fat that they gave him a protuberance on the liver side brushed his old top hat round with his sleeve took his umbrella and descended thick short and buttoned closely into his old frock coat he walked towards covent garden market he never missed that daily promenade to the tube for highgate and seldom some critical transaction on the way in connection with vegetables and fruit generations might be born and hats might change wars be fought and forsytes fade away but thomas gradman faithful and grey would take his daily walk and buy his daily vegetable times were not what they were and his son had lost a leg and they never gave him those nice little plaited baskets to carry the stuff in now and these tubes were convenient thingsstill he mustnt complain his health was good considering his time of life and after fiftyfour years in the law he was getting a round eight hundred a year and a little worried of late because it was mostly collectors commission on the rents and with all this conversion of forsyte property going on it looked like drying up and the price of living still so high but it was no good worryingthe good god made us allas he was in the habit of saying still house property in londonhe didnt know what mr roger or mr james would say if they could see it being sold like thisseemed to show a lack of faith but mr soameshe worried life and lives in being and twentyone years afterbeyond that you couldnt go still he kept his health wonderfullyand miss fleur was a pretty little thingshe was shed marry but lots of people had no children nowadayshe had had his first child at twentytwo and mr jolyon married while he was at cambridge had his child the same yeargracious peter that was back in 70 a long time before old mr jolyonfine judge of propertyhad taken his will away from mr jamesdear yes those were the days when they were buyin property right and left and none of this khaki and fallin over one another to get out of things and cucumbers at twopence and a melonthe old melons that made your mouth water fifty years since he went into mr james office and mr james had said to him now gradman youre only a shaveryou pay attention and youll make your five hundred a year before youve done and he had and feared god and served the forsytes and kept a vegetable diet at night and buying a copy of john bullnot that he approved of it an extravagant affairhe entered the tube elevator with his mere brownpaper parcel and was borne down into the bowels of the earth     vi  soames private life   on his way to green street it occurred to soames that he ought to go into dumetrius in suffolk street about the possibility of the bolderby old crome almost worth while to have fought the war to have the bolderby old crome as it were in flux old bolderby had died his son and grandson had been killeda cousin was coming into the estate who meant to sell it some said because of the condition of england others said because he had asthma  if dumetrius once got hold of it the price would become prohibitive it was necessary for soames to find out whether dumetrius had got it before he tried to get it himself he therefore confined himself to discussing with dumetrius whether monticellis would come again now that it was the fashion for a picture to be anything except a picture and the future of johns with a sideslip into buxton knights it was only when leaving that he added so theyre not selling the bolderby old crome after all in sheer pride of racial superiority as he had calculated would be the case dumetrius replied  oh i shall get it mr forsyte sir  the flutter of his eyelid fortified soames in a resolution to write direct to the new bolderby suggesting that the only dignified way of dealing with an old crome was to avoid dealers he therefore said well goodday and went leaving dumetrius the wiser  at green street he found that fleur was out and would be all the evening she was staying one more night in london he cabbed on dejectedly and caught his train  he reached his house about six oclock the air was heavy midges biting thunder about taking his letters he went up to his dressingroom to cleanse himself of london  an uninteresting post a receipt a bill for purchases on behalf of fleur a circular about an exhibition of etchings a letter beginning   sir  i feel it my duty   that would be an appeal or something unpleasant he looked at once for the signature there was none incredulously he turned the page over and examined each corner not being a public man soames had never yet had an anonymous letter and his first impulse was to tear it up as a dangerous thing his second to read it as a thing still more dangerous   sir  i feel it my duty to inform you that having no interest in the matter your lady is carrying on with a foreigner   reaching that word soames stopped mechanically and examined the postmark so far as he could pierce the impenetrable disguise in which the post office had wrapped it there was something with a sea at the end and a t in it chelsea no battersea perhaps he read on   these foreigners are all the same sack the lot this one meets your lady twice a week i know it of my own knowledgeand to see an englishman put on goes against the grain you watch it and see if what i say isnt true i shouldnt meddle if it wasnt a dirty foreigner thats in it yours obedient   the sensation with which soames dropped the letter was similar to that he would have had entering his bedroom and finding it full of blackbeetles the meanness of anonymity gave a shuddering obscenity to the moment and the worst of it was that this shadow had been at the back of his mind ever since the sunday evening when fleur had pointed down at prosper profond strolling on the lawn and said prowling cat had he not in connection therewith this very day perused his will and marriage settlement and now this anonymous ruffian with nothing to gain apparently save the venting of his spite against foreigners had wrenched it out of the obscurity in which he had hoped and wished it would remain to have such knowledge forced on him at his time of life about fleurs mother he picked the letter up from the carpet tore it across and then when it hung together by just the fold at the back stopped tearing and reread it he was taking at that moment one of the decisive resolutions of his life he would not be forced into another scandal no however he decided to deal with this matterand it required the most farsighted and careful considerationhe would do nothing that might injure fleur that resolution taken his mind answered the helm again and he made his ablutions his hands trembled as he dried them scandal he would not have but something must be done to stop this sort of thing he went into his wifes room and stood looking round him the idea of searching for anything which would incriminate and entitle him to hold a menace over her did not even come to him there would be nothingshe was much too practical the idea of having her watched had been dismissed before it cametoo well he remembered his previous experience of that no he had nothing but this tornup letter from some anonymous ruffian whose impudent intrusion into his private life he so violently resented it was repugnant to him to make use of it but he might have to what a mercy fleur was not at home tonight a tap on the door broke up his painful cogitations  mr michael mont sir is in the drawingroom will you see him  no said soames yes ill come down  anything that would take his mind off for a few minutes  michael mont in flannels stood on the verandah smoking a cigarette he threw it away as soames came up and ran his hand through his hair  soames feeling towards this young man was singular he was no doubt a rackety irresponsible young fellow according to old standards yet somehow likeable with his extraordinarily cheerful way of blurting out his opinions  come in he said have you had tea  mont came in  i thought fleur would have been back sir but im glad she isnt the fact is iim fearfully gone on her so fearfully gone that i thought youd better know its oldfashioned of course coming to fathers first but i thought youd forgive that i went to my own dad and he says if i settle down hell see me through he rather cottons to the idea in fact i told him about your goya  oh said soames inexpressibly dry he rather cottons  yes sir do you  soames smiled faintly you see resumed mont twiddling his straw hat while his hair ears eyebrows all seemed to stand up from excitement when youve been through the war you cant help being in a hurry  to get married and unmarried afterwards said soames slowly  not from fleur sir imagine if you were me  soames cleared his throat that way of putting it was forcible enough  fleurs too young he said  oh no sir were awfully old nowadays my dad seems to me a perfect babe his thinking apparatus hasnt turned a hair but hes a baronight of course that keeps him back  baronight repeated soames what may that be  bart sir i shall be a bart some day but i shall live it down you know  go away and live this down said soames  young mont said imploringly oh no sir i simply must hang round or i shouldnt have a dogs chance youll let fleur do what she likes i suppose anyway madame passes me  indeed said soames frigidly  you dont really bar me do you and the young man looked so doleful that soames smiled  you may think youre very old he said but you strike me as extremely young to rattle ahead of everything is not a proof of maturity  all right sir i give you our age but to show you i mean businessive got a job  glad to hear it  joined a publisher my governor is putting up the stakes  soames put his hand over his mouthhe had so very nearly said god help the publisher his grey eyes scrutinised the agitated young man  i dont dislike you mr mont but fleur is everything to me everythingdo you understand  yes sir i know but so she is to me  thats as may be im glad youve told me however and now i think theres nothing more to be said  i know it rests with her sir  it will rest with her a long time i hope  you arent cheering said mont suddenly  no said soames my experience of life has not made me anxious to couple people in a hurry goodnight mr mont i shant tell fleur what youve said  oh murmured mont blankly i really could knock my brains out for want of her she knows that perfectly well  i dare say and soames held out his hand a distracted squeeze a heavy sigh and soon after sounds from the young mans motorcycle called up visions of flying dust and broken bones  the younger generation he thought heavily and went out on to the lawn the gardeners had been mowing and there was still the smell of freshcut grassthe thundery air kept all scents close to earth the sky was of a purplish huethe poplars black two or three boats passed on the river scuttling as it were for shelter before the storm three days fine weather thought soames and then a storm where was annette with that chap for all he knewshe was a young woman impressed with the queer charity of that thought he entered the summerhouse and sat down the fact wasand he admitted itfleur was so much to him that his wife was very littlevery little frenchhad hardly been more than a mistress and he was getting indifferent to that side of things it was odd how with all his ingrained care for moderation and secure investment soames ever put his emotional eggs into one basket first irenenow fleur he was just conscious of it sitting there conscious of its odd dangerousness it had brought him to wreck and scandal once but nownow it should save him he cared so much for fleur that he would have no further scandal if only he could get at that anonymous letter writer he would teach the fellow not to meddle and stir up mud at the bottom of water which he wished should remain stagnant a distant flash a low rumble and large drops of rain spattered on the thatch above him he remained indifferent tracing a pattern with his finger on the dusty surface of a little rustic table fleurs future i want fair sailing for her he thought nothing else matters at my time of life a lonely businesslife what you had you never could keep to yourself as you warned one off you let another in one could make sure of nothing he reached up and pulled a red rambler rose from a cluster which blocked the window flowers grew and droppedyou couldnt keep them the thunder rumbled and crashed travelling east along the river the paling flashes flicked his eyes the poplar tops showed sharp and dense against the sky a heavy shower rustled and rattled and veiled in the little house wherein he sat indifferent thinking  when the storm was over he left his retreat and went down the wet path to the river bank  two swans had come sheltering in among the reeds he knew the birds well and stood watching the dignity in the curve of those white necks and formidable snakelike heads not dignifiedwhat i have to do he thought and yet it must be tackled lest worse befell annette must be back by now from wherever she had gone for it was nearly dinnertime and as the moment for seeing her approached the difficulty of knowing what to say and how to say it had increased a new and scaring thought occurred to him suppose she wanted her liberty to marry this fellow well if she did she couldnt have it he had not married her for that the image of prosper profond dawdled before him reassuringly not a marrying man no no anger replaced that momentary scare he had better not come my way he thought the mongrel represented ah what did prosper profond represent nothing that mattered surely and yet something real enough in the worldunmorality let off its chain disillusionment on the prowl that expression annette had caught from him je men fiche a fatalistic chap a continentala cosmopolitana product of the age if there were condemnation more complete soames felt that he did not know it  the swans had turned their heads and were looking past him into some distance of their own one of them uttered a little hiss wagged its tail turned as if answering to a rudder and swam away the other followed their white bodies their stately necks passed out of his sight and he went towards the house  annette was in the drawingroom dressed for dinner and he thought as he went upstairs handsome is as handsome does handsome except for remarks about the curtains in the drawingroom and the storm there was practically no conversation during a meal distinguished by exactitude of quantity and perfection of quality soames drank nothing he followed her into the drawingroom afterwards and found her smoking a cigarette on the sofa between the two french windows she was leaning back almost upright in a low black frock with her knees crossed and her blue eyes half closed greyblue smoke issued from her red rather full lips a fillet bound her chestnut hair she wore the thinnest silk stockings and shoes with very high heels showing off her instep a fine piece in any room soames who held that torn letter in a hand thrust deep into the sidepocket of his dinnerjacket said  im going to shut the window the damps lifting in  he did so and stood looking at a david cox adorning the creampanelled wall close by  what was she thinking of he had never understood a woman in his lifeexcept fleurand fleur not always his heart beat fast but if he meant to do it now was the moment turning from the david cox he took out the torn letter  ive had this  her eyes widened stared at him and hardened  soames handed her the letter  its torn but you can read it and he turned back to the david coxa seapiece of good tone but without movement enough i wonder what that chaps doing at this moment he thought ill astonish him yet out of the corner of his eye he saw annette holding the letter rigidly her eyes moved from side to side under her darkened lashes and frowning darkened eyebrows she dropped the letter gave a little shiver smiled and said  dirrty  i quite agree said soames degrading is it true  a tooth fastened on her red lower lip and what if it were  she was brazen  is that all you have to say  no  well speak out  what is the good of talking  soames said icily so you admit it  i admit nothing you are a fool to ask a man like you should not ask it is dangerous  soames made a tour of the room to subdue his rising anger  do you remember he said halting in front of her what you were when i married you working at accounts in a restaurant  do you remember that i was not half your age  soames broke off the hard encounter of their eyes and went back to the david cox  i am not going to bandy words i require you to give up thisfriendship i think of the matter entirely as it affects fleur  ahfleur  yes said soames stubbornly fleur she is your child as well as mine  it is kind to admit that  are you going to do what i say  i refuse to tell you  then i must make you  annette smiled  no soames she said you are helpless do not say things that you will regret  anger swelled the veins on his forehead he opened his mouth to vent that emotion andcould not annette went on  there shall be no more such letters i promise you that is enough  soames writhed he had a sense of being treated like a child by this woman who had deserved he did not know what  when two people have married and lived like us soames they had better be quiet about each other there are things one does not drag up into the light for people to laugh at you will be quiet then not for my sakefor your own you are getting old i am not yet you have made me verry practical soames who had passed through all the sensations of being choked repeated dully  i require you to give up this friendship  and if i do not  thenthen i will cut you out of my will  somehow it did not seem to meet the case annette laughed  you will live a long time soames  youyou are a bad woman said soames suddenly  annette shrugged her shoulders  i do not think so living with you has killed things in me it is true but i am not a bad woman i am sensiblethat is all and so will you be when you have thought it over  i shall see this man said soames sullenly and warn him off  mon cher you are funny you do not want me you have as much of me as you want and you wish the rest of me to be dead i admit nothing but i am not going to be dead soames at my age so you had better be quiet i tell you i myself will make no scandal none now i am not saying any more whatever you do  she reached out took a french novel off a little table and opened it soames watched her silenced by the tumult of his feelings the thought of that man was almost making him want her and this was a revelation of their relationship startling to one little given to introspective philosophy without saying another word he went out and up to the picturegallery this came of marrying a frenchwoman and yet without her there would have been no fleur she had served her purpose  shes right he thought i can do nothing i dont even know that theres anything in it the instinct of selfpreservation warned him to batten down his hatches to smother the fire with want of air unless one believed there was something in a thing there wasnt  that night he went into her room she received him in the most matteroffact way as if there had been no scene between them and he returned to his own room with a curious sense of peace if one didnt choose to see one neednt and he did not choosein future he did not choose there was nothing to be gained by itnothing opening the drawer he took from the sachet a handkerchief and the framed photograph of fleur when he had looked at it a little he slipped it down and there was that other onethat old one of irene an owl hooted while he stood in his window gazing at it the owl hooted the red climbing roses seemed to deepen in colour there came a scent of limeblossom god that had been a different thing passionmemory dust     vii  june takes a hand   one who was a sculptor a slav a sometime resident in new york an egoist and impecunious was to be found of an evening in june forsytes studio on the bank of the thames at chiswick on the evening of july 6 boris strumolowskiseveral of whose works were on show there because they were as yet too advanced to be on show anywhere elsehad begun well with that aloof and rather christlike silence which admirably suited his youthful round broadcheekboned countenance framed in bright hair banged like a girls june had known him three weeks and he still seemed to her the principal embodiment of genius and hope of the future a sort of star of the east which had strayed into an unappreciative west until that evening he had conversationally confined himself to recording his impressions of the united states whose dust he had just shaken from off his feeta country in his opinion so barbarous in every way that he had sold practically nothing there and become an object of suspicion to the police a country as he said without a race of its own without liberty equality or fraternity without principles traditions taste withoutin a worda soul he had left it for his own good and come to the only other country where he could live well june had dwelt unhappily on him in her lonely moments standing before his creationsfrightening but powerful and symbolic once they had been explained that he haloed by bright hair like an early italian painting and absorbed in his genius to the exclusion of all elsethe only sign of course by which real genius could be toldshould still be a lame duck agitated her warm heart almost to the exclusion of paul post and she had begun to take steps to clear her gallery in order to fill it with strumolowski masterpieces she had at once encountered trouble paul post had kicked vospovitch had stung with all the emphasis of a genius which she did not as yet deny them they had demanded another six weeks at least of her gallery the american stream still flowing in would soon be flowing out the american stream was their right their only hope their salvationsince nobody in this beastly country cared for art june had yielded to the demonstration after all boris would not mind their having the full benefit of an american stream which he himself so violently despised  this evening she had put that to boris with nobody else present except hannah hobdey the mediaeval blackandwhitist and jimmy portugal editor of the neoartist she had put it to him with that sudden confidence which continual contact with the neoartistic world had never been able to dry up in her warm and generous nature he had not broken his christlike silence however for more than two minutes before she began to move her blue eyes from side to side as a cat moves its tail thishe saidwas characteristic of england the most selfish country in the world the country which sucked the blood of other countries destroyed the brains and hearts of irishmen hindus egyptians boers and burmese all the finest races in the world bullying hypocritical england this was what he had expected coming to such a country where the climate was all fog and the people all tradesmen perfectly blind to art and sunk in profiteering and the grossest materialism conscious that hannah hobdey was murmuring hear hear and jimmy portugal sniggering june grew crimson and suddenly rapped out  then why did you ever come we didnt ask you the remark was so singularly at variance with all that she had led him to expect from her that strumolowski stretched out his hand and took a cigarette  england never wants an idealist he said  but in june something primitively english was thoroughly upset old jolyons sense of justice had risen as it were from bed you come and sponge on us she said and then abuse us if you think thats playing the game i dont  she now discovered that which others had discovered before herthe thickness of hide beneath which the sensibility of genius is sometimes veiled strumolowskis young and ingenuous face became the incarnation of a sneer  sponge one does not sponge one takes what is owinga tenth part of what is owing you will repent to say that miss forsyte  oh no said june i shant  ah we know very well we artistsyou take us to get what you can out of us i want nothing from youand he blew out a cloud of junes smoke  decision rose in an icy puff from the turmoil of insulted shame within her very well then you can take your things away  and almost in the same moment she thought poor boy hes only got a garret and probably not a taxi fare in front of these people too its positively disgusting  young strumolowski shook his head violently his hair thick smooth close as a golden plate did not fall off  i can live on nothing he said shrilly i have often had to for the sake of my art it is you bourgeois who force us to spend money  the words hit june like a pebble in the ribs after all she had done for art all her identification with its troubles and lame ducks she was struggling for adequate words when the door was opened and her austrian murmured  a young lady gnadiges fraulein  where  in the little mealroom  with a glance at boris strumolowski at hannah hobdey at jimmy portugal june said nothing and went out devoid of equanimity entering the little mealroom she perceived the young lady to be fleurlooking very pretty if pale at this disenchanted moment a lame duck of her own breed was welcome to june so homoeopathic by instinct  the girl must have come of course because of jon or if not at least to get something out of her and june felt just then that to assist somebody was the only bearable thing  so youve remembered to come she said  yes what a jolly little duck of a house but please dont let me bother you if youve got people  not at all said june i want to let them stew in their own juice for a bit have you come about jon  you said you thought we ought to be told well ive found out  oh said june blankly not nice is it  they were standing one on each side of the little bare table at which june took her meals a vase on it was full of iceland poppies the girl raised her hand and touched them with a gloved finger to her newfangled dress frilly about the hips and tight below the knees june took a sudden likinga charming colour flaxblue  she makes a picture thought june her little room with its whitewashed walls its floor and hearth of old pink brick its black paint and latticed window athwart which the last of the sunlight was shining had never looked so charming set off by this young figure with the creamy slightly frowning face she remembered with sudden vividness how nice she herself had looked in those old days when her heart was set on philip bosinney that dead lover who had broken from her to destroy for ever irenes allegiance to this girls father did fleur know of that too  well she said what are you going to do  it was some seconds before fleur answered  i dont want jon to suffer i must see him once more to put an end to it  youre going to put an end to it  what else is there to do  the girl seemed to june suddenly intolerably spiritless  i suppose youre right she muttered i know my father thinks so buti should never have done it myself i cant take things lying down  how poised and watchful that girl looked how unemotional her voice sounded  people will assume that im in love  well arent you  fleur shrugged her shoulders i might have known it thought june shes soames daughterfish and yethe  well what do you want me to do she said with a sort of disgust  could i see jon here tomorrow on his way down to hollys hed come if you sent him a line tonight and perhaps afterwards youd let them know quietly at robin hill that its all over and that they neednt tell jon about his mother  all right said june abruptly ill write now and you can post it halfpast two tomorrow i shant be in myself  she sat down at the tiny bureau which filled one corner when she looked round with the finished note fleur was still touching the poppies with her gloved finger  june licked a stamp well here it is if youre not in love of course theres no more to be said jons lucky  fleur took the note thanks awfully  coldblooded little baggage thought june jon son of her father to love and not to be loved by the daughter ofsoames it was humiliating  is that all  fleur nodded her frills shook and trembled as she swayed towards the door  goodbye  goodbye  little piece of fashion muttered june closing the door that family and she marched back towards her studio boris strumolowski had regained his christlike silence and jimmy portugal was damning everybody except the group in whose behalf he ran the neoartist among the condemned were eric cobbley and several other lameduck genii who at one time or another had held first place in the repertoire of junes aid and adoration she experienced a sense of futility and disgust and went to the window to let the riverwind blow those squeaky words away  but when at length jimmy portugal had finished and gone with hannah hobdey she sat down and mothered young strumolowski for half an hour promising him a month at least of the american stream so that he went away with his halo in perfect order in spite of all june thought boris is wonderful     viii  the bit between the teeth   to know that your hand is against every ones isfor some naturesto experience a sense of moral release fleur felt no remorse when she left junes house reading condemnatory resentment in her little kinswomans blue eyesshe was glad that she had fooled her despising june because that elderly idealist had not seen what she was after  end it forsooth she would soon show them all that she was only just beginning and she smiled to herself on the top of the bus which carried her back to mayfair but the smile died squeezed out by spasms of anticipation and anxiety would she be able to manage jon she had taken the bit between her teeth but could she make him take it too she knew the truth and the real danger of delayhe knew neither therein lay all the difference in the world  suppose i tell him she thought wouldnt it really be safer this hideous luck had no right to spoil their love he must see that they could not let it people always accepted an accomplished fact in time from that piece of philosophyprofound enough at her ageshe passed to another consideration less philosophic if she persuaded jon to a quick and secret marriage and he found out afterwards that she had known the truth what then jon hated subterfuge again then would it not be better to tell him but the memory of his mothers face kept intruding on that impulse fleur was afraid his mother had power over him more power perhaps than she herself who could tell it was too great a risk deepsunk in these instinctive calculations she was carried on past green street as far as the ritz hotel she got down there and walked back on the green park side the storm had washed every tree they still dripped heavy drops fell on to her frills and to avoid them she crossed over under the eyes of the iseeum club chancing to look up she saw monsieur profond with a tall stout man in the bay window turning into green street she heard her name called and saw that prowler coming up he took off his hata glossy bowler such as she particularly detested  goodevenin miss forsyde isnt there a small thing i can do for you  yes pass by on the other side  i say why do you dislike me  it looks like it  well then because you make me feel life isnt worth living  monsieur profond smiled  look here miss forsyde dont worry itll be all right nothing lasts  things do last cried fleur with me anyhowespecially likes and dislikes  well that makes me a bit unappy  i should have thought nothing could ever make you happy or unhappy  i dont like to annoy other people im goin on my yacht  fleur looked at him startled  where  small voyage to the south seas or somewhere said monsieur profond  fleur suffered relief and a sense of insult clearly he meant to convey that he was breaking with her mother how dared he have anything to break and yet how dared he break it  goodnight miss forsyde remember me to mrs dartie im not so bad really goodnight fleur left him standing there with his hat raised stealing a look round she saw him strollimmaculate and heavyback towards his club  he cant even love with conviction she thought what will mother do  her dreams that night were endless and uneasy she rose heavy and unrested and went at once to the study of whitakers almanac a forsyte is instinctively aware that facts are the real crux of any situation she might conquer jons prejudice but without exact machinery to complete their desperate resolve nothing would happen from the invaluable tome she learned that they must each be twentyone or some ones consent would be necessary which of course was unobtainable then she became lost in directions concerning licenses certificates notices districts coming finally to the word perjury but that was nonsense who would really mind their giving wrong ages in order to be married for love she ate hardly any breakfast and went back to whitaker the more she studied the less sure she became till idly turning the pages she came to scotland people could be married there without any of this nonsense she had only to go and stay there twentyone days then jon could come and in front of two people they could declare themselves married and what was morethey would be it was far the best way and at once she ran over her schoolfellows there was mary lambe who lived in edinburgh and was quite a sport she had a brother too she could stay with mary lambe who with her brother would serve for witnesses she well knew that some girls would think all this unnecessary and that all she and jon need do was to go away together for a weekend and then say to their people we are married by nature we must now be married by law but fleur was forsyte enough to feel such a proceeding dubious and to dread her fathers face when he heard of it besides she did not believe that jon would do it he had an opinion of her such as she could not bear to diminish no mary lambe was preferable and it was just the time of year to go to scotland more at ease now she packed avoided her aunt and took a bus to chiswick she was too early and went on to kew gardens she found no peace among its flowerbeds labelled trees and broad green spaces and having lunched off anchovypaste sandwiches and coffee returned to chiswick and rang junes bell the austrian admitted her to the little mealroom now that she knew what she and jon were up against her longing for him had increased tenfold as if he were a toy with sharp edges or dangerous paint such as they had tried to take from her as a child if she could not have her way and get jon for good and all she felt like dying of privation by hook or crook she must and would get him a round dim mirror of very old glass hung over the pink brick hearth she stood looking at herself reflected in it pale and rather dark under the eyes little shudders kept passing through her nerves then she heard the bell ring and stealing to the window saw him standing on the doorstep smoothing his hair and lips as if he too were trying to subdue the fluttering of his nerves  she was sitting on one of the two rushseated chairs with her back to the door when he came in and she said at once  sit down jon i want to talk seriously  jon sat on the table by her side and without looking at him she went on  if you dont want to lose me we must get married  jon gasped  why is there anything new  no but i felt it at robin hill and among my people  but stammered jon at robin hillit was all smoothand theyve said nothing to me  but they mean to stop us your mothers face was enough and my fathers  have you seen him since  fleur nodded what mattered a few supplementary lies  but said jon eagerly i cant see how they can feel like that after all these years  fleur looked up at him  perhaps you dont love me enough  not love you enough whyi  then make sure of me  without telling them  not till after  jon was silent how much older he looked than on that day barely two months ago when she first saw himquite two years older  it would hurt mother awfully he said  fleur drew her hand away  youve got to choose  jon slid off the table onto his knees  but why not tell them they cant really stop us fleur  they can i tell you they can  how  were utterly dependentby putting money pressure and all sorts of other pressure im not patient jon  but its deceiving them  fleur got up  you cant really love me or you wouldnt hesitate he either fears his fate too much  lifting his hands to her waist jon forced her to sit down again she hurried on  ive planned it all out weve only to go to scotland when were married theyll soon come round people always come round to facts dont you see jon  but to hurt them so awfully  so he would rather hurt her than those people of his  all right then let me go  jon got up and put his back against the door i expect youre right he said slowly but i want to think it over  she could see that he was seething with feelings he wanted to express but she did not mean to help him she hated herself at this moment and almost hated him  why had she to do all the work to secure their love it wasnt fair and then she saw his eyes adoring and distressed  dont look like that i only dont want to lose you jon  you cant lose me so long as you want me  oh yes i can  jon put his hands on her shoulders  fleur do you know anything you havent told me  it was the pointblank question she had dreaded she looked straight at him and answered no she had burnt her boats but what did it matter if she got him he would forgive her and throwing her arms round his neck she kissed him on the lips she was winning she felt it in the beating of his heart against her in the closing of his eyes i want to make sure i want to make sure she whispered promise  jon did not answer his face had the stillness of extreme trouble at last he said  its like hitting them i must think a little fleur i really must  fleur slipped out of his arms  oh very well and suddenly she burst into tears of disappointment shame and overstrain followed five minutes of acute misery jons remorse and tenderness knew no bounds but he did not promise despite her will to cry very well then if you dont love me enoughgoodbye she dared not from birth accustomed to her own way this check from one so young so tender so devoted baffled and surprised her she wanted to push him away from her to try what anger and coldness would do and again she dared not the knowledge that she was scheming to rush him blindfold into the irrevocable weakened everythingweakened the sincerity of pique and the sincerity of passion even her kisses had not the lure she wished for them that stormy little meeting ended inconclusively  will you some tea gnadiges fraulein  pushing jon from her she cried out  nono thank you im just going  and before he could prevent her she was gone  she went stealthily mopping her flushed stained cheeks frightened angry very miserable she had stirred jon up so fearfully yet nothing definite was promised or arranged but the more uncertain and hazardous the future the more the will to have worked its tentacles into the flesh of her heartlike some burrowing tick  no one was at green street winifred had gone with imogen to see a play which some said was allegorical and others very exciting dont you know it was because of what others said that winifred and imogen had gone fleur went on to paddington through the carriage the air from the brickkilns of west drayton and the late hayfields fanned her stillflushed cheeks flowers had seemed to be had for the picking now they were all thorned and prickled but the golden flower within the crown of spikes seemed to her tenacious spirit all the fairer and more desirable     ix  fat in the fire   on reaching home fleur found an atmosphere so peculiar that it penetrated even the perplexed aura of her own private life her mother was in blue stockingette and a brown study her father in a white felt hat and the vinery neither of them had a word to throw to a dog is it because of me thought fleur or because of profond to her mother she said  whats the matter with father  her mother answered with a shrug of her shoulders  to her father  whats the matter with mother  her father answered  matter what should be the matter and gave her a sharp look  by the way murmured fleur monsieur profond is going a small voyage on his yacht to the south seas  soames examined a branch on which no grapes were growing  this vines a failure he said ive had young mont here he asked me something about you  oh how do you like him father  hehes a productlike all these young people  what were you at his age dear  soames smiled grimly  we went to work and didnt play aboutflying and motoring and making love  didnt you ever make love  she avoided looking at him while she said that but she saw him well enough his pale face had reddened his eyebrows where darkness was still mingled with the grey had come close together  i had no time or inclination to philander  perhaps you had a grand passion  soames looked at her intently  yesif you want to knowand much good it did me he moved away along by the hotwater pipes fleur tiptoed silently after him  tell me about it father  soames became very still  what should you want to know about such things at your age  is she alive  he nodded  and married  yes  its jon forsytes mother isnt it and she was your wife first  it was said in a flash of intuition surely his opposition came from his anxiety that she should not know of that old wound to his pride but she was startled to see some one so old and calm wince as if struck to hear so sharp a note of pain in his voice  who told you that if your aunt i cant bear the affair talked of  but darling said fleur softly its so long ago  long ago or not i  fleur stood stroking his arm  ive tried to forget he said suddenly i dont wish to be reminded and then as if venting some long and secret irritation he added in these days people dont understand grand passion indeed no one knows what it is  i do said fleur almost in a whisper  soames who had turned his back on her spun round  what are you talking ofa child like you  perhaps ive inherited it father  what  for her son you see  he was pale as a sheet and she knew that she was as bad they stood staring at each other in the steamy heat redolent of the mushy scent of earth of potted geranium and of vines coming along fast  this is crazy said soames at last between dry lips  scarcely moving her own she murmured  dont be angry father i cant help it  but she could see he wasnt angry only scared deeply scared  i thought that foolishness he stammered was all forgotten  oh no its ten times what it was  soames kicked at the hotwater pipe the hapless movement touched her who had no fear of her fathernone  dearest she said what must be must you know  must repeated soames you dont know what youre talking of has that boy been told  the blood rushed into her cheeks  not yet  he had turned from her again and with one shoulder a little raised stood staring fixedly at a joint in the pipes  its most distasteful to me he said suddenly nothing could be more so son of that fellowitsitsperverse  she had noted almost unconsciously that he did not say son of that woman and again her intuition began working  did the ghost of that grand passion linger in some corner of his heart  she slipped her hand under his arm  jons father is quite ill and old i saw him  you  yes i went there with jon i saw them both  well and what did they say to you  nothing they were very polite  they would be he resumed his contemplation of the pipejoint and then said suddenly i must think this overill speak to you again tonight  she knew this was final for the moment and stole away leaving him still looking at the pipejoint she wandered into the fruitgarden among the raspberry and currant bushes without impetus to pick and eat two months agoshe was lighthearted even two days agolighthearted before prosper profond told her now she felt tangled in a webof passions vested rights oppressions and revolts the ties of love and hate at this dark moment of discouragement there seemed even to her holdfast nature no way out how deal with ithow sway and bend things to her will and get her hearts desire and suddenly round the corner of the high box hedge she came plump on her mother walking swiftly with an open letter in her hand her bosom was heaving her eyes dilated her cheeks flushed instantly fleur thought the yacht poor mother  annette gave her a wide startled look and said  jai la migraine  im awfully sorry mother  oh yes you and your fathersorry  but motheri am i know what it feels like  annettes startled eyes grew wide till the whites showed above them you innocent she said  her motherso selfpossessed and commonsensicalto look and speak like this it was all frightening her father her mother herself and only two months back they had seemed to have everything they wanted in this world  annette crumpled the letter in her hand fleur knew that she must ignore the sight  cant i do anything for your head mother  annette shook that head and walked on swaying her hips  its cruel thought fleur and i was glad that man what do men come prowling for disturbing everything i suppose hes tired of her what business has he to be tired of my mother what business and at that thought so natural and so peculiar she uttered a little choked laugh  she ought of course to be delighted but what was there to be delighted at her father didnt really care her mother did perhaps she entered the orchard and sat down under a cherrytree a breeze sighed in the higher boughs the sky seen through their green was very blue and very white in cloudthose heavy white clouds almost always present in river landscape bees sheltering out of the wind hummed softly and over the lush grass fell the thick shade from those fruittrees planted by her father fiveandtwenty years ago birds were almost silent the cuckoos had ceased to sing but woodpigeons were cooing the breath and drone and cooing of high summer were not for long a sedative to her excited nerves crouched over her knees she began to scheme her father must be made to back her up why should he mind so long as she was happy she had not lived for nearly nineteen years without knowing that her future was all he really cared about she had then only to convince him that her future could not be happy without jon he thought it a mad fancy how foolish the old were thinking they could tell what the young felt had not he confessed that hewhen younghad loved with a grand passion he ought to understand he piles up his money for me she thought but whats the use if im not going to be happy money and all it bought did not bring happiness love only brought that the oxeyed daisies in this orchard which gave it such a moony look sometimes grew wild and happy and had their hour they oughtnt to have called me fleur she mused if they didnt mean me to have my hour and be happy while it lasts nothing real stood in the way like poverty or diseasesentiment only a ghost from the unhappy past jon was right they wouldnt let you live these old people they made mistakes committed crimes and wanted their children to go on paying the breeze died away midges began to bite she got up plucked a piece of honeysuckle and went in  it was hot that night both she and her mother had put on thin pale low frocks the dinner flowers were pale fleur was struck with the pale look of everything her fathers face her mothers shoulders the pale panelled walls the palegrey velvety carpet the lampshade even the soup was pale there was not one spot of colour in the room not even wine in the pale glasses for no one drank it what was not pale was blackher fathers clothes the butlers clothes her retriever stretched out exhausted in the window the curtains black with a cream pattern a moth came in and that was pale and silent was that halfmourning dinner in the heat  her father called her back as she was following her mother out  she sat down beside him at the table and unpinning the pale honeysuckle put it to her nose  ive been thinking he said  yes dear  its extremely painful for me to talk but theres no help for it i dont know if you understand how much you are to meive never spoken of it i didnt think it necessary butbut youre everything your mother he paused staring at his fingerbowl of venetian glass  yes  ive only you to look to ive never hadnever wanted anything else since you were born  i know fleur murmured  soames moistened his lips  you may think this a matter i can smooth over and arrange for you youre mistaken iim helpless  fleur did not speak  quite apart from my own feelings went on soames with more resolution those two are not amenable to anything i can say theythey hate me as people always hate those whom they have injured  but hejon  hes their flesh and blood her only child probably he means to her what you mean to me its a deadlock  no cried fleur no father  soames leaned back the image of pale patience as if resolved on the betrayal of no emotion  listen he said youre putting the feelings of two monthstwo monthsagainst the feelings of thirtyfive years what chance do you think you have two monthsyour very first loveaffair a matter of half a dozen meetings a few walks and talks a few kissesagainst against what you cant imagine what no one could who hasnt been through it come be reasonable fleur its midsummer madness  fleur tore the honeysuckle into little slow bits the madness is in letting the past spoil it all what do we care about the past its our lives not yours  soames raised his hand to his forehead where suddenly she saw moisture shining  whose child are you he said whose child is he the present is linked with the past the future with both theres no getting away from that  she had never heard philosophy pass those lips before impressed even in her agitation she leaned her elbows on the table her chin on her hands  but father consider it practically we want each other theres ever so much money and nothing whatever in the way but sentiment lets bury the past father  soames shook his head impossible  besides said fleur gently you cant prevent us  i dont suppose said soames that if left to myself i should try to prevent you i must put up with things i know to keep your affection but its not i who control this matter thats what i want you to realise before its too late if you go on thinking you can get your way and encourage this feeling the blow will be much heavier when you find you cant  oh cried fleur help me father you can help me you know  soames made a startled movement of negation  i he said bitterly help i am the impedimentthe just cause and impedimentisnt that the jargon you have my blood in your veins  he rose  well the fats in the fire if you persist in your wilfulness youll have yourself to blame come dont be foolish my childmy only child  fleur laid her forehead against his shoulder  all was in such turmoil within her but no good to show it no good at all she broke away from him and went out into the twilight distraught but unconvinced all was indeterminate and vague within her like the shapes and shadows in the garden excepther will to have a poplar pierced up into the darkblue sky and touched a white star there the dew wetted her shoes and chilled her bare shoulders she went down to the river bank and stood gazing at a moonstreak on the darkening water suddenly she smelled tobacco smoke and a white figure emerged as if created by the moon it was young mont in flannels standing in his boat she heard the tiny hiss of his cigarette extinguished in the water  fleur came his voice dont be hard on a poor devil ive been waiting hours  for what  come in my boat  not i  why not  im not a waternymph  havent you any romance in you dont be modern fleur  he appeared on the path within a yard of her  go away  fleur i love you fleur  fleur uttered a short laugh  come again she said when i havent got my wish  what is your wish  ask another  fleur said mont and his voice sounded strange dont mock me even vivisected dogs are worth decent treatment before theyre cut up for good  fleur shook her head but her lips were trembling  well you shouldnt make me jump give me a cigarette  mont gave her one lighted it and another for himself  i dont want to talk rot he said but please imagine all the rot that all the lovers that ever were have talked and all my special rot thrown in  thank you i have imagined it goodnight  they stood for a moment facing each other in the shadow of an acaciatree with very moonlit blossoms and the smoke from their cigarettes mingled in the air between them  also ran michael mont he said fleur turned abruptly towards the house on the lawn she stopped to look back michael mont was whirling his arms above him she could see them dashing at his head then waving at the moonlit blossoms of the acacia his voice just reached her jollyjolly fleur shook herself she couldnt help him she had too much trouble of her own on the verandah she stopped very suddenly again her mother was sitting in the drawingroom at her writing bureau quite alone there was nothing remarkable in the expression of her face except its utter immobility but she looked desolate fleur went upstairs at the door of her room she paused she could hear her father walking up and down up and down the picturegallery  yes she thought jolly oh jon     x  decision   when fleur left him jon stared at the austrian she was a thin woman with a dark face and the concerned expression of one who has watched every little good that life once had slip from her one by one  no tea she said  susceptible to the disappointment in her voice jon murmured  no really thanks  a lil cupit ready a lil cup and cigarette  fleur was gone hours of remorse and indecision lay before him and with a heavy sense of disproportion he smiled and said  wellthank you  she brought in a little pot of tea with two cups and a silver box of cigarettes on a little tray  sugar miss forsyte has much sugarshe buy my sugar my friends sugar also miss forsyte is a veree kind lady i am happy to serve her you her brother  yes said jon beginning to puff the second cigarette of his life  very young brother said the austrian with a little anxious smile which reminded him of the wag of a dogs tail  may i give you some he said and wont you sit down  the austrian shook her head  your father a very nice manthe most nice old man i ever see miss forsyte tell me all about him is he better  her words fell on jon like a reproach oh i think hes all right  i like to see him again said the austrian putting a hand on her heart he have veree kind heart  yes said jon and again her words seemed to him a reproach  he never give no trouble to no one and smile so gentle  yes doesnt he  he look at miss forsyte so funny sometimes i tell him all my story he so sympatisch your mothershe nice and well  very  he have her photograph on his dressingtable veree beautiful  jon gulped down his tea this woman with her concerned face and her reminding words was like the first and second murderers  thank you he said i must go now maymay i leave this with you  he put a tenshilling note on the tray with a doubting hand and gained the door he heard the austrian gasp and hurried out he had just time to catch his train and all the way to victoria looked at every face that passed as lovers will hoping against hope on reaching worthing he put his luggage into the local train and set out across the downs for wansdon trying to walk off his aching irresolution so long as he went full bat he could enjoy the beauty of those green slopes stopping now and again to sprawl on the grass admire the perfection of a wild rose or listen to a larks song but the war of motives within him was but postponedthe longing for fleur and the hatred of deception he came to the old chalkpit above wansdon with his mind no more made up than when he started to see both sides of a question vigorously was at once jons strength and weakness he tramped in just as the first dinnerbell rang his things had already been brought up he had a hurried bath and came down to find holly aloneval had gone to town and would not be back till the last train  since vals advice to him to ask his sister what was the matter between the two families so much had happenedfleurs disclosure in the green park her visit to robin hill todays meetingthat there seemed nothing to ask he talked of spain his sunstroke vals horses their fathers health holly startled him by saying that she thought their father not at all well she had been twice to robin hill for the weekend he had seemed fearfully languid sometimes even in pain but had always refused to talk about himself  hes awfully dear and unselfishdont you think jon  feeling far from dear and unselfish himself jon answered rather  i think hes been a simply perfect father so long as i can remember  yes answered jon very subdued  hes never interfered and hes always seemed to understand ive not forgotten how he let me go out to south africa in the boer war when i was in love with val  that was before he married mother wasnt it said jon suddenly  yes why  oh nothing only wasnt she engaged to fleurs father first  holly put down the spoon she was using and raised her eyes her stare was circumspect what did the boy know enough to make it better to tell him she could not decide he looked strained and worried altogether older but that might be the sunstroke  there was something she said of course we were out there and got no news of anything she could not take the risk it was not her secret besides she was in the dark about his feelings now before spain she had made sure he was in love but boys were boys that was seven weeks ago and all spain between  she saw that he knew she was putting him off and added  have you heard anything of fleur  yes  his face told her more than the most elaborate explanations he had not forgotten  she said very quietly fleur is awfully attractive jon but you knowval and i dont really like her very much  why  we think shes got rather a having nature  having i dont know what you mean sheshe he pushed his dessert plate away got up and went to the window  holly too got up and put her arm round his waist  dont be angry jon dear we cant all see people in the same light can we i believe each of us only has about one or two people who can see the best thats in us and bring it out for you i think its your mother i once saw her looking at a letter of yours it was wonderful to see her face i think shes the most beautiful woman i ever sawage doesnt seem to touch her  jons face softened then again became tense he recognised the intention of those words everybody was against him and fleur it all strengthened her appeal  make sure of memarry me jon  here where he had passed that wonderful week with herthe tug of her enchantment the ache in his heart increased with every minute that she was not there to make the room the garden the very air magical would he ever be able to live down here not seeing her and he closed up utterly going early to bed it would not make him healthy wealthy and wise but it closeted him with memory of fleur in her fancy frock he heard vals arrivalthe ford discharging cargo then the stillness of the summer night stole backwith only the bleating of very distant sheep and a nightjars harsh purring he leaned far out cold moonwarm airthe downs like silver small wings a stream bubbling the rambler roses godhow empty all of it without her in the bible it was written thou shalt leave father and mother and cleave tofleur  let him have pluck and go and tell them they couldnt stop him marrying herthey wouldnt want to stop him when they knew how he felt yes he would go bold and openfleur was wrong  the nightjar ceased the sheep were silent the only sound in the darkness was the bubbling of the stream and jon in his bed slept freed from the worst of lifes evilsindecision     xi  timothy prophesies   on the day of the cancelled meeting at the national gallery began the second anniversary of the resurrection of englands pride and gloryor more shortly the top hat lordsthat festival which the war had driven from the fieldraised its light and dark blue flags for the second time displaying almost every feature of a glorious past here in the luncheon interval were all species of female and one species of male hat protecting the multiple types of face associated with the classes the observing forsyte might discern in the free or unconsidered seats a certain number of the squashhatted but they hardly ventured on the grass the old schoolor schoolscould still rejoice that the proletariat was not yet paying the necessary halfcrown here was still a close borough the only one left on a large scalefor the papers were about to estimate the attendance at ten thousand and the ten thousand all animated by one hope were asking each other one question where are you lunching something wonderfully uplifting and reassuring in that query and the sight of so many people like themselves voicing it what reserve power in the british realmenough pigeons lobsters lamb salmon mayonnaise strawberries and bottles of champagne to feed the lot no miracle in prospectno case of seven loaves and a few fishesfaith rested on surer foundations six thousand top hats four thousand parasols would be doffed and furled ten thousand mouths all speaking the same english would be filled there was life in the old dog yet tradition and again tradition how strong and how elastic wars might rage taxation prey trades unions take toll and europe perish of starvation but the ten thousand would be fed and within their ring fence stroll upon green turf wear their top hats and meetthemselves the heart was sound the pulse still regular eton eton harrooow  among the many forsytes present on a huntingground theirs by personal prescriptive right or proxy was soames with his wife and daughter he had not been at either school he took no interest in cricket but he wanted fleur to show her frock and he wanted to wear his top hatparade it again in peace and plenty among his peers he walked sedately with fleur between him and annette no women equalled them so far as he could see they could walk and hold themselves up there was substance in their good looks the modern woman had no build no chest no anything he remembered suddenly with what intoxication of pride he had walked round with irene in the first years of his first marriage and how they used to lunch on the drag which his mother would make his father have because it was so chicall drags and carriages in those days not these lumbering great stands and how consistently montague dartie had drunk too much he supposed that people drank too much still but there was not the scope for it there used to be he remembered george forsytewhose brothers roger and eustace had been at harrow and etontowering up on the top of the drag waving a lightblue flag with one hand and a darkblue flag with the other and shouting etroowharrton just when everybody was silent like the buffoon he had always been and eustace got up to the nines below too dandified to wear any colour or take any notice hm old days and irene in grey silk shot with palest green he looked sideways at fleurs face rather colourlessno light no eagerness that love affair was preying on hera bad business he looked beyond at his wifes face rather more touched up than usual a little disdainfulnot that she had any business to disdain so far as he could see she was taking profonds defection with curious quietude or was his small voyage just a blind if so he should refuse to see it after promenading round the pitch and in front of the pavilion they sought winifreds table in the bedouin club tent this cluba new cock and henhad been founded in the interests of travel and of a gentleman with an old scottish name whose father had somewhat strangely been called levi winifred had joined not because she had travelled but because instinct told her that a club with such a name and such a founder was bound to go far if one didnt join at once one might never have the chance its tent with a text from the koran on an orange ground and a small green camel embroidered over the entrance was the most striking on the ground outside it they found jack cardigan in a darkblue tie he had once played for harrow batting with a malacca cane to show how that fellow ought to have hit that ball he piloted them in assembled in winifreds corner were imogen benedict with his young wife val dartie without holly maud and her husband and after soames and his two were seated one empty place  im expecting prosper said winifred but hes so busy with his yacht  soames stole a glance no movement in his wifes face whether that fellow were coming or not she evidently knew all about it it did not escape him that fleur too looked at her mother if annette didnt respect his feelings she might think of fleur the conversation very desultory was syncopated by jack cardigan talking about midoff he cited all the great midoffs from the beginning of time as if they had been a definite racial entity in the composition of the british people soames had finished his lobster and was beginning on pigeonpie when he heard the words im a small bit late mrs dartie and saw that there was no longer any empty place that fellow was sitting between annette and imogen soames ate steadily on with an occasional word to maud and winifred conversation buzzed around him he heard the voice of profond say  i think youre mistaken mrs forsyde illill bet miss forsyde agrees with me  in what came fleurs clear tones across the table  i was sayin young gurls are much the same as they always weretheres very small difference  do you know so much about them  that sharp reply caught the ears of all and soames moved uneasily on his thin green chair  well i dont know i think they want their own small way and i think they always did  indeed  oh butprosper winifred interjected comfortably the girls in the streetsthe girls whove been in munitions the little flappers in the shops their manners now really quite hit you in the eye  at the word hit jack cardigan stopped his disquisition and in the silence monsieur profond said  it was inside before now its outside thats all  but their morals cried imogen  just as moral as they ever were mrs cardigan but theyve got more opportunity  the saying so cryptically cynical received a little laugh from imogen a slight opening of jack cardigans mouth and another creak from soames chair  winifred said thats too bad prosper  what do you say mrs forsyde dont you think human natures always the same  soames subdued a sudden longing to get up and kick the fellow he heard his wife reply  human nature is not the same in england as anywhere else that was her confounded mockery  well i dont know much about this small countryno thank god thought soamesbut i should say the pot was boilin under the lid everywhere we all want pleasure and we always did  damn the fellow his cynicism was outrageous  when lunch was over they broke up into couples for the digestive promenade too proud to notice soames knew perfectly that annette and that fellow had gone prowling round together fleur was with val she had chosen him no doubt because he knew that boy he himself had winifred for partner they walked in the bright circling stream a little flushed and sated till winifred sighed  i wish we were back forty years old boy  before the eyes of her spirit an interminable procession of her own lords frocks was passing paid for with the money of her father to save a recurrent crisis its been very amusing after all sometimes i even wish monty was back what do you think of people nowadays soames  precious little style the thing began to go to pieces with bicycles and motorcars the war has finished it  i wonder whats coming said winifred in a voice dreamy from pigeonpie im not at all sure we shant go back to crinolines and pegtops look at that dress soames shook his head  theres money but no faith in things we dont lay by for the future these youngstersits all a short life and a merry one with them  theres a hat said winifred i dont knowwhen you come to think of the people killed and all that in the war its rather wonderful i think theres no other countryprosper says the rest are all bankrupt except america and of course her men always took their style in dress from us  is that chap said soames really going to the south seas  oh one never knows where prospers going  hes a sign of the times muttered soames if you like  winifreds hand gripped his arm  dont turn your head she said in a low voice but look to your right in the front row of the stand  soames looked as best he could under that limitation a man in a grey top hat greybearded with thin brown folded cheeks and a certain elegance of posture sat there with a woman in a lawncoloured frock whose dark eyes were fixed on himself soames looked quickly at his feet how funnily feet moved one after the other like that winifreds voice said in his ear  jolyon looks very ill but he always had style she doesnt changeexcept her hair  why did you tell fleur about that business  i didnt she picked it up i always knew she would  well its a mess shes set her heart upon their boy  the little wretch murmured winifred she tried to take me in about that what shall you do soames  be guided by events  they moved on silent in the almost solid crowd  really said winifred suddenly it almost seems like fate only thats so oldfashioned look there are george and eustace  george forsytes lofty bulk had halted before them  hallo soames he said just met profond and your wife youll catch em if you put on steam did you ever go to see old timothy  soames nodded and the streams forced them apart  i always liked old george said winifred hes so droll  i never did said soames wheres your seat i shall go to mine fleur may be back there  having seen winifred to her seat he regained his own conscious of small white distant figures running the click of the bat the cheers and countercheers no fleur and no annette you could expect nothing of women nowadays they had the vote they were emancipated and much good it was doing them so winifred would go back would she and put up with dartie all over again to have the past once moreto be sitting here as he had sat in 83 and 84 before he was certain that his marriage with irene had gone all wrong before her antagonism had become so glaring that with the best will in the world he could not overlook it the sight of her with that fellow had brought all memory back even now he could not understand why she had been so impracticable she could love other men she had it in her to himself the one person she ought to have loved she had chosen to refuse her heart it seemed to him fantastically as he looked back that all this modern relaxation of marriagethough its forms and laws were the same as when he married herthat all this modern looseness had come out of her revolt it seemed to him fantastically that she had started it till all decent ownership of anything had gone or was on the point of going all came from her and nowa pretty state of things homes how could you have them without mutual ownership not that he had ever had a real home but had that been his fault he had done his best and his rewardthose two sitting in that stand and this affair of fleurs  and overcome by loneliness he thought shant wait any longer they must find their own way back to the hotelif they mean to come hailing a cab outside the ground he said  drive me to the bayswater road his old aunts had never failed him to them he had meant an everwelcome visitor though they were gone there still was timothy  smither was standing in the open doorway  mr soames i was just taking the air cook will be so pleased  how is mr timothy  not himself at all these last few days sir hes been talking a great deal only this morning he was saying my brother james hes getting old his mind wanders mr soames and then he will talk of them he troubles about their investments the other day he said theres my brother jolyon wont look at consolshe seemed quite down about it come in mr soames come in its such a pleasant change  well said soames just for a few minutes  no murmured smither in the hall where the air had the singular freshness of the outside day we havent been very satisfied with him not all this week hes always been one to leave a titbit to the end but ever since monday hes been eating it first if you notice a dog mr soames at its dinner it eats the meat first weve always thought it such a good sign of mr timothy at his age to leave it to the last but now he seems to have lost all his selfcontrol and of course it makes him leave the rest the doctor doesnt make anything of it butsmither shook her headhe seems to think hes got to eat it first in case he shouldnt get to it that and his talking makes us anxious  has he said anything important  i shouldnt like to say that mr soames but hes turned against his will he gets quite pettishand after having had it out every morning for years it does seem funny he said the other day they want my money it gave me such a turn because as i said to him nobody wants his money im sure and it does seem a pity he should be thinking about money at his time of life i took my courage in my ands you know mr timothy i said my dear mistressthats miss forsyte mr soames miss ann that trained meshe never thought about money i said it was all character with her he looked at me i cant tell you how funny and he said quite dry nobody wants my character think of his saying a thing like that but sometimes hell say something as sharp and sensible as anything  soames who had been staring at an old print by the hatrack thinking thats got value murmured ill go up and see him smither  cooks with him answered smither above her corsets she will be pleased to see you  he mounted slowly with the thought shant care to live to be that age  on the second floor he paused and tapped the door was opened and he saw the round homely face of a woman about sixty  mr soames she said why mr soames  soames nodded all right cook and entered  timothy was propped up in bed with his hands joined before his chest and his eyes fixed on the ceiling where a fly was standing upside down soames stood at the foot of the bed facing him  uncle timothy he said raising his voice uncle timothy  timothys eyes left the fly and levelled themselves on his visitor soames could see his pale tongue passing over his darkish lips  uncle timothy he said again is there anything i can do for you is there anything youd like to say  ha said timothy  ive come to look you up and see that everythings all right  timothy nodded he seemed trying to get used to the apparition before him  have you got everything you want  no said timothy  can i get you anything  no said timothy  im soames you know your nephew soames forsyte your brother james son  timothy nodded  i shall be delighted to do anything i can for you  timothy beckoned soames went close to him  you said timothy in a voice which seemed to have outlived tone you tell them all from meyou tell them all and his finger tapped on soames arm to hold onhold onconsols are goin up and he nodded thrice  all right said soames i will  yes said timothy and fixing his eyes again on the ceiling he added that fly  strangely moved soames looked at the cooks pleasant fattish face all little puckers from staring at fires  thatll do him a world of good sir she said  a mutter came from timothy but he was clearly speaking to himself and soames went out with the cook  i wish i could make you a pink cream mr soames like in old days you did so relish them goodbye sir it has been a pleasure  take care of him cook he is old  and shaking her crumpled hand he went downstairs smither was still taking the air in the doorway  what do you think of him mr soames  hm soames murmured hes lost touch  yes said smither i was afraid youd think that coming fresh out of the world to see him like  smither said soames were all indebted to you  oh no mr soames dont say that its a pleasurehes such a wonderful man  well goodbye said soames and got into his taxi  going up he thought going up  reaching the hotel at knightsbridge he went to their sittingroom and rang for tea neither of them were in and again that sense of loneliness came over him these hotels what monstrous great places they were now he could remember when there was nothing bigger than longs or browns morleys or the tavistock and the heads that were shaken over the langham and the grand hotels and clubsclubs and hotels no end to them now and soames who had just been watching at lords a miracle of tradition and continuity fell into reverie over the changes in that london where he had been born fiveandsixty years before whether consols were going up or not london had become a terrific property no such property in the world unless it were new york there was a lot of hysteria in the papers nowadays but any one who like himself could remember london sixty years ago and see it now realised the fecundity and elasticity of wealth they had only to keep their heads and go at it steadily why he remembered cobblestones and stinking straw on the floor of your cab and old timothywhat could he not tell them if he had kept his memory things were unsettled people in a funk or in a hurry but here were london and the thames and out there the british empire and the ends of the earth consols are goin up he shouldnt be a bit surprised it was the breed that counted and all that was bulldogged in soames stared for a moment out of his grey eyes till diverted by the print of a victorian picture on the walls the hotel had bought three dozen of that little lot the old hunting or rakes progress prints in the old inns were worth looking atbut this sentimental stuffwell victorianism had gone tell them to hold on old timothy had said but to what were they to hold on in this modern welter of the democratic principle why even privacy was threatened and at the thought that privacy might perish soames pushed back his teacup and went to the window fancy owning no more of nature than the crowd out there owned of the flowers and trees and waters of hyde park no no private possession underlay everything worth having the world had slipped its sanity a bit as dogs now and again at full moon slipped theirs and went off for a nights rabbiting but the world like the dog knew where its bread was buttered and its bed warm and would come back sure enough to the only home worth havingto private ownership the world was in its second childhood for the moment like old timothyeating its titbit first  he heard a sound behind him and saw that his wife and daughter had come in  so youre back he said  fleur did not answer she stood for a moment looking at him and her mother then passed into her bedroom annette poured herself out a cup of tea  i am going to paris to my mother soames  oh to your mother  yes  for how long  i do not know  and when are you going  on monday  was she really going to her mother odd how indifferent he felt odd how clearly she had perceived the indifference he would feel so long as there was no scandal and suddenly between her and himself he saw distinctly the face he had seen that afternoonirenes  will you want money  thank you i have enough  very well let us know when you are coming back  annette put down the cake she was fingering and looking up through darkened lashes said  shall i give maman any message  my regards  annette stretched herself her hands on her waist and said in french  what luck that you have never loved me soames then rising she too left the room soames was glad she had spoken it in frenchit seemed to require no dealing with again that other facepale darkeyed beautiful still and there stirred far down within him the ghost of warmth as from sparks lingering beneath a mound of flaky ash and fleur infatuated with her boy queer chance yet was there such a thing as chance a man went down a street a brick fell on his head ah that was chance no doubt but this inherited his girl had said sheshe was holding on     part iii   i  old jolyon walks   twofold impulse had made jolyon say to his wife at breakfast lets go up to lords  wantedsomething to abate the anxiety in which those two had lived during the sixty hours since jon had brought fleur down wantedtoo that which might assuage the pangs of memory in one who knew he might lose them any day  fiftyeight years ago jolyon had become an eton boy for old jolyons whim had been that he should be canonised at the greatest possible expense year after year he had gone to lords from stanhope gate with a father whose youth in the eighteentwenties had been passed without polish in the game of cricket old jolyon would speak quite openly of swipes full tosses half and threequarter balls and young jolyon with the guileless snobbery of youth had trembled lest his sire should be overheard only in this supreme matter of cricket he had been nervous for his fatherin crimean whiskers thenhad ever impressed him as the beau ideal though never canonised himself old jolyons natural fastidiousness and balance had saved him from the errors of the vulgar how delicious after howling in a top hat and a sweltering heat to go home with his father in a hansom cab bathe dress and forth to the disunion club to dine off whitebait cutlets and a tart and gotwo swells old and young in lavender kid glovesto the opera or play and on sunday when the match was over and his top hat duly broken down with his father in a special hansom to the crown and sceptre and the terrace above the riverthe golden sixties when the world was simple dandies glamorous democracy not born and the books of whyte melville coming thick and fast  a generation later with his own boy jolly harrowbuttonholed with cornflowersby old jolyons whim his grandson had been canonised at a trifle less expenseagain jolyon had experienced the heat and counterpassions of the day and come back to the cool and the strawberry beds of robin hill and billiards after dinner his boy making the most heartbreaking flukes and trying to seem languid and grownup those two days each year he and his son had been alone together in the world one on each sideand democracy just born  and so he had unearthed a grey top hat borrowed a tiny bit of lightblue ribbon from irene and gingerly keeping cool by car and train and taxi had reached lords ground there beside her in a lawncoloured frock with narrow black edges he had watched the game and felt the old thrill stir within him  when soames passed the day was spoiled and irenes face distorted by compression of the lips no good to go on sitting here with soames or perhaps his daughter recurring in front of them like decimals and he said  well dear if youve had enoughlets go  that evening jolyon felt exhausted not wanting her to see him thus he waited till she had begun to play and stole off to the little study he opened the long window for air and the door that he might still hear her music drifting in and settled in his fathers old armchair closed his eyes with his head against the worn brown leather like that passage of the cesar franck sonataso had been his life with her a divine third movement and now this business of jonsthis bad business drifted to the edge of consciousness he hardly knew if it were in sleep that he smelled the scent of a cigar and seemed to see a shape in the blackness before his closed eyes that shape formed went and formed again as if in the very chair where he himself was sitting he saw his father blackcoated with knees crossed glasses balanced between thumb and finger saw the big white moustaches and the deep eyes looking up below a dome of forehead seeming to search his own seeming to speak are you facing it jo its for you to decide shes only a woman how well he knew his father in that phrase how all the victorian age came up with itand his answer no ive funked itfunked hurting her and jon and myself ive got a heart ive funked it but the old eyes so much older so much younger than his own kept at it its your wife your son your past tackle it my boy was it a message from walking spirit or but the instinct of his sire living on within him and again came that scent of cigar smokefrom the old saturated leather well he would tackle it write to jon and put the whole thing down in black and white and suddenly he breathed with difficulty with a sense of suffocation as if his heart were swollen he got up and went out into the air orions belt was very bright he passed along the terrace round the corner of the house till through the window of the musicroom he could see irene at the piano with lamplight falling on her powdery hair withdrawn into herself she seemed her dark eyes staring straight before her her hands idle jolyon saw her raise those hands and clasp them over her breast its jon with her he thought all jon im dying out of herits natural  and careful not to be seen he stole back  next day after a bad night he sat down to his task he wrote with difficulty and many erasures   my dearest boy  you are old enough to understand how very difficult it is for elders to give themselves away to their young especially whenlike your mother and myself though i shall never think of her as anything but youngtheir hearts are altogether set on him to whom they must confess i cannot say we are conscious of having sinned exactlypeople in real life very seldom are i believe but most persons would say we had and at all events our conduct righteous or not has found us out the truth is my dear we both have pasts which it is now my task to make known to you because they so grievously and deeply affect your future many very many years ago as far back indeed as 1883 when she was only twenty your mother had the great and lasting misfortune to make an unhappy marriageno not with me jon without money of her own and with only a stepmotherclosely related to jezebelshe was very unhappy in her home life it was fleurs father that she married my cousin soames forsyte he had pursued her very tenaciously and to do him justice was deeply in love with her within a week she knew the fearful mistake she had made it was not his fault it was her error of judgmenther misfortune   so far jolyon had kept some semblance of irony but now his subject carried him away   jon i want to explain to you if i canand its very hardhow it is that an unhappy marriage such as this can so easily come about you will of course say if she didnt really love him how could she ever have married him you would be quite right if it were not for one or two rather terrible considerations from this initial mistake of hers all the subsequent trouble sorrow and tragedy have come and so i must make it clear to you if i can you see jon in those days and even to this dayindeed i dont see for all the talk of enlightenment how it can well be otherwisemost girls are married ignorant of the sexual side of life even if they know what it means they have not experienced it thats the crux it is this actual lack of experience whatever verbal knowledge they have which makes all the difference and all the trouble in a vast number of marriagesand your mothers was onegirls are not and cannot be certain whether they love the man they marry or not they do not know until after that act of union which makes the reality of marriage now in many perhaps in most doubtful cases this act cements and strengthens the attachment but in other cases and your mothers was one it is a revelation of mistake a destruction of such attraction as there was there is nothing more tragic in a womans life than such a revelation growing daily nightly clearer coarsegrained and unthinking people are apt to laugh at such a mistake and say what a fuss about nothing narrow and selfrighteous people only capable of judging the lives of others by their own are apt to condemn those who make this tragic error to condemn them for life to the dungeons they have made for themselves you know the expression she has made her bed she must lie on it it is a hardmouthed saying quite unworthy of a gentleman or lady in the best sense of those words and i can use no stronger condemnation i have not been what is called a moral man but i wish to use no words to you my dear which will make you think lightly of ties or contracts into which you enter heaven forbid but with the experience of a life behind me i do say that those who condemn the victims of these tragic mistakes condemn them and hold out no hands to help them are inhuman or rather they would be if they had the understanding to know what they are doing but they havent let them go they are as much anathema to me as i no doubt am to them i have had to say all this because i am going to put you into a position to judge your mother and you are very young without experience of what life is to go on with the story after three years of effort to subdue her shrinkingi was going to say her loathing and its not too strong a word for shrinking soon becomes loathing under such circumstancesthree years of what to a sensitive beautyloving nature like your mothers jon was torment she met a young man who fell in love with her he was the architect of this very house that we live in now he was building it for her and fleurs father to live in a new prison to hold her in place of the one she inhabited with him in london perhaps that fact played some part in what came of it but in any case she too fell in love with him i know its not necessary to explain to you that one does not precisely choose with whom one will fall in love it comes very well it came i can imaginethough she never said much to me about itthe struggle that then took place in her because jon she was brought up strictly and was not light in her ideasnot at all however this was an overwhelming feeling and it came to pass that they loved in deed as well as in thought then came a fearful tragedy i must tell you of it because if i dont you will never understand the real situation that you have now to face the man whom she had marriedsoames forsyte the father of fleurone night at the height of her passion for this young man forcibly reasserted his rights over her the next day she met her lover and told him of it whether he committed suicide or whether he was accidentally run over in his distraction we never knew but so it was think of your mother as she was that evening when she heard of his death i happened to see her your grandfather sent me to help her if i could i only just saw her before the door was shut against me by her husband but i have never forgotten her face i can see it now i was not in love with her then nor for twelve years after but i have never forgotten my dear boyit is not easy to write like this but you see i must your mother is wrapped up in you utterly devotedly i dont wish to write harshly of soames forsyte i dont think harshly of him i have long been sorry for him perhaps i was sorry even then as the world judges she was in error he was within his rights he loved herin his way she was his property that is the view he holds of lifeof human feelings and heartsproperty its not his faultso was he born to me it is a view that has always been abhorrentso was i born knowing you as i do i feel it cannot be otherwise than abhorrent to you let me go on with the story your mother fled from his house that night for twelve years she lived quietly alone without companionship of any sort until in 1899 her husbandyou see he was still her husband for he did not attempt to divorce her and she of course had no right to divorce him became conscious it seems of the want of children and commenced a long attempt to induce her to go back to him and give him a child i was her trustee then under your grandfathers will and i watched this going on while watching i became devotedly attached to her his pressure increased till one day she came to me here and practically put herself under my protection her husband who was kept informed of all her movements attempted to force us apart by bringing a divorce suit or at all events by threatening one anyway our names were publicly joined that decided us and we became united in fact she was divorced married me and you were born we have lived in perfect happiness at least i have and i believe your mother also soames soon after the divorce married fleurs mother and she was born that is the story jon i have told it you because by the affection which we see you have formed for this mans daughter you are blindly moving towards what must utterly destroy your mothers happiness if not your own i dont wish to speak of myself because at my age theres no use supposing i shall cumber the ground much longer besides what i should suffer would be mainly on her account and on yours but what i want you to realise is that feelings of horror and aversion such as those can never be buried or forgotten they are alive in her today only yesterday at lords we happened to see soames forsyte her face if you had seen it would have convinced you the idea that you should marry his daughter is a nightmare to her jon i have nothing to say against fleur save that she is his daughter but your children if you married her would be the grandchildren of soames as much as of your mother of a man who once owned your mother as a man might own a slave think what that would mean by such a marriage you enter the camp which held your mother prisoner and wherein she ate her heart out you are just on the threshold of life you have only known this girl two months and however deeply you think you love her i appeal to you to break it off at once dont give your mother this rankling pain and humiliation during the rest of her life young though she will always seem to me she is fiftyseven except for us two she has no one in the world she will soon have only you pluck up your spirit jon and break away dont put this cloud and barrier between you dont break her heart bless you my dear boy and again forgive me for all the pain this letter must bring youwe tried to spare it you but spainit seemswas no good  ever your devoted father  jolyon forsyte   having finished his confession jolyon sat with a thin cheek on his hand rereading there were things in it which hurt him so much when he thought of jon reading themthat he nearly tore the letter up to speak of such things at all to a boyhis own boyto speak of them in relation to his own wife and the boys own mother seemed dreadful to the reticence of his forsyte soul and yet without speaking of them how make jon understand the reality the deep cleavage the ineffaceable scar without them how justify this stifling of the boys love he might just as well not write at all  he folded the confession and put it in his pocket it wasthank heavensaturday he had till sunday evening to think it over for even if posted now it could not reach jon till monday he felt a curious relief at this delay and at the fact that whether sent or not it was written  in the rose garden which had taken the place of the old fernery he could see irene snipping and pruning with a little basket on her arm she was never idle it seemed to him and he envied her now that he himself was idle nearly all his time he went down to her she held up a stained glove and smiled a piece of lace tied under her chin concealed her hair and her oval face with its still dark brows looked very young  the green fly are awful this year and yet its cold you look tired jolyon  jolyon took the confession from his pocket ive been writing this i think you ought to see it  to jon her whole face had changed in that instant becoming almost haggard  yes the murders out  he gave it her and walked away among the roses presently seeing that she had finished reading and was standing quite still with the sheets of the letter against her skirt he came back to her  well  its wonderfully put i dont see how it could be put better thank you dear  is there anything you would like left out  she shook her head  no he must know all if hes to understand  thats what i thought but i hate it like the devil  he had the feeling that he hated it more than sheto him sex was so much easier to mention between man and woman than between man and man and she had always been more natural and frank not deeply secretive like his forsyte self  i wonder if he will understand even now jolyon hes so young and he shrinks from the physical  he gets that shrinking from my father he was as fastidious as a girl in all such matters would it be better to rewrite the whole thing and just say you hated soames  irene shook her head  hates only a word it conveys nothing no better as it is  very well it shall go tomorrow     ii  confession   late that same afternoon jolyon had a nap in the old armchair face down on his knee was la rotisserie de la reine pedaugue and just before he fell asleep he had been thinking as a people shall we ever really like the french will they ever really like us he himself had always liked the french feeling at home with their wit their taste their cooking irene and he had paid many visits to france before the war when jon had been at his private school his romance with her had begun in parishis last and most enduring romance but the frenchno englishman could like them who could not see them in some sort with the detached aesthetic eye and with that melancholy conclusion he had nodded off  when he woke he saw jon standing between him and the window the boy had evidently come in from the garden and was waiting for him to wake jolyon smiled still half asleep how nice the chap lookedsensitive affectionate straight then his heart gave a nasty jump and a quaking sensation overcame him that confession he controlled himself with an effort why jon where did you spring from  jon bent over and kissed his forehead  only then he noticed the look on the boys face  i came home to tell you something dad  with all his might jolyon tried to get the better of the jumping gurgling sensations within his chest  well sit down old man have you seen your mother  no the boys flushed look gave place to pallor he sat down on the arm of the old chair as in old days jolyon himself used to sit beside his own father installed in its recesses right up to the time of the rupture in their relations he had been wont to perch therehad he now reached such a moment with his own son all his life he had hated scenes like poison avoided rows gone on his own way quietly and let others go on theirs but nowit seemedat the very end of things he had a scene before him more painful than any he had avoided he drew a visor down over his emotion and waited for his son to speak  father said jon slowly fleur and i are engaged  exactly thought jolyon breathing with difficulty  i know that you and mother dont like the idea fleur says that mother was engaged to her father before you married her of course i dont know what happened but it must be ages ago im devoted to her dad and she says she is to me  jolyon uttered a queer sound half laugh half groan  you are nineteen jon and i am seventytwo how are we to understand each other in a matter like this eh  you love mother dad you must know what we feel it isnt fair to us to let old things spoil our happiness is it  brought face to face with his confession jolyon resolved to do without it if by any means he could he laid his hand on the boys arm  look jon i might put you off with talk about your both being too young and not knowing your own minds and all that but you wouldnt listen besides it doesnt meet the caseyouth unfortunately cures itself you talk lightly about old things like that knowing nothingas you say trulyof what happened now have i ever given you reason to doubt my love for you or my word  at a less anxious moment he might have been amused by the conflict his words arousedthe boys eager clasp to reassure him on these points the dread on his face of what that reassurance would bring forth but he could only feel grateful for the squeeze  very well you can believe what i tell you if you dont give up this love affair you will make mother wretched to the end of her days believe me my dear the past whatever it was cant be buriedit cant indeed  jon got off the arm of the chair  the girl thought jolyonthere she goesstarting up before himlife itselfeager pretty loving  i cant father how can ijust because you say that of course i cant  jon if you knew the story you would give this up without hesitation you would have to cant you believe me  how can you tell what i should think why i love her better than anything in the world  jolyons face twitched and he said with painful slowness  better than your mother jon  from the boys face and his clenched fists jolyon realised the stress and struggle he was going through  i dont know he burst out i dont know but to give fleur up for nothingfor something i dont understand for something that i dont believe can really matter half so much will make memake me  make you feel us unjust put a barrieryes but thats better than going on with this  i cant fleur loves me and i love her you want me to trust you why dont you trust me father we wouldnt want to know anythingwe wouldnt let it make any difference itll only make us both love you and mother all the more  jolyon put his hand into his breast pocket but brought it out again empty and sat clucking his tongue against his teeth  think what your mothers been to you jon she has nothing but you i shant last much longer  why not it isnt fair towhy not  well said jolyon rather coldly because the doctors tell me i shant thats all  oh dad cried jon and burst into tears  this downbreak of his son whom he had not seen cry since he was ten moved jolyon terribly he recognised to the full how fearfully soft the boys heart was how much he would suffer in this business and in life generally and he reached out his hand helplesslynot wishing indeed not daring to get up  dear man he said dontor youll make me  jon smothered down his paroxysm and stood with face averted very still  what now thought jolyon what can i say to move him  by the way dont speak of that to mother he said she has enough to scare her with this affair of yours i know how you feel but jon you know her and me well enough to be sure we wouldnt wish to spoil your happiness lightly why my dear boy we dont care for anything but your happinessat least with me its just yours and mothers and with her just yours its all the future for you both thats at stake  jon turned his face was deadly pale his eyes deep in his head seemed to burn  what is it what is it dont keep me like this  jolyon who knew that he was beaten thrust his hand again into his breast pocket and sat for a full minute breathing with difficulty his eyes closed the thought passed through his mind ive had a good long inningssome pretty bitter momentsthis is the worst then he brought his hand out with the letter and said with a sort of fatigue well jon if you hadnt come today i was going to send you this i wanted to spare youi wanted to spare your mother and myself but i see its no good read it and i think ill go into the garden he reached forward to get up  jon who had taken the letter said quickly no ill go and was gone  jolyon sank back in his chair a bluebottle chose that moment to come buzzing round him with a sort of fury the sound was homely better than nothing where had the boy gone to read his letter the wretched letterthe wretched story a cruel businesscruel to herto soamesto those two childrento himself his heart thumped and pained him lifeits lovesits workits beautyits aching andits end a good time a fine time in spite of all untilyou regretted that you had ever been born lifeit wore you down yet did not make you want to diethat was the cunning evil mistake to have a heart again the bluebottle came buzzingbringing in all the heat and hum and scent of summeryes even the scentas of ripe fruits dried grasses sappy shrubs and the vanilla breath of cows and out there somewhere in the fragrance jon would be reading that letter turning and twisting its pages in his trouble his bewilderment and troublebreaking his heart about it the thought made jolyon acutely miserable jon was such a tenderhearted chap affectionate to his bones and conscientious tooit was so damned unfair he remembered irene saying to him once never was any one born more loving and lovable than jon poor little jon his world gone up the spout all of a summer afternoon youth took things so hard and stirred tormented by that vision of youth taking things hard jolyon got out of his chair and went to the window the boy was nowhere visible and he passed out if one could take any help to him nowone must  he traversed the shrubbery glanced into the walled gardenno jon nor where the peaches and the apricots were beginning to swell and colour he passed the cupressustrees dark and spiral into the meadow where had the boy got to had he rushed down to the coppicehis old huntingground jolyon crossed the rows of hay they would cock it on monday and be carrying the day after if rain held off often they had crossed this field togetherhand in hand when jon was a little chap dash it the golden age was over by the time one was ten he came to the pond where flies and gnats were dancing over a bright reedy surface and on into the coppice it was cool there fragrant of larches still no jon he called no answer on the log seat he sat down nervous anxious forgetting his own physical sensations he had been wrong to let the boy get away with that letter he ought to have kept him under his eye from the start greatly troubled he got up to retrace his steps at the farmbuildings he called again and looked into the dark cowhouse there in the cool and the scent of vanilla and ammonia away from flies the three alderneys were chewing the quiet cud just milked waiting for evening to be turned out again into the lower field one turned a lazy head a lustrous eye jolyon could see the slobber on its grey lower lip he saw everything with passionate clearness in the agitation of his nervesall that in his time he had adored and tried to paintwonder of light and shade and colour no wonder the legend put christ into a mangerwhat more devotional than the eyes and moonwhite horns of a chewing cow in the warm dusk he called again no answer and he hurried away out of the coppice past the pond up the hill oddly ironicalnow he came to think of itif jon had taken the gruel of his discovery down in the coppice where his mother and bosinney in those old days had made the plunge of acknowledging their love where he himself on the log seat the sunday morning he came back from paris had realised to the full that irene had become the world to him that would have been the place for irony to tear the veil from before the eyes of irenes boy but he was not here where had he got to one must find the poor chap  a gleam of sun had come sharpening to his hurrying senses all the beauty of the afternoon of the tall trees and lengthening shadows of the blue and the white clouds the scent of the hay and the cooing of the pigeons and the flower shapes standing tall he came to the rosary and the beauty of the roses in that sudden sunlight seemed to him unearthly rose you spaniard wonderful three words there she had stood by that bush of dark red roses had stood to read and decide that jon must know it all he knew all now had she chosen wrong he bent and sniffed a rose its petals brushed his nose and trembling lips nothing so soft as a roseleafs velvet except her neckirene on across the lawn he went up the slope to the oaktree its top alone was glistening for the sudden sun was away over the house the lower shade was thick blessedly coolhe was greatly overheated he paused a minute with his hand on the rope of the swingjolly hollyjon the old swing and suddenly he felt horriblydeadly ill ive overdone it he thought by jove ive overdone itafter all he staggered up towards the terrace dragged himself up the steps and fell against the wall of the house he leaned there gasping his face buried in the honeysuckle that he and she had taken such trouble with that it might sweeten the air which drifted in its fragrance mingled with awful pain my love he thought the boy and with a great effort he tottered in through the long window and sank into old jolyons chair the book was there a pencil in it he caught it up scribbled a word on the open page his hand dropped so it was like thiswas it  there was a great wrench and darkness     iii  irene   when jon rushed away with the letter in his hand he ran along the terrace and round the corner of the house in fear and confusion leaning against the creepered wall he tore open the letter it was longvery long this added to his fear and he began reading when he came to the underlined words it was fleurs father that she married everything swam before him he was close to a window and entering by it he passed through musicroom and hall up to his bedroom dipping his face in cold water he sat on his bed and went on reading dropping each finished page on the bed beside him his fathers writing was easy to readhe knew it so well though he had never had a letter from him one quarter so long he read with a dull feelingimagination only half at work he best grasped on that first reading the pain his father must have had in writing such a letter he let the last sheet fall and in a sort of mental moral helplessness he began to read the first again it all seemed to him disgustingdead and disgusting then suddenly a hot wave of horrified emotion tingled through him he buried his face in his hands his mother fleurs father he took up the letter again and read on mechanically and again came the feeling that it was all dead and disgusting his own love so different this letter said his motherand her father an awful letter  property could there be men who looked on women as their property faces seen in street and countryside came thronging up before himred stockfish faces hard dull faces prim dry faces violent faces hundreds thousands of them how could he know what men who had such faces thought and did he held his head in his hands and groaned his mother he caught up the letter and read on again horror and aversionalive in her today  your children  grandchildren  of a man who once owned your mother as a man might own a slave he got up from his bed this cruel shadowy past lurking there to murder his love and fleurs was true or his father could never have written it why didnt they tell me the first thing he thought the day i first saw fleur they knew id seen her they were afraid andnowivegot it overcome by misery too acute for thought or reason he crept into a dusky corner of the room and sat down on the floor he sat there like some unhappy little animal there was comfort in dusk and in the flooras if he were back in those days when he played his battles sprawling all over it he sat there huddled his hair ruffled his hands clasped round his knees for how long he did not know he was wrenched from his blank wretchedness by the sound of the door opening from his mothers room the blinds were down over the windows of his room shut up in his absence and from where he sat he could only hear a rustle her footsteps crossing till beyond the bed he saw her standing before his dressingtable she had something in her hand he hardly breathed hoping she would not see him and go away he saw her touch things on the table as if they had some virtue in them then face the windowgrey from head to foot like a ghost the least turn of her head and she must see him her lips moved oh jon she was speaking to herself the tone of her voice troubled jons heart he saw in her hand a little photograph she held it towards the light looking at itvery small he knew itone of himself as a tiny boy which she always kept in her bag his heart beat fast and suddenly as if she had heard it she turned her eyes and saw him at the gasp she gave and the movement of her hands pressing the photograph against her breast he said  yes its me  she moved over to the bed and sat down on it quite close to him her hands still clasping her breast her feet among the sheets of the letter which had slipped to the floor she saw them and her hands grasped the edge of the bed she sat very upright her dark eyes fixed on him at last she spoke  well jon you know i see  yes  youve seen father  yes  there was a long silence till she said  oh my darling  its all right the emotions in him were so violent and so mixed that he dared not moveresentment despair and yet a strange yearning for the comfort of her hand on his forehead  what are you going to do  i dont know  there was another long silence then she got up she stood a moment very still made a little movement with her hand and said my darling boy my most darling boy dont think of methink of yourself and passing round the foot of the bed went back into her room  jon turnedcurled into a sort of ball as might a hedgehoginto the corner made by the two walls  he must have been twenty minutes there before a cry roused him it came from the terrace below he got up scared again came the cry jon his mother was calling he ran out and down the stairs through the empty diningroom into the study she was kneeling before the old armchair and his father was lying back quite white his head on his breast one of his hands resting on an open book with a pencil clutched in itmore strangely still than anything he had ever seen she looked round wildly and said  oh jonhes deadhes dead  jon flung himself down and reaching over the arm of the chair where he had lately been sitting put his lips to the forehead icy cold how couldhow could dad be dead when only an hour agohis mothers arms were round the knees pressing her breast against them whywhy wasnt i with him he heard her whisper then he saw the tottering word irene pencilled on the open page and broke down himself it was his first sight of human death and its unutterable stillness blotted from him all other emotion all else then was but preliminary to this all love and life and joy anxiety and sorrow all movement light and beauty but a beginning to this terrible white stillness it made a dreadful mark on him all seemed suddenly little futile short he mastered himself at last got up and raised her  mother dont crymother  some hours later when all was done that had to be and his mother was lying down he saw his father alone on the bed covered with a white sheet he stood for a long time gazing at that face which had never looked angryalways whimsical and kind to be kind and keep your end uptheres nothing else in it he had once heard his father say how wonderfully dad had acted up to that philosophy he understood now that his father had known for a long time past that this would come suddenlyknown and not said a word he gazed with an awed and passionate reverence the loneliness of itjust to spare his mother and himself his own trouble seemed small while he was looking at that face the word scribbled on the page the farewell word now his mother had no one but himself he went up close to the dead facenot changed at all and yet completely changed he had heard his father say once that he did not believe in consciousness surviving death or that if it did it might be just survival till the natural agelimit of the body had been reachedthe natural term of its inherent vitality so that if the body were broken by accident excess violent disease consciousness might still persist till in the course of nature uninterfered with it would naturally have faded out the whimsical conceit had struck him when the heart failed like thissurely it was not quite natural perhaps his fathers consciousness was in the room with him above the bed hung a picture of his fathers father perhaps his consciousness too was still alive and his brothershis halfbrother who had died in the transvaal were they all gathered round this bed jon kissed the forehead and stole back to his own room the door between it and his mothers was ajar she had evidently been ineverything was ready for him even some biscuits and hot milk and the letter no longer on the floor he ate and drank watching the last light fade he did not try to see into the futurejust stared at the dark branches of the oaktree level with his window and felt as if life had stopped once in the night turning in his heavy sleep he was conscious of something white and still beside his bed and started up his mothers voice said  its only i jon dear her hand pressed his forehead gently back her white figure disappeared  alone he fell heavily asleep again and dreamed he saw his mothers name crawling on his bed     iv  soames cogitates   the announcement in the times of his cousin jolyons death affected soames quite simply so that chap was gone there had never been a time in their two lives when love had not been lost between them that quickblooded sentiment hatred had run its course long since in soames heart and he had refused to allow any recrudescence but he considered this early decease a piece of poetic justice for twenty years the fellow had enjoyed the reversion of his wife and house andhe was dead the obituary notice which appeared a little later paid jolyonhe thoughttoo much attention it spoke of that diligent and agreeable painter whose work we have come to look on as typical of the best latevictorian watercolour art soames who had almost mechanically preferred mole morpin and caswell baye and had always sniffed quite audibly when he came to one of his cousins on the line turned the times with a crackle  he had to go up to town that morning on forsyte affairs and was fully conscious of gradmans glance sidelong over his spectacles the old clerk had about him an aura of regretful congratulation he smelled as it were of old days one could almost hear him thinking mr jolyon yeesjust my age and gonedear dear i dare say she feels it she was a naicelookin woman flesh is flesh theyve given im a notice in the papers fancy his atmosphere in fact caused soames to handle certain leases and conversions with exceptional swiftness  about that settlement on miss fleur mr soames  ive thought better of that answered soames shortly  aoh im glad of that i thought you were a little hasty the times do change  how this death would affect fleur had begun to trouble soames he was not certain that she knew of itshe seldom looked at the paper never at the births marriages and deaths  he pressed matters on and made his way to green street for lunch winifred was almost doleful jack cardigan had broken a splashboard so far as one could make out and would not be fit for some time she could not get used to the idea  did profond ever get off he said suddenly  he got off replied winifred but wherei dont know  yes there it wasimpossible to tell anything not that he wanted to know letters from annette were coming from dieppe where she and her mother were staying  you saw that fellows death i suppose  yes said winifred im sorry for his children he was very amiable  soames uttered a rather queer sound a suspicion of the old deep truththat men were judged in this world rather by what they were than by what they didcrept and knocked resentfully at the back door of his mind  i know there was a superstition to that effect he muttered  one must do him justice now hes dead  i should like to have done him justice before said soames but i never had the chance have you got a baronetage here  yes in that bottom row  soames took out a fat red book and ran over the leaves  montsir lawrence 9th bt cr 1620 es of geoffrey 8th bt and lavinia daur of sir charles muskham bt of muskham hall shrops marr 1890 emily daur of conway charwell esq of condaford grange co oxon 1 son heir michael conway b 1895 2 daurs residence lippinghall manor folwell bucks clubs snooks coffee house aeroplane see bidlicott  hm he said did you ever know a publisher  uncle timothy  alive i mean  monty knew one at his club he brought him here to dinner once monty was always thinking of writing a book you know about how to make money on the turf he tried to interest that man  well  he put him on to a horsefor the two thousand we didnt see him again he was rather smart if i remember  did it win  no it ran last i think you know monty really was quite clever in his way  was he said soames can you see any connection between a sucking baronet and publishing  people do all sorts of things nowadays replied winifred the great stunt seems not to be idleso different from our time to do nothing was the thing then but i suppose itll come again  this young mont that im speaking of is very sweet on fleur if it would put an end to that other affair i might encourage it  has he got style asked winifred  hes no beauty pleasant enough with some scattered brains theres a good deal of land i believe he seems genuinely attached but i dont know  no murmured winifred its very difficult i always found it best to do nothing it is such a bore about jack now we shant get away till after bank holiday well the people are always amusing i shall go into the park and watch them  if i were you said soames i should have a country cottage and be out of the way of holidays and strikes when you want  the country bores me answered winifred and i found the railway strike quite exciting  winifred had always been noted for sangfroid  soames took his leave all the way down to reading he debated whether he should tell fleur of that boys fathers death it did not alter the situation except that he would be independent now and only have his mothers opposition to encounter he would come into a lot of money no doubt and perhaps the housethe house built for irene and himselfthe house whose architect had wrought his domestic ruin his daughtermistress of that house that would be poetic justice soames uttered a little mirthless laugh he had designed that house to reestablish his failing union meant it for the seat of his descendants if he could have induced irene to give him one her son and fleur their children would be in some sort offspring of the union between himself and her  the theatricality in that thought was repulsive to his sober sense and yetit would be the easiest and wealthiest way out of the impasse now that jolyon was gone the juncture of two forsyte fortunes had a kind of conservative charm and sheirenewould be linked to him once more nonsense absurd he put the notion from his head  on reaching home he heard the click of billiardballs and through the window saw young mont sprawling over the table fleur with her cue akimbo was watching with a smile how pretty she looked no wonder that young fellow was out of his mind about her a titleland there was little enough in land these days perhaps less in a title the old forsytes had always had a kind of contempt for titles rather remote and artificial thingsnot worth the money they cost and having to do with the court they had all had that feeling in differing measuresoames remembered swithin indeed in his most expansive days had once attended a levee he had come away saying he shouldnt go againall that small fry it was suspected that he had looked too big in kneebreeches soames remembered how his own mother had wished to be presented because of the fashionable nature of the performance and how his father had put his foot down with unwonted decision what did she want with such peacockingwasting time and money there was nothing in it  the instinct which had made and kept the british commons the chief power in the state a feeling that their own world was good enough and a little better than any other because it was their world had kept the old forsytes singularly free of flummery as nicholas had been wont to call it when he had the gout soames generation more selfconscious and ironical had been saved by a sense of swithin in kneebreeches while the third and the fourth generation as it seemed to him laughed at everything  however there was no harm in the young fellows being heir to a title and estatea thing one couldnt help he entered quietly as mont missed his shot he noted the young mans eyes fixed on fleur bending over in her turn and the adoration in them almost touched him  she paused with the cue poised on the bridge of her slim hand and shook her crop of short dark chestnut hair  i shall never do it  nothing venture  all right the cue struck the ball rolled there  bad luck never mind  then they saw him and soames said ill mark for you  he sat down on the raised seat beneath the marker trim and tired furtively studying those two young faces when the game was over mont came up to him ive started in sir rum game business isnt it i suppose you saw a lot of human nature as a solicitor  i did  shall i tell you what ive noticed people are quite on the wrong track in offering less than they can afford to give they ought to offer more and work backward  soames raised his eyebrows suppose the more is accepted  that doesnt matter a little bit said mont its much more paying to abate a price than to increase it for instance say we offer an author good termshe naturally takes them then we go into it find we cant publish at a decent profit and tell him so hes got confidence in us because weve been generous to him and he comes down like a lamb and bears us no malice but if we offer him poor terms at the start he doesnt take them so we have to advance them to get him and he thinks us damned screws into the bargain  try buying pictures on that system said soames an offer accepted is a contracthavent you learned that  young mont turned his head to where fleur was standing in the window  no he said i wish i had then theres another thing always let a man off a bargain if he wants to be let off  as advertisement said soames dryly  of course it is but i meant on principle  does your firm work on those lines  not yet said mont but itll come  and they will go  no really sir im making any number of observations and they all confirm my theory human nature is consistently underrated in business people do themselves out of an awful lot of pleasure and profit by that of course you must be perfectly genuine and open but thats easy if you feel it the more human and generous you are the better chance youve got in business  soames rose  are you a partner  not for six months yet  the rest of the firm had better make haste and retire  mont laughed  youll see he said theres going to be a big change the possessive principle has got its shutters up  what said soames  the house is to let goodbye sir im off now  soames watched his daughter give her hand saw her wince at the squeeze it received and distinctly heard the young mans sigh as he passed out then she came from the window trailing her finger along the mahogany edge of the billiardtable watching her soames knew that she was going to ask him something her finger felt round the last pocket and she looked up  have you done anything to stop jon writing to me father  soames shook his head  you havent seen then he said his father died just a week ago today  oh  in her startled frowning face he saw the instant struggle to apprehend what this would mean  poor jon why didnt you tell me father  i never know said soames slowly you dont confide in me  i would if youd help me dear  perhaps i shall  fleur clasped her hands oh darlingwhen one wants a thing fearfully one doesnt think of other people dont be angry with me  soames put out his hand as if pushing away an aspersion  im cogitating he said what on earth had made him use a word like that has young mont been bothering you again  fleur smiled oh michael hes always bothering but hes such a good sorti dont mind him  well said soames im tired i shall go and have a nap before dinner  he went up to his picturegallery lay down on the couch there and closed his eyes a terrible responsibility this girl of hiswhose mother wasah what was she a terrible responsibility help herhow could he help her he could not alter the fact that he was her father or that irene what was it young mont had saidsome nonsense about the possessive instinctshutters upto let silly  the sultry air charged with a scent of meadowsweet of river and roses closed on his senses drowsing them     v  the fixed idea   the fixed idea which has outrun more constables than any other form of human disorder has never more speed and stamina than when it takes the avid guise of love to hedges and ditches and doors to humans without ideas fixed or otherwise to perambulators and the contents sucking their fixed ideas even to the other sufferers from this fast maladythe fixed idea of love pays no attention it runs with eyes turned inward to its own light oblivious of all other stars those with the fixed ideas that human happiness depends on their art on vivisecting dogs on hating foreigners on paying supertax on remaining ministers on making wheels go round on preventing their neighbours from being divorced on conscientious objection greek roots church dogma paradox and superiority to everybody else with other forms of egomaniaall are unstable compared with him or her whose fixed idea is the possession of some her or him and though fleur those chilly summer days pursued the scattered life of a little forsyte whose frocks are paid for and whose business is pleasure she wasas winifred would have said in the latest fashion of speechhonesttogod indifferent to it all she wished and wished for the moon which sailed in cold skies above the river or the green park when she went to town she even kept jons letters covered with pink silk on her heart than which in days when corsets were so low sentiment so despised and chests so out of fashion there could perhaps have been no greater proof of the fixity of her idea  after hearing of his fathers death she had written to jon and received his answer three days later on her return from a river picnic it was his first letter since their meeting at junes she opened it with misgiving and read it with dismay  since i saw you ive heard everything about the past i wont tell it youi think you knew when we met at junes she says you did if you did fleur you ought to have told me i expect you only heard your fathers side of it i have heard my mothers its dreadful now that shes so sad i cant do anything to hurt her more of course i long for you all day but i dont believe now that we shall ever come togethertheres something too strong pulling us apart  her deception had found her out but jonshe felthad forgiven that it was what he said of his mother which caused the fluttering in her heart and the weak sensation in her legs  her first impulse was to replyher second not to reply these impulses were constantly renewed in the days which followed while desperation grew within her she was not her fathers child for nothing the tenacity which had at once made and undone soames was her backbone too frilled and embroidered by french grace and quickness instinctively she conjugated the verb to have always with the pronoun i she concealed however all signs of her growing desperation and pursued such river pleasures as the winds and rain of a disagreeable july permitted as if she had no care in the world nor did any sucking baronet ever neglect the business of a publisher more consistently than her attendant spirit michael mont  to soames she was a puzzle he was almost deceived by this careless gaiety almostbecause he did not fail to mark her eyes often fixed on nothing and the film of light shining from her bedroom window late at night what was she thinking and brooding over into small hours when she ought to have been asleep but he dared not ask what was in her mind and since that one little talk in the billiardroom she said nothing to him  in this taciturn condition of affairs it chanced that winifred invited them to lunch and to go afterwards to a most amusing little play the beggars opera and would they bring a man to make four soames whose attitude towards theatres was to go to nothing accepted because fleurs attitude was to go to everything they motored up taking michael mont who being in his seventh heaven was found by winifred very amusing the beggars opera puzzled soames the people were unpleasant the whole thing cynical winifred was intriguedby the dresses the music too did not displease her at the opera the night before she had arrived too early for the russian ballet and found the stage occupied by singers for a whole hour pale or apoplectic from terror lest by some dreadful inadvertence they might drop into a tune michael mont was enraptured with the whole thing and all three wondered what fleur was thinking of it but fleur was not thinking of it her fixed idea stood on the stage and sang with polly peachum mimed with filch danced with jenny diver postured with lucy lockit kissed trolled and cuddled with macheath her lips might smile her hands applaud but the comic old masterpiece made no more impression on her than if it had been pathetic like a modern revue when they embarked in the car to return she ached because jon was not sitting next her instead of michael mont when at some jolt the young mans arm touched hers as if by accident she only thought if that were jons arm when his cheerful voice tempered by her proximity murmured above the sound of the cars progress she smiled and answered thinking if that were jons voice and when once he said fleur you look a perfect angel in that dress she answered oh do you like it thinking if only jon could see it  during this drive she took a resolution she would go to robin hill and see himalone she would take the car without word beforehand to him or to her father it was nine days since his letter and she could wait no longer on monday she would go the decision made her well disposed towards young mont with something to look forward to she could afford to tolerate and respond he might stay to dinner propose to her as usual dance with her press her hand sighdo what he liked he was only a nuisance when he interfered with her fixed idea she was even sorry for him so far as it was possible to be sorry for anybody but herself just now at dinner he seemed to talk more wildly than usual about what he called the death of the close boroughshe paid little attention but her father seemed paying a good deal with a smile on his face which meant opposition if not anger  the younger generation doesnt think as you do sir does it fleur  fleur shrugged her shouldersthe younger generation was just jon and she did not know what he was thinking  young people will think as i do when theyre my age mr mont human nature doesnt change  i admit that sir but the forms of thought change with the times the pursuit of selfinterest is a form of thought thats going out  indeed to mind ones own business is not a form of thought mr mont its an instinct  yes when jon was the business  but what is ones business sir thats the point everybodys business is going to be ones business isnt it fleur  fleur only smiled  if not added young mont therell be blood  people have talked like that from time immemorial  but youll admit sir that the sense of property is dying out  i should say increasing among those who have none  well look at me im heir to an entailed estate i dont want the thing id cut the entail tomorrow  youre not married and you dont know what youre talking about  fleur saw the young mans eyes turn rather piteously upon her  do you really mean that marriage he began  society is built on marriage came from between her fathers close lips marriage and its consequences do you want to do away with it  young mont made a distracted gesture silence brooded over the dinnertable covered with spoons bearing the forsyte cresta pheasant properunder the electric light in an alabaster globe and outside the river evening darkened charged with heavy moisture and sweet scents  monday thought fleur monday     vi  desperate   the weeks which followed the death of his father were sad and empty to the only jolyon forsyte left the necessary forms and ceremoniesthe reading of the will valuation of the estate distribution of the legacieswere enacted over the head as it were of one not yet of age jolyon was cremated by his special wish no one attended that ceremony or wore black for him the succession of his property controlled to some extent by old jolyons will left his widow in possession of robin hill with two thousand five hundred pounds a year for life apart from this the two wills worked together in some complicated way to insure that each of jolyons three children should have an equal share in their grandfathers and fathers property in the future as in the present save only that jon by virtue of his sex would have control of his capital when he was twentyone while june and holly would only have the spirit of theirs in order that their children might have the body after them if they had no children it would all come to jon if he outlived them and since june was fifty and holly nearly forty it was considered in lincolns inn fields that but for the cruelty of income tax young jon would be as warm a man as his grandfather when he died all this was nothing to jon and little enough to his mother it was june who did everything needful for one who had left his affairs in perfect order when she had gone and those two were alone again in the great house alone with death drawing them together and love driving them apart jon passed very painful days secretly disgusted and disappointed with himself his mother would look at him with a patient sadness which yet had in it an instinctive pride as if she were reserving her defence if she smiled he was angry that his answering smile should be so grudging and unnatural he did not judge or condemn her that was all too remoteindeed the idea of doing so had never come to him no he was grudging and unnatural because he couldnt have what he wanted because of her there was one alleviationmuch to do in connection with his fathers career which could not be safely intrusted to june though she had offered to undertake it both jon and his mother had felt that if she took his portfolios unexhibited drawings and unfinished matter away with her the work would encounter such icy blasts from paul post and other frequenters of her studio that it would soon be frozen out even of her warm heart on its oldfashioned plane and of its kind the work was good and they could not bear the thought of its subjection to ridicule a oneman exhibition of his work was the least testimony they could pay to one they had loved and on preparation for this they spent many hours together jon came to have a curiously increased respect for his father the quiet tenacity with which he had converted a mediocre talent into something really individual was disclosed by these researches there was a great mass of work with a rare continuity of growth in depth and reach of vision nothing certainly went very deep or reached very highbut such as the work was it was thorough conscientious and complete and remembering his fathers utter absence of side or selfassertion the chaffing humility with which he had always spoken of his own efforts ever calling himself an amateur jon could not help feeling that he had never really known his father to take himself seriously yet never bore others by letting them know that he did so seemed to have been his ruling principle there was something in this which appealed to the boy and made him heartily indorse his mothers comment he had true refinement he couldnt help thinking of others whatever he did and when he took a resolution which went counter he did it with the minimum of defiancenot like the age is it twice in his life he had to go against everything and yet it never made him bitter jon saw tears running down her face which she at once turned away from him she was so quiet about her loss that sometimes he had thought she didnt feel it much now as he looked at her he felt how far he fell short of the reserve power and dignity in both his father and his mother and stealing up to her he put his arm round her waist she kissed him swiftly but with a sort of passion and went out of the room  the studio where they had been sorting and labelling had once been hollys schoolroom devoted to her silkworms dried lavender music and other forms of instruction now at the end of july despite its northern and eastern aspects a warm and slumberous air came in between the longfaded lilac linen curtains to redeem a little the departed glory as of a field that is golden and gone clinging to a room which its master has left irene had placed on the paintstained table a bowl of red roses this and jolyons favourite cat who still clung to the deserted habitat were the pleasant spots in that dishevelled sad workroom jon at the north window sniffing air mysteriously scented with warm strawberries heard a car drive up the lawyers again about some nonsense why did that scent so make one ache and where did it come fromthere were no strawberry beds on this side of the house instinctively he took a crumpled sheet of paper from his pocket and wrote down some broken words a warmth began spreading in his chest he rubbed the palms of his hands together presently he had jotted this      if i could make a little song     a little song to soothe my heart     id make it all of little things     the plash of water rub of wings     the puffingoff of dandies crown     the hiss of raindrop spilling down     the purr of cat the trill of bird     and evry whispering ive heard     from willy wind in leaves and grass     and all the distant drones that pass     a song as tender and as light     as flower or butterfly in flight     and when i saw it opening     id let it fly and sing  he was still muttering it over to himself at the window when he heard his name called and turning round saw fleur at that amazing apparition he made at first no movement and no sound while her clear vivid glance ravished his heart then he went forward to the table saying how nice of you to come and saw her flinch as if he had thrown something at her  i asked for you she said and they showed me up here but i can go away again  jon clutched the paintstained table her face and figure in its frilly frock photographed itself with such startling vividness upon his eyes that if she had sunk through the floor he must still have seen her  i know i told you a lie jon but i told it out of love  oh yes thats nothing  i didnt answer your letter what was the usethere wasnt anything to answer i wanted to see you instead she held out both her hands and jon grasped them across the table he tried to say something but all his attention was given to trying not to hurt her hands his own felt so hard and hers so soft she said almost defiantly  that old storywas it so very dreadful  yes in his voice too there was a note of defiance  she dragged her hands away i didnt think in these days boys were tied to their mothers apronstrings  jons chin went up as if he had been struck  oh i didnt mean it jon what a horrible thing to say swiftly she came close to him jon dear i didnt mean it  all right  she had put her two hands on his shoulder and her forehead down on them the brim of her hat touched his neck and he felt it quivering but in a sort of paralysis he made no response she let go of his shoulder and drew away  well ill go if you dont want me but i never thought youd have given me up  i havent cried jon coming suddenly to life i cant ill try again  she swayed towards him joni love you dont give me up if you do i dont know what i shall doi feel so desperate what does it matterall that pastcompared with this  she clung to him he kissed her eyes her cheeks her lips but while he kissed her he saw the sheets of that letter fallen down on the floor of his bedroomhis fathers white dead facehis mother kneeling before it fleurs whisper make her promise oh jon try seemed childish in his ear he felt curiously old  i promise he muttered only you dont understand  she wants to spoil our lives just because  yes of what  again that challenge in his voice and she did not answer her arms tightened round him and he returned her kisses but even while he yielded the poison worked in him the poison of the letter fleur did not know she did not understandshe misjudged his mother she came from the enemys camp so lovely and he loved her soyet even in her embrace he could not help the memory of hollys words i think she has a having nature and his mothers my darling boy dont think of methink of yourself  when she was gone like a passionate dream leaving her image on his eyes her kisses on his lips such an ache in his heart jon leaned in the window listening to the car bearing her away still the scent as of warm strawberries still the little summer sounds that should make his song still all the promise of youth and happiness in sighing floating fluttering julyand his heart torn yearning strong in him hope high in him yet with its eyes cast down as if ashamed the miserable task before him if fleur was desperate so was hewatching the poplars swaying the white clouds passing the sunlight on the grass  he waited till evening till after their almost silent dinner till his mother had played to himand still he waited feeling that she knew what he was waiting to say she kissed him and went upstairs and still he lingered watching the moonlight and the moths and that unreality of colouring which steals along and stains a summer night and he would have given anything to be back in the pastbarely three months back or away forward years in the future the present with this stark cruelty of a decision one way or the other seemed impossible he realised now so much more keenly what his mother felt than he had at first as if the story in that letter had been a poisonous germ producing a kind of fever of partisanship so that he really felt there were two camps his mothers and hisfleurs and her fathers it might be a dead thing that old tragic ownership and enmity but dead things were poisonous till time had cleaned them away even his love felt tainted less illusioned more of the earth and with a treacherous lurking doubt lest fleur like her father might want to own not articulate just a stealing haunt horribly unworthy which crept in and about the ardour of his memories touched with its tarnishing breath the vividness and grace of that charmed face and figurea doubt not real enough to convince him of its presence just real enough to deflower a perfect faith and perfect faith to jon not yet twenty was essential he still had youths eagerness to give with both hands to take with neitherto give lovingly to one who had his own impulsive generosity surely she had he got up from the windowseat and roamed in the big grey ghostly room whose walls were hung with silvered canvas this househis father said in that deathbed letterhad been built for his mother to live inwith fleurs father he put out his hand in the halfdark as if to grasp the shadowy hand of the dead he clenched trying to feel the thin vanished fingers of his father to squeeze them and reassure him that hehe was on his fathers side tears prisoned within him made his eyes feel dry and hot he went back to the window it was warmer not so eerie more comforting outside where the moon hung golden three days off full the freedom of the night was comforting if only fleur and he had met on some desert island without a pastand nature for their house jon had still his high regard for desert islands where breadfruit grew and the water was blue above the coral the night was deep was freethere was enticement in it a lure a promise a refuge from entanglement and love milksop tied to his mothers his cheeks burned he shut the window drew curtains over it switched off the lighted sconce and went upstairs  the door of his room was open the light turned up his mother still in her evening gown was standing at the window she turned and said  sit down jon lets talk she sat down on the windowseat jon on his bed she had her profile turned to him and the beauty and grace of her figure the delicate line of the brow the nose the neck the strange and as it were remote refinement of her moved him his mother never belonged to her surroundings she came into them from somewhereas it were what was she going to say to him who had in his heart such things to say to her  i know fleur came today im not surprised it was as though she had added she is her fathers daughter and jons heart hardened irene went on quietly  i have fathers letter i picked it up that night and kept it would you like it back dear  jon shook his head  i had read it of course before he gave it to you it didnt quite do justice to my criminality  mother burst from jons lips  he put it very sweetly but i know that in marrying fleurs father without love i did a dreadful thing an unhappy marriage jon can play such havoc with other lives besides ones own you are fearfully young my darling and fearfully loving do you think you can possibly be happy with this girl  staring at her dark eyes darker now from pain jon answered  yes oh yesif you could be  irene smiled  admiration of beauty and longing for possession are not love if yours were another case like mine jonwhere the deepest things are stifled the flesh joined and the spirit at war  why should it mother you think she must be like her father but shes not ive seen him  again the smile came on irenes lips and in jon something wavered there was such irony and experience in that smile  you are a giver jon she is a taker  that unworthy doubt that haunting uncertainty again he said with vehemence  she isntshe isnt its only because i cant bear to make you unhappy mother now that father he thrust his fists against his forehead  irene got up  i told you that night dear not to mind me i meant it think of yourself and your own happiness i can stand whats leftive brought it on myself  again the word mother burst from jons lips  she came over to him and put her hands over his  do you feel your head darling  jon shook it what he felt was in his chesta sort of tearing asunder of the tissue there by the two loves  i shall always love you the same jon whatever you do you wont lose anything she smoothed his hair gently and walked away  he heard the door shut and rolling over on the bed lay stifling his breath with an awful heldup feeling within him     vii  embassy   enquiring for her at tea time soames learned that fleur had been out in the car since two three hours where had she gone up to london without a word to him he had never become quite reconciled with cars he had embraced them in principlelike the born empiricist or forsyte that he wasadopting each symptom of progress as it came along with well we couldnt do without them now but in fact he found them tearing great smelly things obliged by annette to have onea rollhard with pearlgrey cushions electric light little mirrors trays for the ashes of cigarettes flower vasesall smelling of petrol and stephanotishe regarded it much as he used to regard his brotherinlaw montague dartie the thing typified all that was fast insecure and subcutaneously oily in modern life as modern life became faster looser younger soames was becoming older slower tighter more and more in thought and language like his father james before him he was almost aware of it himself pace and progress pleased him less and less there was an ostentation too about a car which he considered provocative in the prevailing mood of labour on one occasion that fellow sims had driven over the only vested interest of a working man soames had not forgotten the behaviour of its master when not many people would have stopped to put up with it he had been sorry for the dog and quite prepared to take its part against the car if that ruffian hadnt been so outrageous with four hours fast becoming five and still no fleur all the old carwise feelings he had experienced in person and by proxy balled within him and sinking sensations troubled the pit of his stomach at seven he telephoned to winifred by trunk call no fleur had not been to green street then where was she visions of his beloved daughter rolled up in her pretty frills all bloodandduststained in some hideous catastrophe began to haunt him he went to her room and spied among her things she had taken nothingno dressingcase no jewellery and this a relief in one sense increased his fears of an accident terrible to be helpless when his loved one was missing especially when he couldnt bear fuss or publicity of any kind what should he do if she were not back by nightfall  at a quarter to eight he heard the car a great weight lifted from off his heart he hurried down she was getting outpale and tiredlooking but nothing wrong he met her in the hall  youve frightened me where have you been  to robin hill im sorry dear i had to go ill tell you afterwards and with a flying kiss she ran upstairs  soames waited in the drawingroom to robin hill what did that portend  it was not a subject they could discuss at dinnerconsecrated to the susceptibilities of the butler the agony of nerves soames had been through the relief he felt at her safety softened his power to condemn what she had done or resist what she was going to do he waited in a relaxed stupor for her revelation life was a queer business there he was at sixtyfive and no more in command of things than if he had not spent forty years in building up securityalways something one couldnt get on terms with in the pocket of his dinnerjacket was a letter from annette she was coming back in a fortnight he knew nothing of what she had been doing out there and he was glad that he did not her absence had been a relief out of sight was out of mind and now she was coming back another worry and the bolderby old crome was gonedumetrius had got itall because that anonymous letter had put it out of his thoughts he furtively remarked the strained look on his daughters face as if she too were gazing at a picture that she couldnt buy he almost wished the war back worries didnt seem then quite so worrying from the caress in her voice the look on her face he became certain that she wanted something from him uncertain whether it would be wise of him to give it her he pushed his savoury away uneaten and even joined her in a cigarette  after dinner she set the electric pianoplayer going and he augured the worst when she sat down on a cushion footstool at his knee and put her hand on his  darling be nice to me i had to see jonhe wrote to me hes going to try what he can do with his mother but ive been thinking but its really in your hands father if youd persuade her that it doesnt mean renewing the past in any way that i shall stay yours and jon will stay hers that you need never see him or her and she need never see you or me only you could persuade her dear because only you could promise one cant promise for other people surely it wouldnt be too awkward for you to see her just this oncenow that jons father is dead  too awkward soames repeated the whole things preposterous  you know said fleur without looking up you wouldnt mind seeing her really  soames was silent her words had expressed a truth too deep for him to admit she slipped her fingers between his ownhot slim eager they clung there this child of his would corkscrew her way into a brick wall  what am i to do if you wont father she said very softly  ill do anything for your happiness said soames but this isnt for your happiness  oh it is it is  itll only stir things up he said grimly  but they are stirred up the thing is to quiet them to make her feel that this is just our lives and has nothing to do with yours or hers you can do it father i know you can  you know a great deal then was soames glum answer  if you will jon and i will wait a yeartwo years if you like  it seems to me murmured soames that you care nothing about what i feel  fleur pressed his hand against her cheek  i do darling but you wouldnt like me to be awfully miserable how she wheedled to get her ends and trying with all his might to think she really cared for himhe was not surenot sure all she cared for was this boy why should he help her to get this boy who was killing her affection for himself why should he by the laws of the forsytes it was foolish there was nothing to be had out of itnothing to give her to that boy to pass her into the enemys camp under the influence of the woman who had injured him so deeply slowlyinevitablyhe would lose this flower of his life and suddenly he was conscious that his hand was wet his heart gave a little painful jump he couldnt bear her to cry he put his other hand quickly over hers and a tear dropped on that too he couldnt go on like this well well he said ill think it over and do what i can come come if she must have it for her happinessshe must he couldnt refuse to help her and lest she should begin to thank him he got out of his chair and went up to the pianoplayermaking that noise it ran down as he reached it with a faint buzz that musical box of his nursery days the harmonious blacksmith glorious portthe thing had always made him miserable when his mother set it going on sunday afternoons here it was againthe same thing only larger more expensive and now it played the wild wild women and the policemans holiday and he was no longer in black velvet with a skyblue collar profonds right he thought theres nothing in it were all progressing to the grave and with that surprising mental comment he walked out  he did not see fleur again that night but at breakfast her eyes followed him about with an appeal he could not escapenot that he intended to try no he had made up his mind to the nerveracking business he would go to robin hillto that house of memories a pleasant memorythe last of going down to keep that boys father and irene apart by threatening divorce he had often thought since that it had clenched their union and now he was going to clench the union of that boy with his girl i dont know what ive done he thought to have such things thrust on me he went up by train and down by train and from the station walked by the long rising lane still very much as he remembered it over thirty years ago funnyso near london some one evidently was holding on to the land there this speculation soothed him moving between the high hedges slowly so as not to get overheated though the day was chill enough after all was said and done there was something real about land it didnt shift land and good pictures the values might fluctuate a bit but on the whole they were always going upworth holding on to in a world where there was such a lot of unreality cheap building changing fashions such a here today and gone tomorrow spirit the french were right perhaps with their peasant proprietorship though he had no opinion of the french ones bit of land something solid in it he had heard peasantproprietors described as a pigheaded lot had heard young mont call his father a pigheaded morning posterdisrespectful young devil well there were worse things than being pigheaded or reading the morning post there was profond and his tribe and all these labour chaps and loudmouthed politicians and wild wild women a lot of worse things and suddenly soames became conscious of feeling weak and hot and shaky sheer nerves at the meeting before him as aunt juley might have saidquoting superior dossethis nerves were in a proper fantigue he could see the house now among its trees the house he had watched being built intending it for himself and this woman who by such strange fate had lived in it with another after all he began to think of dumetrius local loans and other forms of investment he could not afford to meet her with his nerves all shaking he who represented the day of judgment for her on earth as it was in heaven he legal ownership personified meeting lawless beauty incarnate his dignity demanded impassivity during this embassy designed to link their offspring who if she had behaved herself would have been brother and sister that wretched tune the wild wild women kept running in his head perversely for tunes did not run there as a rule passing the poplars in front of the house he thought how theyve grown i had them planted  a maid answered his ring  will you saymr forsyte on a very special matter  if she realised who he was quite probably she would not see him by george he thought hardening as the tug came its a topsyturvy affair  the maid came back would the gentleman state his business please  say it concerns mr jon said soames  and once more he was alone in that hall with the pool of greywhite marble designed by her first lover ah she had been a bad lothad loved two men and not himself he must remember that when he came face to face with her once more and suddenly he saw her in the opening chink between the long heavy purple curtains swaying as if in hesitation the old perfect poise and line the old startled darkeyed gravity the old calm defensive voice will you come in please  he passed through that opening as in the picturegallery and the confectioners shop she seemed to him still beautiful and this was the first timethe very firstsince he married her five and thirty years ago that he was speaking to her without the legal right to call her his she was not wearing blackone of that fellows radical notions he supposed  i apologise for coming he said glumly but this business must be settled one way or the other  wont you sit down  no thank you  anger at his false position impatience of ceremony between them mastered him and words came tumbling out  its an infernal mischance ive done my best to discourage it i consider my daughter crazy but ive got into the habit of indulging her thats why im here i suppose youre fond of your son  devotedly  well  it rests with him  he had a sense of being met and baffled alwaysalways she had baffled him even in those old first married days  its a mad notion he said  it is  if you had only wellthey might have been he did not finish that sentence brother and sister and all this saved but he saw her shudder as if he had and stung by the sight he crossed over to the window out there the trees had not grownthey couldnt they were old  so far as im concerned he said you may make your mind easy i desire to see neither you nor your son if this marriage comes about young people in these days areare unaccountable but i cant bear to see my daughter unhappy what am i to say to her when i go back  please say to her as i said to you that it rests with jon  you dont oppose it  with all my heart not with my lips  soames stood biting his finger  i remember an evening he said suddenly and was silent what was therewhat was there in this woman that would not fit into the four comers of his hate or condemnation where is heyour son  up in his fathers studio i think  perhaps youd have him down  he watched her ring the bell he watched the maid come in  please tell mr jon that i want him  if it rests with him said soames hurriedly when the maid was gone i suppose i may take it for granted that this unnatural marriage will take place in that case therell be formalities whom do i deal withherrings irene nodded  you dont propose to live with them  irene shook her head  what happens to this house  it will be as jon wishes  this house said soames suddenly i had hopes when i began it if they live in ittheir children they say theres such a thing as nemesis do you believe in it  yes  oh you do he had come back from the window and was standing close to her who in the curve of her grand piano was as it were embayed  im not likely to see you again he said slowly will you shake hands his lip quivered the words came out jerkily and let the past die he held out his hand her pale face grew paler her eyes so dark rested immovably on his but her hands remained clasped in front of her he heard a sound and turned that boy was standing in the opening of the curtains very queer he looked hardly recognisable as the young fellow he had seen in the gallery off cork streetvery queer much older no youth in the face at allhaggard rigid his hair ruffled his eyes deep in his head soames made an effort and said with a lift of his lip not quite a smile nor quite a sneer  well young man im here for my daughter it rests with you it seemsthis matter your mother leaves it in your hands  the boy continued staring at his mothers face and made no answer  for my daughters sake ive brought myself to come said soames what am i to say to her when i go back  still looking at his mother the boy said quietly  tell fleur that its no good please i must do as my father wished before he died  jon  its all right mother  in a kind of stupefaction soames looked from one to the other then taking up hat and umbrella which he had put down on a chair he walked towards the curtains the boy stood aside for him to go by he passed through and heard the grate of the rings as the curtains were drawn behind him the sound liberated something in his chest  so thats that he thought and passed out of the front door     viii  the dark tune   as soames walked away from the house at robin hill the sun broke through the grey of that chill afternoon in smoky radiance so absorbed in landscapepainting that he seldom looked seriously for effects of nature outofdoors he was struck by that moody effulgenceit mourned with a triumph suited to his own feeling victory in defeat his embassy had come to naught but he was rid of those people had regained his daughter at the expense ofher happiness what would fleur say to him would she believe he had done his best and under that sunlight flaring on the elms hazels hollies of the lane and those unexploited fields soames felt dread she would be terribly upset he must appeal to her pride that boy had given her up declared part and lot with the woman who so long ago had given her father up soames clenched his hands given him up and why what had been wrong with him and once more he felt the malaise of one who contemplates himself as seen by anotherlike a dog who chances on his reflection in a mirror and is intrigued and anxious at the unseizable thing  not in a hurry to get home he dined in town at the connoisseurs while eating a pear it suddenly occurred to him that if he had not gone down to robin hill the boy might not have so decided he remembered the expression on his face while his mother was refusing the hand he had held out a strange an awkward thought had fleur cooked her own goose by trying to make too sure  he reached home at halfpast nine while the car was passing in at one drive gate he heard the grinding sputter of a motorcycle passing out by the other young mont no doubt so fleur had not been lonely but he went in with a sinking heart in the creampanelled drawingroom she was sitting with her elbows on her knees and her chin on her clasped hands in front of a white camellia plant which filled the fireplace that glance at her before she saw him renewed his dread what was she seeing among those white camellias  well father  soames shook his head his tongue failed him this was murderous work he saw her eyes dilate her lips quivering  what what quick father  my dear said soames ii did my best but and again he shook his head  fleur ran to him and put a hand on each of his shoulders  she  no muttered soames he i was to tell you that it was no use he must do what his father wished before he died he caught her by the waist come child dont let them hurt you theyre not worth your little finger  fleur tore herself from his grasp  you didntyou couldnt have tried youyou betrayed me father  bitterly wounded soames gazed at her passionate figure writhing there in front of him  you didnt tryyou didnti was a fooli wont believe he couldhe ever could only yesterday he oh why did i ask you  yes said soames quietly why did you i swallowed my feelings i did my best for you against my judgmentand this is my reward goodnight  with every nerve in his body twitching he went towards the door  fleur darted after him  he gives me up you mean that father  soames turned and forced himself to answer  yes  oh cried fleur what did youwhat could you have done in those old days  the breathless sense of really monstrous injustice cut the power of speech in soames throat what had he done what had they done to him and with quite unconscious dignity he put his hand on his breast and looked at her  its a shame cried fleur passionately  soames went out he mounted slow and icy to his picturegallery and paced among his treasures outrageous oh outrageous she was spoiled ah and who had spoiled her he stood still before the goya copy accustomed to her own way in everythingflower of his life and now that she couldnt have it he turned to the window for some air daylight was dying the moon rising gold behind the poplars what sound was that why that piano thing a dark tune with a thrum and a throb she had set it goingwhat comfort could she get from that his eyes caught movement down there beyond the lawn under the trellis of rambler roses and young acaciatrees where the moonlight fell there she was roaming up and down his heart gave a little sickening jump what would she do under this blow how could he tell what did he know of herhe had only loved her all his lifelooked on her as the apple of his eye he knew nothinghad no notion there she wasand that dark tuneand the river gleaming in the moonlight  i must go out he thought he hastened down to the drawingroom lighted just as he had left it with the piano thrumming out that waltz or foxtrot or whatever they called it in these days and passed through on to the verandah where could he watch without her seeing him and he stole down through the fruit garden to the boathouse he was between her and the river now and his heart felt lighter she was his daughter and annettesshe wouldnt do anything foolish but there it washe didnt know from the boathouse window he could see the last acacia and the spin of her skirt when she turned in her restless march that tune had run down at lastthank goodness he crossed the floor and looked through the farther window at the water slowflowing past the lilies it made little bubbles against them bright where a moonstreak fell he remembered suddenly that early morning when he had slept in this boathouse after his father died and she had just been bornnearly nineteen years ago even now he recalled the unaccustomed world when he woke up the strange feeling it had given him that day the second passion of his life beganfor this girl of his roaming under the acacias what a comfort she had been to him and all the soreness and sense of outrage left him if he could make her happy again he didnt care an owl flew queeking queeking a bat flitted by the moonlight brightened and broadened on the water how long was she going to roam about like this he went back to the window and suddenly saw her coming down to the bank she stood quite close on the landingstage and soames watched clenching his hands should he speak to her his excitement was intense the stillness of her figure its youth its absorption in despair in longing initself he would always remember it moonlit like that and the faint sweet reek of the river and the shivering of the willow leaves she had everything in the world that he could give her except the one thing that she could not have because of him the perversity of things hurt him at that moment as might a fishbone in his throat then with an infinite relief he saw her turn back towards the house what could he give her to make amends pearls travel horses other young menanything she wantedthat he might lose the memory of her young figure lonely by the water there she had set that tune going again whyit was a mania dark thrumming faint travelling from the house it was as though she had said if i cant have something to keep me going i shall die of this soames dimly understood well if it helped her let her keep it thrumming on all night and mousing back through the fruit garden he regained the verandah though he meant to go in and speak to her now he still hesitated not knowing what to say trying hard to recall how it felt to be thwarted in love he ought to know ought to rememberand he could not goneall real recollection except that it had hurt him horribly in this blankness he stood passing his handkerchief over hands and lips which were very dry by craning his head he could just see fleur standing with her back to that piano still grinding out its tune her arms tight crossed on her breast a lighted cigarette between her lips whose smoke half veiled her face the expression on it was strange to soames the eyes shone and stared and every feature was alive with a sort of wretched scorn and anger once or twice he had seen annette look like thatthe face was too vivid too naked not his daughters at that moment and he dared not go in realising the futility of any attempt at consolation he sat down in the shadow of the inglenook monstrous trick that fate had played him nemesis that old unhappy marriage and in gods namewhy how was he to know when he wanted irene so violently and she consented to be his that she would never love him the tune died and was renewed and died again and still soames sat in the shadow waiting for he knew not what the fag of fleurs cigarette flung through the window fell on the grass he watched it glowing burning itself out the moon had freed herself above the poplars and poured her unreality on the garden comfortless light mysterious withdrawnlike the beauty of that woman who had never loved himdappling the nemesias and the stocks with a vesture not of earth flowers and his flower so unhappy ah why could one not put happiness into local loans gild its edges insure it against going down light had ceased to flow out now from the drawingroom window all was silent and dark in there had she gone up he rose and tiptoeing peered in it seemed so he entered the verandah kept the moonlight out and at first he could see nothing but the outlines of furniture blacker than the darkness he groped towards the farther window to shut it his foot struck a chair and he heard a gasp there she was curled and crushed into the corner of the sofa his hand hovered did she want his consolation he stood gazing at that ball of crushed frills and hair and graceful youth trying to burrow its way out of sorrow how leave her there at last he touched her hair and said come darling better go to bed ill make it up to you somehow how fatuous but what could he have said     ix  under the oaktree   when their visitor had disappeared jon and his mother stood without speaking till he said suddenly i ought to have seen him out but soames was already walking down the drive and jon went upstairs to his fathers studio not trusting himself to go back the expression on his mothers face confronting the man she had once been married to had sealed a resolution growing within him ever since she left him the night before it had put the finishing touch of reality to marry fleur would be to hit his mother in the face to betray his dead father it was no good jon had the least resentful of natures he bore his parents no grudge in this hour of his distress for one so young there was a rather strange power in him of seeing things in some sort of proportion it was worse for fleur worse for his mother even than it was for him harder than to give up was to be given up or to be the cause of some one you loved giving up for you he must not would not behave grudgingly while he stood watching the tardy sunlight he had again that sudden vision of the world which had come to him the night before sea on sea country on country millions on millions of people all with their own lives energies joys griefs and sufferingall with things they had to give up and separate struggles for existence even though he might be willing to give up all else for the one thing he couldnt have he would be a fool to think his feelings mattered much in so vast a world and to behave like a crybaby or a cad he pictured the people who had nothingthe millions who had given up life in the war the millions whom the war had left with life and little else the hungry children he had read of the shattered men people in prison every kind of unfortunate andthey did not help him much if one had to miss a meal what comfort in the knowledge that many others had to miss it too there was more distraction in the thought of getting away out into this vast world of which he knew nothing yet he could not go on staying here walled in and sheltered with everything so slick and comfortable and nothing to do but brood and think what might have been he could not go back to wansdon and the memories of fleur if he saw her again he could not trust himself and if he stayed here or went back there he would surely see her while they were within reach of each other that must happen to go far away and quickly was the only thing to do but however much he loved his mother he did not want to go away with her then feeling that was brutal he made up his mind desperately to propose that they should go to italy for two hours in that melancholy room he tried to master himself then dressed solemnly for dinner  his mother had done the same they ate little at some length and talked of his fathers catalogue the show was arranged for october and beyond clerical detail there was nothing more to do  after dinner she put on a cloak and they went out walked a little talked a little till they were standing silent at last beneath the oaktree ruled by the thought if i show anything i show all jon put his arm through hers and said quite casually  mother lets go to italy  irene pressed his arm and said as casually  it would be very nice but ive been thinking you ought to see and do more than you would if i were with you  but then youd be alone  i was once alone for more than twelve years besides i should like to be here for the opening of fathers show  jons grip tightened round her arm he was not deceived  you couldnt stay here all by yourself its too big  not here perhaps in london and i might go to paris after the show opens you ought to have a year at least jon and see the world  yes id like to see the world and rough it but i dont want to leave you all alone  my dear i owe you that at least if its for your good itll be for mine why not start tomorrow youve got your passport  yes if im going it had better be at once onlymotherifif i wanted to stay out somewhereamerica or anywhere would you mind coming presently  wherever and whenever you send for me but dont send until you really want me  jon drew a deep breath  i feel englands choky  they stood a few minutes longer under the oaktreelooking out to where the grand stand at epsom was veiled in evening the branches kept the moonlight from them so that it only fell everywhere elseover the fields and far away and on the windows of the creepered house behind which soon would be to let     x  fleurs wedding   the october paragraphs describing the wedding of fleur forsyte to michael mont hardly conveyed the symbolic significance of this event in the union of the greatgranddaughter of superior dosset with the heir of a ninth baronet was the outward and visible sign of that merger of class in class which buttresses the political stability of a realm the time had come when the forsytes might resign their natural resentment against a flummery not theirs by birth and accept it as the still more natural due of their possessive instincts besides they really had to mount to make room for all those so much more newly rich in that quiet but tasteful ceremony in hanover square and afterwards among the furniture in green street it had been impossible for those not in the know to distinguish the forsyte troop from the mont contingentso far away was superior dosset now was there in the crease of his trousers the expression of his moustache his accent or the shine on his top hat a pin to choose between soames and the ninth baronet himself was not fleur as selfpossessed quick glancing pretty and hard as the likeliest muskham mont or charwell filly present if anything the forsytes had it in dress and looks and manners they had become upper class and now their name would be formally recorded in the stud book their money joined to land whether this was a little late in the day and those rewards of the possessive instinct lands and money destined for the meltingpotwas still a question so moot that it was not mooted after all timothy had said consols were goin up timothy the last the missing link timothy in extremis on the bayswater roadso francie had reported it was whispered too that this young mont was a sort of socialiststrangely wise of him and in the nature of insurance considering the days they lived in there was no uneasiness on that score the landed classes produced that sort of amiable foolishness at times turned to safe uses and confined to theory as george remarked to his sister francie theyll soon be having puppiesthatll give him pause  the church with white flowers and something blue in the middle of the east window looked extremely chaste as though endeavouring to counteract the somewhat lurid phraseology of a service calculated to keep the thoughts of all on puppies forsytes haymans tweetymans sat in the left aisle monts charwells muskhams in the right while a sprinkling of fleurs fellowsufferers at school and of monts fellowsufferers in the war gaped indiscriminately from either side and three maiden ladies who had dropped in on their way from skywards brought up the rear together with two mont retainers and fleurs old nurse in the unsettled state of the country as full a house as could be expected  mrs val dartie who sat with her husband in the third row squeezed his hand more than once during the performance to her who knew the plot of this tragicomedy its most dramatic moment was wellnigh painful i wonder if jon knows by instinct she thoughtjon out in british columbia she had received a letter from him only that morning which had made her smile and say  jons in british columbia val because he wants to be in california he thinks its too nice there  oh said val so hes beginning to see a joke again  hes bought some land and sent for his mother  what on earth will she do out there  all she cares about is jon do you still think it a happy release  vals shrewd eyes narrowed to grey pinpoints between their dark lashes  fleur wouldnt have suited him a bit shes not bred right  poor little fleur sighed holly ah it was strangethis marriage the young man mont had caught her on the rebound of course in the reckless mood of one whose ship has just gone down such a plunge could not but beas val put itan outside chance there was little to be told from the back view of her young cousins veil and hollys eyes reviewed the general aspect of this christian wedding she who had made a lovematch which had been successful had a horror of unhappy marriages this might not be one in the endbut it was clearly a tossup and to consecrate a tossup in this fashion with manufactured unction before a crowd of fashionable freethinkersfor who thought otherwise than freely or not at all when they were dolled upseemed to her as near a sin as one could find in an age which had abolished them her eyes wandered from the prelate in his robes a charwellthe forsytes had not as yet produced a prelate to val beside her thinkingshe was certain ofthe mayfly filly at fifteen to one for the cambridgeshire they passed on and caught the profile of the ninth baronet in counterfeitment of the kneeling process she could just see the neat ruck above his knees where he had pulled his trousers up and thought vals forgotten to pull up his her eyes passed to the pew in front of her where winifreds substantial form was gowned with passion and on again to soames and annette kneeling side by side a little smile came on her lipsprosper profond back from the south seas of the channel would be kneeling too about six rows behind yes this was a funny small business however it turned out still it was in a proper church and would be in the proper papers tomorrow morning  they had begun a hymn she could hear the ninth baronet across the aisle singing of the hosts of midian her little finger touched vals thumbthey were holding the same hymnbookand a tiny thrill passed through her preserved from twenty years ago he stooped and whispered  i say dyou remember the rat the rat at their wedding in cape colony which had cleaned its whiskers behind the table at the registrars and between her little and third finger she squeezed his thumb hard  the hymn was over the prelate had begun to deliver his discourse he told them of the dangerous times they lived in and the awful conduct of the house of lords in connection with divorce they were all soldiershe saidin the trenches under the poisonous gas of the prince of darkness and must be manful the purpose of marriage was children not mere sinful happiness  an imp danced in hollys eyesvals eyelashes were meeting whatever happened he must not snore her finger and thumb closed on his thigh till he stirred uneasily  the discourse was over the danger past they were signing in the vestry and general relaxation had set in  a voice behind her said  will she stay the course  whos that she whispered  old george forsyte  holly demurely scrutinised one of whom she had often heard fresh from south africa and ignorant of her kith and kin she never saw one without an almost childish curiosity he was very big and very dapper his eyes gave her a funny feeling of having no particular clothes  theyre off she heard him say  they came stepping from the chancel holly looked first in young monts face his lips and ears were twitching his eyes shifting from his feet to the hand within his arm stared suddenly before them as if to face a firing party he gave holly the feeling that he was spiritually intoxicated but fleur ah that was different the girl was perfectly composed prettier than ever in her white robes and veil over her banged dark chestnut hair her eyelids hovered demure over her dark hazel eyes outwardly she seemed all there but inwardly where was she as those two passed fleur raised her eyelidsthe restless glint of those clear whites remained on hollys vision as might the flutter of a caged birds wings  in green street winifred stood to receive just a little less composed than usual soames request for the use of her house had come on her at a deeply psychological moment under the influence of a remark of prosper profond she had begun to exchange her empire for expressionistic furniture there were the most amusing arrangements with violet green and orange blobs and scriggles to be had at mealards another month and the change would have been complete just now the very intriguing recruits she had enlisted did not march too well with the old guard it was as if her regiment were half in khaki half in scarlet and bearskins but her strong and comfortable character made the best of it in a drawingroom which typified perhaps more perfectly than she imagined the semibolshevised imperialism of her country after all this was a day of merger and you couldnt have too much of it her eyes travelled indulgently among her guests soames had gripped the back of a buhl chair young mont was behind that awfully amusing screen which no one as yet had been able to explain to her the ninth baronet had shied violently at a round scarlet table inlaid tinder glass with blue australian butterflies wings and was clinging to her louisquinze cabinet francie forsyte had seized the new mantelboard finely carved with little purple grotesques on an ebony ground george over by the old spinet was holding a little skyblue book as if about to enter bets prosper profond was twiddling the knob of the open door black with peacockblue panels and annettes hands close by were grasping her own waist two muskhams clung to the balcony among the plants as if feeling ill lady mont thin and bravelooking had taken up her longhandled glasses and was gazing at the central light shade of ivory and orange dashed with deep magenta as if the heavens had opened everybody in fact seemed holding on to something only fleur still in her bridal dress was detached from all support flinging her words and glances to left and right  the room was full of the bubble and the squeak of conversation nobody could hear anything that anybody said which seemed of little consequence since no one waited for anything so slow as an answer modern conversation seemed to winifred so different from the days of her prime when a drawl was all the vogue still it was diverting which of course was all that mattered even the forsytes were talking with extreme rapidityfleur and christopher and imogen and young nicholass youngest patrick soames of course was silent but george by the spinet kept up a running commentary and francie by her mantelshelf winifred drew nearer to the ninth baronet he seemed to promise a certain repose his nose was fine and drooped a little his grey moustaches too and she said drawling through her smile  its rather nice isnt it  his reply shot out of his smile like a snipped bread pellet  dyou remember in frazer the tribe that buries the bride up to the waist  he spoke as fast as anybody he had dark lively little eyes too all crinkled round like a catholic priests winifred felt suddenly he might say things she would regret  theyre always so divertingweddings she murmured and moved on to soames he was curiously still and winifred saw at once what was dictating his immobility to his right was george forsyte to his left annette and prosper profond he could not move without either seeing those two together or the reflection of them in george forsytes japing eyes he was quite right not to be taking notice  they say timothys sinking he said glumly  where will you put him soames  highgate and counted on his fingers itll make twelve of them there including wives how do you think fleur looks  remarkably well  soames nodded he had never seen her look prettier yet he could not rid himself of the impression that this business was unnaturalremembering still that crushed figure burrowing into the corner of the sofa from that night to this day he had received from her no confidences he knew from his chauffeur that she had made one more attempt on robin hill and drawn blankan empty house no one at home he knew that she had received a letter but not what was in it except that it had made her hide herself and cry he had remarked that she looked at him sometimes when she thought he wasnt noticing as if she were wondering still what he had doneforsoothto make those people hate him so well there it was annette had come back and things had worn on through the summervery miserable till suddenly fleur had said she was going to marry young mont she had shown him a little more affection when she told soames that and he had yieldedwhat was the good of opposing it god knew that he had never wished to thwart her in anything and the young man seemed quite delirious about her no doubt she was in a reckless mood and she was young absurdly young but if he opposed her he didnt know what she would do for all he could tell she might want to take up a profession become a doctor or solicitor some nonsense she had no aptitude for painting writing music in his view the legitimate occupations of unmarried women if they must do something in these days on the whole she was safer married for he could see too well how feverish and restless she was at home annette too had been in favour of itannette from behind the veil of his refusal to know what she was about if she was about anything annette had said let her marry this young man he is a nice boynot so hightyflighty as he seems where she got her expressions he didnt knowbut her opinion soothed his doubts his wife whatever her conduct had clear eyes and an almost depressing amount of common sense he had settled fifty thousand on fleur taking care that there was no cross settlement in case it didnt turn out well could it turn out well she had not got over that other boyhe knew they were to go to spain for the honeymoon he would be even lonelier when she was gone but later perhaps she would forget and turn to him again  winifreds voice broke on his reverie  why of all wondersjune  there in a djibbahwhat things she worewith her hair straying from under a fillet soames saw his cousin and fleur going forward to greet her the two passed from their view out on to the stairway  really said winifred she does the most impossible things fancy her coming  what made you ask her muttered soames  because i thought she wouldnt accept of course  winifred had forgotten that behind conduct lies the main trend of character or in other words omitted to remember that fleur was now a lame duck  on receiving her invitation june had first thought i wouldnt go near them for the world and then one morning had awakened from a dream of fleur waving to her from a boat with a wild unhappy gesture and she had changed her mind  when fleur came forward and said to her  do come up while im changing my dress she had followed up the stairs the girl led the way into imogens old bedroom set ready for her toilet  june sat down on the bed thin and upright like a little spirit in the sere and yellow fleur locked the door  the girl stood before her divested of her weddingdress what a pretty thing she was  i suppose you think me a fool she said with quivering lips when it was to have been jon but what does it matter michael wants me and i dont care itll get me away from home diving her hand into the frills on her breast she brought out a letter jon wrote me this  june read lake okanagen british columbia im not coming back to england bless you always jon  shes made safe you see said fleur  june handed back the letter  thats not fair to irene she always told jon he could do as he wished  fleur smiled bitterly didnt she spoil your life too  nobody can spoil a life my dear thats nonsense things happen but we bob up  then with a sort of terror she saw the girl sink on her knees and bury her face in the djibbah with a strangled sob  its all rightall right june murmured dont there there  but the point of the girls chin was pressed ever closer into her thigh and the sound was dreadful of her sobbing well well it had to come she would feel better afterwards june stroked the short hair of that shapely head and all the scattered mothersense in her focussed itself and passed through the tips of her fingers into the girls brain  dont sit down under it my dear she said at last we cant control life but we can fight it make the best of things ive had to i held on like you and i cried as youre crying now and look at me  fleur raised her head a sob merged suddenly into a little choked laugh in truth it was a thin and rather wild and wasted spirit she was looking at but it had brave eyes  all right she said im sorry i shall forget him i suppose if i fly fast and far enough  and scrambling to her feet she went over to the washstand  june watched her removing with cold water the traces of emotion save for a little becoming pinkness there was nothing left when she stood before the mirror june got off the bed and took a pincushion in her hand to put two pins into the wrong places was all the vent she found for sympathy  give me a kiss she said when fleur was ready and dug her chin into the girls warm cheek  i want a whiff said fleur dont wait  june left her sitting on the bed with a cigarette between her lips and her eyes half closed and went downstairs in the doorway of the drawingroom stood soames as if unquiet at his daughters tardiness june tossed her head and passed down on to the half landing her cousin francie was standing there  look said june pointing with her chin at soames that mans fatal  how do you mean said francie fatal  june did not answer her i shant wait to see them off she said goodbye  goodbye and francies eyes of a celtic grey goggled that old feud really it was quite romantic  soames moving to the well of the staircase saw june go and drew a breath of satisfaction but why didnt fleur come they would miss their train that train would bear her away from him yet he could not help fidgeting at the thought that they would lose it and then she did come running down in her tancoloured frock and black velvet cap and passed him into the drawingroom he saw her kiss her mother her aunt vals wife imogen and then come forth quick and pretty as ever how would she treat him at this last moment of her girlhood he couldnt hope for much  her lips pressed the middle of his cheek  daddy she said and was past and gone daddy she hadnt called him that for years he drew a long breath and followed slowly down there was all the folly with that confetti stuff and the rest of it to go through with yet but he would like just to catch her smile if she leaned out though they would hit her in the eye with the shoe if they didnt take care young monts voice said fervently in his ear  goodbye sir and thank you im so fearfully bucked  goodbye he said dont miss your train  he stood on the bottom step but three whence he could see above the headsthe silly hats and heads they were in the car now and there was that stuff showering and there went the shoe a flood of something welled up in soames andhe didnt knowhe couldnt see     xi  the last of the forsytes   when they came to prepare that terrific symbol timothy forsytethe one pure individualist left the only man who hadnt heard of the great warthey found him wonderfulnot even death had undermined his soundness  to smither and cook that preparation came like final evidence of what they had never believed possiblethe end of the old forsyte family on earth poor mr timothy must now take a harp and sing in the company of miss forsyte mrs julia miss hester with mr jolyon mr swithin mr james mr roger and mr nicholas of the party whether mrs hayman would be there was more doubtful seeing that she had been cremated secretly cook thought that mr timothy would be upsethe had always been so set against barrel organs how many times had she not said drat the thing there it is again smither youd better run up and see what you can do and in her heart she would so have enjoyed the tunes if she hadnt known that mr timothy would ring the bell in a minute and say here take him a halfpenny and tell him to move on often they had been obliged to add threepence of their own before the man would gotimothy had ever underrated the value of emotion luckily he had taken the organs for bluebottles in his last years which had been a comfort and they had been able to enjoy the tunes but a harp cook wondered it was a change and mr timothy had never liked change but she did not speak of this to smither who did so take a line of her own in regard to heaven that it quite put one about sometimes  she cried while timothy was being prepared and they all had sherry afterwards out of the yearly christmas bottle which would not be needed now ah dear she had been there fiveandforty years and smither nineandthirty and now they would be going to a tiny house in tooting to live on their savings and what miss hester had so kindly left themfor to take fresh service after the glorious pastno but they would like just to see mr soames again and mrs dartie and miss francie and miss euphemia and even if they had to take their own cab they felt they must go to the funeral for six years mr timothy had been their baby getting younger and younger every day till at last he had been too young to live  they spent the regulation hours of waiting in polishing and dusting in catching the one mouse left and asphyxiating the last beetle so as to leave it nice discussing with each other what they would buy at the sale miss anns workbox miss juleys that is mrs julias seaweed album the firescreen miss hester had crewelled and mr timothys hairlittle golden curls glued into a black frame oh they must have thoseonly the price of things had gone up so  it fell to soames to issue invitations for the funeral he had them drawn up by gradman in his officeonly blood relations and no flowers six carriages were ordered the will would be read afterwards at the house  he arrived at eleven oclock to see that all was ready at a quarter past old gradman came in black gloves and crape on his hat he and soames stood in the drawingroom waiting at halfpast eleven the carriages drew up in a long row but no one else appeared gradman said  it surprises me mr soames i posted them myself  i dont know said soames hed lost touch with the family  soames had often noticed in old days how much more neighbourly his family were to the dead than to the living but now the way they had flocked to fleurs wedding and abstained from timothys funeral seemed to show some vital change there might of course be another reason for soames felt that if he had not known the contents of timothys will he might have stayed away himself through delicacy timothy had left a lot of money with nobody in particular to leave it to they mightnt like to seem to expect something  at twelve oclock the procession left the door timothy alone in the first carriage under glass then soames alone then gradman alone then cook and smither together they started at a walk but were soon trotting under a bright sky at the entrance to highgate cemetery they were delayed by service in the chapel soames would have liked to stay outside in the sunshine he didnt believe a word of it on the other hand it was a form of insurance which could not safely be neglected in case there might be something in it after all  they walked up two and twohe and gradman cook and smitherto the family vault it was not very distinguished for the funeral of the last old forsyte  he took gradman into his carriage on the way back to the bayswater road with a certain glow in his heart he had a surprise in pickle for the old chap who had served the forsytes fourandfifty yearsa treat that was entirely his doing how well he remembered saying to timothy the day after aunt hesters funeral well uncle timothy theres gradman hes taken a lot of trouble for the family what do you say to leaving him five thousand and his surprise seeing the difficulty there had been in getting timothy to leave anything when timothy had nodded and now the old chap would be as pleased as punch for mrs gradman he knew had a weak heart and their son had lost a leg in the war it was extraordinarily gratifying to soames to have left him five thousand pounds of timothys money they sat down together in the little drawingroom whose wallslike a vision of heavenwere skyblue and gold with every pictureframe unnaturally bright and every speck of dust removed from every piece of furniture to read that little masterpiecethe will of timothy with his back to the light in aunt hesters chair soames faced gradman with his face to the light on aunt anns sofa and crossing his legs began  this is the last will and testament of me timothy forsyte of the bower bayswater road london i appoint my nephew soames forsyte of the shelter mapledurham and thomas gradman of 159 folly road highgate hereinafter called my trustees to be the trustees and executors of this my will to the said soames forsyte i leave the sum of one thousand pounds free of legacy duty and to the said thomas gradman i leave the sum of five thousand pounds free of legacy duty  soames paused old gradman was leaning forward convulsively gripping a stout black knee with each of his thick hands his mouth had fallen open so that the gold fillings of three teeth gleamed his eyes were blinking two tears rolled slowly out of them soames read hastily on  all the rest of my property of whatsoever description i bequeath to my trustees upon trust to convert and hold the same upon the following trusts namely to pay thereout all my debts funeral expenses and outgoings of any kind in connection with my will and to hold the residue thereof in trust for that male lineal descendant of my father jolyon forsyte by his marriage with ann pierce who after the decease of all lineal descendants whether male or female of my said father by his said marriage in being at the time of my death shall last attain the age of twentyone years absolutely it being my desire that my property shall be nursed to the extreme limit permitted by the laws of england for the benefit of such male lineal descendant as aforesaid  soames read the investment and attestation clauses and ceasing looked at gradman the old fellow was wiping his brow with a large handkerchief whose brilliant colour supplied a sudden festive tinge to the proceedings  my word mr soames he said and it was clear that the lawyer in him had utterly wiped out the man my word why there are two babies now and some quite young childrenif one of them lives to be eightyits not a great ageand add twentyonethats a hundred years and mr timothy worth a hundred and fifty thousand pound if hes worth a penny compound interest at five per cent doubles you in fourteen years in fourteen years three hundred thousandsix hundred thousand in twentyeighttwelve hundred thousand in fortytwotwentyfour hundred thousand in fiftysixfour million eight hundred thousand in seventynine million six hundred thousand in eightyfourwhy in a hundred years itll be twenty million and we shant live to see it it is a will  soames said dryly anything may happen the state might take the lot theyre capable of anything in these days  and carry five said gradman to himself i forgotmr timothys in consols we shant get more than two per cent with this income tax to be on the safe side say seven million still thats a pretty penny  soames rose and handed him the will youre going into the city take care of that and do whats necessary advertise but there are no debts whens the sale  tuesday week said gradman life or lives in bein and twentyone years afterwardsits a long way off but im glad hes left it in the family   the salenot at jobsons in view of the victorian nature of the effectswas far more freely attended than the funeral though not by cook and smither for soames had taken it on himself to give them their hearts desires winifred was present euphemia and francie and eustace had come in his car the miniatures barbizons and j r drawings had been bought in by soames and relics of no marketable value were set aside in an offroom for members of the family who cared to have mementos these were the only restrictions upon bidding characterised by an almost tragic langour not one piece of furniture no picture or porcelain figure appealed to modern taste the hummingbirds had fallen like autumn leaves when taken from where they had not hummed for sixty years it was painful to soames to see the chairs his aunts had sat on the little grand piano they had practically never played the books whose outsides they had gazed at the china they had dusted the curtains they had drawn the hearthrug which had warmed their feet above all the beds they had lain and died insold to little dealers and the housewives of fulham and yetwhat could one do buy them and stick them in a lumberroom no they had to go the way of all flesh and furniture and be worn out but when they put up aunt anns sofa and were going to knock it down for thirty shillings he cried out suddenly five pounds the sensation was considerable and the sofa his  when that little sale was over in the fusty saleroom and those victorian ashes scattered he went out into the misty october sunshine feeling as if cosiness had died out of the world and the board to let was up indeed revolutions on the horizon fleur in spain no comfort in annette no timothys on the bayswater road in the irritable desolation of his soul he went into the goupenor gallery that chap jolyons watercolours were on view there he went in to look down his nose at themit might give him some faint satisfaction the news had trickled through from june to vals wife from her to val from val to his mother from her to soames that the housethe fatal house at robin hillwas for sale and irene going to join her boy out in british columbia or some such place for one wild moment the thought had come to soames why shouldnt i buy it back i meant it for my no sooner come than gone too lugubrious a triumph with two many humiliating memories for himself and fleur she would never live there after what had happened no the place must go its way to some peer or profiteer it had been a bone of contention from the first the shell of the feud and with the woman gone it was an empty shell for sale or to let with his minds eye he could see that board raised high above the ivied wall which he had built  he passed through the first of the two rooms in the gallery there was certainly a body of work and now that the fellow was dead it did not seem so trivial the drawings were pleasing enough with quite a sense of atmosphere and something individual in the brush work his father and my father he and i his child and mine thought soames so it had gone on and all about that woman softened by the events of the past week affected by the melancholy beauty of the autumn day soames came nearer than he had ever been to realisation of that truthpassing the understanding of a forsyte purethat the body of beauty has a spiritual essence uncapturable save by a devotion which thinks not of self after all he was near that truth in his devotion to his daughter perhaps that made him understand a little how he had missed the prize and there among the drawings of his kinsman who had attained to that which he had found beyond his reach he thought of him and her with a tolerance which surprised him but he did not buy a drawing  just as he passed the seat of custom on his return to the outer air he met with a contingency which had not been entirely absent from his mind when he went into the galleryirene herself coming in so she had not gone yet and was still paying farewell visits to that fellows remains he subdued the little involuntary leap of his subconsciousness the mechanical reaction of his senses to the charm of this onceowned woman and passed her with averted eyes but when he had gone by he could not for the life of him help looking back this then was finalitythe heat and stress of his life the madness and the longing thereof the long the only defeat he had known would be over when she faded from his view this time even such memories had their own queer aching value she too was looking back suddenly she lifted her gloved hand her lips smiled faintly her dark eyes seemed to speak it was the turn of soames to make no answer to that smile and that little farewell wave he went out into the fashionable street quivering from head to foot he knew what she had meant to say now that i am going for ever out of the reach of you and yoursforgive me i wish you well that was the meaning last sign of that terrible realitypassing morality duty common senseher aversion from him who had owned her body but had never touched her spirit or her heart it hurt yesmore than if she had kept her mask unmoved her hand unlifted  three days later in that fastyellowing october soames took a taxicab to highgate cemetery and mounted through its white forest to the forsyte vault close to the cedar above catacombs and columbaria tall ugly and individual it looked like an apex of the competitive system he could remember a discussion wherein swithin had advocated the addition to its face of the pheasant proper the proposal had been rejected in favour of a wreath in stone above the stark words the family vault of jolyon forsyte 1850 it was in good order all trace of the recent interment had been removed and its sober grey gloomed reposefully in the sunshine the whole family lay there now except old jolyons wife who had gone back under a contract to her own family vault in suffolk old jolyon himself lying at robin hill and susan hayman cremated so that none knew where she might be soames gazed at it with satisfactionmassive needing little attention and this was important for he was well aware that no one would attend to it when he himself was gone and he would have to be looking out for lodgings soon he might have twenty years before him but one never knew twenty years without an aunt or uncle with a wife of whom one had better not know anything with a daughter gone from home his mood inclined to melancholy and retrospection this cemetery was quite full nowof people with extraordinary names buried in extraordinary taste still they had a fine view up here right over london annette had once given him a story to read by that frenchman maupassanta most lugubrious concern where all the skeletons emerged from their graves one night and all the pious inscriptions on the stones were altered to descriptions of their sins not a true story at all he didnt know about the french but there was not much real harm in english people except their teeth and their taste which were certainly deplorable the family vault of jolyon forsyte 1850 a lot of people had been buried here since thena lot of english life crumbled to mould and dust the boom of an airplane passing under the goldtinted clouds caused him to lift his eyes the deuce of a lot of expansion had gone on but it all came back to a cemeteryto a name and a date on a tomb and he thought with a curious pride that he and his family had done little or nothing to help this feverish expansion good solid middlemen they had gone to work with dignity to manage and possess superior dosset indeed had built in a dreadful and jolyon painted in a doubtful period but so far as he remembered not another of them all had soiled his hands by creating anythingunless you counted val dartie and his horsebreeding collectors solicitors barristers merchants publishers accountants directors land agents even soldiersthere they had been the country had expanded as it were in spite of them they had checked controlled defended and taken advantage of the processand when you considered how superior dosset had begun life with next to nothing and his lineal descendants already owned what old gradman estimated at between a million and a million and a half it was not so bad and yet he sometimes felt as if the family bolt was shot their possessive instinct dying out they seemed unable to make moneythis fourth generation they were going into art literature farming or the army or just living on what was left themthey had no push and no tenacity they would die out if they didnt take care  soames turned from the vault and faced towards the breeze the air up here would be delicious if only he could rid his nerves of the feeling that mortality was in it he gazed restlessly at the crosses and the urns the angels the immortelles the flowers gaudy or withering and suddenly he noticed a spot which seemed so different from anything else up there that he was obliged to walk the few necessary yards and look at it a sober corner with a massive queershaped cross of grey roughhewn granite guarded by four dark yewtrees the spot was free from the pressure of the other graves having a little boxhedged garden on the far side arid in front a goldening birchtree this oasis in the desert of conventional graves appealed to the aesthetic sense of soames and he sat down there in the sunshine through those trembling gold birch leaves he gazed out at london and yielded to the waves of memory he thought of irene in montpellier square when her hair was rustygolden and her white shoulders hisirene the prize of his lovepassion resistant to his ownership he saw bosinneys body lying in that white mortuary and irene sitting on the sofa looking at her picture with the eyes of a dying bird again he thought of her by the little green niobe in the bois de boulogne once more rejecting him his fancy took him on beside his drifting river on the november day when fleur was to be born took him to the dead leaves floating on the greentinged water and the snakeheaded weed for ever swaying and nosing sinuous blind tethered and on again to the window opened to the cold starry night above hyde park with his father lying dead his fancy darted to that picture of the future town to that boys and fleurs first meeting to the blueish trail of prosper profonds cigar and fleur in the window pointing down to where the fellow prowled to the sight of irene and that dead fellow sitting side by side in the stand at lords to her and that boy at robin hill to the sofa where fleur lay crushed up in the corner to her lips pressed into his cheek and her farewell daddy and suddenly he saw again irenes greygloved hand waving its last gesture of release  he sat there a long time dreaming his career faithful to the scut of his possessive instinct warming himself even with its failures  to letthe forsyte age and way of life when a man owned his soul his investments and his woman without check or question and now the state had or would have his investments his woman had herself and god knew who had his soul to letthat sane and simple creed  the waters of change were foaming in carrying the promise of new forms only when their destructive flood should have passed its full he sat there subconscious of them but with his thoughts resolutely set on the pastas a man might ride into a wild night with his face to the tail of his galloping horse athwart the victorian dykes the waters were rolling on property manners and morals on melody and the old forms of artwaters bringing to his mouth a salt taste as of blood lapping to the foot of this highgate hill where victorianism lay buried and sitting there high up on its most individual spot soameslike a figure of investmentrefused their restless sounds instinctively he would not fight themthere was in him too much primeval wisdom of man the possessive animal they would quiet down when they had fulfilled their tidal fever of dispossessing and destroying when the creations and the properties of others were sufficiently broken and dejectedthey would lapse and ebb and fresh forms would rise based on an instinct older than the fever of changethe instinct of home  je men fiche said prosper profond soames did not say je men ficheit was french and the fellow was a thorn in his sidebut deep down he knew that change was only the interval of death between two forms of life destruction necessary to make room for fresher property what though the board was up and cosiness to letsome one would come along and take it again some day  and only one thing really troubled him sitting therethe melancholy craving in his heartbecause the sun was like enchantment on his face and on the clouds and on the golden birch leaves and the winds rustle was so gentle and the yewtree green so dark and the sickle of a moon pale in the sky  ah he might wish and wish and never get itthe beauty and the loving in the world     the end
