59019796	the wreck of the golden mary   the wreck   i was apprenticed to the sea when i was twelve years old and i have encountered a great deal of rough weather both literal and metaphorical it has always been my opinion since i first possessed such a thing as an opinion that the man who knows only one subject is next tiresome to the man who knows no subject  therefore in the course of my life i have taught myself whatever i could and although i am not an educated man i am able i am thankful to say to have an intelligent interest in most things  a person might suppose from reading the above that i am in the habit of holding forth about number one  that is not the case  just as if i was to come into a room among strangers and must either be introduced or introduce myself so i have taken the liberty of passing these few remarks simply and plainly that it may be known who and what i am  i will add no more of the sort than that my name is william george ravender that i was born at penrith half a year after my own father was drowned and that i am on the second day of this present blessed christmas week of one thousand eight hundred and fiftysix fiftysix years of age  when the rumour first went flying up and down that there was gold in californiawhich as most people know was before it was discovered in the british colony of australiai was in the west indies trading among the islands  being in command and likewise partowner of a smart schooner i had my work cut out for me and i was doing it  consequently gold in california was no business of mine  but by the time when i came home to england again the thing was as clear as your hand held up before you at noonday  there was californian gold in the museums and in the goldsmiths shops and the very first time i went upon change i met a friend of mine a seafaring man like myself with a californian nugget hanging to his watchchain  i handled it  it was as like a peeled walnut with bits unevenly broken off here and there and then electrotyped all over as ever i saw anything in my life  i am a single man she was too good for this world and for me and she died six weeks before our marriageday so when i am ashore i live in my house at poplar  my house at poplar is taken care of and kept ship shape by an old lady who was my mothers maid before i was born  she is as handsome and as upright as any old lady in the world  she is as fond of me as if she had ever had an only son and i was he  well do i know wherever i sail that she never lays down her head at night without having said merciful lord bless and preserve william george ravender and send him safe home through christ our saviour  i have thought of it in many a dangerous moment when it has done me no harm i am sure  in my house at poplar along with this old lady i lived quiet for best part of a year having had a long spell of it among the islands and having which was very uncommon in me taken the fever rather badly  at last being strong and hearty and having read every book i could lay hold of right out i was walking down leadenhall street in the city of london thinking of turningto again when i met what i call smithick and watersby of liverpool  i chanced to lift up my eyes from looking in at a ships chronometer in a window and i saw him bearing down upon me head on  it is personally neither smithick nor watersby that i here mention nor was i ever acquainted with any man of either of those names nor do i think that there has been any one of either of those names in that liverpool house for years back  but it is in reality the house itself that i refer to and a wiser merchant or a truer gentleman never stepped  my dear captain ravender says he  of all the men on earth i wanted to see you most  i was on my way to you  well says i  that looks as if you were to see me dont it  with that i put my arm in his and we walked on towards the royal exchange and when we got there walked up and down at the back of it where the clocktower is  we walked an hour and more for he had much to say to me  he had a scheme for chartering a new ship of their own to take out cargo to the diggers and emigrants in california and to buy and bring back gold  into the particulars of that scheme i will not enter and i have no right to enter  all i say of it is that it was a very original one a very fine one a very sound one and a very lucrative one beyond doubt  he imparted it to me as freely as if i had been a part of himself  after doing so he made me the handsomest sharing offer that ever was made to me boy or manor i believe to any other captain in the merchant navyand he took this round turn to finish with  ravender you are well aware that the lawlessness of that coast and country at present is as special as the circumstances in which it is placed  crews of vessels outwardbound desert as soon as they make the land crews of vessels homewardbound ship at enormous wages with the express intention of murdering the captain and seizing the gold freight no man can trust another and the devil seems let loose  now says he you know my opinion of you and you know i am only expressing it and with no singularity when i tell you that you are almost the only man on whose integrity discretion and energy c c  for i dont want to repeat what he said though i was and am sensible of it  notwithstanding my being as i have mentioned quite ready for a voyage still i had some doubts of this voyage  of course i knew without being told that there were peculiar difficulties and dangers in it a long way over and above those which attend all voyages  it must not be supposed that i was afraid to face them but in my opinion a man has no manly motive or sustainment in his own breast for facing dangers unless he has well considered what they are and is able quietly to say to himself none of these perils can now take me by surprise i shall know what to do for the best in any of them all the rest lies in the higher and greater hands to which i humbly commit myself  on this principle i have so attentively considered regarding it as my duty all the hazards i have ever been able to think of in the ordinary way of storm shipwreck and fire at sea that i hope i should be prepared to do in any of those cases whatever could be done to save the lives intrusted to my charge  as i was thoughtful my good friend proposed that he should leave me to walk there as long as i liked and that i should dine with him byandby at his club in pall mall  i accepted the invitation and i walked up and down there quarterdeck fashion a matter of a couple of hours now and then looking up at the weathercock as i might have looked up aloft and now and then taking a look into cornhill as i might have taken a look over the side  all dinnertime and all after dinnertime we talked it over again  i gave him my views of his plan and he very much approved of the same  i told him i had nearly decided but not quite  well well says he come down to liverpool tomorrow with me and see the golden mary  i liked the name her name was mary and she was golden if golden stands for good so i began to feel that it was almost done when i said i would go to liverpool  on the next morning but one we were on board the golden mary  i might have known from his asking me to come down and see her what she was  i declare her to have been the completest and most exquisite beauty that ever i set my eyes upon  we had inspected every timber in her and had come back to the gangway to go ashore from the dockbasin when i put out my hand to my friend touch upon it says i and touch heartily  i take command of this ship and i am hers and yours if i can get john steadiman for my chief mate  john steadiman had sailed with me four voyages  the first voyage john was third mate out to china and came home second  the other three voyages he was my first officer  at this time of chartering the golden mary he was aged thirtytwo  a brisk bright blueeyed fellow a very neat figure and rather under the middle size never out of the way and never in it a face that pleased everybody and that all children took to a habit of going about singing as cheerily as a blackbird and a perfect sailor  we were in one of those liverpool hackneycoaches in less than a minute and we cruised about in her upwards of three hours looking for john john had come home from van diemens land barely a month before and i had heard of him as taking a frisk in liverpool  we asked after him among many other places at the two boardinghouses he was fondest of and we found he had had a weeks spell at each of them but he had gone here and gone there and had set off to lay out on the maintogallant yard of the highest welsh mountain so he had told the people of the house and where he might be then or when he might come back nobody could tell us  but it was surprising to be sure to see how every face brightened the moment there was mention made of the name of mr steadiman  we were taken aback at meeting with no better luck and we had wore ship and put her head for my friends when as we were jogging through the streets i clap my eyes on john himself coming out of a toyshop  he was carrying a little boy and conducting two uncommon pretty women to their coach and he told me afterwards that he had never in his life seen one of the three before but that he was so taken with them on looking in at the toyshop while they were buying the child a cranky noahs ark very much down by the head that he had gone in and asked the ladies permission to treat him to a tolerably correct cutter there was in the window in order that such a handsome boy might not grow up with a lubberly idea of naval architecture  we stood off and on until the ladies coachman began to give way and then we hailed john  on his coming aboard of us i told him very gravely what i had said to my friend  it struck him as he said himself amidships  he was quite shaken by it  captain ravender were john steadimans words such an opinion from you is true commendation and ill sail round the world with you for twenty years if you hoist the signal and stand by you for ever  and now indeed i felt that it was done and that the golden mary was afloat  grass never grew yet under the feet of smithick and watersby  the riggers were out of that ship in a fortnights time and we had begun taking in cargo  john was always aboard seeing everything stowed with his own eyes and whenever i went aboard myself early or late whether he was below in the hold or on deck at the hatchway or overhauling his cabin nailing up pictures in it of the blush roses of england the blue belles of scotland and the female shamrock of ireland of a certainty i heard john singing like a blackbird  we had room for twenty passengers  our sailing advertisement was no sooner out than we might have taken these twenty times over  in entering our men i and john both together picked them and we entered none but good handsas good as were to be found in that port  and so in a good ship of the best build well owned well arranged well officered well manned well found in all respects we parted with our pilot at a quarter past four oclock in the afternoon of the seventh of march one thousand eight hundred and fiftyone and stood with a fair wind out to sea  it may be easily believed that up to that time i had had no leisure to be intimate with my passengers  the most of them were then in their berths seasick however in going among them telling them what was good for them persuading them not to be there but to come up on deck and feel the breeze and in rousing them with a joke or a comfortable word i made acquaintance with them perhaps in a more friendly and confidential way from the first than i might have done at the cabin table  of my passengers i need only particularise just at present a bright eyed blooming young wife who was going out to join her husband in california taking with her their only child a little girl of three years old whom he had never seen a sedate young woman in black some five years older about thirty as i should say who was going out to join a brother and an old gentleman a good deal like a hawk if his eyes had been better and not so red who was always talking morning noon and night about the gold discovery  but whether he was making the voyage thinking his old arms could dig for gold or whether his speculation was to buy it or to barter for it or to cheat for it or to snatch it anyhow from other people was his secret  he kept his secret  these three and the child were the soonest well  the child was a most engaging child to be sure and very fond of me though i am bound to admit that john steadiman and i were borne on her pretty little books in reverse order and that he was captain there and i was mate  it was beautiful to watch her with john and it was beautiful to watch john with her  few would have thought it possible to see john playing at bopeep round the mast that he was the man who had caught up an iron bar and struck a malay and a maltese dead as they were gliding with their knives down the cabin stair aboard the barque old england when the captain lay ill in his cot off saugar point  but he was and give him his back against a bulwark he would have done the same by half a dozen of them the name of the young mother was mrs atherfield the name of the young lady in black was miss coleshaw and the name of the old gentleman was mr rarx  as the child had a quantity of shining fair hair clustering in curls all about her face and as her name was lucy steadiman gave her the name of the golden lucy  so we had the golden lucy and the golden mary and john kept up the idea to that extent as he and the child went playing about the decks that i believe she used to think the ship was alive somehowa sister or companion going to the same place as herself  she liked to be by the wheel and in fine weather i have often stood by the man whose trick it was at the wheel only to hear her sitting near my feet talking to the ship  never had a child such a doll before i suppose but she made a doll of the golden mary and used to dress her up by tying ribbons and little bits of finery to the belayingpins and nobody ever moved them unless it was to save them from being blown away  of course i took charge of the two young women and i called them my dear and they never minded knowing that whatever i said was said in a fatherly and protecting spirit  i gave them their places on each side of me at dinner mrs atherfield on my right and miss coleshaw on my left and i directed the unmarried lady to serve out the breakfast and the married lady to serve out the tea  likewise i said to my black steward in their presence tom snow these two ladies are equally the mistresses of this house and do you obey their orders equally at which tom laughed and they all laughed  old mr rarx was not a pleasant man to look at nor yet to talk to or to be with for no one could help seeing that he was a sordid and selfish character and that he had warped further and further out of the straight with time  not but what he was on his best behaviour with us as everybody was for we had no bickering among us forard or aft  i only mean to say he was not the man one would have chosen for a messmate  if choice there had been one might even have gone a few points out of ones course to say no  not him  but there was one curious inconsistency in mr rarx  that was that he took an astonishing interest in the child  he looked and i may add he was one of the last of men to care at all for a child or to care much for any human creature  still he went so far as to be habitually uneasy if the child was long on deck out of his sight  he was always afraid of her falling overboard or falling down a hatchway or of a block or what not coming down upon her from the rigging in the working of the ship or of her getting some hurt or other  he used to look at her and touch her as if she was something precious to him  he was always solicitous about her not injuring her health and constantly entreated her mother to be careful of it  this was so much the more curious because the child did not like him but used to shrink away from him and would not even put out her hand to him without coaxing from others  i believe that every soul on board frequently noticed this and not one of us understood it  however it was such a plain fact that john steadiman said more than once when old mr rarx was not within earshot that if the golden mary felt a tenderness for the dear old gentleman she carried in her lap she must be bitterly jealous of the golden lucy  before i go any further with this narrative i will state that our ship was a barque of three hundred tons carrying a crew of eighteen men a second mate in addition to john a carpenter an armourer or smith and two apprentices one a scotch boy poor little fellow  we had three boats the longboat capable of carrying twentyfive men the cutter capable of carrying fifteen and the surfboat capable of carrying ten i put down the capacity of these boats according to the numbers they were really meant to hold  we had tastes of bad weather and headwinds of course but on the whole we had as fine a run as any reasonable man could expect for sixty days i then began to enter two remarks in the ships log and in my journal first that there was an unusual and amazing quantity of ice second that the nights were most wonderfully dark in spite of the ice  for five days and a half it seemed quite useless and hopeless to alter the ships course so as to stand out of the way of this ice  i made what southing i could but all that time we were beset by it  mrs atherfield after standing by me on deck once looking for some time in an awed manner at the great bergs that surrounded us said in a whisper o captain ravender it looks as if the whole solid earth had changed into ice and broken up  i said to her laughing i dont wonder that it does to your inexperienced eyes my dear  but i had never seen a twentieth part of the quantity and in reality i was pretty much of her opinion  however at two pm on the afternoon of the sixth day that is to say when we were sixtysix days out john steadiman who had gone aloft sang out from the top that the sea was clear ahead  before four pm a strong breeze springing up right astern we were in open water at sunset the breeze then freshening into half a gale of wind and the golden mary being a very fast sailer we went before the wind merrily all night  i had thought it impossible that it could be darker than it had been until the sun moon and stars should fall out of the heavens and time should be destroyed but it had been next to light in comparison with what it was now  the darkness was so profound that looking into it was painful and oppressivelike looking without a ray of light into a dense black bandage put as close before the eyes as it could be without touching them  i doubled the lookout and john and i stood in the bow sidebyside never leaving it all night  yet i should no more have known that he was near me when he was silent without putting out my arm and touching him than i should if he had turned in and been fast asleep below  we were not so much looking out all of us as listening to the utmost both with our eyes and ears  next day i found that the mercury in the barometer which had risen steadily since we cleared the ice remained steady  i had had very good observations with now and then the interruption of a day or so since our departure  i got the sun at noon and found that we were in lat 58 degrees s long 60 degrees w off new south shetland in the neighbourhood of cape horn  we were sixtyseven days out that day  the ships reckoning was accurately worked and made up  the ship did her duty admirably all on board were well and all hands were as smart efficient and contented as it was possible to be  when the night came on again as dark as before it was the eighth night i had been on deck  nor had i taken more than a very little sleep in the daytime my station being always near the helm and often at it while we were among the ice  few but those who have tried it can imagine the difficulty and pain of only keeping the eyes openphysically openunder such circumstances in such darkness  they get struck by the darkness and blinded by the darkness  they make patterns in it and they flash in it as if they had gone out of your head to look at you  on the turn of midnight john steadiman who was alert and fresh for i had always made him turn in by day said to me captain ravender i entreat of you to go below  i am sure you can hardly stand and your voice is getting weak sir  go below and take a little rest  ill call you if a block chafes  i said to john in answer well well john  let us wait till the turn of one oclock before we talk about that  i had just had one of the ships lanterns held up that i might see how the night went by my watch and it was then twenty minutes after twelve  at five minutes before one john sang out to the boy to bring the lantern again and when i told him once more what the time was entreated and prayed of me to go below  captain ravender says he alls well we cant afford to have you laid up for a single hour and i respectfully and earnestly beg of you to go below  the end of it was that i agreed to do so on the understanding that if i failed to come up of my own accord within three hours i was to be punctually called  having settled that i left john in charge  but i called him to me once afterwards to ask him a question  i had been to look at the barometer and had seen the mercury still perfectly steady and had come up the companion again to take a last look about meif i can use such a word in reference to such darknesswhen i thought that the waves as the golden mary parted them and shook them off had a hollow sound in them something that i fancied was a rather unusual reverberation  i was standing by the quarterdeck rail on the starboard side when i called john aft to me and bade him listen  he did so with the greatest attention  turning to me he then said rely upon it captain ravender you have been without rest too long and the novelty is only in the state of your sense of hearing  i thought so too by that time and i think so now though i can never know for absolute certain in this world whether it was or not  when i left john steadiman in charge the ship was still going at a great rate through the water  the wind still blew right astern  though she was making great way she was under shortened sail and had no more than she could easily carry  all was snug and nothing complained  there was a pretty sea running but not a very high sea neither nor at all a confused one  i turned in as we seamen say all standing  the meaning of that is i did not pull my clothes offno not even so much as my coat though i did my shoes for my feet were badly swelled with the deck  there was a little swinglamp alight in my cabin  i thought as i looked at it before shutting my eyes that i was so tired of darkness and troubled by darkness that i could have gone to sleep best in the midst of a million of flaming gaslights  that was the last thought i had before i went off except the prevailing thought that i should not be able to get to sleep at all  i dreamed that i was back at penrith again and was trying to get round the church which had altered its shape very much since i last saw it and was cloven all down the middle of the steeple in a most singular manner  why i wanted to get round the church i dont know but i was as anxious to do it as if my life depended on it  indeed i believe it did in the dream  for all that i could not get round the church  i was still trying when i came against it with a violent shock and was flung out of my cot against the ships side  shrieks and a terrific outcry struck me far harder than the bruising timbers and amidst sounds of grinding and crashing and a heavy rushing and breaking of watersounds i understood too welli made my way on deck  it was not an easy thing to do for the ship heeled over frightfully and was beating in a furious manner  i could not see the men as i went forward but i could hear that they were hauling in sail in disorder  i had my trumpet in my hand and after directing and encouraging them in this till it was done i hailed first john steadiman and then my second mate mr william rames  both answered clearly and steadily  now i had practised them and all my crew as i have ever made it a custom to practise all who sail with me to take certain stations and wait my orders in case of any unexpected crisis  when my voice was heard hailing and their voices were heard answering i was aware through all the noises of the ship and sea and all the crying of the passengers below that there was a pause  are you ready ramesay ay sirthen light up for gods sake  in a moment he and another were burning bluelights and the ship and all on board seemed to be enclosed in a mist of light under a great black dome  the light shone up so high that i could see the huge iceberg upon which we had struck cloven at the top and down the middle exactly like penrith church in my dream  at the same moment i could see the watch last relieved crowding up and down on deck i could see mrs atherfield and miss coleshaw thrown about on the top of the companion as they struggled to bring the child up from below i could see that the masts were going with the shock and the beating of the ship i could see the frightful breach stove in on the starboard side half the length of the vessel and the sheathing and timbers spirting up i could see that the cutter was disabled in a wreck of broken fragments and i could see every eye turned upon me  it is my belief that if there had been ten thousand eyes there i should have seen them all with their different looks  and all this in a moment  but you must consider what a moment  i saw the men as they looked at me fall towards their appointed stations like good men and true  if she had not righted they could have done very little there or anywhere but dienot that it is little for a man to die at his posti mean they could have done nothing to save the passengers and themselves  happily however the violence of the shock with which we had so determinedly borne down direct on that fatal iceberg as if it had been our destination instead of our destruction had so smashed and pounded the ship that she got off in this same instant and righted  i did not want the carpenter to tell me she was filling and going down i could see and hear that  i gave rames the word to lower the longboat and the surfboat and i myself told off the men for each duty  not one hung back or came before the other  i now whispered to john steadiman john i stand at the gangway here to see every soul on board safe over the side  you shall have the next post of honour and shall be the last but one to leave the ship  bring up the passengers and range them behind me and put what provision and water you can got at in the boats  cast your eye forard john and youll see you have not a moment to lose  my noble fellows got the boats over the side as orderly as i ever saw boats lowered with any sea running and when they were launched two or three of the nearest men in them as they held on rising and falling with the swell called out looking up at me captain ravender if anything goes wrong with us and you are saved remember we stood by youwell all stand by one another ashore yet please god my lads says i  hold on bravely and be tender with the women  the women were an example to us  they trembled very much but they were quiet and perfectly collected  kiss me captain ravender says mrs atherfield and god in heaven bless you you good man  my dear says i those words are better for me than a lifeboat  i held her child in my arms till she was in the boat and then kissed the child and handed her safe down  i now said to the people in her you have got your freight my lads all but me and i am not coming yet awhile  pull away from the ship and keep off  that was the longboat  old mr rarx was one of her complement and he was the only passenger who had greatly misbehaved since the ship struck others had been a little wild which was not to be wondered at and not very blamable but he had made a lamentation and uproar which it was dangerous for the people to hear as there is always contagion in weakness and selfishness  his incessant cry had been that he must not be separated from the child that he couldnt see the child and that he and the child must go together  he had even tried to wrest the child out of my arms that he might keep her in his  mr rarx said i to him when it came to that i have a loaded pistol in my pocket and if you dont stand out of the gangway and keep perfectly quiet i shall shoot you through the heart if you have got one  says he you wont do murder captain ravender   no sir says i i wont murder fortyfour people to humour you but ill shoot you to save them  after that he was quiet and stood shivering a little way off until i named him to go over the side  the longboat being cast off the surfboat was soon filled  there only remained aboard the golden mary john mullion the man who had kept on burning the bluelights and who had lighted every new one at every old one before it went out as quietly as if he had been at an illumination john steadiman and myself  i hurried those two into the surfboat called to them to keep off and waited with a grateful and relieved heart for the longboat to come and take me in if she could  i looked at my watch and it showed me by the bluelight ten minutes past two  they lost no time  as soon as she was near enough i swung myself into her and called to the men with a will lads  shes reeling  we were not an inch too far out of the inner vortex of her going down when by the bluelight which john mullion still burnt in the bow of the surfboat we saw her lurch and plunge to the bottom headforemost  the child cried weeping wildly o the dear golden mary  o look at her  save her  save the poor golden mary  and then the light burnt out and the black dome seemed to come down upon us  i suppose if we had all stood atop of a mountain and seen the whole remainder of the world sink away from under us we could hardly have felt more shocked and solitary than we did when we knew we were alone on the wide ocean and that the beautiful ship in which most of us had been securely asleep within half an hour was gone for ever  there was an awful silence in our boat and such a kind of palsy on the rowers and the man at the rudder that i felt they were scarcely keeping her before the sea  i spoke out then and said let every one here thank the lord for our preservation  all the voices answered even the childs we thank the lord  i then said the lords prayer and all hands said it after me with a solemn murmuring  then i gave the word cheerily o men cheerily and i felt that they were handling the boat again as a boat ought to be handled  the surfboat now burnt another bluelight to show us where they were and we made for her and laid ourselves as nearly alongside of her as we dared  i had always kept my boats with a coil or two of good stout stuff in each of them so both boats had a rope at hand  we made a shift with much labour and trouble to got near enough to one another to divide the bluelights they were no use after that night for the seawater soon got at them and to get a towrope out between us  all night long we kept together sometimes obliged to cast off the rope and sometimes getting it out again and all of us wearying for the morningwhich appeared so long in coming that old mr rarx screamed out in spite of his fears of me the world is drawing to an end and the sun will never rise any more  when the day broke i found that we were all huddled together in a miserable manner  we were deep in the water being as i found on mustering thirtyone in number or at least six too many  in the surf boat they were fourteen in number being at least four too many  the first thing i did was to get myself passed to the rudderwhich i took from that timeand to get mrs atherfield her child and miss coleshaw passed on to sit next me  as to old mr rarx i put him in the bow as far from us as i could  and i put some of the best men near us in order that if i should drop there might be a skilful hand ready to take the helm  the sea moderating as the sun came up though the sky was cloudy and wild we spoke the other boat to know what stores they had and to overhaul what we had  i had a compass in my pocket a small telescope a doublebarrelled pistol a knife and a firebox and matches  most of my men had knives and some had a little tobacco some a pipe as well  we had a mug among us and an iron spoon  as to provisions there were in my boat two bags of biscuit one piece of raw beef one piece of raw pork a bag of coffee roasted but not ground thrown in i imagine by mistake for something else two small casks of water and about halfa gallon of rum in a keg  the surfboat having rather more rum than we and fewer to drink it gave us as i estimated another quart into our keg  in return we gave them three double handfuls of coffee tied up in a piece of a handkerchief they reported that they had aboard besides a bag of biscuit a piece of beef a small cask of water a small box of lemons and a dutch cheese  it took a long time to make these exchanges and they were not made without risk to both parties the sea running quite high enough to make our approaching near to one another very hazardous  in the bundle with the coffee i conveyed to john steadiman who had a ships compass with him a paper written in pencil and torn from my pocketbook containing the course i meant to steer in the hope of making land or being picked up by some vesseli say in the hope though i had little hope of either deliverance  i then sang out to him so as all might hear that if we two boats could live or die together we would but that if we should be parted by the weather and join company no more they should have our prayers and blessings and we asked for theirs  we then gave them three cheers which they returned and i saw the mens heads droop in both boats as they fell to their oars again  these arrangements had occupied the general attention advantageously for all though as i expressed in the last sentence they ended in a sorrowful feeling  i now said a few words to my fellowvoyagers on the subject of the small stock of food on which our lives depended if they were preserved from the great deep and on the rigid necessity of our eking it out in the most frugal manner  one and all replied that whatever allowance i thought best to lay down should be strictly kept to we made a pair of scales out of a thin scrap of ironplating and some twine and i got together for weights such of the heaviest buttons among us as i calculated made up some fraction over two ounces  this was the allowance of solid food served out once aday to each from that time to the end with the addition of a coffeeberry or sometimes half a one when the weather was very fair for breakfast  we had nothing else whatever but half a pint of water each per day and sometimes when we were coldest and weakest a teaspoonful of rum each served out as a dram  i know how learnedly it can be shown that rum is poison but i also know that in this case as in all similar cases i have ever read ofwhich are numerousno words can express the comfort and support derived from it  nor have i the least doubt that it saved the lives of far more than half our number  having mentioned half a pint of water as our daily allowance i ought to observe that sometimes we had less and sometimes we had more for much rain fell and we caught it in a canvas stretched for the purpose  thus at that tempestuous time of the year and in that tempestuous part of the world we shipwrecked people rose and fell with the waves  it is not my intention to relate if i can avoid it such circumstances appertaining to our doleful condition as have been better told in many other narratives of the kind than i can be expected to tell them  i will only note in so many passing words that day after day and night after night we received the sea upon our backs to prevent it from swamping the boat that one party was always kept baling and that every hat and cap among us soon got worn out though patched up fifty times as the only vessels we had for that service that another party lay down in the bottom of the boat while a third rowed and that we were soon all in boils and blisters and rags  the other boat was a source of such anxious interest to all of us that i used to wonder whether if we were saved the time could ever come when the survivors in this boat of ours could be at all indifferent to the fortunes of the survivors in that  we got out a towrope whenever the weather permitted but that did not often happen and how we two parties kept within the same horizon as we did he who mercifully permitted it to be so for our consolation only knows  i never shall forget the looks with which when the morning light came we used to gaze about us over the stormy waters for the other boat  we once parted company for seventytwo hours and we believed them to have gone down as they did us  the joy on both sides when we came within view of one another again had something in a manner divine in it each was so forgetful of individual suffering in tears of delight and sympathy for the people in the other boat  i have been wanting to get round to the individual or personal part of my subject as i call it and the foregoing incident puts me in the right way  the patience and good disposition aboard of us was wonderful  i was not surprised by it in the women for all men born of women know what great qualities they will show when men will fail but i own i was a little surprised by it in some of the men  among oneandthirty people assembled at the best of times there will usually i should say be two or three uncertain tempers  i knew that i had more than one rough temper with me among my own people for i had chosen those for the longboat that i might have them under my eye  but they softened under their misery and were as considerate of the ladies and as compassionate of the child as the best among us or among menthey could not have been more so  i heard scarcely any complaining  the party lying down would moan a good deal in their sleep and i would often notice a mannot always the same man it is to be understood but nearly all of them at one time or othersitting moaning at his oar or in his place as he looked mistily over the sea  when it happened to be long before i could catch his eye he would go on moaning all the time in the dismallest manner but when our looks met he would brighten and leave off  i almost always got the impression that he did not know what sound he had been making but that he thought he had been humming a tune  our sufferings from cold and wet were far greater than our sufferings from hunger  we managed to keep the child warm but i doubt if any one else among us ever was warm for five minutes together and the shivering and the chattering of teeth were sad to hear  the child cried a little at first for her lost playfellow the golden mary but hardly ever whimpered afterwards and when the state of the weather made it possible she used now and then to be held up in the arms of some of us to look over the sea for john steadimans boat  i see the golden hair and the innocent face now between me and the driving clouds like an angel going to fly away  it had happened on the second day towards night that mrs atherfield in getting little lucy to sleep sang her a song  she had a soft melodious voice and when she had finished it our people up and begged for another  she sang them another and after it had fallen dark ended with the evening hymn  from that time whenever anything could be heard above the sea and wind and while she had any voice left nothing would serve the people but that she should sing at sunset  she always did and always ended with the evening hymn  we mostly took up the last line and shed tears when it was done but not miserably  we had a prayer night and morning also when the weather allowed of it  twelve nights and eleven days we had been driving in the boat when old mr rarx began to be delirious and to cry out to me to throw the gold overboard or it would sink us and we should all be lost  for days past the child had been declining and that was the great cause of his wildness  he had been over and over again shrieking out to me to give her all the remaining meat to give her all the remaining rum to save her at any cost or we should all be ruined  at this time she lay in her mothers arms at my feet  one of her little hands was almost always creeping about her mothers neck or chin  i had watched the wasting of the little hand and i knew it was nearly over  the old mans cries were so discordant with the mothers love and submission that i called out to him in an angry voice unless he held his peace on the instant i would order him to be knocked on the head and thrown overboard  he was mute then until the child died very peacefully an hour afterwards which was known to all in the boat by the mothers breaking out into lamentations for the first time since the wreckfor she had great fortitude and constancy though she was a little gentle woman  old mr rarx then became quite ungovernable tearing what rags he had on him raging in imprecations and calling to me that if i had thrown the gold overboard always the gold with him i might have saved the child  and now says he in a terrible voice we shall founder and all go to the devil for our sins will sink us when we have no innocent child to bear us up  we so discovered with amazement that this old wretch had only cared for the life of the pretty little creature dear to all of us because of the influence he superstitiously hoped she might have in preserving him  altogether it was too much for the smith or armourer who was sitting next the old man to bear  he took him by the throat and rolled him under the thwarts where he lay still enough for hours afterwards  all that thirteenth night miss coleshaw lying across my knees as i kept the helm comforted and supported the poor mother  her child covered with a peajacket of mine lay in her lap  it troubled me all night to think that there was no prayerbook among us and that i could remember but very few of the exact words of the burial service  when i stood up at broad day all knew what was going to be done and i noticed that my poor fellows made the motion of uncovering their heads though their heads had been stark bare to the sky and sea for many a weary hour  there was a long heavy swell on but otherwise it was a fair morning and there were broad fields of sunlight on the waves in the east  i said no more than this i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord  he raised the daughter of jairus the ruler and said she was not dead but slept  he raised the widows son  he arose himself and was seen of many  he loved little children saying suffer them to come unto me and rebuke them not for of such is the kingdom of heaven  in his name my friends and committed to his merciful goodness  with those words i laid my rough face softly on the placid little forehead and buried the golden lucy in the grave of the golden mary  having had it on my mind to relate the end of this dear little child i have omitted something from its exact place which i will supply here  it will come quite as well here as anywhere else  foreseeing that if the boat lived through the stormy weather the time must come and soon come when we should have absolutely no morsel to eat i had one momentous point often in my thoughts  although i had years before that fully satisfied myself that the instances in which human beings in the last distress have fed upon each other are exceedingly few and have very seldom indeed if ever occurred when the people in distress however dreadful their extremity have been accustomed to moderate forbearance and restraint i say though i had long before quite satisfied my mind on this topic i felt doubtful whether there might not have been in former cases some harm and danger from keeping it out of sight and pretending not to think of it  i felt doubtful whether some minds growing weak with fasting and exposure and having such a terrific idea to dwell upon in secret might not magnify it until it got to have an awful attraction about it  this was not a new thought of mine for it had grown out of my reading  however it came over me stronger than it had ever done beforeas it had reason for doingin the boat and on the fourth day i decided that i would bring out into the light that unformed fear which must have been more or less darkly in every brain among us  therefore as a means of beguiling the time and inspiring hope i gave them the best summary in my power of blighs voyage of more than three thousand miles in an open boat after the mutiny of the bounty and of the wonderful preservation of that boats crew  they listened throughout with great interest and i concluded by telling them that in my opinion the happiest circumstance in the whole narrative was that bligh who was no delicate man either had solemnly placed it on record therein that he was sure and certain that under no conceivable circumstances whatever would that emaciated party who had gone through all the pains of famine have preyed on one another  i cannot describe the visible relief which this spread through the boat and how the tears stood in every eye  from that time i was as well convinced as bligh himself that there was no danger and that this phantom at any rate did not haunt us  now it was a part of blighs experience that when the people in his boat were most cast down nothing did them so much good as hearing a story told by one of their number  when i mentioned that i saw that it struck the general attention as much as it did my own for i had not thought of it until i came to it in my summary  this was on the day after mrs atherfield first sang to us  i proposed that whenever the weather would permit we should have a story two hours after dinner i always issued the allowance i have mentioned at one oclock and called it by that name as well as our song at sunset  the proposal was received with a cheerful satisfaction that warmed my heart within me and i do not say too much when i say that those two periods in the fourandtwenty hours were expected with positive pleasure and were really enjoyed by all hands  spectres as we soon were in our bodily wasting our imaginations did not perish like the gross flesh upon our bones  music and adventure two of the great gifts of providence to mankind could charm us long after that was lost  the wind was almost always against us after the second day and for many days together we could not nearly hold our own  we had all varieties of bad weather  we had rain hail snow wind mist thunder and lightning still the boats lived through the heavy seas and still we perishing people rose and fell with the great waves  sixteen nights and fifteen days twenty nights and nineteen days twenty four nights and twentythree days  so the time went on  disheartening as i knew that our progress or want of progress must be i never deceived them as to my calculations of it  in the first place i felt that we were all too near eternity for deceit in the second place i knew that if i failed or died the man who followed me must have a knowledge of the true state of things to begin upon  when i told them at noon what i reckoned we had made or lost they generally received what i said in a tranquil and resigned manner and always gratefully towards me it was not unusual at any time of the day for some one to burst out weeping loudly without any new cause and when the burst was over to calm down a little better than before  i had seen exactly the same thing in a house of mourning  during the whole of this time old mr rarx had had his fits of calling out to me to throw the gold always the gold overboard and of heaping violent reproaches upon me for not having saved the child but now the food being all gone and i having nothing left to serve out but a bit of coffeeberry now and then he began to be too weak to do this and consequently fell silent  mrs atherfield and miss coleshaw generally lay each with an arm across one of my knees and her head upon it  they never complained at all  up to the time of her childs death mrs atherfield had bound up her own beautiful hair every day and i took particular notice that this was always before she sang her song at night when everyone looked at her  but she never did it after the loss of her darling and it would have been now all tangled with dirt and wet but that miss coleshaw was careful of it long after she was herself and would sometimes smooth it down with her weak thin hands  we were past mustering a story now but one day at about this period i reverted to the superstition of old mr rarx concerning the golden lucy and told them that nothing vanished from the eye of god though much might pass away from the eyes of men  we were all of us says i children once and our baby feet have strolled in green woods ashore and our baby hands have gathered flowers in gardens where the birds were singing  the children that we were are not lost to the great knowledge of our creator  those innocent creatures will appear with us before him and plead for us  what we were in the best time of our generous youth will arise and go with us too  the purest part of our lives will not desert us at the pass to which all of us here present are gliding  what we were then will be as much in existence before him as what we are now  they were no less comforted by this consideration than i was myself and miss coleshaw drawing my ear nearer to her lips said captain ravender i was on my way to marry a disgraced and broken man whom i dearly loved when he was honourable and good  your words seem to have come out of my own poor heart  she pressed my hand upon it smiling  twentyseven nights and twentysix days  we were in no want of rainwater but we had nothing else  and yet even now i never turned my eyes upon a waking face but it tried to brighten before mine  o what a thing it is in a time of danger and in the presence of death the shining of a face upon a face  i have heard it broached that orders should be given in great new ships by electric telegraph  i admire machinery as much is any man and am as thankful to it as any man can be for what it does for us  but it will never be a substitute for the face of a man with his soul in it encouraging another man to be brave and true  never try it for that  it will break down like a straw  i now began to remark certain changes in myself which i did not like they caused me much disquiet  i often saw the golden lucy in the air above the boat  i often saw her i have spoken of before sitting beside me  i saw the golden mary go down as she really had gone down twenty times in a day  and yet the sea was mostly to my thinking not sea neither but moving country and extraordinary mountainous regions the like of which have never been beheld  i felt it time to leave my last words regarding john steadiman in case any lips should last out to repeat them to any living ears  i said that john had told me as he had on deck that he had sung out breakers ahead the instant they were audible and had tried to wear ship but she struck before it could be done  his cry i dare say had made my dream  i said that the circumstances were altogether without warning and out of any course that could have been guarded against that the same loss would have happened if i had been in charge and that john was not to blame but from first to last had done his duty nobly like the man he was  i tried to write it down in my pocketbook but could make no words though i knew what the words were that i wanted to make  when it had come to that her handsthough she was dead so longlaid me down gently in the bottom of the boat and she and the golden lucy swung me to sleep        all that follows was written by john steadiman chief mate  on the twentysixth day after the foundering of the golden mary at sea i john steadiman was sitting in my place in the sternsheets of the surfboat with just sense enough left in me to steerthat is to say with my eyes strained wideawake over the bows of the boat and my brains fast asleep and dreamingwhen i was roused upon a sudden by our second mate mr william rames  let me take a spell in your place says he  and look you out for the longboat astern  the last time she rose on the crest of a wave i thought i made out a signal flying aboard her  we shifted our places clumsily and slowly enough for we were both of us weak and dazed with wet cold and hunger  i waited some time watching the heavy rollers astern before the longboat rose atop of one of them at the same time with us  at last she was heaved up for a moment well in view and there sure enough was the signal flying aboard of hera strip of rag of some sort rigged to an oar and hoisted in her bows  what does it mean says rames to me in a quavering trembling sort of voice  do they signal a sail in sight  hush for gods sake says i clapping my hand over his mouth  dont let the people hear you  theyll all go mad together if we mislead them about that signal  wait a bit till i have another look at it  i held on by him for he had set me all of a tremble with his notion of a sail in sight and watched for the longboat again  up she rose on the top of another roller  i made out the signal clearly that second time and saw that it was rigged halfmast high  rames says i its a signal of distress  pass the word forward to keep her before the sea and no more  we must get the longboat within hailing distance of us as soon as possible  i dropped down into my old place at the tiller without another wordfor the thought went through me like a knife that something had happened to captain ravender  i should consider myself unworthy to write another line of this statement if i had not made up my mind to speak the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truthand i must therefore confess plainly that now for the first time my heart sank within me this weakness on my part was produced in some degree as i take it by the exhausting effects of previous anxiety and grief  our provisionsif i may give that name to what we had leftwere reduced to the rind of one lemon and about a couple of handsfull of coffeeberries  besides these great distresses caused by the death the danger and the suffering among my crew and passengers i had had a little distress of my own to shake me still more in the death of the child whom i had got to be very fond of on the voyage outso fond that i was secretly a little jealous of her being taken in the longboat instead of mine when the ship foundered  it used to be a great comfort to me and i think to those with me also after we had seen the last of the golden mary to see the golden lucy held up by the men in the longboat when the weather allowed it as the best and brightest sight they had to show  she looked at the distance we saw her from almost like a little white bird in the air  to miss her for the first time when the weather lulled a little again and we all looked out for our white bird and looked in vain was a sore disappointment  to see the mens heads bowed down and the captains hand pointing into the sea when we hailed the long boat a few days after gave me as heavy a shock and as sharp a pang of heartache to bear as ever i remember suffering in all my life  i only mention these things to show that if i did give way a little at first under the dread that our captain was lost to us it was not without having been a good deal shaken beforehand by more trials of one sort or another than often fall to one mans share  i had got over the choking in my throat with the help of a drop of water and had steadied my mind again so as to be prepared against the worst when i heard the hail lord help the poor fellows how weak it sounded  surfboat ahoy  i looked up and there were our companions in misfortune tossing abreast of us not so near that we could make out the features of any of them but near enough with some exertion for people in our condition to make their voices heard in the intervals when the wind was weakest  i answered the hail and waited a bit and heard nothing and then sung out the captains name  the voice that replied did not sound like his the words that reached us were  chiefmate wanted on board  every man of my crew knew what that meant as well as i did  as second officer in command there could be but one reason for wanting me on board the longboat  a groan went all round us and my men looked darkly in each others faces and whispered under their breaths  the captain is dead  i commanded them to be silent and not to make too sure of bad news at such a pass as things had now come to with us  then hailing the long boat i signified that i was ready to go on board when the weather would let mestopped a bit to draw a good long breathand then called out as loud as i could the dreadful question  is the captain dead  the black figures of three or four men in the afterpart of the longboat all stooped down together as my voice reached them  they were lost to view for about a minute then appeared againone man among them was held up on his feet by the rest and he hailed back the blessed words a very faint hope went a very long way with people in our desperate situation not yet  the relief felt by me and by all with me when we knew that our captain though unfitted for duty was not lost to us it is not in wordsat least not in such words as a man like me can commandto express  i did my best to cheer the men by telling them what a good sign it was that we were not as badly off yet as we had feared and then communicated what instructions i had to give to william rames who was to be left in command in my place when i took charge of the longboat  after that there was nothing to be done but to wait for the chance of the wind dropping at sunset and the sea going down afterwards so as to enable our weak crews to lay the two boats alongside of each other without undue riskor to put it plainer without saddling ourselves with the necessity for any extraordinary exertion of strength or skill  both the one and the other had now been starved out of us for days and days together  at sunset the wind suddenly dropped but the sea which had been running high for so long a time past took hours after that before it showed any signs of getting to rest  the moon was shining the sky was wonderfully clear and it could not have been according to my calculations far off midnight when the long slow regular swell of the calming ocean fairly set in and i took the responsibility of lessening the distance between the longboat and ourselves  it was i dare say a delusion of mine but i thought i had never seen the moon shine so white and ghastly anywhere either on sea or on land as she shone that night while we were approaching our companions in misery  when there was not much more than a boats length between us and the white light streamed cold and clear over all our faces both crews rested on their oars with one great shudder and stared over the gunwale of either boat panicstricken at the first sight of each other  any lives lost among you i asked in the midst of that frightful silence  the men in the longbout huddled together like sheep at the sound of my voice  none yet but the child thanks be to god answered one among them  and at the sound of his voice all my men shrank together like the men in the longboat  i was afraid to let the horror produced by our first meeting at close quarters after the dreadful changes that wet cold and famine had produced last one moment longer than could be helped so without giving time for any more questions and answers i commanded the men to lay the two boats close alongside of each other  when i rose up and committed the tiller to the hands of rames all my poor follows raised their white faces imploringly to mine  dont leave us sir they said dont leave us  i leave you says i under the command and the guidance of mr william rames as good a sailor as i am and as trusty and kind a man as ever stepped  do your duty by him as you have done it by me and remember to the last that while there is life there is hope  god bless and help you all  with those words i collected what strength i had left and caught at two arms that were held out to me and so got from the sternsheets of one boat into the sternsheets of the other  mind where you step sir whispered one of the men who had helped me into the longboat  i looked down as he spoke  three figures were huddled up below me with the moonshine falling on them in ragged streaks through the gaps between the men standing or sitting above them  the first face i made out was the face of miss coleshaw her eyes were wide open and fixed on me  she seemed still to keep her senses and by the alternate parting and closing of her lips to be trying to speak but i could not hear that she uttered a single word  on her shoulder rested the head of mrs atherfield  the mother of our poor little golden lucy must i think have been dreaming of the child she had lost for there was a faint smile just ruffling the white stillness of her face when i first saw it turned upward with peaceful closed eyes towards the heavens  from her i looked down a little and there with his head on her lap and with one of her hands resting tenderly on his cheekthere lay the captain to whose help and guidance up to this miserable time we had never looked in vainthere worn out at last in our service and for our sakes lay the best and bravest man of all our company  i stole my hand in gently through his clothes and laid it on his heart and felt a little feeble warmth over it though my cold dulled touch could not detect even the faintest beating  the two men in the sternsheets with me noticing what i was doingknowing i loved him like a brotherand seeing i suppose more distress in my face than i myself was conscious of its showing lost command over themselves altogether and burst into a piteous moaning sobbing lamentation over him  one of the two drew aside a jacket from his feet and showed me that they were bare except where a wet ragged strip of stocking still clung to one of them  when the ship struck the iceberg he had run on deck leaving his shoes in his cabin all through the voyage in the boat his feet had been unprotected and not a soul had discovered it until he dropped  as long as he could keep his eyes open the very look of them had cheered the men and comforted and upheld the women  not one living creature in the boat with any sense about him but had felt the good influence of that brave man in one way or another  not one but had heard him over and over again give the credit to others which was due only to himself praising this man for patience and thanking that man for help when the patience and the help had really and truly as to the best part of both come only from him all this and much more i heard pouring confusedly from the mens lips while they crouched down sobbing and crying over their commander and wrapping the jacket as warmly and tenderly as they could over is cold feet  it went to my heart to check them but i knew that if this lamenting spirit spread any further all chance of keeping alight any last sparks of hope and resolution among the boats company would be lost for ever  accordingly i sent them to their places spoke a few encouraging words to the men forward promising to serve out when the morning came as much as i dared of any eatable thing left in the lockers called to rames in my old boat to keep as near us as he safely could drew the garments and coverings of the two poor suffering women more closely about them and with a secret prayer to be directed for the best in bearing the awful responsibility now laid on my shoulders took my captains vacant place at the helm of the longboat  this as well as i can tell it is the full and true account of how i came to be placed in charge of the lost passengers and crew of the golden mary on the morning of the twentyseventh day after the ship struck the iceberg and foundered at sea
