30368960	silas marner  the weaver of raveloe   by  george eliot  mary anne evans    1861      a child more than all other gifts   that earth can offer to declining man   brings hope with it and forwardlooking thoughts     wordsworth     part one    chapter i  in the days when the spinningwheels hummed busily in the farmhousesand even great ladies clothed in silk and threadlace had their toy spinningwheels of polished oakthere might be seen in districts far away among the lanes or deep in the bosom of the hills certain pallid undersized men who by the side of the brawny countryfolk looked like the remnants of a disinherited race  the shepherds dog barked fiercely when one of these alienlooking men appeared on the upland dark against the early winter sunset for what dog likes a figure bent under a heavy bagand these pale men rarely stirred abroad without that mysterious burden  the shepherd himself though he had good reason to believe that the bag held nothing but flaxen thread or else the long rolls of strong linen spun from that thread was not quite sure that this trade of weaving indispensable though it was could be carried on entirely without the help of the evil one  in that faroff time superstition clung easily round every person or thing that was at all unwonted or even intermittent and occasional merely like the visits of the pedlar or the knifegrinder no one knew where wandering men had their homes or their origin and how was a man to be explained unless you at least knew somebody who knew his father and mother to the peasants of old times the world outside their own direct experience was a region of vagueness and mystery to their untravelled thought a state of wandering was a conception as dim as the winter life of the swallows that came back with the spring and even a settler if he came from distant parts hardly ever ceased to be viewed with a remnant of distrust which would have prevented any surprise if a long course of inoffensive conduct on his part had ended in the commission of a crime especially if he had any reputation for knowledge or showed any skill in handicraft  all cleverness whether in the rapid use of that difficult instrument the tongue or in some other art unfamiliar to villagers was in itself suspicious honest folk born and bred in a visible manner were mostly not overwise or cleverat least not beyond such a matter as knowing the signs of the weather and the process by which rapidity and dexterity of any kind were acquired was so wholly hidden that they partook of the nature of conjuring  in this way it came to pass that those scattered linenweaversemigrants from the town into the countrywere to the last regarded as aliens by their rustic neighbours and usually contracted the eccentric habits which belong to a state of loneliness  in the early years of this century such a linenweaver named silas marner worked at his vocation in a stone cottage that stood among the nutty hedgerows near the village of raveloe and not far from the edge of a deserted stonepit  the questionable sound of silass loom so unlike the natural cheerful trotting of the winnowingmachine or the simpler rhythm of the flail had a halffearful fascination for the raveloe boys who would often leave off their nutting or birdsnesting to peep in at the window of the stone cottage counterbalancing a certain awe at the mysterious action of the loom by a pleasant sense of scornful superiority drawn from the mockery of its alternating noises along with the bent treadmill attitude of the weaver  but sometimes it happened that marner pausing to adjust an irregularity in his thread became aware of the small scoundrels and though chary of his time he liked their intrusion so ill that he would descend from his loom and opening the door would fix on them a gaze that was always enough to make them take to their legs in terror  for how was it possible to believe that those large brown protuberant eyes in silas marners pale face really saw nothing very distinctly that was not close to them and not rather that their dreadful stare could dart cramp or rickets or a wry mouth at any boy who happened to be in the rear  they had perhaps heard their fathers and mothers hint that silas marner could cure folks rheumatism if he had a mind and add still more darkly that if you could only speak the devil fair enough he might save you the cost of the doctor  such strange lingering echoes of the old demonworship might perhaps even now be caught by the diligent listener among the greyhaired peasantry for the rude mind with difficulty associates the ideas of power and benignity  a shadowy conception of power that by much persuasion can be induced to refrain from inflicting harm is the shape most easily taken by the sense of the invisible in the minds of men who have always been pressed close by primitive wants and to whom a life of hard toil has never been illuminated by any enthusiastic religious faith  to them pain and mishap present a far wider range of possibilities than gladness and enjoyment their imagination is almost barren of the images that feed desire and hope but is all overgrown by recollections that are a perpetual pasture to fear is there anything you can fancy that you would like to eat  i once said to an old labouring man who was in his last illness and who had refused all the food his wife had offered him  no he answered ive never been used to nothing but common victual and i cant eat that  experience had bred no fancies in him that could raise the phantasm of appetite  and raveloe was a village where many of the old echoes lingered undrowned by new voices  not that it was one of those barren parishes lying on the outskirts of civilizationinhabited by meagre sheep and thinlyscattered shepherds on the contrary it lay in the rich central plain of what we are pleased to call merry england and held farms which speaking from a spiritual point of view paid highlydesirable tithes  but it was nestled in a snug wellwooded hollow quite an hours journey on horseback from any turnpike where it was never reached by the vibrations of the coachhorn or of public opinion  it was an importantlooking village with a fine old church and large churchyard in the heart of it and two or three large brickandstone homesteads with wellwalled orchards and ornamental weathercocks standing close upon the road and lifting more imposing fronts than the rectory which peeped from among the trees on the other side of the churchyarda village which showed at once the summits of its social life and told the practised eye that there was no great park and manorhouse in the vicinity but that there were several chiefs in raveloe who could farm badly quite at their ease drawing enough money from their bad farming in those war times to live in a rollicking fashion and keep a jolly christmas whitsun and easter tide  it was fifteen years since silas marner had first come to raveloe he was then simply a pallid young man with prominent shortsighted brown eyes whose appearance would have had nothing strange for people of average culture and experience but for the villagers near whom he had come to settle it had mysterious peculiarities which corresponded with the exceptional nature of his occupation and his advent from an unknown region called northard  so had his way of lifehe invited no comer to step across his doorsill and he never strolled into the village to drink a pint at the rainbow or to gossip at the wheelwrights he sought no man or woman save for the purposes of his calling or in order to supply himself with necessaries and it was soon clear to the raveloe lasses that he would never urge one of them to accept him against her willquite as if he had heard them declare that they would never marry a dead man come to life again  this view of marners personality was not without another ground than his pale face and unexampled eyes for jem rodney the molecatcher averred that one evening as he was returning homeward he saw silas marner leaning against a stile with a heavy bag on his back instead of resting the bag on the stile as a man in his senses would have done and that on coming up to him he saw that marners eyes were set like a dead mans and he spoke to him and shook him and his limbs were stiff and his hands clutched the bag as if theyd been made of iron but just as he had made up his mind that the weaver was dead he came all right again like as you might say in the winking of an eye and said goodnight and walked off  all this jem swore he had seen more by token that it was the very day he had been molecatching on squire casss land down by the old sawpit  some said marner must have been in a fit a word which seemed to explain things otherwise incredible but the argumentative mr macey clerk of the parish shook his head and asked if anybody was ever known to go off in a fit and not fall down  a fit was a stroke wasnt it  and it was in the nature of a stroke to partly take away the use of a mans limbs and throw him on the parish if hed got no children to look to  no no it was no stroke that would let a man stand on his legs like a horse between the shafts and then walk off as soon as you can say gee but there might be such a thing as a mans soul being loose from his body and going out and in like a bird out of its nest and back and that was how folks got overwise for they went to school in this shellless state to those who could teach them more than their neighbours could learn with their five senses and the parson  and where did master marner get his knowledge of herbs fromand charms too if he liked to give them away  jem rodneys story was no more than what might have been expected by anybody who had seen how marner had cured sally oates and made her sleep like a baby when her heart had been beating enough to burst her body for two months and more while she had been under the doctors care  he might cure more folks if he would but he was worth speaking fair if it was only to keep him from doing you a mischief  it was partly to this vague fear that marner was indebted for protecting him from the persecution that his singularities might have drawn upon him but still more to the fact that the old linenweaver in the neighbouring parish of tarley being dead his handicraft made him a highly welcome settler to the richer housewives of the district and even to the more provident cottagers who had their little stock of yarn at the years end their sense of his usefulness would have counteracted any repugnance or suspicion which was not confirmed by a deficiency in the quality or the tale of the cloth he wove for them and the years had rolled on without producing any change in the impressions of the neighbours concerning marner except the change from novelty to habit  at the end of fifteen years the raveloe men said just the same things about silas marner as at the beginning they did not say them quite so often but they believed them much more strongly when they did say them  there was only one important addition which the years had brought it was that master marner had laid by a fine sight of money somewhere and that he could buy up bigger men than himself  but while opinion concerning him had remained nearly stationary and his daily habits had presented scarcely any visible change marners inward life had been a history and a metamorphosis as that of every fervid nature must be when it has fled or been condemned to solitude his life before he came to raveloe had been filled with the movement the mental activity and the close fellowship which in that day as in this marked the life of an artisan early incorporated in a narrow religious sect where the poorest layman has the chance of distinguishing himself by gifts of speech and has at the very least the weight of a silent voter in the government of his community marner was highly thought of in that little hidden world known to itself as the church assembling in lantern yard he was believed to be a young man of exemplary life and ardent faith and a peculiar interest had been centred in him ever since he had fallen at a prayermeeting into a mysterious rigidity and suspension of consciousness which lasting for an hour or more had been mistaken for death  to have sought a medical explanation for this phenomenon would have been held by silas himself as well as by his minister and fellowmembers a wilful selfexclusion from the spiritual significance that might lie therein  silas was evidently a brother selected for a peculiar discipline and though the effort to interpret this discipline was discouraged by the absence on his part of any spiritual vision during his outward trance yet it was believed by himself and others that its effect was seen in an accession of light and fervour a less truthful man than he might have been tempted into the subsequent creation of a vision in the form of resurgent memory a less sane man might have believed in such a creation but silas was both sane and honest though as with many honest and fervent men culture had not defined any channels for his sense of mystery and so it spread itself over the proper pathway of inquiry and knowledge  he had inherited from his mother some acquaintance with medicinal herbs and their preparationa little store of wisdom which she had imparted to him as a solemn bequestbut of late years he had had doubts about the lawfulness of applying this knowledge believing that herbs could have no efficacy without prayer and that prayer might suffice without herbs so that the inherited delight he had in wandering in the fields in search of foxglove and dandelion and coltsfoot began to wear to him the character of a temptation  among the members of his church there was one young man a little older than himself with whom he had long lived in such close friendship that it was the custom of their lantern yard brethren to call them david and jonathan  the real name of the friend was william dane and he too was regarded as a shining instance of youthful piety though somewhat given to overseverity towards weaker brethren and to be so dazzled by his own light as to hold himself wiser than his teachers  but whatever blemishes others might discern in william to his friends mind he was faultless for marner had one of those impressible selfdoubting natures which at an inexperienced age admire imperativeness and lean on contradiction  the expression of trusting simplicity in marners face heightened by that absence of special observation that defenceless deerlike gaze which belongs to large prominent eyes was strongly contrasted by the selfcomplacent suppression of inward triumph that lurked in the narrow slanting eyes and compressed lips of william dane  one of the most frequent topics of conversation between the two friends was assurance of salvation silas confessed that he could never arrive at anything higher than hope mingled with fear and listened with longing wonder when william declared that he had possessed unshaken assurance ever since in the period of his conversion he had dreamed that he saw the words calling and election sure standing by themselves on a white page in the open bible  such colloquies have occupied many a pair of palefaced weavers whose unnurtured souls have been like young winged things fluttering forsaken in the twilight  it had seemed to the unsuspecting silas that the friendship had suffered no chill even from his formation of another attachment of a closer kind  for some months he had been engaged to a young servantwoman waiting only for a little increase to their mutual savings in order to their marriage and it was a great delight to him that sarah did not object to williams occasional presence in their sunday interviews  it was at this point in their history that silass cataleptic fit occurred during the prayermeeting and amidst the various queries and expressions of interest addressed to him by his fellowmembers williams suggestion alone jarred with the general sympathy towards a brother thus singled out for special dealings  he observed that to him this trance looked more like a visitation of satan than a proof of divine favour and exhorted his friend to see that he hid no accursed thing within his soul  silas feeling bound to accept rebuke and admonition as a brotherly office felt no resentment but only pain at his friends doubts concerning him and to this was soon added some anxiety at the perception that sarahs manner towards him began to exhibit a strange fluctuation between an effort at an increased manifestation of regard and involuntary signs of shrinking and dislike  he asked her if she wished to break off their engagement but she denied this their engagement was known to the church and had been recognized in the prayermeetings it could not be broken off without strict investigation and sarah could render no reason that would be sanctioned by the feeling of the community  at this time the senior deacon was taken dangerously ill and being a childless widower he was tended night and day by some of the younger brethren or sisters silas frequently took his turn in the nightwatching with william the one relieving the other at two in the morning  the old man contrary to expectation seemed to be on the way to recovery when one night silas sitting up by his bedside observed that his usual audible breathing had ceased  the candle was burning low and he had to lift it to see the patients face distinctly  examination convinced him that the deacon was deadhad been dead some time for the limbs were rigid  silas asked himself if he had been asleep and looked at the clock it was already four in the morning how was it that william had not come  in much anxiety he went to seek for help and soon there were several friends assembled in the house the minister among them while silas went away to his work wishing he could have met william to know the reason of his nonappearance  but at six oclock as he was thinking of going to seek his friend william came and with him the minister  they came to summon him to lantern yard to meet the church members there and to his inquiry concerning the cause of the summons the only reply was you will hear  nothing further was said until silas was seated in the vestry in front of the minister with the eyes of those who to him represented gods people fixed solemnly upon him then the minister taking out a pocketknife showed it to silas and asked him if he knew where he had left that knife  silas said he did not know that he had left it anywhere out of his own pocketbut he was trembling at this strange interrogation  he was then exhorted not to hide his sin but to confess and repent  the knife had been found in the bureau by the departed deacons bedsidefound in the place where the little bag of church money had lain which the minister himself had seen the day before  some hand had removed that bag and whose hand could it be if not that of the man to whom the knife belonged  for some time silas was mute with astonishment then he said god will clear me i know nothing about the knife being there or the money being gone  search me and my dwelling you will find nothing but three pound five of my own savings which william dane knows i have had these six months  at this william groaned but the minister said the proof is heavy against you brother marner  the money was taken in the night last past and no man was with our departed brother but you for william dane declares to us that he was hindered by sudden sickness from going to take his place as usual and you yourself said that he had not come and moreover you neglected the dead body  i must have slept said silas  then after a pause he added or i must have had another visitation like that which you have all seen me under so that the thief must have come and gone while i was not in the body but out of the body  but i say again search me and my dwelling for i have been nowhere else  the search was made and it endedin william danes finding the wellknown bag empty tucked behind the chest of drawers in silass chamber  on this william exhorted his friend to confess and not to hide his sin any longer  silas turned a look of keen reproach on him and said william for nine years that we have gone in and out together have you ever known me tell a lie  but god will clear me  brother said william how do i know what you may have done in the secret chambers of your heart to give satan an advantage over you  silas was still looking at his friend  suddenly a deep flush came over his face and he was about to speak impetuously when he seemed checked again by some inward shock that sent the flush back and made him tremble  but at last he spoke feebly looking at william  i remember nowthe knife wasnt in my pocket  william said i know nothing of what you mean  the other persons present however began to inquire where silas meant to say that the knife was but he would give no further explanation he only said i am sore stricken i can say nothing  god will clear me  on their return to the vestry there was further deliberation  any resort to legal measures for ascertaining the culprit was contrary to the principles of the church in lantern yard according to which prosecution was forbidden to christians even had the case held less scandal to the community  but the members were bound to take other measures for finding out the truth and they resolved on praying and drawing lots  this resolution can be a ground of surprise only to those who are unacquainted with that obscure religious life which has gone on in the alleys of our towns  silas knelt with his brethren relying on his own innocence being certified by immediate divine interference but feeling that there was sorrow and mourning behind for him even thenthat his trust in man had been cruelly bruised  the lots declared that silas marner was guilty  he was solemnly suspended from churchmembership and called upon to render up the stolen money only on confession as the sign of repentance could he be received once more within the folds of the church marner listened in silence at last when everyone rose to depart he went towards william dane and said in a voice shaken by agitation  the last time i remember using my knife was when i took it out to cut a strap for you  i dont remember putting it in my pocket again you stole the money and you have woven a plot to lay the sin at my door  but you may prosper for all that there is no just god that governs the earth righteously but a god of lies that bears witness against the innocent  there was a general shudder at this blasphemy  william said meekly i leave our brethren to judge whether this is the voice of satan or not  i can do nothing but pray for you silas  poor marner went out with that despair in his soulthat shaken trust in god and man which is little short of madness to a loving nature in the bitterness of his wounded spirit he said to himself she will cast me off too  and he reflected that if she did not believe the testimony against him her whole faith must be upset as his was to people accustomed to reason about the forms in which their religious feeling has incorporated itself it is difficult to enter into that simple untaught state of mind in which the form and the feeling have never been severed by an act of reflection  we are apt to think it inevitable that a man in marners position should have begun to question the validity of an appeal to the divine judgment by drawing lots but to him this would have been an effort of independent thought such as he had never known and he must have made the effort at a moment when all his energies were turned into the anguish of disappointed faith  if there is an angel who records the sorrows of men as well as their sins he knows how many and deep are the sorrows that spring from false ideas for which no man is culpable  marner went home and for a whole day sat alone stunned by despair without any impulse to go to sarah and attempt to win her belief in his innocence  the second day he took refuge from benumbing unbelief by getting into his loom and working away as usual and before many hours were past the minister and one of the deacons came to him with the message from sarah that she held her engagement to him at an end silas received the message mutely and then turned away from the messengers to work at his loom again  in little more than a month from that time sarah was married to william dane and not long afterwards it was known to the brethren in lantern yard that silas marner had departed from the town    chapter ii  even people whose lives have been made various by learning sometimes find it hard to keep a fast hold on their habitual views of life on their faith in the invisible nay on the sense that their past joys and sorrows are a real experience when they are suddenly transported to a new land where the beings around them know nothing of their history and share none of their ideaswhere their mother earth shows another lap and human life has other forms than those on which their souls have been nourished  minds that have been unhinged from their old faith and love have perhaps sought this lethean influence of exile in which the past becomes dreamy because its symbols have all vanished and the present too is dreamy because it is linked with no memories  but even their experience may hardly enable them thoroughly to imagine what was the effect on a simple weaver like silas marner when he left his own country and people and came to settle in raveloe  nothing could be more unlike his native town set within sight of the widespread hillsides than this low wooded region where he felt hidden even from the heavens by the screening trees and hedgerows  there was nothing here when he rose in the deep morning quiet and looked out on the dewy brambles and rank tufted grass that seemed to have any relation with that life centring in lantern yard which had once been to him the altarplace of high dispensations  the whitewashed walls the little pews where wellknown figures entered with a subdued rustling and where first one wellknown voice and then another pitched in a peculiar key of petition uttered phrases at once occult and familiar like the amulet worn on the heart the pulpit where the minister delivered unquestioned doctrine and swayed to and fro and handled the book in a long accustomed manner the very pauses between the couplets of the hymn as it was given out and the recurrent swell of voices in song these things had been the channel of divine influences to marnerthey were the fostering home of his religious emotionsthey were christianity and gods kingdom upon earth  a weaver who finds hard words in his hymnbook knows nothing of abstractions as the little child knows nothing of parental love but only knows one face and one lap towards which it stretches its arms for refuge and nurture  and what could be more unlike that lantern yard world than the world in raveloeorchards looking lazy with neglected plenty the large church in the wide churchyard which men gazed at lounging at their own doors in servicetime the purplefaced farmers jogging along the lanes or turning in at the rainbow homesteads where men supped heavily and slept in the light of the evening hearth and where women seemed to be laying up a stock of linen for the life to come  there were no lips in raveloe from which a word could fall that would stir silas marners benumbed faith to a sense of pain in the early ages of the world we know it was believed that each territory was inhabited and ruled by its own divinities so that a man could cross the bordering heights and be out of the reach of his native gods whose presence was confined to the streams and the groves and the hills among which he had lived from his birth  and poor silas was vaguely conscious of something not unlike the feeling of primitive men when they fled thus in fear or in sullenness from the face of an unpropitious deity  it seemed to him that the power he had vainly trusted in among the streets and at the prayermeetings was very far away from this land in which he had taken refuge where men lived in careless abundance knowing and needing nothing of that trust which for him had been turned to bitterness the little light he possessed spread its beams so narrowly that frustrated belief was a curtain broad enough to create for him the blackness of night  his first movement after the shock had been to work in his loom and he went on with this unremittingly never asking himself why now he was come to raveloe he worked far on into the night to finish the tale of mrs osgoods tablelinen sooner than she expectedwithout contemplating beforehand the money she would put into his hand for the work  he seemed to weave like the spider from pure impulse without reflection  every mans work pursued steadily tends in this way to become an end in itself and so to bridge over the loveless chasms of his life  silass hand satisfied itself with throwing the shuttle and his eye with seeing the little squares in the cloth complete themselves under his effort  then there were the calls of hunger and silas in his solitude had to provide his own breakfast dinner and supper to fetch his own water from the well and put his own kettle on the fire and all these immediate promptings helped along with the weaving to reduce his life to the unquestioning activity of a spinning insect  he hated the thought of the past there was nothing that called out his love and fellowship toward the strangers he had come amongst and the future was all dark for there was no unseen love that cared for him thought was arrested by utter bewilderment now its old narrow pathway was closed and affection seemed to have died under the bruise that had fallen on its keenest nerves  but at last mrs osgoods tablelinen was finished and silas was paid in gold  his earnings in his native town where he worked for a wholesale dealer had been after a lower rate he had been paid weekly and of his weekly earnings a large proportion had gone to objects of piety and charity  now for the first time in his life he had five bright guineas put into his hand no man expected a share of them and he loved no man that he should offer him a share but what were the guineas to him who saw no vista beyond countless days of weaving  it was needless for him to ask that for it was pleasant to him to feel them in his palm and look at their bright faces which were all his own it was another element of life like the weaving and the satisfaction of hunger subsisting quite aloof from the life of belief and love from which he had been cut off the weavers hand had known the touch of hardwon money even before the palm had grown to its full breadth for twenty years mysterious money had stood to him as the symbol of earthly good and the immediate object of toil  he had seemed to love it little in the years when every penny had its purpose for him for he loved the purpose then  but now when all purpose was gone that habit of looking towards the money and grasping it with a sense of fulfilled effort made a loam that was deep enough for the seeds of desire and as silas walked homeward across the fields in the twilight he drew out the money and thought it was brighter in the gathering gloom  about this time an incident happened which seemed to open a possibility of some fellowship with his neighbours  one day taking a pair of shoes to be mended he saw the cobblers wife seated by the fire suffering from the terrible symptoms of heartdisease and dropsy which he had witnessed as the precursors of his mothers death  he felt a rush of pity at the mingled sight and remembrance and recalling the relief his mother had found from a simple preparation of foxglove he promised sally oates to bring her something that would ease her since the doctor did her no good  in this office of charity silas felt for the first time since he had come to raveloe a sense of unity between his past and present life which might have been the beginning of his rescue from the insectlike existence into which his nature had shrunk but sally oatess disease had raised her into a personage of much interest and importance among the neighbours and the fact of her having found relief from drinking silas marners stuff became a matter of general discourse  when doctor kimble gave physic it was natural that it should have an effect but when a weaver who came from nobody knew where worked wonders with a bottle of brown waters the occult character of the process was evident  such a sort of thing had not been known since the wise woman at tarley died and she had charms as well as stuff everybody went to her when their children had fits silas marner must be a person of the same sort for how did he know what would bring back sally oatess breath if he didnt know a fine sight more than that  the wise woman had words that she muttered to herself so that you couldnt hear what they were and if she tied a bit of red thread round the childs toe the while it would keep off the water in the head  there were women in raveloe at that present time who had worn one of the wise womans little bags round their necks and in consequence had never had an idiot child as ann coulter had  silas marner could very likely do as much and more and now it was all clear how he should have come from unknown parts and be so comicallooking but sally oates must mind and not tell the doctor for he would be sure to set his face against marner he was always angry about the wise woman and used to threaten those who went to her that they should have none of his help any more  silas now found himself and his cottage suddenly beset by mothers who wanted him to charm away the whoopingcough or bring back the milk and by men who wanted stuff against the rheumatics or the knots in the hands and to secure themselves against a refusal the applicants brought silver in their palms  silas might have driven a profitable trade in charms as well as in his small list of drugs but money on this condition was no temptation to him he had never known an impulse towards falsity and he drove one after another away with growing irritation for the news of him as a wise man had spread even to tarley and it was long before people ceased to take long walks for the sake of asking his aid  but the hope in his wisdom was at length changed into dread for no one believed him when he said he knew no charms and could work no cures and every man and woman who had an accident or a new attack after applying to him set the misfortune down to master marners illwill and irritated glances  thus it came to pass that his movement of pity towards sally oates which had given him a transient sense of brotherhood heightened the repulsion between him and his neighbours and made his isolation more complete  gradually the guineas the crowns and the halfcrowns grew to a heap and marner drew less and less for his own wants trying to solve the problem of keeping himself strong enough to work sixteen hours aday on as small an outlay as possible  have not men shut up in solitary imprisonment found an interest in marking the moments by straight strokes of a certain length on the wall until the growth of the sum of straight strokes arranged in triangles has become a mastering purpose  do we not wile away moments of inanity or fatigued waiting by repeating some trivial movement or sound until the repetition has bred a want which is incipient habit  that will help us to understand how the love of accumulating money grows an absorbing passion in men whose imaginations even in the very beginning of their hoard showed them no purpose beyond it marner wanted the heaps of ten to grow into a square and then into a larger square and every added guinea while it was itself a satisfaction bred a new desire  in this strange world made a hopeless riddle to him he might if he had had a less intense nature have sat weaving weavinglooking towards the end of his pattern or towards the end of his web till he forgot the riddle and everything else but his immediate sensations but the money had come to mark off his weaving into periods and the money not only grew but it remained with him  he began to think it was conscious of him as his loom was and he would on no account have exchanged those coins which had become his familiars for other coins with unknown faces  he handled them he counted them till their form and colour were like the satisfaction of a thirst to him but it was only in the night when his work was done that he drew them out to enjoy their companionship  he had taken up some bricks in his floor underneath his loom and here he had made a hole in which he set the iron pot that contained his guineas and silver coins covering the bricks with sand whenever he replaced them  not that the idea of being robbed presented itself often or strongly to his mind hoarding was common in country districts in those days there were old labourers in the parish of raveloe who were known to have their savings by them probably inside their flockbeds but their rustic neighbours though not all of them as honest as their ancestors in the days of king alfred had not imaginations bold enough to lay a plan of burglary  how could they have spent the money in their own village without betraying themselves  they would be obliged to run awaya course as dark and dubious as a balloon journey  so year after year silas marner had lived in this solitude his guineas rising in the iron pot and his life narrowing and hardening itself more and more into a mere pulsation of desire and satisfaction that had no relation to any other being  his life had reduced itself to the functions of weaving and hoarding without any contemplation of an end towards which the functions tended  the same sort of process has perhaps been undergone by wiser men when they have been cut off from faith and loveonly instead of a loom and a heap of guineas they have had some erudite research some ingenious project or some wellknit theory  strangely marners face and figure shrank and bent themselves into a constant mechanical relation to the objects of his life so that he produced the same sort of impression as a handle or a crooked tube which has no meaning standing apart  the prominent eyes that used to look trusting and dreamy now looked as if they had been made to see only one kind of thing that was very small like tiny grain for which they hunted everywhere and he was so withered and yellow that though he was not yet forty the children always called him old master marner  yet even in this stage of withering a little incident happened which showed that the sap of affection was not all gone  it was one of his daily tasks to fetch his water from a well a couple of fields off and for this purpose ever since he came to raveloe he had had a brown earthenware pot which he held as his most precious utensil among the very few conveniences he had granted himself  it had been his companion for twelve years always standing on the same spot always lending its handle to him in the early morning so that its form had an expression for him of willing helpfulness and the impress of its handle on his palm gave a satisfaction mingled with that of having the fresh clear water  one day as he was returning from the well he stumbled against the step of the stile and his brown pot falling with force against the stones that overarched the ditch below him was broken in three pieces  silas picked up the pieces and carried them home with grief in his heart  the brown pot could never be of use to him any more but he stuck the bits together and propped the ruin in its old place for a memorial  this is the history of silas marner until the fifteenth year after he came to raveloe  the livelong day he sat in his loom his ear filled with its monotony his eyes bent close down on the slow growth of sameness in the brownish web his muscles moving with such even repetition that their pause seemed almost as much a constraint as the holding of his breath  but at night came his revelry at night he closed his shutters and made fast his doors and drew forth his gold long ago the heap of coins had become too large for the iron pot to hold them and he had made for them two thick leather bags which wasted no room in their restingplace but lent themselves flexibly to every corner  how the guineas shone as they came pouring out of the dark leather mouths  the silver bore no large proportion in amount to the gold because the long pieces of linen which formed his chief work were always partly paid for in gold and out of the silver he supplied his own bodily wants choosing always the shillings and sixpences to spend in this way he loved the guineas best but he would not change the silverthe crowns and halfcrowns that were his own earnings begotten by his labour he loved them all  he spread them out in heaps and bathed his hands in them then he counted them and set them up in regular piles and felt their rounded outline between his thumb and fingers and thought fondly of the guineas that were only halfearned by the work in his loom as if they had been unborn childrenthought of the guineas that were coming slowly through the coming years through all his life which spread far away before him the end quite hidden by countless days of weaving  no wonder his thoughts were still with his loom and his money when he made his journeys through the fields and the lanes to fetch and carry home his work so that his steps never wandered to the hedgebanks and the laneside in search of the once familiar herbs these too belonged to the past from which his life had shrunk away like a rivulet that has sunk far down from the grassy fringe of its old breadth into a little shivering thread that cuts a groove for itself in the barren sand  but about the christmas of that fifteenth year a second great change came over marners life and his history became blent in a singular manner with the life of his neighbours    chapter iii  the greatest man in raveloe was squire cass who lived in the large red house with the handsome flight of stone steps in front and the high stables behind it nearly opposite the church  he was only one among several landed parishioners but he alone was honoured with the title of squire for though mr osgoods family was also understood to be of timeless originthe raveloe imagination having never ventured back to that fearful blank when there were no osgoodsstill he merely owned the farm he occupied whereas squire cass had a tenant or two who complained of the game to him quite as if he had been a lord  it was still that glorious wartime which was felt to be a peculiar favour of providence towards the landed interest and the fall of prices had not yet come to carry the race of small squires and yeomen down that road to ruin for which extravagant habits and bad husbandry were plentifully anointing their wheels  i am speaking now in relation to raveloe and the parishes that resembled it for our oldfashioned country life had many different aspects as all life must have when it is spread over a various surface and breathed on variously by multitudinous currents from the winds of heaven to the thoughts of men which are for ever moving and crossing each other with incalculable results  raveloe lay low among the bushy trees and the rutted lanes aloof from the currents of industrial energy and puritan earnestness the rich ate and drank freely accepting gout and apoplexy as things that ran mysteriously in respectable families and the poor thought that the rich were entirely in the right of it to lead a jolly life besides their feasting caused a multiplication of orts which were the heirlooms of the poor  betty jay scented the boiling of squire casss hams but her longing was arrested by the unctuous liquor in which they were boiled and when the seasons brought round the great merrymakings they were regarded on all hands as a fine thing for the poor  for the raveloe feasts were like the rounds of beef and the barrels of alethey were on a large scale and lasted a good while especially in the wintertime  after ladies had packed up their best gowns and topknots in bandboxes and had incurred the risk of fording streams on pillions with the precious burden in rainy or snowy weather when there was no knowing how high the water would rise it was not to be supposed that they looked forward to a brief pleasure  on this ground it was always contrived in the dark seasons when there was little work to be done and the hours were long that several neighbours should keep open house in succession so soon as squire casss standing dishes diminished in plenty and freshness his guests had nothing to do but to walk a little higher up the village to mr osgoods at the orchards and they found hams and chines uncut porkpies with the scent of the fire in them spun butter in all its freshnesseverything in fact that appetites at leisure could desire in perhaps greater perfection though not in greater abundance than at squire casss  for the squires wife had died long ago and the red house was without that presence of the wife and mother which is the fountain of wholesome love and fear in parlour and kitchen and this helped to account not only for there being more profusion than finished excellence in the holiday provisions but also for the frequency with which the proud squire condescended to preside in the parlour of the rainbow rather than under the shadow of his own dark wainscot perhaps also for the fact that his sons had turned out rather ill  raveloe was not a place where moral censure was severe but it was thought a weakness in the squire that he had kept all his sons at home in idleness and though some licence was to be allowed to young men whose fathers could afford it people shook their heads at the courses of the second son dunstan commonly called dunsey cass whose taste for swopping and betting might turn out to be a sowing of something worse than wild oats  to be sure the neighbours said it was no matter what became of dunseya spiteful jeering fellow who seemed to enjoy his drink the more when other people went dryalways provided that his doings did not bring trouble on a family like squire casss with a monument in the church and tankards older than king george  but it would be a thousand pities if mr godfrey the eldest a fine openfaced goodnatured young man who was to come into the land some day should take to going along the same road with his brother as he had seemed to do of late  if he went on in that way he would lose miss nancy lammeter for it was well known that she had looked very shyly on him ever since last whitsuntide twelvemonth when there was so much talk about his being away from home days and days together there was something wrong more than commonthat was quite clear for mr godfrey didnt look half so freshcoloured and open as he used to do  at one time everybody was saying what a handsome couple he and miss nancy lammeter would make and if she could come to be mistress at the red house there would be a fine change for the lammeters had been brought up in that way that they never suffered a pinch of salt to be wasted and yet everybody in their household had of the best according to his place  such a daughterinlaw would be a saving to the old squire if she never brought a penny to her fortune for it was to be feared that notwithstanding his incomings there were more holes in his pocket than the one where he put his own hand in  but if mr godfrey didnt turn over a new leaf he might say goodbye to miss nancy lammeter  it was the once hopeful godfrey who was standing with his hands in his sidepockets and his back to the fire in the dark wainscoted parlour one late november afternoon in that fifteenth year of silas marners life at raveloe  the fading grey light fell dimly on the walls decorated with guns whips and foxes brushes on coats and hats flung on the chairs on tankards sending forth a scent of flat ale and on a halfchoked fire with pipes propped up in the chimneycorners signs of a domestic life destitute of any hallowing charm with which the look of gloomy vexation on godfreys blond face was in sad accordance he seemed to be waiting and listening for some ones approach and presently the sound of a heavy step with an accompanying whistle was heard across the large empty entrancehall  the door opened and a thickset heavylooking young man entered with the flushed face and the gratuitously elated bearing which mark the first stage of intoxication  it was dunsey and at the sight of him godfreys face parted with some of its gloom to take on the more active expression of hatred  the handsome brown spaniel that lay on the hearth retreated under the chair in the chimneycorner  well master godfrey what do you want with me  said dunsey in a mocking tone  youre my elders and betters you know i was obliged to come when you sent for me  why this is what i wantand just shake yourself sober and listen will you  said godfrey savagely  he had himself been drinking more than was good for him trying to turn his gloom into uncalculating anger  i want to tell you i must hand over that rent of fowlers to the squire or else tell him i gave it you for hes threatening to distrain for it and itll all be out soon whether i tell him or not he said just now before he went out he should send word to cox to distrain if fowler didnt come and pay up his arrears this week  the squires short o cash and in no humour to stand any nonsense and you know what he threatened if ever he found you making away with his money again  so see and get the money and pretty quickly will you  oh  said dunsey sneeringly coming nearer to his brother and looking in his face  suppose now you get the money yourself and save me the trouble eh  since you was so kind as to hand it over to me youll not refuse me the kindness to pay it back for me it was your brotherly love made you do it you know  godfrey bit his lips and clenched his fist  dont come near me with that look else ill knock you down  oh no you wont said dunsey turning away on his heel however because im such a goodnatured brother you know i might get you turned out of house and home and cut off with a shilling any day  i might tell the squire how his handsome son was married to that nice young woman molly farren and was very unhappy because he couldnt live with his drunken wife and i should slip into your place as comfortable as could be  but you see i dont do itim so easy and goodnatured  youll take any trouble for me youll get the hundred pounds for mei know you will  how can i get the money  said godfrey quivering  i havent a shilling to bless myself with  and its a lie that youd slip into my place youd get yourself turned out too thats all  for if you begin telling tales ill follow  bobs my fathers favouriteyou know that very well  hed only think himself well rid of you  never mind said dunsey nodding his head sideways as he looked out of the window  it ud be very pleasant to me to go in your companyyoure such a handsome brother and weve always been so fond of quarrelling with one another i shouldnt know what to do without you  but youd like better for us both to stay at home together i know you would  so youll manage to get that little sum o money and ill bid you goodbye though im sorry to part  dunstan was moving off but godfrey rushed after him and seized him by the arm saying with an oath  i tell you i have no money i can get no money  borrow of old kimble  i tell you he wont lend me any more and i shant ask him  well then sell wildfire  yes thats easy talking  i must have the money directly  well youve only got to ride him to the hunt tomorrow  therell be bryce and keating there for sure  youll get more bids than one  i daresay and get back home at eight oclock splashed up to the chin  im going to mrs osgoods birthday dance  oho  said dunsey turning his head on one side and trying to speak in a small mincing treble  and theres sweet miss nancy coming and we shall dance with her and promise never to be naughty again and be taken into favour and  hold your tongue about miss nancy you fool said godfrey turning red else ill throttle you  what for  said dunsey still in an artificial tone but taking a whip from the table and beating the buttend of it on his palm youve a very good chance  id advise you to creep up her sleeve again it ud be saving time if molly should happen to take a drop too much laudanum some day and make a widower of you  miss nancy wouldnt mind being a second if she didnt know it  and youve got a goodnatured brother wholl keep your secret well because youll be so very obliging to him  ill tell you what it is said godfrey quivering and pale again my patience is pretty near at an end  if youd a little more sharpness in you you might know that you may urge a man a bit too far and make one leap as easy as another  i dont know but what it is so now i may as well tell the squire everything myselfi should get you off my back if i got nothing else  and after all hell know some time  shes been threatening to come herself and tell him  so dont flatter yourself that your secrecys worth any price you choose to ask you drain me of money till i have got nothing to pacify her with and shell do as she threatens some day  its all one  ill tell my father everything myself and you may go to the devil  dunsey perceived that he had overshot his mark and that there was a point at which even the hesitating godfrey might be driven into decision  but he said with an air of unconcern  as you please but ill have a draught of ale first  and ringing the bell he threw himself across two chairs and began to rap the windowseat with the handle of his whip  godfrey stood still with his back to the fire uneasily moving his fingers among the contents of his sidepockets and looking at the floor  that big muscular frame of his held plenty of animal courage but helped him to no decision when the dangers to be braved were such as could neither be knocked down nor throttled  his natural irresolution and moral cowardice were exaggerated by a position in which dreaded consequences seemed to press equally on all sides and his irritation had no sooner provoked him to defy dunstan and anticipate all possible betrayals than the miseries he must bring on himself by such a step seemed more unendurable to him than the present evil  the results of confession were not contingent they were certain whereas betrayal was not certain from the near vision of that certainty he fell back on suspense and vacillation with a sense of repose  the disinherited son of a small squire equally disinclined to dig and to beg was almost as helpless as an uprooted tree which by the favour of earth and sky has grown to a handsome bulk on the spot where it first shot upward perhaps it would have been possible to think of digging with some cheerfulness if nancy lammeter were to be won on those terms but since he must irrevocably lose her as well as the inheritance and must break every tie but the one that degraded him and left him without motive for trying to recover his better self he could imagine no future for himself on the other side of confession but that of listing for a soldierthe most desperate step short of suicide in the eyes of respectable families  no  he would rather trust to casualties than to his own resolverather go on sitting at the feast and sipping the wine he loved though with the sword hanging over him and terror in his heart than rush away into the cold darkness where there was no pleasure left  the utmost concession to dunstan about the horse began to seem easy compared with the fulfilment of his own threat  but his pride would not let him recommence the conversation otherwise than by continuing the quarrel  dunstan was waiting for this and took his ale in shorter draughts than usual  its just like you godfrey burst out in a bitter tone to talk about my selling wildfire in that cool waythe last thing ive got to call my own and the best bit of horseflesh i ever had in my life and if youd got a spark of pride in you youd be ashamed to see the stables emptied and everybody sneering about it but its my belief youd sell yourself if it was only for the pleasure of making somebody feel hed got a bad bargain  aye aye said dunstan very placably you do me justice i see you know im a jewel for ticing people into bargains  for which reason i advise you to let me sell wildfire  id ride him to the hunt tomorrow for you with pleasure  i shouldnt look so handsome as you in the saddle but its the horse theyll bid for and not the rider  yes i daresaytrust my horse to you  as you please said dunstan rapping the windowseat again with an air of great unconcern  its you have got to pay fowlers money its none of my business  you received the money from him when you went to bramcote and you told the squire it wasnt paid id nothing to do with that you chose to be so obliging as to give it me that was all  if you dont want to pay the money let it alone its all one to me  but i was willing to accommodate you by undertaking to sell the horse seeing its not convenient to you to go so far tomorrow  godfrey was silent for some moments  he would have liked to spring on dunstan wrench the whip from his hand and flog him to within an inch of his life and no bodily fear could have deterred him but he was mastered by another sort of fear which was fed by feelings stronger even than his resentment  when he spoke again it was in a halfconciliatory tone  well you mean no nonsense about the horse eh  youll sell him all fair and hand over the money  if you dont you know everything ull go to smash for ive got nothing else to trust to and youll have less pleasure in pulling the house over my head when your own skulls to be broken too  aye aye said dunstan rising all right  i thought youd come round  im the fellow to bring old bryce up to the scratch ill get you a hundred and twenty for him if i get you a penny  but itll perhaps rain cats and dogs tomorrow as it did yesterday and then you cant go said godfrey hardly knowing whether he wished for that obstacle or not  not it said dunstan  im always lucky in my weather  it might rain if you wanted to go yourself  you never hold trumps you knowi always do  youve got the beauty you see and ive got the luck so you must keep me by you for your crooked sixpence youll never get along without me  confound you hold your tongue  said godfrey impetuously and take care to keep sober tomorrow else youll get pitched on your head coming home and wildfire might be the worse for it  make your tender heart easy said dunstan opening the door you never knew me see double when id got a bargain to make it ud spoil the fun  besides whenever i fall im warranted to fall on my legs  with that dunstan slammed the door behind him and left godfrey to that bitter rumination on his personal circumstances which was now unbroken from day to day save by the excitement of sporting drinking cardplaying or the rarer and less oblivious pleasure of seeing miss nancy lammeter  the subtle and varied pains springing from the higher sensibility that accompanies higher culture are perhaps less pitiable than that dreary absence of impersonal enjoyment and consolation which leaves ruder minds to the perpetual urgent companionship of their own griefs and discontents  the lives of those rural forefathers whom we are apt to think very prosaic figuresmen whose only work was to ride round their land getting heavier and heavier in their saddles and who passed the rest of their days in the halflistless gratification of senses dulled by monotonyhad a certain pathos in them nevertheless calamities came to them too and their early errors carried hard consequences perhaps the love of some sweet maiden the image of purity order and calm had opened their eyes to the vision of a life in which the days would not seem too long even without rioting but the maiden was lost and the vision passed away and then what was left to them especially when they had become too heavy for the hunt or for carrying a gun over the furrows but to drink and get merry or to drink and get angry so that they might be independent of variety and say over again with eager emphasis the things they had said already any time that twelvemonth assuredly among these flushed and dulleyed men there were some whomthanks to their native humankindnesseven riot could never drive into brutality men who when their cheeks were fresh had felt the keen point of sorrow or remorse had been pierced by the reeds they leaned on or had lightly put their limbs in fetters from which no struggle could loose them and under these sad circumstances common to us all their thoughts could find no restingplace outside the evertrodden round of their own petty history  that at least was the condition of godfrey cass in this sixandtwentieth year of his life  a movement of compunction helped by those small indefinable influences which every personal relation exerts on a pliant nature had urged him into a secret marriage which was a blight on his life  it was an ugly story of low passion delusion and waking from delusion which needs not to be dragged from the privacy of godfreys bitter memory  he had long known that the delusion was partly due to a trap laid for him by dunstan who saw in his brothers degrading marriage the means of gratifying at once his jealous hate and his cupidity  and if godfrey could have felt himself simply a victim the iron bit that destiny had put into his mouth would have chafed him less intolerably  if the curses he muttered half aloud when he was alone had had no other object than dunstans diabolical cunning he might have shrunk less from the consequences of avowal but he had something else to cursehis own vicious folly which now seemed as mad and unaccountable to him as almost all our follies and vices do when their promptings have long passed away  for four years he had thought of nancy lammeter and wooed her with tacit patient worship as the woman who made him think of the future with joy she would be his wife and would make home lovely to him as his fathers home had never been and it would be easy when she was always near to shake off those foolish habits that were no pleasures but only a feverish way of annulling vacancy  godfreys was an essentially domestic nature bred up in a home where the hearth had no smiles and where the daily habits were not chastised by the presence of household order  his easy disposition made him fall in unresistingly with the family courses but the need of some tender permanent affection the longing for some influence that would make the good he preferred easy to pursue caused the neatness purity and liberal orderliness of the lammeter household sunned by the smile of nancy to seem like those fresh bright hours of the morning when temptations go to sleep and leave the ear open to the voice of the good angel inviting to industry sobriety and peace  and yet the hope of this paradise had not been enough to save him from a course which shut him out of it for ever  instead of keeping fast hold of the strong silken rope by which nancy would have drawn him safe to the green banks where it was easy to step firmly he had let himself be dragged back into mud and slime in which it was useless to struggle  he had made ties for himself which robbed him of all wholesome motive and were a constant exasperation  still there was one position worse than the present it was the position he would be in when the ugly secret was disclosed and the desire that continually triumphed over every other was that of warding off the evil day when he would have to bear the consequences of his fathers violent resentment for the wound inflicted on his family pridewould have perhaps to turn his back on that hereditary ease and dignity which after all was a sort of reason for living and would carry with him the certainty that he was banished for ever from the sight and esteem of nancy lammeter  the longer the interval the more chance there was of deliverance from some at least of the hateful consequences to which he had sold himself the more opportunities remained for him to snatch the strange gratification of seeing nancy and gathering some faint indications of her lingering regard  towards this gratification he was impelled fitfully every now and then after having passed weeks in which he had avoided her as the faroff brightwinged prize that only made him spring forward and find his chain all the more galling  one of those fits of yearning was on him now and it would have been strong enough to have persuaded him to trust wildfire to dunstan rather than disappoint the yearning even if he had not had another reason for his disinclination towards the morrows hunt  that other reason was the fact that the mornings meet was near batherley the markettown where the unhappy woman lived whose image became more odious to him every day and to his thought the whole vicinage was haunted by her  the yoke a man creates for himself by wrongdoing will breed hate in the kindliest nature and the goodhumoured affectionatehearted godfrey cass was fast becoming a bitter man visited by cruel wishes that seemed to enter and depart and enter again like demons who had found in him a readygarnished home  what was he to do this evening to pass the time  he might as well go to the rainbow and hear the talk about the cockfighting everybody was there and what else was there to be done  though for his own part he did not care a button for cockfighting snuff the brown spaniel who had placed herself in front of him and had been watching him for some time now jumped up in impatience for the expected caress but godfrey thrust her away without looking at her and left the room followed humbly by the unresenting snuffperhaps because she saw no other career open to her    chapter iv  dunstan cass setting off in the raw morning at the judiciously quiet pace of a man who is obliged to ride to cover on his hunter had to take his way along the lane which at its farther extremity passed by the piece of unenclosed ground called the stonepit where stood the cottage once a stonecutters shed now for fifteen years inhabited by silas marner  the spot looked very dreary at this season with the moist trodden clay about it and the red muddy water high up in the deserted quarry  that was dunstans first thought as he approached it the second was that the old fool of a weaver whose loom he heard rattling already had a great deal of money hidden somewhere  how was it that he dunstan cass who had often heard talk of marners miserliness had never thought of suggesting to godfrey that he should frighten or persuade the old fellow into lending the money on the excellent security of the young squires prospects  the resource occurred to him now as so easy and agreeable especially as marners hoard was likely to be large enough to leave godfrey a handsome surplus beyond his immediate needs and enable him to accommodate his faithful brother that he had almost turned the horses head towards home again godfrey would be ready enough to accept the suggestion he would snatch eagerly at a plan that might save him from parting with wildfire but when dunstans meditation reached this point the inclination to go on grew strong and prevailed  he didnt want to give godfrey that pleasure he preferred that master godfrey should be vexed moreover dunstan enjoyed the selfimportant consciousness of having a horse to sell and the opportunity of driving a bargain swaggering and possibly taking somebody in  he might have all the satisfaction attendant on selling his brothers horse and not the less have the further satisfaction of setting godfrey to borrow marners money  so he rode on to cover  bryce and keating were there as dunstan was quite sure they would behe was such a lucky fellow  heyday  said bryce who had long had his eye on wildfire youre on your brothers horse today hows that  oh ive swopped with him said dunstan whose delight in lying grandly independent of utility was not to be diminished by the likelihood that his hearer would not believe himwildfires mine now  what  has he swopped with you for that bigboned hack of yours said bryce quite aware that he should get another lie in answer  oh there was a little account between us said dunsey carelessly and wildfire made it even  i accommodated him by taking the horse though it was against my will for id got an itch for a mare o jortinsas rare a bit o blood as ever you threw your leg across but i shall keep wildfire now ive got him though id a bid of a hundred and fifty for him the other day from a man over at flittonhes buying for lord cromlecka fellow with a cast in his eye and a green waistcoat  but i mean to stick to wildfire i shant get a better at a fence in a hurry  the mares got more blood but shes a bit too weak in the hindquarters  bryce of course divined that dunstan wanted to sell the horse and dunstan knew that he divined it horsedealing is only one of many human transactions carried on in this ingenious manner and they both considered that the bargain was in its first stage when bryce replied ironically  i wonder at that now i wonder you mean to keep him for i never heard of a man who didnt want to sell his horse getting a bid of half as much again as the horse was worth  youll be lucky if you get a hundred  keating rode up now and the transaction became more complicated it ended in the purchase of the horse by bryce for a hundred and twenty to be paid on the delivery of wildfire safe and sound at the batherley stables  it did occur to dunsey that it might be wise for him to give up the days hunting proceed at once to batherley and having waited for bryces return hire a horse to carry him home with the money in his pocket  but the inclination for a run encouraged by confidence in his luck and by a draught of brandy from his pocketpistol at the conclusion of the bargain was not easy to overcome especially with a horse under him that would take the fences to the admiration of the field  dunstan however took one fence too many and got his horse pierced with a hedgestake his own illfavoured person which was quite unmarketable escaped without injury but poor wildfire unconscious of his price turned on his flank and painfully panted his last  it happened that dunstan a short time before having had to get down to arrange his stirrup had muttered a good many curses at this interruption which had thrown him in the rear of the hunt near the moment of glory and under this exasperation had taken the fences more blindly  he would soon have been up with the hounds again when the fatal accident happened and hence he was between eager riders in advance not troubling themselves about what happened behind them and faroff stragglers who were as likely as not to pass quite aloof from the line of road in which wildfire had fallen  dunstan whose nature it was to care more for immediate annoyances than for remote consequences no sooner recovered his legs and saw that it was all over with wildfire than he felt a satisfaction at the absence of witnesses to a position which no swaggering could make enviable reinforcing himself after his shake with a little brandy and much swearing he walked as fast as he could to a coppice on his right hand through which it occurred to him that he could make his way to batherley without danger of encountering any member of the hunt his first intention was to hire a horse there and ride home forthwith for to walk many miles without a gun in his hand and along an ordinary road was as much out of the question to him as to other spirited young men of his kind  he did not much mind about taking the bad news to godfrey for he had to offer him at the same time the resource of marners money and if godfrey kicked as he always did at the notion of making a fresh debt from which he himself got the smallest share of advantage why he wouldnt kick long dunstan felt sure he could worry godfrey into anything  the idea of marners money kept growing in vividness now the want of it had become immediate the prospect of having to make his appearance with the muddy boots of a pedestrian at batherley and to encounter the grinning queries of stablemen stood unpleasantly in the way of his impatience to be back at raveloe and carry out his felicitous plan and a casual visitation of his waistcoatpocket as he was ruminating awakened his memory to the fact that the two or three small coins his forefinger encountered there were of too pale a colour to cover that small debt without payment of which the stablekeeper had declared he would never do any more business with dunsey cass  after all according to the direction in which the run had brought him he was not so very much farther from home than he was from batherley but dunsey not being remarkable for clearness of head was only led to this conclusion by the gradual perception that there were other reasons for choosing the unprecedented course of walking home  it was now nearly four oclock and a mist was gathering the sooner he got into the road the better he remembered having crossed the road and seen the fingerpost only a little while before wildfire broke down so buttoning his coat twisting the lash of his huntingwhip compactly round the handle and rapping the tops of his boots with a selfpossessed air as if to assure himself that he was not at all taken by surprise he set off with the sense that he was undertaking a remarkable feat of bodily exertion which somehow and at some time he should be able to dress up and magnify to the admiration of a select circle at the rainbow  when a young gentleman like dunsey is reduced to so exceptional a mode of locomotion as walking a whip in his hand is a desirable corrective to a too bewildering dreamy sense of unwontedness in his position and dunstan as he went along through the gathering mist was always rapping his whip somewhere  it was godfreys whip which he had chosen to take without leave because it had a gold handle of course no one could see when dunstan held it that the name godfrey cass was cut in deep letters on that gold handlethey could only see that it was a very handsome whip dunsey was not without fear that he might meet some acquaintance in whose eyes he would cut a pitiable figure for mist is no screen when people get close to each other but when he at last found himself in the wellknown raveloe lanes without having met a soul he silently remarked that that was part of his usual good luck but now the mist helped by the evening darkness was more of a screen than he desired for it hid the ruts into which his feet were liable to sliphid everything so that he had to guide his steps by dragging his whip along the low bushes in advance of the hedgerow he must soon he thought be getting near the opening at the stonepits he should find it out by the break in the hedgerow  he found it out however by another circumstance which he had not expectednamely by certain gleams of light which he presently guessed to proceed from silas marners cottage  that cottage and the money hidden within it had been in his mind continually during his walk and he had been imagining ways of cajoling and tempting the weaver to part with the immediate possession of his money for the sake of receiving interest  dunstan felt as if there must be a little frightening added to the cajolery for his own arithmetical convictions were not clear enough to afford him any forcible demonstration as to the advantages of interest and as for security he regarded it vaguely as a means of cheating a man by making him believe that he would be paid  altogether the operation on the misers mind was a task that godfrey would be sure to hand over to his more daring and cunning brother dunstan had made up his mind to that and by the time he saw the light gleaming through the chinks of marners shutters the idea of a dialogue with the weaver had become so familiar to him that it occurred to him as quite a natural thing to make the acquaintance forthwith  there might be several conveniences attending this course the weaver had possibly got a lantern and dunstan was tired of feeling his way  he was still nearly threequarters of a mile from home and the lane was becoming unpleasantly slippery for the mist was passing into rain he turned up the bank not without some fear lest he might miss the right way since he was not certain whether the light were in front or on the side of the cottage  but he felt the ground before him cautiously with his whiphandle and at last arrived safely at the door  he knocked loudly rather enjoying the idea that the old fellow would be frightened at the sudden noise  he heard no movement in reply all was silence in the cottage  was the weaver gone to bed then  if so why had he left a light  that was a strange forgetfulness in a miser dunstan knocked still more loudly and without pausing for a reply pushed his fingers through the latchhole intending to shake the door and pull the latchstring up and down not doubting that the door was fastened but to his surprise at this double motion the door opened and he found himself in front of a bright fire which lit up every corner of the cottagethe bed the loom the three chairs and the tableand showed him that marner was not there  nothing at that moment could be much more inviting to dunsey than the bright fire on the brick hearth he walked in and seated himself by it at once  there was something in front of the fire too that would have been inviting to a hungry man if it had been in a different stage of cooking  it was a small bit of pork suspended from the kettlehanger by a string passed through a large doorkey in a way known to primitive housekeepers unpossessed of jacks  but the pork had been hung at the farthest extremity of the hanger apparently to prevent the roasting from proceeding too rapidly during the owners absence  the old staring simpleton had hot meat for his supper then thought dunstan  people had always said he lived on mouldy bread on purpose to check his appetite  but where could he be at this time and on such an evening leaving his supper in this stage of preparation and his door unfastened  dunstans own recent difficulty in making his way suggested to him that the weaver had perhaps gone outside his cottage to fetch in fuel or for some such brief purpose and had slipped into the stonepit  that was an interesting idea to dunstan carrying consequences of entire novelty  if the weaver was dead who had a right to his money  who would know where his money was hidden who would know that anybody had come to take it away  he went no farther into the subtleties of evidence the pressing question where is the money  now took such entire possession of him as to make him quite forget that the weavers death was not a certainty  a dull mind once arriving at an inference that flatters a desire is rarely able to retain the impression that the notion from which the inference started was purely problematic  and dunstans mind was as dull as the mind of a possible felon usually is  there were only three hidingplaces where he had ever heard of cottagers hoards being found the thatch the bed and a hole in the floor  marners cottage had no thatch and dunstans first act after a train of thought made rapid by the stimulus of cupidity was to go up to the bed but while he did so his eyes travelled eagerly over the floor where the bricks distinct in the firelight were discernible under the sprinkling of sand  but not everywhere for there was one spot and one only which was quite covered with sand and sand showing the marks of fingers which had apparently been careful to spread it over a given space  it was near the treddles of the loom  in an instant dunstan darted to that spot swept away the sand with his whip and inserting the thin end of the hook between the bricks found that they were loose  in haste he lifted up two bricks and saw what he had no doubt was the object of his search for what could there be but money in those two leathern bags  and from their weight they must be filled with guineas dunstan felt round the hole to be certain that it held no more then hastily replaced the bricks and spread the sand over them  hardly more than five minutes had passed since he entered the cottage but it seemed to dunstan like a long while and though he was without any distinct recognition of the possibility that marner might be alive and might reenter the cottage at any moment he felt an undefinable dread laying hold on him as he rose to his feet with the bags in his hand he would hasten out into the darkness and then consider what he should do with the bags  he closed the door behind him immediately that he might shut in the stream of light a few steps would be enough to carry him beyond betrayal by the gleams from the shutterchinks and the latchhole  the rain and darkness had got thicker and he was glad of it though it was awkward walking with both hands filled so that it was as much as he could do to grasp his whip along with one of the bags  but when he had gone a yard or two he might take his time  so he stepped forward into the darkness    chapter v  when dunstan cass turned his back on the cottage silas marner was not more than a hundred yards away from it plodding along from the village with a sack thrown round his shoulders as an overcoat and with a horn lantern in his hand  his legs were weary but his mind was at ease free from the presentiment of change  the sense of security more frequently springs from habit than from conviction and for this reason it often subsists after such a change in the conditions as might have been expected to suggest alarm  the lapse of time during which a given event has not happened is in this logic of habit constantly alleged as a reason why the event should never happen even when the lapse of time is precisely the added condition which makes the event imminent a man will tell you that he has worked in a mine for forty years unhurt by an accident as a reason why he should apprehend no danger though the roof is beginning to sink and it is often observable that the older a man gets the more difficult it is to him to retain a believing conception of his own death  this influence of habit was necessarily strong in a man whose life was so monotonous as marnerswho saw no new people and heard of no new events to keep alive in him the idea of the unexpected and the changeful and it explains simply enough why his mind could be at ease though he had left his house and his treasure more defenceless than usual  silas was thinking with double complacency of his supper first because it would be hot and savoury and secondly because it would cost him nothing  for the little bit of pork was a present from that excellent housewife miss priscilla lammeter to whom he had this day carried home a handsome piece of linen and it was only on occasion of a present like this that silas indulged himself with roastmeat  supper was his favourite meal because it came at his time of revelry when his heart warmed over his gold whenever he had roastmeat he always chose to have it for supper  but this evening he had no sooner ingeniously knotted his string fast round his bit of pork twisted the string according to rule over his doorkey passed it through the handle and made it fast on the hanger than he remembered that a piece of very fine twine was indispensable to his setting up a new piece of work in his loom early in the morning  it had slipped his memory because in coming from mr lammeters he had not had to pass through the village but to lose time by going on errands in the morning was out of the question  it was a nasty fog to turn out into but there were things silas loved better than his own comfort so drawing his pork to the extremity of the hanger and arming himself with his lantern and his old sack he set out on what in ordinary weather would have been a twenty minutes errand  he could not have locked his door without undoing his wellknotted string and retarding his supper it was not worth his while to make that sacrifice  what thief would find his way to the stonepits on such a night as this and why should he come on this particular night when he had never come through all the fifteen years before  these questions were not distinctly present in silass mind they merely serve to represent the vaguelyfelt foundation of his freedom from anxiety  he reached his door in much satisfaction that his errand was done he opened it and to his shortsighted eyes everything remained as he had left it except that the fire sent out a welcome increase of heat  he trod about the floor while putting by his lantern and throwing aside his hat and sack so as to merge the marks of dunstans feet on the sand in the marks of his own nailed boots then he moved his pork nearer to the fire and sat down to the agreeable business of tending the meat and warming himself at the same time  any one who had looked at him as the red light shone upon his pale face strange straining eyes and meagre form would perhaps have understood the mixture of contemptuous pity dread and suspicion with which he was regarded by his neighbours in raveloe  yet few men could be more harmless than poor marner  in his truthful simple soul not even the growing greed and worship of gold could beget any vice directly injurious to others  the light of his faith quite put out and his affections made desolate he had clung with all the force of his nature to his work and his money and like all objects to which a man devotes himself they had fashioned him into correspondence with themselves  his loom as he wrought in it without ceasing had in its turn wrought on him and confirmed more and more the monotonous craving for its monotonous response  his gold as he hung over it and saw it grow gathered his power of loving together into a hard isolation like its own  as soon as he was warm he began to think it would be a long while to wait till after supper before he drew out his guineas and it would be pleasant to see them on the table before him as he ate his unwonted feast  for joy is the best of wine and silass guineas were a golden wine of that sort  he rose and placed his candle unsuspectingly on the floor near his loom swept away the sand without noticing any change and removed the bricks  the sight of the empty hole made his heart leap violently but the belief that his gold was gone could not come at onceonly terror and the eager effort to put an end to the terror  he passed his trembling hand all about the hole trying to think it possible that his eyes had deceived him then he held the candle in the hole and examined it curiously trembling more and more  at last he shook so violently that he let fall the candle and lifted his hands to his head trying to steady himself that he might think  had he put his gold somewhere else by a sudden resolution last night and then forgotten it  a man falling into dark waters seeks a momentary footing even on sliding stones and silas by acting as if he believed in false hopes warded off the moment of despair  he searched in every corner he turned his bed over and shook it and kneaded it he looked in his brick oven where he laid his sticks  when there was no other place to be searched he kneeled down again and felt once more all round the hole there was no untried refuge left for a moments shelter from the terrible truth  yes there was a sort of refuge which always comes with the prostration of thought under an overpowering passion it was that expectation of impossibilities that belief in contradictory images which is still distinct from madness because it is capable of being dissipated by the external fact  silas got up from his knees trembling and looked round at the table didnt the gold lie there after all  the table was bare then he turned and looked behind himlooked all round his dwelling seeming to strain his brown eyes after some possible appearance of the bags where he had already sought them in vain  he could see every object in his cottageand his gold was not there  again he put his trembling hands to his head and gave a wild ringing scream the cry of desolation  for a few moments after he stood motionless but the cry had relieved him from the first maddening pressure of the truth  he turned and tottered towards his loom and got into the seat where he worked instinctively seeking this as the strongest assurance of reality  and now that all the false hopes had vanished and the first shock of certainty was past the idea of a thief began to present itself and he entertained it eagerly because a thief might be caught and made to restore the gold  the thought brought some new strength with it and he started from his loom to the door  as he opened it the rain beat in upon him for it was falling more and more heavily there were no footsteps to be tracked on such a nightfootsteps when had the thief come  during silass absence in the daytime the door had been locked and there had been no marks of any inroad on his return by daylight and in the evening too he said to himself everything was the same as when he had left it  the sand and bricks looked as if they had not been moved  was it a thief who had taken the bags  or was it a cruel power that no hands could reach which had delighted in making him a second time desolate  he shrank from this vaguer dread and fixed his mind with struggling effort on the robber with hands who could be reached by hands  his thoughts glanced at all the neighbours who had made any remarks or asked any questions which he might now regard as a ground of suspicion  there was jem rodney a known poacher and otherwise disreputable he had often met marner in his journeys across the fields and had said something jestingly about the weavers money nay he had once irritated marner by lingering at the fire when he called to light his pipe instead of going about his business  jem rodney was the manthere was ease in the thought  jem could be found and made to restore the money marner did not want to punish him but only to get back his gold which had gone from him and left his soul like a forlorn traveller on an unknown desert  the robber must be laid hold of  marners ideas of legal authority were confused but he felt that he must go and proclaim his loss and the great people in the villagethe clergyman the constable and squire casswould make jem rodney or somebody else deliver up the stolen money  he rushed out in the rain under the stimulus of this hope forgetting to cover his head not caring to fasten his door for he felt as if he had nothing left to lose  he ran swiftly till want of breath compelled him to slacken his pace as he was entering the village at the turning close to the rainbow  the rainbow in marners view was a place of luxurious resort for rich and stout husbands whose wives had superfluous stores of linen it was the place where he was likely to find the powers and dignities of raveloe and where he could most speedily make his loss public  he lifted the latch and turned into the bright bar or kitchen on the right hand where the less lofty customers of the house were in the habit of assembling the parlour on the left being reserved for the more select society in which squire cass frequently enjoyed the double pleasure of conviviality and condescension  but the parlour was dark tonight the chief personages who ornamented its circle being all at mrs osgoods birthday dance as godfrey cass was  and in consequence of this the party on the highscreened seats in the kitchen was more numerous than usual several personages who would otherwise have been admitted into the parlour and enlarged the opportunity of hectoring and condescension for their betters being content this evening to vary their enjoyment by taking their spiritsandwater where they could themselves hector and condescend in company that called for beer    chapter vi  the conversation which was at a high pitch of animation when silas approached the door of the rainbow had as usual been slow and intermittent when the company first assembled  the pipes began to be puffed in a silence which had an air of severity the more important customers who drank spirits and sat nearest the fire staring at each other as if a bet were depending on the first man who winked while the beerdrinkers chiefly men in fustian jackets and smockfrocks kept their eyelids down and rubbed their hands across their mouths as if their draughts of beer were a funereal duty attended with embarrassing sadness  at last mr snell the landlord a man of a neutral disposition accustomed to stand aloof from human differences as those of beings who were all alike in need of liquor broke silence by saying in a doubtful tone to his cousin the butcher  some folks ud say that was a fine beast you druv in yesterday bob  the butcher a jolly smiling redhaired man was not disposed to answer rashly  he gave a few puffs before he spat and replied and they wouldnt be fur wrong john  after this feeble delusive thaw the silence set in as severely as before  was it a red durham  said the farrier taking up the thread of discourse after the lapse of a few minutes  the farrier looked at the landlord and the landlord looked at the butcher as the person who must take the responsibility of answering  red it was said the butcher in his goodhumoured husky trebleand a durham it was  then you neednt tell me who you bought it of said the farrier looking round with some triumph i know who it is has got the red durhams o this countryside  and shed a white star on her brow ill bet a penny  the farrier leaned forward with his hands on his knees as he put this question and his eyes twinkled knowingly  well yesshe might said the butcher slowly considering that he was giving a decided affirmative  i dont say contrairy  i knew that very well said the farrier throwing himself backward again and speaking defiantly if i dont know mr lammeters cows i should like to know who doesthats all and as for the cow youve bought bargain or no bargain ive been at the drenching of hercontradick me who will  the farrier looked fierce and the mild butchers conversational spirit was roused a little  im not for contradicking no man he said im for peace and quietness  some are for cutting long ribsim for cutting em short myself but i dont quarrel with em  all i say is its a lovely carkissand anybody as was reasonable it ud bring tears into their eyes to look at it  well its the cow as i drenched whatever it is pursued the farrier angrily and it was mr lammeters cow else you told a lie when you said it was a red durham  i tell no lies said the butcher with the same mild huskiness as before and i contradick nonenot if a man was to swear himself black hes no meat o mine nor none o my bargains  all i say is its a lovely carkiss  and what i say ill stick to but ill quarrel wi no man  no said the farrier with bitter sarcasm looking at the company generally and prhaps you arent pigheaded and prhaps you didnt say the cow was a red durham and prhaps you didnt say shed got a star on her browstick to that now youre at it  come come said the landlord let the cow alone  the truth lies atween you youre both right and both wrong as i allays say and as for the cows being mr lammeters i say nothing to that but this i say as the rainbows the rainbow  and for the matter o that if the talk is to be o the lammeters you know the most upo that head eh mr macey  you remember when first mr lammeters father come into these parts and took the warrens  mr macey tailor and parishclerk the latter of which functions rheumatism had of late obliged him to share with a smallfeatured young man who sat opposite him held his white head on one side and twirled his thumbs with an air of complacency slightly seasoned with criticism  he smiled pityingly in answer to the landlords appeal and said  aye aye i know i know but i let other folks talk  ive laid by now and gev up to the young uns  ask them as have been to school at tarley theyve learnt pernouncing thats come up since my day  if youre pointing at me mr macey said the deputy clerk with an air of anxious propriety im nowise a man to speak out of my place as the psalm says    i know whats right nor only so   but also practise what i know   well then i wish youd keep hold o the tune when its set for you if youre for practising i wish youd practise that said a large jocoselooking man an excellent wheelwright in his weekday capacity but on sundays leader of the choir  he winked as he spoke at two of the company who were known officially as the bassoon and the keybugle in the confidence that he was expressing the sense of the musical profession in raveloe  mr tookey the deputyclerk who shared the unpopularity common to deputies turned very red but replied with careful moderationmr winthrop if youll bring me any proof as im in the wrong im not the man to say i wont alter  but theres people set up their own ears for a standard and expect the whole choir to follow em  there may be two opinions i hope  aye aye said mr macey who felt very well satisfied with this attack on youthful presumption youre right there tookey theres allays two pinions theres the pinion a man has of himsen and theres the pinion other folks have on him  thered be two pinions about a cracked bell if the bell could hear itself  well mr macey said poor tookey serious amidst the general laughter i undertook to partially fill up the office of parishclerk by mr crackenthorps desire whenever your infirmities should make you unfitting and its one of the rights thereof to sing in the choirelse why have you done the same yourself  ah but the old gentleman and you are two folks said ben winthrop the old gentlemans got a gift  why the squire used to invite him to take a glass only to hear him sing the red rovier didnt he mr macey  its a natral gift  theres my little lad aaron hes got a gifthe can sing a tune off straight like a throstle  but as for you master tookey youd better stick to your amens your voice is well enough when you keep it up in your nose  its your inside as isnt right made for music its no better nor a hollow stalk  this kind of unflinching frankness was the most piquant form of joke to the company at the rainbow and ben winthrops insult was felt by everybody to have capped mr maceys epigram  i see what it is plain enough said mr tookey unable to keep cool any longer  theres a consperacy to turn me out o the choir as i shouldnt share the christmas moneythats where it is  but i shall speak to mr crackenthorp ill not be put upon by no man  nay nay tookey said ben winthrop  well pay you your share to keep out of itthats what well do  theres things folks ud pay to be rid on besides varmin  come come said the landlord who felt that paying people for their absence was a principle dangerous to society a jokes a joke  were all good friends here i hope  we must give and take youre both right and youre both wrong as i say  i agree wi mr macey here as theres two opinions and if mine was asked i should say theyre both right  tookeys right and winthrops right and theyve only got to split the difference and make themselves even  the farrier was puffing his pipe rather fiercely in some contempt at this trivial discussion  he had no ear for music himself and never went to church as being of the medical profession and likely to be in requisition for delicate cows  but the butcher having music in his soul had listened with a divided desire for tookeys defeat and for the preservation of the peace  to be sure he said following up the landlords conciliatory view were fond of our old clerk its natral and him used to be such a singer and got a brother as is known for the first fiddler in this countryside  eh its a pity but what solomon lived in our village and could give us a tune when we liked eh mr macey  id keep him in liver and lights for nothingthat i would  aye aye said mr macey in the height of complacency our familys been known for musicianers as far back as anybody can tell but them things are dying out as i tell solomon every time he comes round theres no voices like what there used to be and theres nobody remembers what we remember if it isnt the old crows  aye you remember when first mr lammeters father come into these parts dont you mr macey  said the landlord  i should think i did said the old man who had now gone through that complimentary process necessary to bring him up to the point of narration and a fine old gentleman he wasas fine and finer nor the mr lammeter as now is  he came from a bit northard so far as i could ever make out  but theres nobody rightly knows about those parts only it couldnt be far northard nor much different from this country for he brought a fine breed o sheep with him so there must be pastures there and everything reasonable  we heared tell as hed sold his own land to come and take the warrens and that seemed odd for a man as had land of his own to come and rent a farm in a strange place  but they said it was along of his wifes dying though theres reasons in things as nobody knows onthats pretty much what ive made out yet some folks are so wise theyll find you fifty reasons straight off and all the while the real reasons winking at em in the corner and they niver seet  howsomever it was soon seen as wed got a new parishner as knowd the rights and customs o things and kep a good house and was well looked on by everybody  and the young manthats the mr lammeter as now is for hed niver a sistersoon begun to court miss osgood thats the sister o the mr osgood as now is and a fine handsome lass she waseh you cant thinkthey pretend this young lass is like her but thats the way wi people as dont know what come before em  i should know for i helped the old rector mr drumlow as was i helped him marry em  here mr macey paused he always gave his narrative in instalments expecting to be questioned according to precedent  aye and a particlar thing happened didnt it mr macey so as you were likely to remember that marriage  said the landlord in a congratulatory tone  i should think there dida very particlar thing said mr macey nodding sideways  for mr drumlowpoor old gentleman i was fond on him though hed got a bit confused in his head what wi age and wi taking a drop o summat warm when the service come of a cold morning and young mr lammeter hed have no way but he must be married in janiwary which to be sure s a unreasonable time to be married in for it isnt like a christening or a burying as you cant help and so mr drumlowpoor old gentleman i was fond on himbut when he come to put the questions he put em by the rule o contrairy like and he says wilt thou have this man to thy wedded wife  says he and then he says wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded husband says he but the particlarest thing of all is as nobody took any notice on it but me and they answered straight off yes like as if it had been me saying amen i the right place without listening to what went before  but you knew what was going on well enough didnt you mr macey you were live enough eh  said the butcher  lor bless you  said mr macey pausing and smiling in pity at the impotence of his hearers imaginationwhy i was all of a tremble it was as if id been a coat pulled by the two tails like for i couldnt stop the parson i couldnt take upon me to do that and yet i said to myself i says suppose they shouldnt be fast married cause the words are contrairy  and my head went working like a mill for i was allays uncommon for turning things over and seeing all round em and i says to myself ist the meanin or the words as makes folks fast i wedlock  for the parson meant right and the bride and bridegroom meant right  but then when i come to think on it meanin goes but a little way i most things for you may mean to stick things together and your glue may be bad and then where are you  and so i says to mysen it isnt the meanin its the glue  and i was worreted as if id got three bells to pull at once when we went into the vestry and they begun to sign their names  but wheres the use o talkingyou cant think what goes on in a cute mans inside  but you held in for all that didnt you mr macey  said the landlord  aye i held in tight till i was by mysen wi mr drumlow and then i out wi everything but respectful as i allays did  and he made light on it and he says pooh pooh macey make yourself easy he says its neither the meaning nor the wordsits the regester does itthats the glue  so you see he settled it easy for parsons and doctors know everything by heart like so as they arent worreted wi thinking whats the rights and wrongs o things as in been many and manys the time  and sure enough the wedding turned out all right ony poor mrs lammeterthats miss osgood as wasdied afore the lasses was growed up but for prosperity and everything respectable theres no family more looked on  every one of mr maceys audience had heard this story many times but it was listened to as if it had been a favourite tune and at certain points the puffing of the pipes was momentarily suspended that the listeners might give their whole minds to the expected words  but there was more to come and mr snell the landlord duly put the leading question  why old mr lammeter had a pretty fortin didnt they say when he come into these parts  well yes said mr macey but i daresay its as much as this mr lammeters done to keep it whole  for there was allays a talk as nobody could get rich on the warrens though he holds it cheap for its what they call charity land  aye and theres few folks know so well as you how it come to be charity land eh mr macey  said the butcher  how should they  said the old clerk with some contempt why my grandfather made the grooms livery for that mr cliff as came and built the big stables at the warrens  why theyre stables four times as big as squire casss for he thought o nothing but hosses and hunting cliff didnta lunnon tailor some folks said as had gone mad wi cheating  for he couldnt ride lor bless you  they said hed got no more grip o the hoss than if his legs had been crosssticks my grandfather heared old squire cass say so many and many a time  but ride he would as if old harry had been adriving him and hed a son a lad o sixteen and nothing would his father have him do but he must ride and ridethough the lad was frighted they said  and it was a common saying as the father wanted to ride the tailor out o the lad and make a gentleman on himnot but what im a tailor myself but in respect as god made me such im proud on it for macey tailor s been wrote up over our door since afore the queens heads went out on the shillings but cliff he was ashamed o being called a tailor and he was sore vexed as his riding was laughed at and nobody o the gentlefolks hereabout could abide him  howsomever the poor lad got sickly and died and the father didnt live long after him for he got queerer nor ever and they said he used to go out i the dead o the night wi a lantern in his hand to the stables and set a lot o lights burning for he got as he couldnt sleep and there hed stand cracking his whip and looking at his hosses and they said it was a mercy as the stables didnt get burnt down wi the poor dumb creaturs in em  but at last he died raving and they found as hed left all his property warrens and all to a lunnon charity and thats how the warrens come to be charity land though as for the stables mr lammeter never uses emtheyre out o all charicterlor bless you if you was to set the doors abanging in em it ud sound like thunder half oer the parish  aye but theres more going on in the stables than what folks see by daylight eh mr macey  said the landlord  aye aye go that way of a dark night thats all said mr macey winking mysteriously and then make believe if you like as you didnt see lights i the stables nor hear the stamping o the hosses nor the cracking o the whips and howling too if its towrt daybreak  cliffs holiday has been the name of it ever sin i were a boy thats to say some said as it was the holiday old harry gev him from roasting like  thats what my father told me and he was a reasonable man though theres folks nowadays know what happened afore they were born better nor they know their own business  what do you say to that eh dowlas  said the landlord turning to the farrier who was swelling with impatience for his cue theres a nut for you to crack  mr dowlas was the negative spirit in the company and was proud of his position  say  i say what a man should say as doesnt shut his eyes to look at a fingerpost  i say as im ready to wager any man ten pound if hell stand out wi me any dry night in the pasture before the warren stables as we shall neither see lights nor hear noises if it isnt the blowing of our own noses  thats what i say and ive said it many a time but theres nobody ull ventur a tenpun note on their ghoses as they make so sure of  why dowlas thats easy betting that is said ben winthrop you might as well bet a man as he wouldnt catch the rheumatise if he stood up to s neck in the pool of a frosty night  it ud be fine fun for a man to win his bet as hed catch the rheumatise folks as believe in cliffs holiday arent agoing to ventur near it for a matter o ten pound  if master dowlas wants to know the truth on it said mr macey with a sarcastic smile tapping his thumbs together hes no call to lay any betlet him go and stan by himselftheres nobody ull hinder him and then he can let the parishners know if theyre wrong  thank you  im obliged to you said the farrier with a snort of scorn  if folks are fools its no business o mine  i dont want to make out the truth about ghoses i know it aready but im not against a beteverything fair and open  let any man bet me ten pound as i shall see cliffs holiday and ill go and stand by myself  i want no company  id as lief do it as id fill this pipe  ah but whos to watch you dowlas and see you do it  thats no fair bet said the butcher  no fair bet  replied mr dowlas angrily  i should like to hear any man stand up and say i want to bet unfair  come now master lundy i should like to hear you say it  very like you would said the butcher  but its no business o mine  youre none o my bargains and i arent agoing to try and bate your price  if anybody ll bid for you at your own vallying let him  im for peace and quietness i am  yes thats what every yapping cur is when you hold a stick up at him said the farrier  but im afraid o neither man nor ghost and im ready to lay a fair bet  i arent a turntail cur  aye but theres this in it dowlas said the landlord speaking in a tone of much candour and tolerance  theres folks i my opinion they cant see ghoses not if they stood as plain as a pikestaff before em  and theres reason i that  for theres my wife now cant smell not if shed the strongest o cheese under her nose  i never seed a ghost myself but then i says to myself very like i havent got the smell for em  i mean putting a ghost for a smell or else contrairiways  and so im for holding with both sides for as i say the truth lies between em  and if dowlas was to go and stand and say hed never seen a wink o cliffs holiday all the night through id back him and if anybody said as cliffs holiday was certain sure for all that id back him too  for the smells what i go by  the landlords analogical argument was not well received by the farriera man intensely opposed to compromise  tut tut he said setting down his glass with refreshed irritation whats the smell got to do with it  did ever a ghost give a man a black eye  thats what i should like to know  if ghoses want me to believe in em let em leave off skulking i the dark and i lone placeslet em come where theres company and candles  as if ghoses ud want to be believed in by anybody so ignirant said mr macey in deep disgust at the farriers crass incompetence to apprehend the conditions of ghostly phenomena    chapter vii  yet the next moment there seemed to be some evidence that ghosts had a more condescending disposition than mr macey attributed to them for the pale thin figure of silas marner was suddenly seen standing in the warm light uttering no word but looking round at the company with his strange unearthly eyes  the long pipes gave a simultaneous movement like the antennae of startled insects and every man present not excepting even the sceptical farrier had an impression that he saw not silas marner in the flesh but an apparition for the door by which silas had entered was hidden by the highscreened seats and no one had noticed his approach mr macey sitting a long way off the ghost might be supposed to have felt an argumentative triumph which would tend to neutralize his share of the general alarm  had he not always said that when silas marner was in that strange trance of his his soul went loose from his body  here was the demonstration nevertheless on the whole he would have been as well contented without it  for a few moments there was a dead silence marners want of breath and agitation not allowing him to speak  the landlord under the habitual sense that he was bound to keep his house open to all company and confident in the protection of his unbroken neutrality at last took on himself the task of adjuring the ghost  master marner he said in a conciliatory tone whats lacking to you  whats your business here  robbed  said silas gaspingly  ive been robbed  i want the constableand the justiceand squire cassand mr crackenthorp  lay hold on him jem rodney said the landlord the idea of a ghost subsiding hes off his head i doubt  hes wet through  jem rodney was the outermost man and sat conveniently near marners standingplace but he declined to give his services  come and lay hold on him yourself mr snell if youve a mind said jem rather sullenly  hes been robbed and murdered too for what i know he added in a muttering tone  jem rodney  said silas turning and fixing his strange eyes on the suspected man  aye master marner what do you want wi me  said jem trembling a little and seizing his drinkingcan as a defensive weapon  if it was you stole my money said silas clasping his hands entreatingly and raising his voice to a cry give it me backand i wont meddle with you  i wont set the constable on you give it me back and ill let youill let you have a guinea  me stole your money  said jem angrily  ill pitch this can at your eye if you talk o my stealing your money  come come master marner said the landlord now rising resolutely and seizing marner by the shoulder if youve got any information to lay speak it out sensible and show as youre in your right mind if you expect anybody to listen to you  youre as wet as a drownded rat sit down and dry yourself and speak straight forrard  ah to be sure man said the farrier who began to feel that he had not been quite on a par with himself and the occasion  lets have no more staring and screaming else well have you strapped for a madman that was why i didnt speak at the firstthinks i the mans run mad  aye aye make him sit down said several voices at once well pleased that the reality of ghosts remained still an open question  the landlord forced marner to take off his coat and then to sit down on a chair aloof from every one else in the centre of the circle and in the direct rays of the fire  the weaver too feeble to have any distinct purpose beyond that of getting help to recover his money submitted unresistingly  the transient fears of the company were now forgotten in their strong curiosity and all faces were turned towards silas when the landlord having seated himself again said  now then master marner whats this youve got to sayas youve been robbed  speak out  hed better not say again as it was me robbed him cried jem rodney hastily  what could i ha done with his money  i could as easy steal the parsons surplice and wear it  hold your tongue jem and lets hear what hes got to say said the landlord  now then master marner  silas now told his story under frequent questioning as the mysterious character of the robbery became evident  this strangely novel situation of opening his trouble to his raveloe neighbours of sitting in the warmth of a hearth not his own and feeling the presence of faces and voices which were his nearest promise of help had doubtless its influence on marner in spite of his passionate preoccupation with his loss  our consciousness rarely registers the beginning of a growth within us any more than without us there have been many circulations of the sap before we detect the smallest sign of the bud  the slight suspicion with which his hearers at first listened to him gradually melted away before the convincing simplicity of his distress it was impossible for the neighbours to doubt that marner was telling the truth not because they were capable of arguing at once from the nature of his statements to the absence of any motive for making them falsely but because as mr macey observed folks as had the devil to back em were not likely to be so mushed as poor silas was  rather from the strange fact that the robber had left no traces and had happened to know the nick of time utterly incalculable by mortal agents when silas would go away from home without locking his door the more probable conclusion seemed to be that his disreputable intimacy in that quarter if it ever existed had been broken up and that in consequence this ill turn had been done to marner by somebody it was quite in vain to set the constable after  why this preternatural felon should be obliged to wait till the door was left unlocked was a question which did not present itself  it isnt jem rodney as has done this work master marner said the landlord  you mustnt be acasting your eye at poor jem there may be a bit of a reckoning against jem for the matter of a hare or so if anybody was bound to keep their eyes staring open and niver to wink but jems been asitting here drinking his can like the decentest man i the parish since before you left your house master marner by your own account  aye aye said mr macey lets have no accusing o the innicent that isnt the law  there must be folks to swear again a man before he can be taen up  lets have no accusing o the innicent master marner  memory was not so utterly torpid in silas that it could not be awakened by these words  with a movement of compunction as new and strange to him as everything else within the last hour he started from his chair and went close up to jem looking at him as if he wanted to assure himself of the expression in his face  i was wrong he saidyes yesi ought to have thought theres nothing to witness against you jem  only youd been into my house oftener than anybody else and so you came into my head i dont accuse youi wont accuse anybodyonly he added lifting up his hands to his head and turning away with bewildered misery i tryi try to think where my guineas can be  aye aye theyre gone where its hot enough to melt em i doubt said mr macey  tchuh  said the farrier  and then he asked with a crossexamining air how much money might there be in the bags master marner  two hundred and seventytwo pounds twelve and sixpence last night when i counted it said silas seating himself again with a groan  pooh  why theyd be none so heavy to carry  some tramps been in thats all and as for the no footmarks and the bricks and the sand being all rightwhy your eyes are pretty much like a insects master marner theyre obliged to look so close you cant see much at a time its my opinion as if id been you or youd been mefor it comes to the same thingyou wouldnt have thought youd found everything as you left it  but what i vote is as two of the sensiblest o the company should go with you to master kench the constableshes ill i bed i know that muchand get him to appoint one of us his deppity for thats the law and i dont think anybody ull take upon him to contradick me there  it isnt much of a walk to kenchs and then if its me as is deppity ill go back with you master marner and examine your premises and if anybodys got any fault to find with that ill thank him to stand up and say it out like a man  by this pregnant speech the farrier had reestablished his selfcomplacency and waited with confidence to hear himself named as one of the superlatively sensible men  let us see how the night is though said the landlord who also considered himself personally concerned in this proposition  why it rains heavy still he said returning from the door  well im not the man to be afraid o the rain said the farrier for itll look bad when justice malam hears as respectable men like us had a information laid before em and took no steps  the landlord agreed with this view and after taking the sense of the company and duly rehearsing a small ceremony known in high ecclesiastical life as the nolo episcopari he consented to take on himself the chill dignity of going to kenchs  but to the farriers strong disgust mr macey now started an objection to his proposing himself as a deputyconstable for that oracular old gentleman claiming to know the law stated as a fact delivered to him by his father that no doctor could be a constable  and youre a doctor i reckon though youre only a cowdoctorfor a flys a fly though it may be a hossfly concluded mr macey wondering a little at his own cuteness  there was a hot debate upon this the farrier being of course indisposed to renounce the quality of doctor but contending that a doctor could be a constable if he likedthe law meant he neednt be one if he didnt like  mr macey thought this was nonsense since the law was not likely to be fonder of doctors than of other folks moreover if it was in the nature of doctors more than of other men not to like being constables how came mr dowlas to be so eager to act in that capacity  i dont want to act the constable said the farrier driven into a corner by this merciless reasoning and theres no man can say it of me if hed tell the truth  but if theres to be any jealousy and envying about going to kenchs in the rain let them go as like ityou wont get me to go i can tell you  by the landlords intervention however the dispute was accommodated mr dowlas consented to go as a second person disinclined to act officially and so poor silas furnished with some old coverings turned out with his two companions into the rain again thinking of the long nighthours before him not as those do who long to rest but as those who expect to watch for the morning    chapter viii  when godfrey cass returned from mrs osgoods party at midnight he was not much surprised to learn that dunsey had not come home perhaps he had not sold wildfire and was waiting for another chanceperhaps on that foggy afternoon he had preferred housing himself at the red lion at batherley for the night if the run had kept him in that neighbourhood for he was not likely to feel much concern about leaving his brother in suspense  godfreys mind was too full of nancy lammeters looks and behaviour too full of the exasperation against himself and his lot which the sight of her always produced in him for him to give much thought to wildfire or to the probabilities of dunstans conduct  the next morning the whole village was excited by the story of the robbery and godfrey like every one else was occupied in gathering and discussing news about it and in visiting the stonepits  the rain had washed away all possibility of distinguishing footmarks but a close investigation of the spot had disclosed in the direction opposite to the village a tinderbox with a flint and steel half sunk in the mud  it was not silass tinderbox for the only one he had ever had was still standing on his shelf and the inference generally accepted was that the tinderbox in the ditch was somehow connected with the robbery  a small minority shook their heads and intimated their opinion that it was not a robbery to have much light thrown on it by tinderboxes that master marners tale had a queer look with it and that such things had been known as a mans doing himself a mischief and then setting the justice to look for the doer but when questioned closely as to their grounds for this opinion and what master marner had to gain by such false pretences they only shook their heads as before and observed that there was no knowing what some folks counted gain moreover that everybody had a right to their own opinions grounds or no grounds and that the weaver as everybody knew was partly crazy  mr macey though he joined in the defence of marner against all suspicions of deceit also poohpoohed the tinderbox indeed repudiated it as a rather impious suggestion tending to imply that everything must be done by human hands and that there was no power which could make away with the guineas without moving the bricks nevertheless he turned round rather sharply on mr tookey when the zealous deputy feeling that this was a view of the case peculiarly suited to a parishclerk carried it still farther and doubted whether it was right to inquire into a robbery at all when the circumstances were so mysterious  as if concluded mr tookeyas if there was nothing but what could be made out by justices and constables  now dont you be for overshooting the mark tookey said mr macey nodding his head aside admonishingly  thats what youre allays at if i throw a stone and hit you think theres summat better than hitting and you try to throw a stone beyond what i said was against the tinderbox i said nothing against justices and constables for theyre o king georges making and it ud be illbecoming a man in a parish office to fly out again king george  while these discussions were going on amongst the group outside the rainbow a higher consultation was being carried on within under the presidency of mr crackenthorp the rector assisted by squire cass and other substantial parishioners  it had just occurred to mr snell the landlordhe being as he observed a man accustomed to put two and two togetherto connect with the tinderbox which as deputyconstable he himself had had the honourable distinction of finding certain recollections of a pedlar who had called to drink at the house about a month before and had actually stated that he carried a tinderbox about with him to light his pipe  here surely was a clue to be followed out  and as memory when duly impregnated with ascertained facts is sometimes surprisingly fertile mr snell gradually recovered a vivid impression of the effect produced on him by the pedlars countenance and conversation  he had a look with his eye which fell unpleasantly on mr snells sensitive organism  to be sure he didnt say anything particularno except that about the tinderboxbut it isnt what a man says its the way he says it moreover he had a swarthy foreignness of complexion which boded little honesty  did he wear earrings  mr crackenthorp wished to know having some acquaintance with foreign customs  wellstaylet me see said mr snell like a docile clairvoyante who would really not make a mistake if she could help it  after stretching the corners of his mouth and contracting his eyes as if he were trying to see the earrings he appeared to give up the effort and said well hed got earrings in his box to sell so its natral to suppose he might wear em  but he called at every house amost in the village theres somebody else mayhap saw em in his ears though i cant take upon me rightly to say  mr snell was correct in his surmise that somebody else would remember the pedlars earrings  for on the spread of inquiry among the villagers it was stated with gathering emphasis that the parson had wanted to know whether the pedlar wore earrings in his ears and an impression was created that a great deal depended on the eliciting of this fact  of course every one who heard the question not having any distinct image of the pedlar as without earrings immediately had an image of him with earrings larger or smaller as the case might be and the image was presently taken for a vivid recollection so that the glaziers wife a wellintentioned woman not given to lying and whose house was among the cleanest in the village was ready to declare as sure as ever she meant to take the sacrament the very next christmas that was ever coming that she had seen big earrings in the shape of the young moon in the pedlars two ears while jinny oates the cobblers daughter being a more imaginative person stated not only that she had seen them too but that they had made her blood creep as it did at that very moment while there she stood  also by way of throwing further light on this clue of the tinderbox a collection was made of all the articles purchased from the pedlar at various houses and carried to the rainbow to be exhibited there  in fact there was a general feeling in the village that for the clearingup of this robbery there must be a great deal done at the rainbow and that no man need offer his wife an excuse for going there while it was the scene of severe public duties  some disappointment was felt and perhaps a little indignation also when it became known that silas marner on being questioned by the squire and the parson had retained no other recollection of the pedlar than that he had called at his door but had not entered his house having turned away at once when silas holding the door ajar had said that he wanted nothing  this had been silass testimony though he clutched strongly at the idea of the pedlars being the culprit if only because it gave him a definite image of a whereabout for his gold after it had been taken away from its hidingplace he could see it now in the pedlars box  but it was observed with some irritation in the village that anybody but a blind creatur like marner would have seen the man prowling about for how came he to leave his tinderbox in the ditch close by if he hadnt been lingering there  doubtless he had made his observations when he saw marner at the door  anybody might knowand only look at himthat the weaver was a halfcrazy miser  it was a wonder the pedlar hadnt murdered him men of that sort with rings in their ears had been known for murderers often and often there had been one tried at the sizes not so long ago but what there were people living who remembered it  godfrey cass indeed entering the rainbow during one of mr snells frequently repeated recitals of his testimony had treated it lightly stating that he himself had bought a penknife of the pedlar and thought him a merry grinning fellow enough it was all nonsense he said about the mans evil looks  but this was spoken of in the village as the random talk of youth as if it was only mr snell who had seen something odd about the pedlar  on the contrary there were at least halfadozen who were ready to go before justice malam and give in much more striking testimony than any the landlord could furnish  it was to be hoped mr godfrey would not go to tarley and throw cold water on what mr snell said there and so prevent the justice from drawing up a warrant  he was suspected of intending this when after midday he was seen setting off on horseback in the direction of tarley  but by this time godfreys interest in the robbery had faded before his growing anxiety about dunstan and wildfire and he was going not to tarley but to batherley unable to rest in uncertainty about them any longer  the possibility that dunstan had played him the ugly trick of riding away with wildfire to return at the end of a month when he had gambled away or otherwise squandered the price of the horse was a fear that urged itself upon him more even than the thought of an accidental injury and now that the dance at mrs osgoods was past he was irritated with himself that he had trusted his horse to dunstan instead of trying to still his fears he encouraged them with that superstitious impression which clings to us all that if we expect evil very strongly it is the less likely to come and when he heard a horse approaching at a trot and saw a hat rising above a hedge beyond an angle of the lane he felt as if his conjuration had succeeded  but no sooner did the horse come within sight than his heart sank again  it was not wildfire and in a few moments more he discerned that the rider was not dunstan but bryce who pulled up to speak with a face that implied something disagreeable  well mr godfrey thats a lucky brother of yours that master dunsey isnt he  what do you mean  said godfrey hastily  why hasnt he been home yet  said bryce  home  no  what has happened  be quick  what has he done with my horse  ah i thought it was yours though he pretended you had parted with it to him  has he thrown him down and broken his knees  said godfrey flushed with exasperation  worse than that said bryce  you see id made a bargain with him to buy the horse for a hundred and twentya swinging price but i always liked the horse  and what does he do but go and stake himfly at a hedge with stakes in it atop of a bank with a ditch before it the horse had been dead a pretty good while when he was found  so he hasnt been home since has he  home  no said godfrey and hed better keep away  confound me for a fool  i might have known this would be the end of it  well to tell you the truth said bryce after id bargained for the horse it did come into my head that he might be riding and selling the horse without your knowledge for i didnt believe it was his own  i knew master dunsey was up to his tricks sometimes but where can he be gone  hes never been seen at batherley  he couldnt have been hurt for he must have walked off  hurt  said godfrey bitterly  hell never be hurthes made to hurt other people  and so you did give him leave to sell the horse eh  said bryce  yes i wanted to part with the horsehe was always a little too hard in the mouth for me said godfrey his pride making him wince under the idea that bryce guessed the sale to be a matter of necessity  i was going to see after himi thought some mischief had happened  ill go back now he added turning the horses head and wishing he could get rid of bryce for he felt that the longdreaded crisis in his life was close upon him youre coming on to raveloe arent you  well no not now said bryce  i was coming round there for i had to go to flitton and i thought i might as well take you in my way and just let you know all i knew myself about the horse i suppose master dunsey didnt like to show himself till the ill news had blown over a bit  hes perhaps gone to pay a visit at the three crowns by whitbridgei know hes fond of the house  perhaps he is said godfrey rather absently  then rousing himself he said with an effort at carelessness we shall hear of him soon enough ill be bound  well heres my turning said bryce not surprised to perceive that godfrey was rather down so ill bid you goodday and wish i may bring you better news another time  godfrey rode along slowly representing to himself the scene of confession to his father from which he felt that there was now no longer any escape  the revelation about the money must be made the very next morning and if he withheld the rest dunstan would be sure to come back shortly and finding that he must bear the brunt of his fathers anger would tell the whole story out of spite even though he had nothing to gain by it  there was one step perhaps by which he might still win dunstans silence and put off the evil day he might tell his father that he had himself spent the money paid to him by fowler and as he had never been guilty of such an offence before the affair would blow over after a little storming but godfrey could not bend himself to this  he felt that in letting dunstan have the money he had already been guilty of a breach of trust hardly less culpable than that of spending the money directly for his own behoof and yet there was a distinction between the two acts which made him feel that the one was so much more blackening than the other as to be intolerable to him  i dont pretend to be a good fellow he said to himself but im not a scoundrelat least ill stop short somewhere  ill bear the consequences of what i have done sooner than make believe ive done what i never would have done  id never have spent the money for my own pleasurei was tortured into it  through the remainder of this day godfrey with only occasional fluctuations kept his will bent in the direction of a complete avowal to his father and he withheld the story of wildfires loss till the next morning that it might serve him as an introduction to heavier matter  the old squire was accustomed to his sons frequent absence from home and thought neither dunstans nor wildfires nonappearance a matter calling for remark  godfrey said to himself again and again that if he let slip this one opportunity of confession he might never have another the revelation might be made even in a more odious way than by dunstans malignity she might come as she had threatened to do  and then he tried to make the scene easier to himself by rehearsal he made up his mind how he would pass from the admission of his weakness in letting dunstan have the money to the fact that dunstan had a hold on him which he had been unable to shake off and how he would work up his father to expect something very bad before he told him the fact  the old squire was an implacable man he made resolutions in violent anger and he was not to be moved from them after his anger had subsidedas fiery volcanic matters cool and harden into rock  like many violent and implacable men he allowed evils to grow under favour of his own heedlessness till they pressed upon him with exasperating force and then he turned round with fierce severity and became unrelentingly hard  this was his system with his tenants he allowed them to get into arrears neglect their fences reduce their stock sell their straw and otherwise go the wrong wayand then when he became short of money in consequence of this indulgence he took the hardest measures and would listen to no appeal  godfrey knew all this and felt it with the greater force because he had constantly suffered annoyance from witnessing his fathers sudden fits of unrelentingness for which his own habitual irresolution deprived him of all sympathy  he was not critical on the faulty indulgence which preceded these fits that seemed to him natural enough  still there was just the chance godfrey thought that his fathers pride might see this marriage in a light that would induce him to hush it up rather than turn his son out and make the family the talk of the country for ten miles round  this was the view of the case that godfrey managed to keep before him pretty closely till midnight and he went to sleep thinking that he had done with inward debating  but when he awoke in the still morning darkness he found it impossible to reawaken his evening thoughts it was as if they had been tired out and were not to be roused to further work  instead of arguments for confession he could now feel the presence of nothing but its evil consequences the old dread of disgrace came backthe old shrinking from the thought of raising a hopeless barrier between himself and nancythe old disposition to rely on chances which might be favourable to him and save him from betrayal  why after all should he cut off the hope of them by his own act  he had seen the matter in a wrong light yesterday  he had been in a rage with dunstan and had thought of nothing but a thorough breakup of their mutual understanding but what it would be really wisest for him to do was to try and soften his fathers anger against dunsey and keep things as nearly as possible in their old condition if dunsey did not come back for a few days and godfrey did not know but that the rascal had enough money in his pocket to enable him to keep away still longer everything might blow over    chapter ix  godfrey rose and took his own breakfast earlier than usual but lingered in the wainscoted parlour till his younger brothers had finished their meal and gone out awaiting his father who always took a walk with his managingman before breakfast  every one breakfasted at a different hour in the red house and the squire was always the latest giving a long chance to a rather feeble morning appetite before he tried it  the table had been spread with substantial eatables nearly two hours before he presented himselfa tall stout man of sixty with a face in which the knit brow and rather hard glance seemed contradicted by the slack and feeble mouth  his person showed marks of habitual neglect his dress was slovenly and yet there was something in the presence of the old squire distinguishable from that of the ordinary farmers in the parish who were perhaps every whit as refined as he but having slouched their way through life with a consciousness of being in the vicinity of their betters wanted that selfpossession and authoritativeness of voice and carriage which belonged to a man who thought of superiors as remote existences with whom he had personally little more to do than with america or the stars  the squire had been used to parish homage all his life used to the presupposition that his family his tankards and everything that was his were the oldest and best and as he never associated with any gentry higher than himself his opinion was not disturbed by comparison  he glanced at his son as he entered the room and said what sir havent you had your breakfast yet  but there was no pleasant morning greeting between them not because of any unfriendliness but because the sweet flower of courtesy is not a growth of such homes as the red house  yes sir said godfrey ive had my breakfast but i was waiting to speak to you  ah  well said the squire throwing himself indifferently into his chair and speaking in a ponderous coughing fashion which was felt in raveloe to be a sort of privilege of his rank while he cut a piece of beef and held it up before the deerhound that had come in with him ring the bell for my ale will you  you youngsters business is your own pleasure mostly  theres no hurry about it for anybody but yourselves  the squires life was quite as idle as his sons but it was a fiction kept up by himself and his contemporaries in raveloe that youth was exclusively the period of folly and that their aged wisdom was constantly in a state of endurance mitigated by sarcasm godfrey waited before he spoke again until the ale had been brought and the door closedan interval during which fleet the deerhound had consumed enough bits of beef to make a poor mans holiday dinner  theres been a cursed piece of illluck with wildfire he began happened the day before yesterday  what  broke his knees  said the squire after taking a draught of ale  i thought you knew how to ride better than that sir i never threw a horse down in my life  if i had i might ha whistled for another for my father wasnt quite so ready to unstring as some other fathers i know of  but they must turn over a new leafthey must  what with mortgages and arrears im as short o cash as a roadside pauper  and that fool kimble says the newspapers talking about peace  why the country wouldnt have a leg to stand on  prices ud run down like a jack and i should never get my arrears not if i sold all the fellows up  and theres that damned fowler i wont put up with him any longer ive told winthrop to go to cox this very day the lying scoundrel told me hed be sure to pay me a hundred last month  he takes advantage because hes on that outlying farm and thinks i shall forget him  the squire had delivered this speech in a coughing and interrupted manner but with no pause long enough for godfrey to make it a pretext for taking up the word again  he felt that his father meant to ward off any request for money on the ground of the misfortune with wildfire and that the emphasis he had thus been led to lay on his shortness of cash and his arrears was likely to produce an attitude of mind the utmost unfavourable for his own disclosure but he must go on now he had begun  its worse than breaking the horses kneeshes been staked and killed he said as soon as his father was silent and had begun to cut his meat  but i wasnt thinking of asking you to buy me another horse i was only thinking id lost the means of paying you with the price of wildfire as id meant to do  dunsey took him to the hunt to sell him for me the other day and after hed made a bargain for a hundred and twenty with bryce he went after the hounds and took some fools leap or other that did for the horse at once  if it hadnt been for that i should have paid you a hundred pounds this morning  the squire had laid down his knife and fork and was staring at his son in amazement not being sufficiently quick of brain to form a probable guess as to what could have caused so strange an inversion of the paternal and filial relations as this proposition of his son to pay him a hundred pounds  the truth is sirim very sorryi was quite to blame said godfrey  fowler did pay that hundred pounds  he paid it to me when i was over there one day last month  and dunsey bothered me for the money and i let him have it because i hoped i should be able to pay it you before this  the squire was purple with anger before his son had done speaking and found utterance difficult  you let dunsey have it sir  and how long have you been so thick with dunsey that you must collogue with him to embezzle my money  are you turning out a scamp  i tell you i wont have it  ill turn the whole pack of you out of the house together and marry again  id have you to remember sir my propertys got no entail on itsince my grandfathers time the casses can do as they like with their land  remember that sir let dunsey have the money why should you let dunsey have the money  theres some lie at the bottom of it  theres no lie sir said godfrey  i wouldnt have spent the money myself but dunsey bothered me and i was a fool and let him have it but i meant to pay it whether he did or not  thats the whole story i never meant to embezzle money and im not the man to do it  you never knew me do a dishonest trick sir  wheres dunsey then  what do you stand talking there for  go and fetch dunsey as i tell you and let him give account of what he wanted the money for and what hes done with it  he shall repent it  ill turn him out  i said i would and ill do it  he shant brave me  go and fetch him  dunsey isnt come back sir  what  did he break his own neck then  said the squire with some disgust at the idea that in that case he could not fulfil his threat  no he wasnt hurt i believe for the horse was found dead and dunsey must have walked off  i daresay we shall see him again byandby  i dont know where he is  and what must you be letting him have my money for  answer me that said the squire attacking godfrey again since dunsey was not within reach  well sir i dont know said godfrey hesitatingly  that was a feeble evasion but godfrey was not fond of lying and not being sufficiently aware that no sort of duplicity can long flourish without the help of vocal falsehoods he was quite unprepared with invented motives  you dont know  i tell you what it is sir  youve been up to some trick and youve been bribing him not to tell said the squire with a sudden acuteness which startled godfrey who felt his heart beat violently at the nearness of his fathers guess  the sudden alarm pushed him on to take the next stepa very slight impulse suffices for that on a downward road  why sir he said trying to speak with careless ease it was a little affair between me and dunsey its no matter to anybody else its hardly worth while to pry into young mens fooleries it wouldnt have made any difference to you sir if id not had the bad luck to lose wildfire  i should have paid you the money  fooleries  pshaw  its time youd done with fooleries  and id have you know sir you must ha done with em said the squire frowning and casting an angry glance at his son  your goingson are not what i shall find money for any longer  theres my grandfather had his stables full o horses and kept a good house too and in worse times by what i can make out and so might i if i hadnt four goodfornothing fellows to hang on me like horseleeches  ive been too good a father to you allthats what it is  but i shall pull up sir  godfrey was silent  he was not likely to be very penetrating in his judgments but he had always had a sense that his fathers indulgence had not been kindness and had had a vague longing for some discipline that would have checked his own errant weakness and helped his better will  the squire ate his bread and meat hastily took a deep draught of ale then turned his chair from the table and began to speak again  itll be all the worse for you you knowyoud need try and help me keep things together  well sir ive often offered to take the management of things but you know youve taken it ill always and seemed to think i wanted to push you out of your place  i know nothing o your offering or o my taking it ill said the squire whose memory consisted in certain strong impressions unmodified by detail but i know one while you seemed to be thinking o marrying and i didnt offer to put any obstacles in your way as some fathers would  id as lieve you married lammeters daughter as anybody  i suppose if id said you nay youd ha kept on with it but for want o contradiction youve changed your mind  youre a shillyshally fellow you take after your poor mother  she never had a will of her own a woman has no call for one if shes got a proper man for her husband  but your wife had need have one for you hardly know your own mind enough to make both your legs walk one way  the lass hasnt said downright she wont have you has she  no said godfrey feeling very hot and uncomfortable but i dont think she will  think  why havent you the courage to ask her  do you stick to it you want to have herthats the thing  theres no other woman i want to marry said godfrey evasively  well then let me make the offer for you thats all if you havent the pluck to do it yourself  lammeter isnt likely to be loath for his daughter to marry into my family i should think and as for the pretty lass she wouldnt have her cousinand theres nobody else as i see could ha stood in your way  id rather let it be please sir at present said godfrey in alarm i think shes a little offended with me just now and i should like to speak for myself  a man must manage these things for himself  well speak then and manage it and see if you cant turn over a new leaf  thats what a man must do when he thinks o marrying  i dont see how i can think of it at present sir  you wouldnt like to settle me on one of the farms i suppose and i dont think shed come to live in this house with all my brothers  its a different sort of life to what shes been used to  not come to live in this house  dont tell me  you ask her thats all said the squire with a short scornful laugh  id rather let the thing be at present sir said godfrey  i hope you wont try to hurry it on by saying anything  i shall do what i choose said the squire and i shall let you know im master else you may turn out and find an estate to drop into somewhere else  go out and tell winthrop not to go to coxs but wait for me  and tell em to get my horse saddled  and stop look out and get that hack o dunseys sold and hand me the money will you  hell keep no more hacks at my expense  and if you know where hes sneakingi daresay you doyou may tell him to spare himself the journey o coming back home  let him turn ostler and keep himself he shant hang on me any more  i dont know where he is sir and if i did it isnt my place to tell him to keep away said godfrey moving towards the door  confound it sir dont stay arguing but go and order my horse said the squire taking up a pipe  godfrey left the room hardly knowing whether he were more relieved by the sense that the interview was ended without having made any change in his position or more uneasy that he had entangled himself still further in prevarication and deceit  what had passed about his proposing to nancy had raised a new alarm lest by some afterdinner words of his fathers to mr lammeter he should be thrown into the embarrassment of being obliged absolutely to decline her when she seemed to be within his reach  he fled to his usual refuge that of hoping for some unforeseen turn of fortune some favourable chance which would save him from unpleasant consequencesperhaps even justify his insincerity by manifesting its prudence and in this point of trusting to some throw of fortunes dice godfrey can hardly be called specially oldfashioned  favourable chance i fancy is the god of all men who follow their own devices instead of obeying a law they believe in  let even a polished man of these days get into a position he is ashamed to avow and his mind will be bent on all the possible issues that may deliver him from the calculable results of that position  let him live outside his income or shirk the resolute honest work that brings wages and he will presently find himself dreaming of a possible benefactor a possible simpleton who may be cajoled into using his interest a possible state of mind in some possible person not yet forthcoming let him neglect the responsibilities of his office and he will inevitably anchor himself on the chance that the thing left undone may turn out not to be of the supposed importance  let him betray his friends confidence and he will adore that same cunning complexity called chance which gives him the hope that his friend will never know  let him forsake a decent craft that he may pursue the gentilities of a profession to which nature never called him and his religion will infallibly be the worship of blessed chance which he will believe in as the mighty creator of success  the evil principle deprecated in that religion is the orderly sequence by which the seed brings forth a crop after its kind    chapter x  justice malam was naturally regarded in tarley and raveloe as a man of capacious mind seeing that he could draw much wider conclusions without evidence than could be expected of his neighbours who were not on the commission of the peace  such a man was not likely to neglect the clue of the tinderbox and an inquiry was set on foot concerning a pedlar name unknown with curly black hair and a foreign complexion carrying a box of cutlery and jewellery and wearing large rings in his ears  but either because inquiry was too slowfooted to overtake him or because the description applied to so many pedlars that inquiry did not know how to choose among them weeks passed away and there was no other result concerning the robbery than a gradual cessation of the excitement it had caused in raveloe  dunstan casss absence was hardly a subject of remark he had once before had a quarrel with his father and had gone off nobody knew whither to return at the end of six weeks take up his old quarters unforbidden and swagger as usual  his own family who equally expected this issue with the sole difference that the squire was determined this time to forbid him the old quarters never mentioned his absence and when his uncle kimble or mr osgood noticed it the story of his having killed wildfire and committed some offence against his father was enough to prevent surprise  to connect the fact of dunseys disappearance with that of the robbery occurring on the same day lay quite away from the track of every ones thoughteven godfreys who had better reason than any one else to know what his brother was capable of  he remembered no mention of the weaver between them since the time twelve years ago when it was their boyish sport to deride him and besides his imagination constantly created an alibi for dunstan he saw him continually in some congenial haunt to which he had walked off on leaving wildfiresaw him sponging on chance acquaintances and meditating a return home to the old amusement of tormenting his elder brother  even if any brain in raveloe had put the said two facts together i doubt whether a combination so injurious to the prescriptive respectability of a family with a mural monument and venerable tankards would not have been suppressed as of unsound tendency  but christmas puddings brawn and abundance of spirituous liquors throwing the mental originality into the channel of nightmare are great preservatives against a dangerous spontaneity of waking thought  when the robbery was talked of at the rainbow and elsewhere in good company the balance continued to waver between the rational explanation founded on the tinderbox and the theory of an impenetrable mystery that mocked investigation  the advocates of the tinderboxandpedlar view considered the other side a muddleheaded and credulous set who because they themselves were walleyed supposed everybody else to have the same blank outlook and the adherents of the inexplicable more than hinted that their antagonists were animals inclined to crow before they had found any cornmere skimmingdishes in point of depthwhose clearsightedness consisted in supposing there was nothing behind a barndoor because they couldnt see through it so that though their controversy did not serve to elicit the fact concerning the robbery it elicited some true opinions of collateral importance  but while poor silass loss served thus to brush the slow current of raveloe conversation silas himself was feeling the withering desolation of that bereavement about which his neighbours were arguing at their ease  to any one who had observed him before he lost his gold it might have seemed that so withered and shrunken a life as his could hardly be susceptible of a bruise could hardly endure any subtraction but such as would put an end to it altogether  but in reality it had been an eager life filled with immediate purpose which fenced him in from the wide cheerless unknown  it had been a clinging life and though the object round which its fibres had clung was a dead disrupted thing it satisfied the need for clinging  but now the fence was broken downthe support was snatched away  marners thoughts could no longer move in their old round and were baffled by a blank like that which meets a plodding ant when the earth has broken away on its homeward path  the loom was there and the weaving and the growing pattern in the cloth but the bright treasure in the hole under his feet was gone the prospect of handling and counting it was gone the evening had no phantasm of delight to still the poor souls craving  the thought of the money he would get by his actual work could bring no joy for its meagre image was only a fresh reminder of his loss and hope was too heavily crushed by the sudden blow for his imagination to dwell on the growth of a new hoard from that small beginning  he filled up the blank with grief  as he sat weaving he every now and then moaned low like one in pain it was the sign that his thoughts had come round again to the sudden chasmto the empty eveningtime and all the evening as he sat in his loneliness by his dull fire he leaned his elbows on his knees and clasped his head with his hands and moaned very lownot as one who seeks to be heard  and yet he was not utterly forsaken in his trouble  the repulsion marner had always created in his neighbours was partly dissipated by the new light in which this misfortune had shown him  instead of a man who had more cunning than honest folks could come by and what was worse had not the inclination to use that cunning in a neighbourly way it was now apparent that silas had not cunning enough to keep his own  he was generally spoken of as a poor mushed creatur and that avoidance of his neighbours which had before been referred to his illwill and to a probable addiction to worse company was now considered mere craziness  this change to a kindlier feeling was shown in various ways  the odour of christmas cooking being on the wind it was the season when superfluous pork and black puddings are suggestive of charity in welltodo families and silass misfortune had brought him uppermost in the memory of housekeepers like mrs osgood mr crackenthorp too while he admonished silas that his money had probably been taken from him because he thought too much of it and never came to church enforced the doctrine by a present of pigs pettitoes well calculated to dissipate unfounded prejudices against the clerical character neighbours who had nothing but verbal consolation to give showed a disposition not only to greet silas and discuss his misfortune at some length when they encountered him in the village but also to take the trouble of calling at his cottage and getting him to repeat all the details on the very spot and then they would try to cheer him by saying well master marner youre no worse off nor other poor folks after all and if you was to be crippled the parish ud give you a lowance  i suppose one reason why we are seldom able to comfort our neighbours with our words is that our goodwill gets adulterated in spite of ourselves before it can pass our lips  we can send black puddings and pettitoes without giving them a flavour of our own egoism but language is a stream that is almost sure to smack of a mingled soil  there was a fair proportion of kindness in raveloe but it was often of a beery and bungling sort and took the shape least allied to the complimentary and hypocritical  mr macey for example coming one evening expressly to let silas know that recent events had given him the advantage of standing more favourably in the opinion of a man whose judgment was not formed lightly opened the conversation by saying as soon as he had seated himself and adjusted his thumbs  come master marner why youve no call to sit amoaning  youre a deal better off to ha lost your money nor to ha kep it by foul means  i used to think when you first come into these parts as you were no better nor you should be you were younger a deal than what you are now but you were allays a staring whitefaced creatur partly like a baldfaced calf as i may say  but theres no knowing it isnt every queerlooksed thing as old harrys had the making ofi mean speaking o toads and such for theyre often harmless like and useful against varmin  and its pretty much the same wi you as fur as i can see  though as to the yarbs and stuff to cure the breathing if you brought that sort o knowledge from distant parts you might ha been a bit freer of it and if the knowledge wasnt well come by why you might ha made up for it by coming to church reglar for as for the children as the wise woman charmed ive been at the christening of em again and again and they took the water just as well  and thats reasonable for if old harrys a mind to do a bit o kindness for a holiday like whos got anything against it  thats my thinking and ive been clerk o this parish forty year and i know when the parson and me does the cussing of a ash wednesday theres no cussing o folks as have a mind to be cured without a doctor let kimble say what he will  and so master marner as i was sayingfor theres windings i things as they may carry you to the fur end o the prayerbook afore you get back to emmy advice is as you keep up your sperrits for as for thinking youre a deep un and ha got more inside you nor ull bear daylight im not o that opinion at all and so i tell the neighbours  for says i you talk o master marner making out a talewhy its nonsense that is it ud take a cute man to make a tale like that and says i he looked as scared as a rabbit  during this discursive address silas had continued motionless in his previous attitude leaning his elbows on his knees and pressing his hands against his head  mr macey not doubting that he had been listened to paused in the expectation of some appreciatory reply but marner remained silent  he had a sense that the old man meant to be goodnatured and neighbourly but the kindness fell on him as sunshine falls on the wretchedhe had no heart to taste it and felt that it was very far off him  come master marner have you got nothing to say to that  said mr macey at last with a slight accent of impatience  oh said marner slowly shaking his head between his hands i thank youthank youkindly  aye aye to be sure i thought you would said mr macey and my advice ishave you got a sunday suit  no said marner  i doubted it was so said mr macey  now let me advise you to get a sunday suit theres tookey hes a poor creatur but hes got my tailoring business and some o my money in it and he shall make a suit at a low price and give you trust and then you can come to church and be a bit neighbourly  why youve never heared me say amen since you come into these parts and i recommend you to lose no time for itll be poor work when tookey has it all to himself for i maynt be equil to stand i the desk at all come another winter here mr macey paused perhaps expecting some sign of emotion in his hearer but not observing any he went on and as for the money for the suit o clothes why you get a matter of a pound aweek at your weaving master marner and youre a young man eh for all you look so mushed  why you couldnt ha been fiveandtwenty when you come into these parts eh  silas started a little at the change to a questioning tone and answered mildly i dont know i cant rightly sayits a long while since  after receiving such an answer as this it is not surprising that mr macey observed later on in the evening at the rainbow that marners head was all of a muddle and that it was to be doubted if he ever knew when sunday came round which showed him a worse heathen than many a dog  another of silass comforters besides mr macey came to him with a mind highly charged on the same topic  this was mrs winthrop the wheelwrights wife  the inhabitants of raveloe were not severely regular in their churchgoing and perhaps there was hardly a person in the parish who would not have held that to go to church every sunday in the calendar would have shown a greedy desire to stand well with heaven and get an undue advantage over their neighboursa wish to be better than the common run that would have implied a reflection on those who had had godfathers and godmothers as well as themselves and had an equal right to the buryingservice  at the same time it was understood to be requisite for all who were not household servants or young men to take the sacrament at one of the great festivals squire cass himself took it on christmasday while those who were held to be good livers went to church with greater though still with moderate frequency  mrs winthrop was one of these she was in all respects a woman of scrupulous conscience so eager for duties that life seemed to offer them too scantily unless she rose at halfpast four though this threw a scarcity of work over the more advanced hours of the morning which it was a constant problem with her to remove  yet she had not the vixenish temper which is sometimes supposed to be a necessary condition of such habits she was a very mild patient woman whose nature it was to seek out all the sadder and more serious elements of life and pasture her mind upon them  she was the person always first thought of in raveloe when there was illness or death in a family when leeches were to be applied or there was a sudden disappointment in a monthly nurse  she was a comfortable womangoodlooking freshcomplexioned having her lips always slightly screwed as if she felt herself in a sickroom with the doctor or the clergyman present but she was never whimpering no one had seen her shed tears she was simply grave and inclined to shake her head and sigh almost imperceptibly like a funereal mourner who is not a relation  it seemed surprising that ben winthrop who loved his quartpot and his joke got along so well with dolly but she took her husbands jokes and joviality as patiently as everything else considering that men would be so and viewing the stronger sex in the light of animals whom it had pleased heaven to make naturally troublesome like bulls and turkeycocks  this good wholesome woman could hardly fail to have her mind drawn strongly towards silas marner now that he appeared in the light of a sufferer and one sunday afternoon she took her little boy aaron with her and went to call on silas carrying in her hand some small lardcakes flat pastelike articles much esteemed in raveloe aaron an applecheeked youngster of seven with a clean starched frill which looked like a plate for the apples needed all his adventurous curiosity to embolden him against the possibility that the bigeyed weaver might do him some bodily injury and his dubiety was much increased when on arriving at the stonepits they heard the mysterious sound of the loom  ah it is as i thought said mrs winthrop sadly  they had to knock loudly before silas heard them but when he did come to the door he showed no impatience as he would once have done at a visit that had been unasked for and unexpected formerly his heart had been as a locked casket with its treasure inside but now the casket was empty and the lock was broken  left groping in darkness with his prop utterly gone silas had inevitably a sense though a dull and halfdespairing one that if any help came to him it must come from without and there was a slight stirring of expectation at the sight of his fellowmen a faint consciousness of dependence on their goodwill he opened the door wide to admit dolly but without otherwise returning her greeting than by moving the armchair a few inches as a sign that she was to sit down in it  dolly as soon as she was seated removed the white cloth that covered her lardcakes and said in her gravest way  id a baking yisterday master marner and the lardcakes turned out better nor common and id ha asked you to accept some if youd thought well  i dont eat such things myself for a bit o breads what i like from one years end to the other but mens stomichs are made so comical they want a changethey do i know god help em  dolly sighed gently as she held out the cakes to silas who thanked her kindly and looked very close at them absently being accustomed to look so at everything he took into his handeyed all the while by the wondering bright orbs of the small aaron who had made an outwork of his mothers chair and was peeping round from behind it  theres letters pricked on em said dolly  i cant read em myself and theres nobody not mr macey himself rightly knows what they mean but theyve a good meaning for theyre the same as is on the pulpitcloth at church  what are they aaron my dear  aaron retreated completely behind his outwork  oh go thats naughty said his mother mildly  well whativer the letters are theyve a good meaning and its a stamp as has been in our house ben says ever since he was a little un and his mother used to put it on the cakes and ive allays put it on too for if theres any good weve need of it i this world  its i h s said silas at which proof of learning aaron peeped round the chair again  well to be sure you can read em off said dolly  bens read em to me many and many a time but they slip out o my mind again the mores the pity for theyre good letters else they wouldnt be in the church and so i prick em on all the loaves and all the cakes though sometimes they wont hold because o the risingfor as i said if theres any good to be got weve need of it i this worldthat we have and i hope theyll bring good to you master marner for its wi that will i brought you the cakes and you see the letters have held better nor common  silas was as unable to interpret the letters as dolly but there was no possibility of misunderstanding the desire to give comfort that made itself heard in her quiet tones  he said with more feeling than beforethank youthank you kindly  but he laid down the cakes and seated himself absentlydrearily unconscious of any distinct benefit towards which the cakes and the letters or even dollys kindness could tend for him  ah if theres good anywhere weve need of it repeated dolly who did not lightly forsake a serviceable phrase  she looked at silas pityingly as she went on  but you didnt hear the churchbells this morning master marner  i doubt you didnt know it was sunday  living so lone here you lose your count i daresay and then when your loom makes a noise you cant hear the bells more particlar now the frost kills the sound  yes i did i heard em said silas to whom sunday bells were a mere accident of the day and not part of its sacredness  there had been no bells in lantern yard  dear heart  said dolly pausing before she spoke again  but what a pity it is you should work of a sunday and not clean yourselfif you didnt go to church for if youd a roasting bit it might be as you couldnt leave it being a lone man  but theres the bakehus if you could make up your mind to spend a twopence on the oven now and thennot every week in coursei shouldnt like to do that myselfyou might carry your bit o dinner there for its nothing but right to have a bit o summat hot of a sunday and not to make it as you cant know your dinner from saturday  but now upo christmasday this blessed christmas as is ever coming if you was to take your dinner to the bakehus and go to church and see the holly and the yew and hear the anthim and then take the sacramen youd be a deal the better and youd know which end you stood on and you could put your trust i them as knows better nor we do seein youd ha done what it lies on us all to do  dollys exhortation which was an unusually long effort of speech for her was uttered in the soothing persuasive tone with which she would have tried to prevail on a sick man to take his medicine or a basin of gruel for which he had no appetite  silas had never before been closely urged on the point of his absence from church which had only been thought of as a part of his general queerness and he was too direct and simple to evade dollys appeal  nay nay he said i know nothing o church  ive never been to church  no  said dolly in a low tone of wonderment  then bethinking herself of silass advent from an unknown country she said could it ha been as theyd no church where you was born  oh yes said silas meditatively sitting in his usual posture of leaning on his knees and supporting his head  there was churchesa manyit was a big town  but i knew nothing of emi went to chapel  dolly was much puzzled at this new word but she was rather afraid of inquiring further lest chapel might mean some haunt of wickedness after a little thought she said  well master marner its niver too late to turn over a new leaf and if youve niver had no church theres no telling the good itll do you  for i feel so set up and comfortable as niver was when ive been and heard the prayers and the singing to the praise and glory o god as mr macey gives outand mr crackenthorp saying good words and more particlar on sacramen day and if a bit o trouble comes i feel as i can put up wi it for ive looked for help i the right quarter and gev myself up to them as we must all give ourselves up to at the last and if wen done our part it isnt to be believed as them as are above us ull be worse nor we are and come short o theirn  poor dollys exposition of her simple raveloe theology fell rather unmeaningly on silass ears for there was no word in it that could rouse a memory of what he had known as religion and his comprehension was quite baffled by the plural pronoun which was no heresy of dollys but only her way of avoiding a presumptuous familiarity  he remained silent not feeling inclined to assent to the part of dollys speech which he fully understoodher recommendation that he should go to church  indeed silas was so unaccustomed to talk beyond the brief questions and answers necessary for the transaction of his simple business that words did not easily come to him without the urgency of a distinct purpose  but now little aaron having become used to the weavers awful presence had advanced to his mothers side and silas seeming to notice him for the first time tried to return dollys signs of goodwill by offering the lad a bit of lardcake  aaron shrank back a little and rubbed his head against his mothers shoulder but still thought the piece of cake worth the risk of putting his hand out for it  oh for shame aaron said his mother taking him on her lap however why you dont want cake again yet awhile  hes wonderful hearty she went on with a little sighthat he is god knows  hes my youngest and we spoil him sadly for either me or the father must allays hev him in our sightthat we must  she stroked aarons brown head and thought it must do master marner good to see such a pictur of a child  but marner on the other side of the hearth saw the neatfeatured rosy face as a mere dim round with two dark spots in it  and hes got a voice like a birdyou wouldnt think dolly went on he can sing a christmas carril as his fathers taught him and i take it for a token as hell come to good as he can learn the good tunes so quick  come aaron stan up and sing the carril to master marner come  aaron replied by rubbing his forehead against his mothers shoulder  oh thats naughty said dolly gently  stan up when mother tells you and let me hold the cake till youve done  aaron was not indisposed to display his talents even to an ogre under protecting circumstances and after a few more signs of coyness consisting chiefly in rubbing the backs of his hands over his eyes and then peeping between them at master marner to see if he looked anxious for the carril he at length allowed his head to be duly adjusted and standing behind the table which let him appear above it only as far as his broad frill so that he looked like a cherubic head untroubled with a body he began with a clear chirp and in a melody that had the rhythm of an industrious hammer    god rest you merry gentlemen   let nothing you dismay   for jesus christ our savior   was born on christmasday   dolly listened with a devout look glancing at marner in some confidence that this strain would help to allure him to church  thats christmas music she said when aaron had ended and had secured his piece of cake again  theres no other music equil to the christmas musichark the erol angils sing  and you may judge what it is at church master marner with the bassoon and the voices as you cant help thinking youve got to a better place areadyfor i wouldnt speak ill o this world seeing as them put us in it as knows bestbut what wi the drink and the quarrelling and the bad illnesses and the hard dying as ive seen times and times ones thankful to hear of a better  the boy sings pretty dont he master marner  yes said silas absently very pretty  the christmas carol with its hammerlike rhythm had fallen on his ears as strange music quite unlike a hymn and could have none of the effect dolly contemplated  but he wanted to show her that he was grateful and the only mode that occurred to him was to offer aaron a bit more cake  oh no thank you master marner said dolly holding down aarons willing hands  we must be going home now  and so i wish you goodbye master marner and if you ever feel anyways bad in your inside as you cant fend for yourself ill come and clean up for you and get you a bit o victual and willing  but i beg and pray of you to leave off weaving of a sunday for its bad for soul and bodyand the money as comes i that way ull be a bad bed to lie down on at the last if it doesnt fly away nobody knows where like the white frost and youll excuse me being that free with you master marner for i wish you welli do  make your bow aaron  silas said goodbye and thank you kindly as he opened the door for dolly but he couldnt help feeling relieved when she was gonerelieved that he might weave again and moan at his ease  her simple view of life and its comforts by which she had tried to cheer him was only like a report of unknown objects which his imagination could not fashion  the fountains of human love and of faith in a divine love had not yet been unlocked and his soul was still the shrunken rivulet with only this difference that its little groove of sand was blocked up and it wandered confusedly against dark obstruction  and so notwithstanding the honest persuasions of mr macey and dolly winthrop silas spent his christmasday in loneliness eating his meat in sadness of heart though the meat had come to him as a neighbourly present  in the morning he looked out on the black frost that seemed to press cruelly on every blade of grass while the halficy red pool shivered under the bitter wind but towards evening the snow began to fall and curtained from him even that dreary outlook shutting him close up with his narrow grief  and he sat in his robbed home through the livelong evening not caring to close his shutters or lock his door pressing his head between his hands and moaning till the cold grasped him and told him that his fire was grey  nobody in this world but himself knew that he was the same silas marner who had once loved his fellow with tender love and trusted in an unseen goodness  even to himself that past experience had become dim  but in raveloe village the bells rang merrily and the church was fuller than all through the rest of the year with red faces among the abundant darkgreen boughsfaces prepared for a longer service than usual by an odorous breakfast of toast and ale  those green boughs the hymn and anthem never heard but at christmaseven the athanasian creed which was discriminated from the others only as being longer and of exceptional virtue since it was only read on rare occasionsbrought a vague exulting sense for which the grown men could as little have found words as the children that something great and mysterious had been done for them in heaven above and in earth below which they were appropriating by their presence  and then the red faces made their way through the black biting frost to their own homes feeling themselves free for the rest of the day to eat drink and be merry and using that christian freedom without diffidence  at squire casss family party that day nobody mentioned dunstannobody was sorry for his absence or feared it would be too long the doctor and his wife uncle and aunt kimble were there and the annual christmas talk was carried through without any omissions rising to the climax of mr kimbles experience when he walked the london hospitals thirty years back together with striking professional anecdotes then gathered  whereupon cards followed with aunt kimbles annual failure to follow suit and uncle kimbles irascibility concerning the odd trick which was rarely explicable to him when it was not on his side without a general visitation of tricks to see that they were formed on sound principles the whole being accompanied by a strong steaming odour of spiritsandwater  but the party on christmasday being a strictly family party was not the preeminently brilliant celebration of the season at the red house it was the great dance on new years eve that made the glory of squire casss hospitality as of his forefathers time out of mind  this was the occasion when all the society of raveloe and tarley whether old acquaintances separated by long rutty distances or cooled acquaintances separated by misunderstandings concerning runaway calves or acquaintances founded on intermittent condescension counted on meeting and on comporting themselves with mutual appropriateness  this was the occasion on which fair dames who came on pillions sent their bandboxes before them supplied with more than their evening costume for the feast was not to end with a single evening like a paltry town entertainment where the whole supply of eatables is put on the table at once and bedding is scanty  the red house was provisioned as if for a siege and as for the spare featherbeds ready to be laid on floors they were as plentiful as might naturally be expected in a family that had killed its own geese for many generations  godfrey cass was looking forward to this new years eve with a foolish reckless longing that made him half deaf to his importunate companion anxiety  dunsey will be coming home soon there will be a great blowup and how will you bribe his spite to silence  said anxiety  oh he wont come home before new years eve perhaps said godfrey and i shall sit by nancy then and dance with her and get a kind look from her in spite of herself  but money is wanted in another quarter said anxiety in a louder voice and how will you get it without selling your mothers diamond pin  and if you dont get it  well but something may happen to make things easier  at any rate theres one pleasure for me close at hand nancy is coming  yes and suppose your father should bring matters to a pass that will oblige you to decline marrying herand to give your reasons  hold your tongue and dont worry me  i can see nancys eyes just as they will look at me and feel her hand in mine already  but anxiety went on though in noisy christmas company refusing to be utterly quieted even by much drinking    chapter xi  some women i grant would not appear to advantage seated on a pillion and attired in a drab joseph and a drab beaverbonnet with a crown resembling a small stewpan for a garment suggesting a coachmans greatcoat cut out under an exiguity of cloth that would only allow of miniature capes is not well adapted to conceal deficiencies of contour nor is drab a colour that will throw sallow cheeks into lively contrast  it was all the greater triumph to miss nancy lammeters beauty that she looked thoroughly bewitching in that costume as seated on the pillion behind her tall erect father she held one arm round him and looked down with openeyed anxiety at the treacherous snowcovered pools and puddles which sent up formidable splashings of mud under the stamp of dobbins foot  a painter would perhaps have preferred her in those moments when she was free from selfconsciousness but certainly the bloom on her cheeks was at its highest point of contrast with the surrounding drab when she arrived at the door of the red house and saw mr godfrey cass ready to lift her from the pillion  she wished her sister priscilla had come up at the same time behind the servant for then she would have contrived that mr godfrey should have lifted off priscilla first and in the meantime she would have persuaded her father to go round to the horseblock instead of alighting at the doorsteps  it was very painful when you had made it quite clear to a young man that you were determined not to marry him however much he might wish it that he would still continue to pay you marked attentions besides why didnt he always show the same attentions if he meant them sincerely instead of being so strange as mr godfrey cass was sometimes behaving as if he didnt want to speak to her and taking no notice of her for weeks and weeks and then all on a sudden almost making love again moreover it was quite plain he had no real love for her else he would not let people have that to say of him which they did say did he suppose that miss nancy lammeter was to be won by any man squire or no squire who led a bad life  that was not what she had been used to see in her own father who was the soberest and best man in that countryside only a little hot and hasty now and then if things were not done to the minute  all these thoughts rushed through miss nancys mind in their habitual succession in the moments between her first sight of mr godfrey cass standing at the door and her own arrival there happily the squire came out too and gave a loud greeting to her father so that somehow under cover of this noise she seemed to find concealment for her confusion and neglect of any suitably formal behaviour while she was being lifted from the pillion by strong arms which seemed to find her ridiculously small and light and there was the best reason for hastening into the house at once since the snow was beginning to fall again threatening an unpleasant journey for such guests as were still on the road  these were a small minority for already the afternoon was beginning to decline and there would not be too much time for the ladies who came from a distance to attire themselves in readiness for the early tea which was to inspirit them for the dance  there was a buzz of voices through the house as miss nancy entered mingled with the scrape of a fiddle preluding in the kitchen but the lammeters were guests whose arrival had evidently been thought of so much that it had been watched for from the windows for mrs kimble who did the honours at the red house on these great occasions came forward to meet miss nancy in the hall and conduct her upstairs mrs kimble was the squires sister as well as the doctors wifea double dignity with which her diameter was in direct proportion so that a journey upstairs being rather fatiguing to her she did not oppose miss nancys request to be allowed to find her way alone to the blue room where the miss lammeters bandboxes had been deposited on their arrival in the morning  there was hardly a bedroom in the house where feminine compliments were not passing and feminine toilettes going forward in various stages in space made scanty by extra beds spread upon the floor and miss nancy as she entered the blue room had to make her little formal curtsy to a group of six  on the one hand there were ladies no less important than the two miss gunns the wine merchants daughters from lytherly dressed in the height of fashion with the tightest skirts and the shortest waists and gazed at by miss ladbrook of the old pastures with a shyness not unsustained by inward criticism  partly miss ladbrook felt that her own skirt must be regarded as unduly lax by the miss gunns and partly that it was a pity the miss gunns did not show that judgment which she herself would show if she were in their place by stopping a little on this side of the fashion  on the other hand mrs ladbrook was standing in skullcap and front with her turban in her hand curtsying and smiling blandly and saying after you maam to another lady in similar circumstances who had politely offered the precedence at the lookingglass  but miss nancy had no sooner made her curtsy than an elderly lady came forward whose full white muslin kerchief and mobcap round her curls of smooth grey hair were in daring contrast with the puffed yellow satins and topknotted caps of her neighbours  she approached miss nancy with much primness and said with a slow treble suavity  niece i hope i see you well in health  miss nancy kissed her aunts cheek dutifully and answered with the same sort of amiable primness quite well i thank you aunt and i hope i see you the same  thank you niece i keep my health for the present  and how is my brotherinlaw  these dutiful questions and answers were continued until it was ascertained in detail that the lammeters were all as well as usual and the osgoods likewise also that niece priscilla must certainly arrive shortly and that travelling on pillions in snowy weather was unpleasant though a joseph was a great protection  then nancy was formally introduced to her aunts visitors the miss gunns as being the daughters of a mother known to their mother though now for the first time induced to make a journey into these parts and these ladies were so taken by surprise at finding such a lovely face and figure in an outoftheway country place that they began to feel some curiosity about the dress she would put on when she took off her joseph  miss nancy whose thoughts were always conducted with the propriety and moderation conspicuous in her manners remarked to herself that the miss gunns were rather hardfeatured than otherwise and that such very low dresses as they wore might have been attributed to vanity if their shoulders had been pretty but that being as they were it was not reasonable to suppose that they showed their necks from a love of display but rather from some obligation not inconsistent with sense and modesty  she felt convinced as she opened her box that this must be her aunt osgoods opinion for miss nancys mind resembled her aunts to a degree that everybody said was surprising considering the kinship was on mr osgoods side and though you might not have supposed it from the formality of their greeting there was a devoted attachment and mutual admiration between aunt and niece  even miss nancys refusal of her cousin gilbert osgood on the ground solely that he was her cousin though it had grieved her aunt greatly had not in the least cooled the preference which had determined her to leave nancy several of her hereditary ornaments let gilberts future wife be whom she might  three of the ladies quickly retired but the miss gunns were quite content that mrs osgoods inclination to remain with her niece gave them also a reason for staying to see the rustic beautys toilette and it was really a pleasurefrom the first opening of the bandbox where everything smelt of lavender and roseleaves to the clasping of the small coral necklace that fitted closely round her little white neck everything belonging to miss nancy was of delicate purity and nattiness not a crease was where it had no business to be not a bit of her linen professed whiteness without fulfilling its profession the very pins on her pincushion were stuck in after a pattern from which she was careful to allow no aberration and as for her own person it gave the same idea of perfect unvarying neatness as the body of a little bird  it is true that her lightbrown hair was cropped behind like a boys and was dressed in front in a number of flat rings that lay quite away from her face but there was no sort of coiffure that could make miss nancys cheek and neck look otherwise than pretty and when at last she stood complete in her silvery twilled silk her lace tucker her coral necklace and coral eardrops the miss gunns could see nothing to criticise except her hands which bore the traces of buttermaking cheesecrushing and even still coarser work  but miss nancy was not ashamed of that for even while she was dressing she narrated to her aunt how she and priscilla had packed their boxes yesterday because this morning was baking morning and since they were leaving home it was desirable to make a good supply of meatpies for the kitchen and as she concluded this judicious remark she turned to the miss gunns that she might not commit the rudeness of not including them in the conversation  the miss gunns smiled stiffly and thought what a pity it was that these rich country people who could afford to buy such good clothes really miss nancys lace and silk were very costly should be brought up in utter ignorance and vulgarity  she actually said mate for meat appen for perhaps and oss for horse which to young ladies living in good lytherly society who habitually said orse even in domestic privacy and only said appen on the right occasions was necessarily shocking  miss nancy indeed had never been to any school higher than dame tedmans her acquaintance with profane literature hardly went beyond the rhymes she had worked in her large sampler under the lamb and the shepherdess and in order to balance an account she was obliged to effect her subtraction by removing visible metallic shillings and sixpences from a visible metallic total  there is hardly a servantmaid in these days who is not better informed than miss nancy yet she had the essential attributes of a ladyhigh veracity delicate honour in her dealings deference to others and refined personal habitsand lest these should not suffice to convince grammatical fair ones that her feelings can at all resemble theirs i will add that she was slightly proud and exacting and as constant in her affection towards a baseless opinion as towards an erring lover  the anxiety about sister priscilla which had grown rather active by the time the coral necklace was clasped was happily ended by the entrance of that cheerfullooking lady herself with a face made blowsy by cold and damp  after the first questions and greetings she turned to nancy and surveyed her from head to footthen wheeled her round to ascertain that the back view was equally faultless  what do you think o these gowns aunt osgood  said priscilla while nancy helped her to unrobe  very handsome indeed niece said mrs osgood with a slight increase of formality  she always thought niece priscilla too rough  im obliged to have the same as nancy you know for all im five years older and it makes me look yallow for she never will have anything without i have mine just like it because she wants us to look like sisters  and i tell her folks ull think its my weakness makes me fancy as i shall look pretty in what she looks pretty in  for i am uglytheres no denying that i feature my fathers family  but law  i dont mind do you  priscilla here turned to the miss gunns rattling on in too much preoccupation with the delight of talking to notice that her candour was not appreciated  the pretty uns do for flycatchersthey keep the men off us  ive no opinion o the men miss gunni dont know what you have  and as for fretting and stewing about what theyll think of you from morning till night and making your life uneasy about what theyre doing when theyre out o your sightas i tell nancy its a folly no woman need be guilty of if shes got a good father and a good home let her leave it to them as have got no fortin and cant help themselves  as i say mr haveyourownway is the best husband and the only one id ever promise to obey  i know it isnt pleasant when youve been used to living in a big way and managing hogsheads and all that to go and put your nose in by somebody elses fireside or to sit down by yourself to a scrag or a knuckle but thank god  my fathers a sober man and likely to live and if youve got a man by the chimneycorner it doesnt matter if hes childishthe business neednt be broke up  the delicate process of getting her narrow gown over her head without injury to her smooth curls obliged miss priscilla to pause in this rapid survey of life and mrs osgood seized the opportunity of rising and saying  well niece youll follow us  the miss gunns will like to go down  sister said nancy when they were alone youve offended the miss gunns im sure  what have i done child  said priscilla in some alarm  why you asked them if they minded about being uglyyoure so very blunt  law did i  well it popped out its a mercy i said no more for im a bad un to live with folks when they dont like the truth  but as for being ugly look at me child in this silvercoloured silki told you how it ud bei look as yallow as a daffadil anybody ud say you wanted to make a mawkin of me  no priscy dont say so  i begged and prayed of you not to let us have this silk if youd like another better  i was willing to have your choice you know i was said nancy in anxious selfvindication  nonsense child  you know youd set your heart on this and reason good for youre the colour o cream  it ud be fine doings for you to dress yourself to suit my skin  what i find fault with is that notion o yours as i must dress myself just like you but you do as you like with meyou always did from when first you begun to walk  if you wanted to go the fields length the fields length youd go and there was no whipping you for you looked as prim and innicent as a daisy all the while  priscy said nancy gently as she fastened a coral necklace exactly like her own round priscillas neck which was very far from being like her own im sure im willing to give way as far as is right but who shouldnt dress alike if it isnt sisters would you have us go about looking as if we were no kin to one anotherus that have got no mother and not another sister in the world  id do what was right if i dressed in a gown dyed with cheesecolouring and id rather youd choose and let me wear what pleases you  there you go again  youd come round to the same thing if one talked to you from saturday night till saturday morning  itll be fine fun to see how youll master your husband and never raise your voice above the singing o the kettle all the while  i like to see the men mastered  dont talk so priscy said nancy blushing  you know i dont mean ever to be married  oh you never mean a fiddlesticks end  said priscilla as she arranged her discarded dress and closed her bandbox  who shall i have to work for when fathers gone if you are to go and take notions in your head and be an old maid because some folks are no better than they should be  i havent a bit o patience with yousitting on an addled egg for ever as if there was never a fresh un in the world one old maids enough out o two sisters and i shall do credit to a single life for god amighty meant me for it  come we can go down now  im as ready as a mawkin can betheres nothing awanting to frighten the crows now ive got my eardroppers in  as the two miss lammeters walked into the large parlour together any one who did not know the character of both might certainly have supposed that the reason why the squareshouldered clumsy highfeatured priscilla wore a dress the facsimile of her pretty sisters was either the mistaken vanity of the one or the malicious contrivance of the other in order to set off her own rare beauty  but the goodnatured selfforgetful cheeriness and commonsense of priscilla would soon have dissipated the one suspicion and the modest calm of nancys speech and manners told clearly of a mind free from all disavowed devices  places of honour had been kept for the miss lammeters near the head of the principal teatable in the wainscoted parlour now looking fresh and pleasant with handsome branches of holly yew and laurel from the abundant growths of the old garden and nancy felt an inward flutter that no firmness of purpose could prevent when she saw mr godfrey cass advancing to lead her to a seat between himself and mr crackenthorp while priscilla was called to the opposite side between her father and the squire  it certainly did make some difference to nancy that the lover she had given up was the young man of quite the highest consequence in the parishat home in a venerable and unique parlour which was the extremity of grandeur in her experience a parlour where she might one day have been mistress with the consciousness that she was spoken of as madam cass the squires wife  these circumstances exalted her inward drama in her own eyes and deepened the emphasis with which she declared to herself that not the most dazzling rank should induce her to marry a man whose conduct showed him careless of his character but that love once love always was the motto of a true and pure woman and no man should ever have any right over her which would be a call on her to destroy the dried flowers that she treasured and always would treasure for godfrey casss sake  and nancy was capable of keeping her word to herself under very trying conditions  nothing but a becoming blush betrayed the moving thoughts that urged themselves upon her as she accepted the seat next to mr crackenthorp for she was so instinctively neat and adroit in all her actions and her pretty lips met each other with such quiet firmness that it would have been difficult for her to appear agitated  it was not the rectors practice to let a charming blush pass without an appropriate compliment  he was not in the least lofty or aristocratic but simply a merryeyed smallfeatured greyhaired man with his chin propped by an ample manycreased white neckcloth which seemed to predominate over every other point in his person and somehow to impress its peculiar character on his remarks so that to have considered his amenities apart from his cravat would have been a severe and perhaps a dangerous effort of abstraction  ha miss nancy he said turning his head within his cravat and smiling down pleasantly upon her when anybody pretends this has been a severe winter i shall tell them i saw the roses blooming on new years eveeh godfrey what do you say  godfrey made no reply and avoided looking at nancy very markedly for though these complimentary personalities were held to be in excellent taste in oldfashioned raveloe society reverent love has a politeness of its own which it teaches to men otherwise of small schooling  but the squire was rather impatient at godfreys showing himself a dull spark in this way  by this advanced hour of the day the squire was always in higher spirits than we have seen him in at the breakfasttable and felt it quite pleasant to fulfil the hereditary duty of being noisily jovial and patronizing the large silver snuffbox was in active service and was offered without fail to all neighbours from time to time however often they might have declined the favour  at present the squire had only given an express welcome to the heads of families as they appeared but always as the evening deepened his hospitality rayed out more widely till he had tapped the youngest guests on the back and shown a peculiar fondness for their presence in the full belief that they must feel their lives made happy by their belonging to a parish where there was such a hearty man as squire cass to invite them and wish them well  even in this early stage of the jovial mood it was natural that he should wish to supply his sons deficiencies by looking and speaking for him  aye aye he began offering his snuffbox to mr lammeter who for the second time bowed his head and waved his hand in stiff rejection of the offer us old fellows may wish ourselves young tonight when we see the mistletoebough in the white parlour its true most things are gone backard in these last thirty yearsthe countrys going down since the old king fell ill  but when i look at miss nancy here i begin to think the lasses keep up their qualityding me if i remember a sample to match her not when i was a fine young fellow and thought a deal about my pigtail  no offence to you madam he added bending to mrs crackenthorp who sat by him i didnt know you when you were as young as miss nancy here  mrs crackenthorpa small blinking woman who fidgeted incessantly with her lace ribbons and gold chain turning her head about and making subdued noises very much like a guineapig that twitches its nose and soliloquizes in all company indiscriminatelynow blinked and fidgeted towards the squire and said oh nono offence  this emphatic compliment of the squires to nancy was felt by others besides godfrey to have a diplomatic significance and her father gave a slight additional erectness to his back as he looked across the table at her with complacent gravity  that grave and orderly senior was not going to bate a jot of his dignity by seeming elated at the notion of a match between his family and the squires he was gratified by any honour paid to his daughter but he must see an alteration in several ways before his consent would be vouchsafed his spare but healthy person and highfeatured firm face that looked as if it had never been flushed by excess was in strong contrast not only with the squires but with the appearance of the raveloe farmers generallyin accordance with a favourite saying of his own that breed was stronger than pasture  miss nancys wonderful like what her mother was though isnt she kimble  said the stout lady of that name looking round for her husband  but doctor kimble country apothecaries in old days enjoyed that title without authority of diploma being a thin and agile man was flitting about the room with his hands in his pockets making himself agreeable to his feminine patients with medical impartiality and being welcomed everywhere as a doctor by hereditary rightnot one of those miserable apothecaries who canvass for practice in strange neighbourhoods and spend all their income in starving their one horse but a man of substance able to keep an extravagant table like the best of his patients  time out of mind the raveloe doctor had been a kimble kimble was inherently a doctors name and it was difficult to contemplate firmly the melancholy fact that the actual kimble had no son so that his practice might one day be handed over to a successor with the incongruous name of taylor or johnson  but in that case the wiser people in raveloe would employ dr blick of flittonas less unnatural  did you speak to me my dear  said the authentic doctor coming quickly to his wifes side but as if foreseeing that she would be too much out of breath to repeat her remark he went on immediatelyha miss priscilla the sight of you revives the taste of that superexcellent porkpie  i hope the batch isnt near an end  yes indeed it is doctor said priscilla but ill answer for it the next shall be as good  my porkpies dont turn out well by chance  not as your doctoring does eh kimblebecause folks forget to take your physic eh  said the squire who regarded physic and doctors as many loyal churchmen regard the church and the clergytasting a joke against them when he was in health but impatiently eager for their aid when anything was the matter with him  he tapped his box and looked round with a triumphant laugh  ah she has a quick wit my friend priscilla has said the doctor choosing to attribute the epigram to a lady rather than allow a brotherinlaw that advantage over him  she saves a little pepper to sprinkle over her talkthats the reason why she never puts too much into her pies  theres my wife now she never has an answer at her tongues end but if i offend her shes sure to scarify my throat with black pepper the next day or else give me the colic with watery greens  thats an awful titfortat  here the vivacious doctor made a pathetic grimace  did you ever hear the like  said mrs kimble laughing above her double chin with much goodhumour aside to mrs crackenthorp who blinked and nodded and seemed to intend a smile which by the correlation of forces went off in small twitchings and noises  i suppose thats the sort of titfortat adopted in your profession kimble if youve a grudge against a patient said the rector  never do have a grudge against our patients said mr kimble except when they leave us and then you see we havent the chance of prescribing for em  ha miss nancy he continued suddenly skipping to nancys side you wont forget your promise youre to save a dance for me you know  come come kimble dont you be too forard said the squire give the young uns fairplay  theres my son godfreyll be wanting to have a round with you if you run off with miss nancy hes bespoke her for the first dance ill be bound  eh sir  what do you say  he continued throwing himself backward and looking at godfrey  havent you asked miss nancy to open the dance with you  godfrey sorely uncomfortable under this significant insistence about nancy and afraid to think where it would end by the time his father had set his usual hospitable example of drinking before and after supper saw no course open but to turn to nancy and say with as little awkwardness as possible  no ive not asked her yet but i hope shell consentif somebody else hasnt been before me  no ive not engaged myself said nancy quietly though blushingly if mr godfrey founded any hopes on her consenting to dance with him he would soon be undeceived but there was no need for her to be uncivil  then i hope youve no objections to dancing with me said godfrey beginning to lose the sense that there was anything uncomfortable in this arrangement  no no objections said nancy in a cold tone  ah well youre a lucky fellow godfrey said uncle kimble but youre my godson so i wont stand in your way  else im not so very old eh my dear  he went on skipping to his wifes side again you wouldnt mind my having a second after you were gonenot if i cried a good deal first  come come take a cup o tea and stop your tongue do said goodhumoured mrs kimble feeling some pride in a husband who must be regarded as so clever and amusing by the company generally  if he had only not been irritable at cards  while safe welltested personalities were enlivening the tea in this way the sound of the fiddle approaching within a distance at which it could be heard distinctly made the young people look at each other with sympathetic impatience for the end of the meal  why theres solomon in the hall said the squire and playing my favrite tune i believethe flaxenheaded ploughboyhes for giving us a hint as we arent enough in a hurry to hear him play bob he called out to his third longlegged son who was at the other end of the room open the door and tell solomon to come in  he shall give us a tune here  bob obeyed and solomon walked in fiddling as he walked for he would on no account break off in the middle of a tune  here solomon said the squire with loud patronage  round here my man  ah i knew it was the flaxenheaded ploughboy theres no finer tune  solomon macey a small hale old man with an abundant crop of long white hair reaching nearly to his shoulders advanced to the indicated spot bowing reverently while he fiddled as much as to say that he respected the company though he respected the keynote more  as soon as he had repeated the tune and lowered his fiddle he bowed again to the squire and the rector and said i hope i see your honour and your reverence well and wishing you health and long life and a happy new year  and wishing the same to you mr lammeter sir and to the other gentlemen and the madams and the young lasses  as solomon uttered the last words he bowed in all directions solicitously lest he should be wanting in due respect  but thereupon he immediately began to prelude and fell into the tune which he knew would be taken as a special compliment by mr lammeter  thank ye solomon thank ye said mr lammeter when the fiddle paused again  thats over the hills and far away that is  my father used to say to me whenever we heard that tune ah lad i come from over the hills and far away  theres a many tunes i dont make head or tail of but that speaks to me like the blackbirds whistle  i suppose its the name theres a deal in the name of a tune  but solomon was already impatient to prelude again and presently broke with much spirit into sir roger de coverley at which there was a sound of chairs pushed back and laughing voices  aye aye solomon we know what that means said the squire rising its time to begin the dance eh  lead the way then and well all follow you  so solomon holding his white head on one side and playing vigorously marched forward at the head of the gay procession into the white parlour where the mistletoebough was hung and multitudinous tallow candles made rather a brilliant effect gleaming from among the berried hollyboughs and reflected in the oldfashioned oval mirrors fastened in the panels of the white wainscot  a quaint procession  old solomon in his seedy clothes and long white locks seemed to be luring that decent company by the magic scream of his fiddleluring discreet matrons in turbanshaped caps nay mrs crackenthorp herself the summit of whose perpendicular feather was on a level with the squires shoulderluring fair lasses complacently conscious of very short waists and skirts blameless of frontfoldsluring burly fathers in large variegated waistcoats and ruddy sons for the most part shy and sheepish in short nether garments and very long coattails  already mr macey and a few other privileged villagers who were allowed to be spectators on these great occasions were seated on benches placed for them near the door and great was the admiration and satisfaction in that quarter when the couples had formed themselves for the dance and the squire led off with mrs crackenthorp joining hands with the rector and mrs osgood that was as it should bethat was what everybody had been used toand the charter of raveloe seemed to be renewed by the ceremony it was not thought of as an unbecoming levity for the old and middleaged people to dance a little before sitting down to cards but rather as part of their social duties  for what were these if not to be merry at appropriate times interchanging visits and poultry with due frequency paying each other oldestablished compliments in sound traditional phrases passing welltried personal jokes urging your guests to eat and drink too much out of hospitality and eating and drinking too much in your neighbours house to show that you liked your cheer  and the parson naturally set an example in these social duties  for it would not have been possible for the raveloe mind without a peculiar revelation to know that a clergyman should be a palefaced memento of solemnities instead of a reasonably faulty man whose exclusive authority to read prayers and preach to christen marry and bury you necessarily coexisted with the right to sell you the ground to be buried in and to take tithe in kind on which last point of course there was a little grumbling but not to the extent of irreligionnot of deeper significance than the grumbling at the rain which was by no means accompanied with a spirit of impious defiance but with a desire that the prayer for fine weather might be read forthwith  there was no reason then why the rectors dancing should not be received as part of the fitness of things quite as much as the squires or why on the other hand mr maceys official respect should restrain him from subjecting the parsons performance to that criticism with which minds of extraordinary acuteness must necessarily contemplate the doings of their fallible fellowmen  the squires pretty springe considering his weight said mr macey and he stamps uncommon well  but mr lammeter beats em all for shapes you see he holds his head like a sodger and he isnt so cushiony as most o the oldish gentlefolksthey run fat in general and hes got a fine leg  the parsons nimble enough but he hasnt got much of a leg its a bit too thick downard and his knees might be a bit nearer wiout damage but he might do worse he might do worse though he hasnt that grand way o waving his hand as the squire has  talk o nimbleness look at mrs osgood said ben winthrop who was holding his son aaron between his knees  she trips along with her little steps so as nobody can see how she goesits like as if she had little wheels to her feet  she doesnt look a day older nor last year shes the finestmade woman as is let the next be where she will  i dont heed how the women are made said mr macey with some contempt  they wear nayther coat nor breeches you cant make much out o their shapes  fayder said aaron whose feet were busy beating out the tune how does that big cocksfeather stick in mrs crackenthorps yead  is there a little hole for it like in my shuttlecock  hush lad hush thats the way the ladies dress theirselves that is said the father adding however in an undertone to mr macey it does make her look funny thoughpartly like a shortnecked bottle wi a long quill in it  hey by jingo theres the young squire leading off now wi miss nancy for partners theres a lass for youlike a pinkandwhite posytheres nobody ud think as anybody could be so pritty  i shouldnt wonder if shes madam cass some day arter alland nobody more rightfuller for theyd make a fine match you can find nothing against master godfreys shapes macey ill bet a penny  mr macey screwed up his mouth leaned his head further on one side and twirled his thumbs with a presto movement as his eyes followed godfrey up the dance  at last he summed up his opinion  pretty well downard but a bit too round i the shoulderblades and as for them coats as he gets from the flitton tailor theyre a poor cut to pay double money for  ah mr macey you and me are two folks said ben slightly indignant at this carping  when ive got a pot o good ale i like to swaller it and do my inside good istead o smelling and staring at it to see if i cant find faut wi the brewing  i should like you to pick me out a finerlimbed young fellow nor master godfreyone as ud knock you down easier or s more pleasanterlooksed when hes piert and merry  tchuh  said mr macey provoked to increased severity he isnt come to his right colour yet hes partly like a slackbaked pie  and i doubt hes got a soft place in his head else why should he be turned round the finger by that offal dunsey as nobodys seen o late and let him kill that fine hunting hoss as was the talk o the country  and one while he was allays after miss nancy and then it all went off again like a smell o hot porridge as i may say that wasnt my way when i went acoorting  ah but mayhap miss nancy hung off like and your lass didnt said ben  i should say she didnt said mr macey significantly before i said sniff i took care to know as shed say snaff and pretty quick too  i wasnt agoing to open my mouth like a dog at a fly and snap it to again wi nothing to swaller  well i think miss nancys acoming round again said ben for master godfrey doesnt look so downhearted tonight  and i see hes for taking her away to sit down now theyre at the end o the dance that looks like sweethearting that does  the reason why godfrey and nancy had left the dance was not so tender as ben imagined  in the close press of couples a slight accident had happened to nancys dress which while it was short enough to show her neat ankle in front was long enough behind to be caught under the stately stamp of the squires foot so as to rend certain stitches at the waist and cause much sisterly agitation in priscillas mind as well as serious concern in nancys  ones thoughts may be much occupied with lovestruggles but hardly so as to be insensible to a disorder in the general framework of things nancy had no sooner completed her duty in the figure they were dancing than she said to godfrey with a deep blush that she must go and sit down till priscilla could come to her for the sisters had already exchanged a short whisper and an openeyed glance full of meaning  no reason less urgent than this could have prevailed on nancy to give godfrey this opportunity of sitting apart with her as for godfrey he was feeling so happy and oblivious under the long charm of the countrydance with nancy that he got rather bold on the strength of her confusion and was capable of leading her straight away without leave asked into the adjoining small parlour where the cardtables were set  oh no thank you said nancy coldly as soon as she perceived where he was going not in there  ill wait here till priscillas ready to come to me  im sorry to bring you out of the dance and make myself troublesome  why youll be more comfortable here by yourself said the artful godfrey ill leave you here till your sister can come he spoke in an indifferent tone  that was an agreeable proposition and just what nancy desired why then was she a little hurt that mr godfrey should make it  they entered and she seated herself on a chair against one of the cardtables as the stiffest and most unapproachable position she could choose  thank you sir she said immediately  i neednt give you any more trouble  im sorry youve had such an unlucky partner  thats very illnatured of you said godfrey standing by her without any sign of intended departure to be sorry youve danced with me  oh no sir i dont mean to say whats illnatured at all said nancy looking distractingly prim and pretty  when gentlemen have so many pleasures one dance can matter but very little  you know that isnt true  you know one dance with you matters more to me than all the other pleasures in the world  it was a long long while since godfrey had said anything so direct as that and nancy was startled  but her instinctive dignity and repugnance to any show of emotion made her sit perfectly still and only throw a little more decision into her voice as she said  no indeed mr godfrey thats not known to me and i have very good reasons for thinking different  but if its true i dont wish to hear it  would you never forgive me then nancynever think well of me let what would happenwould you never think the present made amends for the past  not if i turned a good fellow and gave up everything you didnt like  godfrey was half conscious that this sudden opportunity of speaking to nancy alone had driven him beside himself but blind feeling had got the mastery of his tongue  nancy really felt much agitated by the possibility godfreys words suggested but this very pressure of emotion that she was in danger of finding too strong for her roused all her power of selfcommand  i should be glad to see a good change in anybody mr godfrey she answered with the slightest discernible difference of tone but it ud be better if no change was wanted  youre very hardhearted nancy said godfrey pettishly  you might encourage me to be a better fellow  im very miserablebut youve no feeling  i think those have the least feeling that act wrong to begin with said nancy sending out a flash in spite of herself godfrey was delighted with that little flash and would have liked to go on and make her quarrel with him nancy was so exasperatingly quiet and firm but she was not indifferent to him yet though  the entrance of priscilla bustling forward and saying dear heart alive child let us look at this gown cut off godfreys hopes of a quarrel  i suppose i must go now he said to priscilla  its no matter to me whether you go or stay said that frank lady searching for something in her pocket with a preoccupied brow  do you want me to go  said godfrey looking at nancy who was now standing up by priscillas order  as you like said nancy trying to recover all her former coldness and looking down carefully at the hem of her gown  then i like to stay said godfrey with a reckless determination to get as much of this joy as he could tonight and think nothing of the morrow    chapter xii  while godfrey cass was taking draughts of forgetfulness from the sweet presence of nancy willingly losing all sense of that hidden bond which at other moments galled and fretted him so as to mingle irritation with the very sunshine godfreys wife was walking with slow uncertain steps through the snowcovered raveloe lanes carrying her child in her arms  this journey on new years eve was a premeditated act of vengeance which she had kept in her heart ever since godfrey in a fit of passion had told her he would sooner die than acknowledge her as his wife  there would be a great party at the red house on new years eve she knew her husband would be smiling and smiled upon hiding her existence in the darkest corner of his heart  but she would mar his pleasure she would go in her dingy rags with her faded face once as handsome as the best with her little child that had its fathers hair and eyes and disclose herself to the squire as his eldest sons wife it is seldom that the miserable can help regarding their misery as a wrong inflicted by those who are less miserable  molly knew that the cause of her dingy rags was not her husbands neglect but the demon opium to whom she was enslaved body and soul except in the lingering mothers tenderness that refused to give him her hungry child  she knew this well and yet in the moments of wretched unbenumbed consciousness the sense of her want and degradation transformed itself continually into bitterness towards godfrey  he was well off and if she had her rights she would be well off too  the belief that he repented his marriage and suffered from it only aggravated her vindictiveness just and selfreproving thoughts do not come to us too thickly even in the purest air and with the best lessons of heaven and earth how should those whitewinged delicate messengers make their way to mollys poisoned chamber inhabited by no higher memories than those of a barmaids paradise of pink ribbons and gentlemens jokes  she had set out at an early hour but had lingered on the road inclined by her indolence to believe that if she waited under a warm shed the snow would cease to fall  she had waited longer than she knew and now that she found herself belated in the snowhidden ruggedness of the long lanes even the animation of a vindictive purpose could not keep her spirit from failing  it was seven oclock and by this time she was not very far from raveloe but she was not familiar enough with those monotonous lanes to know how near she was to her journeys end  she needed comfort and she knew but one comforterthe familiar demon in her bosom but she hesitated a moment after drawing out the black remnant before she raised it to her lips in that moment the mothers love pleaded for painful consciousness rather than oblivionpleaded to be left in aching weariness rather than to have the encircling arms benumbed so that they could not feel the dear burden  in another moment molly had flung something away but it was not the black remnantit was an empty phial  and she walked on again under the breaking cloud from which there came now and then the light of a quickly veiled star for a freezing wind had sprung up since the snowing had ceased  but she walked always more and more drowsily and clutched more and more automatically the sleeping child at her bosom  slowly the demon was working his will and cold and weariness were his helpers  soon she felt nothing but a supreme immediate longing that curtained off all futuritythe longing to lie down and sleep  she had arrived at a spot where her footsteps were no longer checked by a hedgerow and she had wandered vaguely unable to distinguish any objects notwithstanding the wide whiteness around her and the growing starlight  she sank down against a straggling furze bush an easy pillow enough and the bed of snow too was soft  she did not feel that the bed was cold and did not heed whether the child would wake and cry for her  but her arms had not yet relaxed their instinctive clutch and the little one slumbered on as gently as if it had been rocked in a lacetrimmed cradle  but the complete torpor came at last the fingers lost their tension the arms unbent then the little head fell away from the bosom and the blue eyes opened wide on the cold starlight  at first there was a little peevish cry of mammy and an effort to regain the pillowing arm and bosom but mammys ear was deaf and the pillow seemed to be slipping away backward  suddenly as the child rolled downward on its mothers knees all wet with snow its eyes were caught by a bright glancing light on the white ground and with the ready transition of infancy it was immediately absorbed in watching the bright living thing running towards it yet never arriving  that bright living thing must be caught and in an instant the child had slipped on allfours and held out one little hand to catch the gleam  but the gleam would not be caught in that way and now the head was held up to see where the cunning gleam came from  it came from a very bright place and the little one rising on its legs toddled through the snow the old grimy shawl in which it was wrapped trailing behind it and the queer little bonnet dangling at its backtoddled on to the open door of silas marners cottage and right up to the warm hearth where there was a bright fire of logs and sticks which had thoroughly warmed the old sack silass greatcoat spread out on the bricks to dry  the little one accustomed to be left to itself for long hours without notice from its mother squatted down on the sack and spread its tiny hands towards the blaze in perfect contentment gurgling and making many inarticulate communications to the cheerful fire like a newhatched gosling beginning to find itself comfortable  but presently the warmth had a lulling effect and the little golden head sank down on the old sack and the blue eyes were veiled by their delicate halftransparent lids  but where was silas marner while this strange visitor had come to his hearth  he was in the cottage but he did not see the child during the last few weeks since he had lost his money he had contracted the habit of opening his door and looking out from time to time as if he thought that his money might be somehow coming back to him or that some trace some news of it might be mysteriously on the road and be caught by the listening ear or the straining eye  it was chiefly at night when he was not occupied in his loom that he fell into this repetition of an act for which he could have assigned no definite purpose and which can hardly be understood except by those who have undergone a bewildering separation from a supremely loved object  in the evening twilight and later whenever the night was not dark silas looked out on that narrow prospect round the stonepits listening and gazing not with hope but with mere yearning and unrest  this morning he had been told by some of his neighbours that it was new years eve and that he must sit up and hear the old year rung out and the new rung in because that was good luck and might bring his money back again  this was only a friendly raveloeway of jesting with the halfcrazy oddities of a miser but it had perhaps helped to throw silas into a more than usually excited state  since the oncoming of twilight he had opened his door again and again though only to shut it immediately at seeing all distance veiled by the falling snow  but the last time he opened it the snow had ceased and the clouds were parting here and there  he stood and listened and gazed for a long whilethere was really something on the road coming towards him then but he caught no sign of it and the stillness and the wide trackless snow seemed to narrow his solitude and touched his yearning with the chill of despair  he went in again and put his right hand on the latch of the door to close itbut he did not close it he was arrested as he had been already since his loss by the invisible wand of catalepsy and stood like a graven image with wide but sightless eyes holding open his door powerless to resist either the good or the evil that might enter there  when marners sensibility returned he continued the action which had been arrested and closed his door unaware of the chasm in his consciousness unaware of any intermediate change except that the light had grown dim and that he was chilled and faint  he thought he had been too long standing at the door and looking out  turning towards the hearth where the two logs had fallen apart and sent forth only a red uncertain glimmer he seated himself on his fireside chair and was stooping to push his logs together when to his blurred vision it seemed as if there were gold on the floor in front of the hearth  goldhis own goldbrought back to him as mysteriously as it had been taken away  he felt his heart begin to beat violently and for a few moments he was unable to stretch out his hand and grasp the restored treasure  the heap of gold seemed to glow and get larger beneath his agitated gaze  he leaned forward at last and stretched forth his hand but instead of the hard coin with the familiar resisting outline his fingers encountered soft warm curls  in utter amazement silas fell on his knees and bent his head low to examine the marvel it was a sleeping childa round fair thing with soft yellow rings all over its head  could this be his little sister come back to him in a dreamhis little sister whom he had carried about in his arms for a year before she died when he was a small boy without shoes or stockings  that was the first thought that darted across silass blank wonderment  was it a dream  he rose to his feet again pushed his logs together and throwing on some dried leaves and sticks raised a flame but the flame did not disperse the visionit only lit up more distinctly the little round form of the child and its shabby clothing it was very much like his little sister silas sank into his chair powerless under the double presence of an inexplicable surprise and a hurrying influx of memories  how and when had the child come in without his knowledge  he had never been beyond the door  but along with that question and almost thrusting it away there was a vision of the old home and the old streets leading to lantern yardand within that vision another of the thoughts which had been present with him in those faroff scenes the thoughts were strange to him now like old friendships impossible to revive and yet he had a dreamy feeling that this child was somehow a message come to him from that faroff life it stirred fibres that had never been moved in raveloeold quiverings of tendernessold impressions of awe at the presentiment of some power presiding over his life for his imagination had not yet extricated itself from the sense of mystery in the childs sudden presence and had formed no conjectures of ordinary natural means by which the event could have been brought about  but there was a cry on the hearth the child had awaked and marner stooped to lift it on his knee  it clung round his neck and burst louder and louder into that mingling of inarticulate cries with mammy by which little children express the bewilderment of waking  silas pressed it to him and almost unconsciously uttered sounds of hushing tenderness while he bethought himself that some of his porridge which had got cool by the dying fire would do to feed the child with if it were only warmed up a little  he had plenty to do through the next hour  the porridge sweetened with some dry brown sugar from an old store which he had refrained from using for himself stopped the cries of the little one and made her lift her blue eyes with a wide quiet gaze at silas as he put the spoon into her mouth  presently she slipped from his knee and began to toddle about but with a pretty stagger that made silas jump up and follow her lest she should fall against anything that would hurt her but she only fell in a sitting posture on the ground and began to pull at her boots looking up at him with a crying face as if the boots hurt her  he took her on his knee again but it was some time before it occurred to silass dull bachelor mind that the wet boots were the grievance pressing on her warm ankles  he got them off with difficulty and baby was at once happily occupied with the primary mystery of her own toes inviting silas with much chuckling to consider the mystery too  but the wet boots had at last suggested to silas that the child had been walking on the snow and this roused him from his entire oblivion of any ordinary means by which it could have entered or been brought into his house  under the prompting of this new idea and without waiting to form conjectures he raised the child in his arms and went to the door  as soon as he had opened it there was the cry of mammy again which silas had not heard since the childs first hungry waking  bending forward he could just discern the marks made by the little feet on the virgin snow and he followed their track to the furze bushes  mammy  the little one cried again and again stretching itself forward so as almost to escape from silass arms before he himself was aware that there was something more than the bush before himthat there was a human body with the head sunk low in the furze and halfcovered with the shaken snow    chapter xiii  it was after the early suppertime at the red house and the entertainment was in that stage when bashfulness itself had passed into easy jollity when gentlemen conscious of unusual accomplishments could at length be prevailed on to dance a hornpipe and when the squire preferred talking loudly scattering snuff and patting his visitors backs to sitting longer at the whisttablea choice exasperating to uncle kimble who being always volatile in sober business hours became intense and bitter over cards and brandy shuffled before his adversarys deal with a glare of suspicion and turned up a mean trumpcard with an air of inexpressible disgust as if in a world where such things could happen one might as well enter on a course of reckless profligacy when the evening had advanced to this pitch of freedom and enjoyment it was usual for the servants the heavy duties of supper being well over to get their share of amusement by coming to look on at the dancing so that the back regions of the house were left in solitude  there were two doors by which the white parlour was entered from the hall and they were both standing open for the sake of air but the lower one was crowded with the servants and villagers and only the upper doorway was left free  bob cass was figuring in a hornpipe and his father very proud of this lithe son whom he repeatedly declared to be just like himself in his young days in a tone that implied this to be the very highest stamp of juvenile merit was the centre of a group who had placed themselves opposite the performer not far from the upper door  godfrey was standing a little way off not to admire his brothers dancing but to keep sight of nancy who was seated in the group near her father  he stood aloof because he wished to avoid suggesting himself as a subject for the squires fatherly jokes in connection with matrimony and miss nancy lammeters beauty which were likely to become more and more explicit  but he had the prospect of dancing with her again when the hornpipe was concluded and in the meanwhile it was very pleasant to get long glances at her quite unobserved  but when godfrey was lifting his eyes from one of those long glances they encountered an object as startling to him at that moment as if it had been an apparition from the dead  it was an apparition from that hidden life which lies like a dark bystreet behind the goodly ornamented facade that meets the sunlight and the gaze of respectable admirers  it was his own child carried in silas marners arms  that was his instantaneous impression unaccompanied by doubt though he had not seen the child for months past and when the hope was rising that he might possibly be mistaken mr crackenthorp and mr lammeter had already advanced to silas in astonishment at this strange advent godfrey joined them immediately unable to rest without hearing every wordtrying to control himself but conscious that if any one noticed him they must see that he was whitelipped and trembling  but now all eyes at that end of the room were bent on silas marner the squire himself had risen and asked angrily hows thiswhats thiswhat do you do coming in here in this way  im come for the doctori want the doctor silas had said in the first moment to mr crackenthorp  why whats the matter marner  said the rector  the doctors here but say quietly what you want him for  its a woman said silas speaking low and halfbreathlessly just as godfrey came up  shes dead i thinkdead in the snow at the stonepitsnot far from my door  godfrey felt a great throb there was one terror in his mind at that moment it was that the woman might not be dead  that was an evil terroran ugly inmate to have found a nestlingplace in godfreys kindly disposition but no disposition is a security from evil wishes to a man whose happiness hangs on duplicity  hush hush  said mr crackenthorp  go out into the hall there ill fetch the doctor to you  found a woman in the snowand thinks shes dead he added speaking low to the squire better say as little about it as possible it will shock the ladies  just tell them a poor woman is ill from cold and hunger ill go and fetch kimble  by this time however the ladies had pressed forward curious to know what could have brought the solitary linenweaver there under such strange circumstances and interested in the pretty child who half alarmed and half attracted by the brightness and the numerous company now frowned and hid her face now lifted up her head again and looked round placably until a touch or a coaxing word brought back the frown and made her bury her face with new determination  what child is it  said several ladies at once and among the rest nancy lammeter addressing godfrey  i dont knowsome poor womans who has been found in the snow i believe was the answer godfrey wrung from himself with a terrible effort  after all am i certain  he hastened to add silently in anticipation of his own conscience  why youd better leave the child here then master marner said goodnatured mrs kimble hesitating however to take those dingy clothes into contact with her own ornamented satin bodice ill tell one o the girls to fetch it  nonoi cant part with it i cant let it go said silas abruptly  its come to meive a right to keep it  the proposition to take the child from him had come to silas quite unexpectedly and his speech uttered under a strong sudden impulse was almost like a revelation to himself a minute before he had no distinct intention about the child  did you ever hear the like  said mrs kimble in mild surprise to her neighbour  now ladies i must trouble you to stand aside said mr kimble coming from the cardroom in some bitterness at the interruption but drilled by the long habit of his profession into obedience to unpleasant calls even when he was hardly sober  its a nasty business turning out now eh kimble  said the squire he might ha gone for your young fellowthe prentice therewhats his name  might  ayewhats the use of talking about might  growled uncle kimble hastening out with marner and followed by mr crackenthorp and godfrey  get me a pair of thick boots godfrey will you  and stay let somebody run to winthrops and fetch dollyshes the best woman to get  ben was here himself before supper is he gone  yes sir i met him said marner but i couldnt stop to tell him anything only i said i was going for the doctor and he said the doctor was at the squires  and i made haste and ran and there was nobody to be seen at the back o the house and so i went in to where the company was  the child no longer distracted by the bright light and the smiling womens faces began to cry and call for mammy though always clinging to marner who had apparently won her thorough confidence godfrey had come back with the boots and felt the cry as if some fibre were drawn tight within him  ill go he said hastily eager for some movement ill go and fetch the womanmrs winthrop  oh poohsend somebody else said uncle kimble hurrying away with marner  youll let me know if i can be of any use kimble said mr crackenthorp  but the doctor was out of hearing  godfrey too had disappeared he was gone to snatch his hat and coat having just reflection enough to remember that he must not look like a madman but he rushed out of the house into the snow without heeding his thin shoes  in a few minutes he was on his rapid way to the stonepits by the side of dolly who though feeling that she was entirely in her place in encountering cold and snow on an errand of mercy was much concerned at a young gentlemans getting his feet wet under a like impulse  youd a deal better go back sir said dolly with respectful compassion  youve no call to catch cold and id ask you if youd be so good as tell my husband to come on your way backhes at the rainbow i doubtif you found him anyway sober enough to be o use or else theres mrs snell ud happen send the boy up to fetch and carry for there may be things wanted from the doctors  no ill stay now im once outill stay outside here said godfrey when they came opposite marners cottage  you can come and tell me if i can do anything  well sir youre very good youve a tender heart said dolly going to the door  godfrey was too painfully preoccupied to feel a twinge of selfreproach at this undeserved praise  he walked up and down unconscious that he was plunging ankledeep in snow unconscious of everything but trembling suspense about what was going on in the cottage and the effect of each alternative on his future lot  no not quite unconscious of everything else  deeper down and halfsmothered by passionate desire and dread there was the sense that he ought not to be waiting on these alternatives that he ought to accept the consequences of his deeds own the miserable wife and fulfil the claims of the helpless child  but he had not moral courage enough to contemplate that active renunciation of nancy as possible for him he had only conscience and heart enough to make him for ever uneasy under the weakness that forbade the renunciation  and at this moment his mind leaped away from all restraint toward the sudden prospect of deliverance from his long bondage  is she dead  said the voice that predominated over every other within him  if she is i may marry nancy and then i shall be a good fellow in future and have no secrets and the childshall be taken care of somehow  but across that vision came the other possibilityshe may live and then its all up with me  godfrey never knew how long it was before the door of the cottage opened and mr kimble came out  he went forward to meet his uncle prepared to suppress the agitation he must feel whatever news he was to hear  i waited for you as id come so far he said speaking first  pooh it was nonsense for you to come out why didnt you send one of the men  theres nothing to be done  shes deadhas been dead for hours i should say  what sort of woman is she  said godfrey feeling the blood rush to his face  a young woman but emaciated with long black hair  some vagrantquite in rags  shes got a weddingring on however  they must fetch her away to the workhouse tomorrow  come come along  i want to look at her said godfrey  i think i saw such a woman yesterday  ill overtake you in a minute or two  mr kimble went on and godfrey turned back to the cottage  he cast only one glance at the dead face on the pillow which dolly had smoothed with decent care but he remembered that last look at his unhappy hated wife so well that at the end of sixteen years every line in the worn face was present to him when he told the full story of this night  he turned immediately towards the hearth where silas marner sat lulling the child  she was perfectly quiet now but not asleeponly soothed by sweet porridge and warmth into that widegazing calm which makes us older human beings with our inward turmoil feel a certain awe in the presence of a little child such as we feel before some quiet majesty or beauty in the earth or skybefore a steady glowing planet or a fullflowered eglantine or the bending trees over a silent pathway  the wideopen blue eyes looked up at godfreys without any uneasiness or sign of recognition the child could make no visible audible claim on its father and the father felt a strange mixture of feelings a conflict of regret and joy that the pulse of that little heart had no response for the halfjealous yearning in his own when the blue eyes turned away from him slowly and fixed themselves on the weavers queer face which was bent low down to look at them while the small hand began to pull marners withered cheek with loving disfiguration  youll take the child to the parish tomorrow  asked godfrey speaking as indifferently as he could  who says so  said marner sharply  will they make me take her  why you wouldnt like to keep her should youan old bachelor like you  till anybody shows theyve a right to take her away from me said marner  the mothers dead and i reckon its got no father its a lone thingand im a lone thing  my moneys gone i dont know whereand this is come from i dont know where  i know nothingim partly mazed  poor little thing  said godfrey  let me give something towards finding it clothes  he had put his hand in his pocket and found halfaguinea and thrusting it into silass hand he hurried out of the cottage to overtake mr kimble  ah i see its not the same woman i saw he said as he came up its a pretty little child the old fellow seems to want to keep it thats strange for a miser like him  but i gave him a trifle to help him out the parish isnt likely to quarrel with him for the right to keep the child  no but ive seen the time when i might have quarrelled with him for it myself  its too late now though  if the child ran into the fire your aunts too fat to overtake it she could only sit and grunt like an alarmed sow  but what a fool you are godfrey to come out in your dancing shoes and stockings in this wayand you one of the beaux of the evening and at your own house  what do you mean by such freaks young fellow  has miss nancy been cruel and do you want to spite her by spoiling your pumps  oh everything has been disagreeable tonight  i was tired to death of jigging and gallanting and that bother about the hornpipes  and id got to dance with the other miss gunn said godfrey glad of the subterfuge his uncle had suggested to him  the prevarication and white lies which a mind that keeps itself ambitiously pure is as uneasy under as a great artist under the false touches that no eye detects but his own are worn as lightly as mere trimmings when once the actions have become a lie  godfrey reappeared in the white parlour with dry feet and since the truth must be told with a sense of relief and gladness that was too strong for painful thoughts to struggle with  for could he not venture now whenever opportunity offered to say the tenderest things to nancy lammeterto promise her and himself that he would always be just what she would desire to see him  there was no danger that his dead wife would be recognized those were not days of active inquiry and wide report and as for the registry of their marriage that was a long way off buried in unturned pages away from every ones interest but his own  dunsey might betray him if he came back but dunsey might be won to silence  and when events turn out so much better for a man than he has had reason to dread is it not a proof that his conduct has been less foolish and blameworthy than it might otherwise have appeared  when we are treated well we naturally begin to think that we are not altogether unmeritorious and that it is only just we should treat ourselves well and not mar our own good fortune  where after all would be the use of his confessing the past to nancy lammeter and throwing away his happinessnay hers  for he felt some confidence that she loved him  as for the child he would see that it was cared for he would never forsake it he would do everything but own it perhaps it would be just as happy in life without being owned by its father seeing that nobody could tell how things would turn out and thatis there any other reason wantedwell then that the father would be much happier without owning the child    chapter xiv  there was a paupers burial that week in raveloe and up kench yard at batherley it was known that the darkhaired woman with the fair child who had lately come to lodge there was gone away again that was all the express note taken that molly had disappeared from the eyes of men but the unwept death which to the general lot seemed as trivial as the summershed leaf was charged with the force of destiny to certain human lives that we know of shaping their joys and sorrows even to the end  silas marners determination to keep the tramps child was matter of hardly less surprise and iterated talk in the village than the robbery of his money  that softening of feeling towards him which dated from his misfortune that merging of suspicion and dislike in a rather contemptuous pity for him as lone and crazy was now accompanied with a more active sympathy especially amongst the women  notable mothers who knew what it was to keep children whole and sweet lazy mothers who knew what it was to be interrupted in folding their arms and scratching their elbows by the mischievous propensities of children just firm on their legs were equally interested in conjecturing how a lone man would manage with a twoyearold child on his hands and were equally ready with their suggestions the notable chiefly telling him what he had better do and the lazy ones being emphatic in telling him what he would never be able to do  among the notable mothers dolly winthrop was the one whose neighbourly offices were the most acceptable to marner for they were rendered without any show of bustling instruction  silas had shown her the halfguinea given to him by godfrey and had asked her what he should do about getting some clothes for the child  eh master marner said dolly theres no call to buy no more nor a pair o shoes for ive got the little petticoats as aaron wore five years ago and its ill spending the money on them babyclothes for the child ull grow like grass i may bless itthat it will  and the same day dolly brought her bundle and displayed to marner one by one the tiny garments in their due order of succession most of them patched and darned but clean and neat as freshsprung herbs this was the introduction to a great ceremony with soap and water from which baby came out in new beauty and sat on dollys knee handling her toes and chuckling and patting her palms together with an air of having made several discoveries about herself which she communicated by alternate sounds of gugguggug and mammy  the mammy was not a cry of need or uneasiness baby had been used to utter it without expecting either tender sound or touch to follow  anybody ud think the angils in heaven couldnt be prettier said dolly rubbing the golden curls and kissing them  and to think of its being covered wi them dirty ragsand the poor motherfroze to death but theres them as took care of it and brought it to your door master marner  the door was open and it walked in over the snow like as if it had been a little starved robin  didnt you say the door was open  yes said silas meditatively  yesthe door was open  the moneys gone i dont know where and this is come from i dont know where  he had not mentioned to any one his unconsciousness of the childs entrance shrinking from questions which might lead to the fact he himself suspectednamely that he had been in one of his trances  ah said dolly with soothing gravity its like the night and the morning and the sleeping and the waking and the rain and the harvestone goes and the other comes and we know nothing how nor where  we may strive and scrat and fend but its little we can do arter allthe big things come and go wi no striving o ournthey do that they do and i think youre in the right on it to keep the little un master marner seeing as its been sent to you though theres folks as thinks different  youll happen be a bit moithered with it while its so little but ill come and welcome and see to it for you ive a bit o time to spare most days for when one gets up betimes i the morning the clock seems to stan still towrt ten afore its time to go about the victual  so as i say ill come and see to the child for you and welcome  thank you kindly said silas hesitating a little  ill be glad if youll tell me things  but he added uneasily leaning forward to look at baby with some jealousy as she was resting her head backward against dollys arm and eyeing him contentedly from a distancebut i want to do things for it myself else it may get fond o somebody else and not fond o me  ive been used to fending for myself in the housei can learn i can learn  eh to be sure said dolly gently  ive seen men as are wonderful handy wi children  the men are awkard and contrairy mostly god help embut when the drinks out of em they arent unsensible though theyre bad for leeching and bandagingso fiery and unpatient  you see this goes first next the skin proceeded dolly taking up the little shirt and putting it on  yes said marner docilely bringing his eyes very close that they might be initiated in the mysteries whereupon baby seized his head with both her small arms and put her lips against his face with purring noises  see there said dolly with a womans tender tact shes fondest o you  she wants to go o your lap ill be bound  go then take her master marner you can put the things on and then you can say as youve done for her from the first of her coming to you  marner took her on his lap trembling with an emotion mysterious to himself at something unknown dawning on his life  thought and feeling were so confused within him that if he had tried to give them utterance he could only have said that the child was come instead of the goldthat the gold had turned into the child  he took the garments from dolly and put them on under her teaching interrupted of course by babys gymnastics  there then  why you take to it quite easy master marner said dolly but what shall you do when youre forced to sit in your loom for shell get busier and mischievouser every dayshe will bless her its lucky as youve got that high hearth istead of a grate for that keeps the fire more out of her reach but if youve got anything as can be spilt or broke or as is fit to cut her fingers off shell be at itand it is but right you should know  silas meditated a little while in some perplexity  ill tie her to the leg o the loom he said at lasttie her with a good long strip o something  well mayhap thatll do as its a little gell for theyre easier persuaded to sit i one place nor the lads  i know what the lads are for ive had fourfour ive had god knowsand if you was to take and tie em up theyd make a fighting and a crying as if you was ringing the pigs  but ill bring you my little chair and some bits o red rag and things for her to play wi an shell sit and chatter to em as if they was alive  eh if it wasnt a sin to the lads to wish em made different bless em i should ha been glad for one of em to be a little gell and to think as i could ha taught her to scour and mend and the knitting and everything but i can teach em this little un master marner when she gets old enough  but shell be my little un said marner rather hastily shell be nobody elses  no to be sure youll have a right to her if youre a father to her and bring her up according  but added dolly coming to a point which she had determined beforehand to touch upon you must bring her up like christened folkss children and take her to church and let her learn her catechise as my little aaron can say offthe i believe and everything and hurt nobody by word or deedas well as if he was the clerk  thats what you must do master marner if youd do the right thing by the orphin child  marners pale face flushed suddenly under a new anxiety  his mind was too busy trying to give some definite bearing to dollys words for him to think of answering her  and its my belief she went on as the poor little creatur has never been christened and its nothing but right as the parson should be spoke to and if you was noways unwilling id talk to mr macey about it this very day  for if the child ever went anyways wrong and you hadnt done your part by it master marnernoculation and everything to save it from harmit ud be a thorn i your bed for ever o this side the grave and i cant think as it ud be easy lying down for anybody when theyd got to another world if they hadnt done their part by the helpless children as come wiout their own asking  dolly herself was disposed to be silent for some time now for she had spoken from the depths of her own simple belief and was much concerned to know whether her words would produce the desired effect on silas he was puzzled and anxious for dollys word christened conveyed no distinct meaning to him  he had only heard of baptism and had only seen the baptism of grownup men and women  what is it as you mean by christened  he said at last timidly wont folks be good to her without it  dear dear  master marner said dolly with gentle distress and compassion  had you never no father nor mother as taught you to say your prayers and as theres good words and good things to keep us from harm  yes said silas in a low voice i know a deal about thatused to used to  but your ways are different my country was a good way off he paused a few moments and then added more decidedly but i want to do everything as can be done for the child  and whatevers right for it i this country and you think ull do it good ill act according if youll tell me  well then master marner said dolly inwardly rejoiced ill ask mr macey to speak to the parson about it and you must fix on a name for it because it must have a name giv it when its christened  my mothers name was hephzibah said silas and my little sister was named after her  eh thats a hard name said dolly  i partly think it isnt a christened name  its a bible name said silas old ideas recurring  then ive no call to speak again it said dolly rather startled by silass knowledge on this head but you see im no scholard and im slow at catching the words  my husband says im allays like as if i was putting the haft for the handlethats what he saysfor hes very sharp god help him  but it was awkard calling your little sister by such a hard name when youd got nothing big to say likewasnt it master marner  we called her eppie said silas  well if it was noways wrong to shorten the name it ud be a deal handier  and so ill go now master marner and ill speak about the christening afore dark and i wish you the best o luck and its my belief as itll come to you if you do whats right by the orphin childand theres the noculation to be seen to and as to washing its bits o things you need look to nobody but me for i can do em wi one hand when ive got my suds about  eh the blessed angil youll let me bring my aaron one o these days and hell show her his little cart as his fathers made for him and the blackandwhite pup as hes got arearing  baby was christened the rector deciding that a double baptism was the lesser risk to incur and on this occasion silas making himself as clean and tidy as he could appeared for the first time within the church and shared in the observances held sacred by his neighbours he was quite unable by means of anything he heard or saw to identify the raveloe religion with his old faith if he could at any time in his previous life have done so it must have been by the aid of a strong feeling ready to vibrate with sympathy rather than by a comparison of phrases and ideas and now for long years that feeling had been dormant  he had no distinct idea about the baptism and the churchgoing except that dolly had said it was for the good of the child and in this way as the weeks grew to months the child created fresh and fresh links between his life and the lives from which he had hitherto shrunk continually into narrower isolation  unlike the gold which needed nothing and must be worshipped in closelocked solitudewhich was hidden away from the daylight was deaf to the song of birds and started to no human toneseppie was a creature of endless claims and evergrowing desires seeking and loving sunshine and living sounds and living movements making trial of everything with trust in new joy and stirring the human kindness in all eyes that looked on her  the gold had kept his thoughts in an everrepeated circle leading to nothing beyond itself but eppie was an object compacted of changes and hopes that forced his thoughts onward and carried them far away from their old eager pacing towards the same blank limitcarried them away to the new things that would come with the coming years when eppie would have learned to understand how her father silas cared for her and made him look for images of that time in the ties and charities that bound together the families of his neighbours the gold had asked that he should sit weaving longer and longer deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web but eppie called him away from his weaving and made him think all its pauses a holiday reawakening his senses with her fresh life even to the old winterflies that came crawling forth in the early spring sunshine and warming him into joy because she had joy  and when the sunshine grew strong and lasting so that the buttercups were thick in the meadows silas might be seen in the sunny midday or in the late afternoon when the shadows were lengthening under the hedgerows strolling out with uncovered head to carry eppie beyond the stonepits to where the flowers grew till they reached some favourite bank where he could sit down while eppie toddled to pluck the flowers and make remarks to the winged things that murmured happily above the bright petals calling daddads attention continually by bringing him the flowers then she would turn her ear to some sudden birdnote and silas learned to please her by making signs of hushed stillness that they might listen for the note to come again so that when it came she set up her small back and laughed with gurgling triumph sitting on the banks in this way silas began to look for the once familiar herbs again and as the leaves with their unchanged outline and markings lay on his palm there was a sense of crowding remembrances from which he turned away timidly taking refuge in eppies little world that lay lightly on his enfeebled spirit  as the childs mind was growing into knowledge his mind was growing into memory as her life unfolded his soul long stupefied in a cold narrow prison was unfolding too and trembling gradually into full consciousness  it was an influence which must gather force with every new year the tones that stirred silass heart grew articulate and called for more distinct answers shapes and sounds grew clearer for eppies eyes and ears and there was more that daddad was imperatively required to notice and account for  also by the time eppie was three years old she developed a fine capacity for mischief and for devising ingenious ways of being troublesome which found much exercise not only for silass patience but for his watchfulness and penetration  sorely was poor silas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible demands of love  dolly winthrop told him that punishment was good for eppie and that as for rearing a child without making it tingle a little in soft and safe places now and then it was not to be done  to be sure theres another thing you might do master marner added dolly meditatively you might shut her up once i the coalhole that was what i did wi aaron for i was that silly wi the youngest lad as i could never bear to smack him  not as i could find i my heart to let him stay i the coalhole more nor a minute but it was enough to colly him all over so as he must be new washed and dressed and it was as good as a rod to himthat was  but i put it upo your conscience master marner as theres one of em you must chooseayther smacking or the coalholeelse shell get so masterful therell be no holding her  silas was impressed with the melancholy truth of this last remark but his force of mind failed before the only two penal methods open to him not only because it was painful to him to hurt eppie but because he trembled at a moments contention with her lest she should love him the less for it  let even an affectionate goliath get himself tied to a small tender thing dreading to hurt it by pulling and dreading still more to snap the cord and which of the two pray will be master  it was clear that eppie with her short toddling steps must lead father silas a pretty dance on any fine morning when circumstances favoured mischief  for example  he had wisely chosen a broad strip of linen as a means of fastening her to his loom when he was busy it made a broad belt round her waist and was long enough to allow of her reaching the trucklebed and sitting down on it but not long enough for her to attempt any dangerous climbing  one bright summers morning silas had been more engrossed than usual in setting up a new piece of work an occasion on which his scissors were in requisition  these scissors owing to an especial warning of dollys had been kept carefully out of eppies reach but the click of them had had a peculiar attraction for her ear and watching the results of that click she had derived the philosophic lesson that the same cause would produce the same effect  silas had seated himself in his loom and the noise of weaving had begun but he had left his scissors on a ledge which eppies arm was long enough to reach and now like a small mouse watching her opportunity she stole quietly from her corner secured the scissors and toddled to the bed again setting up her back as a mode of concealing the fact  she had a distinct intention as to the use of the scissors and having cut the linen strip in a jagged but effectual manner in two moments she had run out at the open door where the sunshine was inviting her while poor silas believed her to be a better child than usual  it was not until he happened to need his scissors that the terrible fact burst upon him eppie had run out by herselfhad perhaps fallen into the stonepit  silas shaken by the worst fear that could have befallen him rushed out calling eppie  and ran eagerly about the unenclosed space exploring the dry cavities into which she might have fallen and then gazing with questioning dread at the smooth red surface of the water  the cold drops stood on his brow how long had she been out there was one hopethat she had crept through the stile and got into the fields where he habitually took her to stroll  but the grass was high in the meadow and there was no descrying her if she were there except by a close search that would be a trespass on mr osgoods crop still that misdemeanour must be committed and poor silas after peering all round the hedgerows traversed the grass beginning with perturbed vision to see eppie behind every group of red sorrel and to see her moving always farther off as he approached  the meadow was searched in vain and he got over the stile into the next field looking with dying hope towards a small pond which was now reduced to its summer shallowness so as to leave a wide margin of good adhesive mud here however sat eppie discoursing cheerfully to her own small boot which she was using as a bucket to convey the water into a deep hoofmark while her little naked foot was planted comfortably on a cushion of olivegreen mud  a redheaded calf was observing her with alarmed doubt through the opposite hedge  here was clearly a case of aberration in a christened child which demanded severe treatment but silas overcome with convulsive joy at finding his treasure again could do nothing but snatch her up and cover her with halfsobbing kisses  it was not until he had carried her home and had begun to think of the necessary washing that he recollected the need that he should punish eppie and make her remember  the idea that she might run away again and come to harm gave him unusual resolution and for the first time he determined to try the coalholea small closet near the hearth  naughty naughty eppie he suddenly began holding her on his knee and pointing to her muddy feet and clothesnaughty to cut with the scissors and run away  eppie must go into the coalhole for being naughty  daddy must put her in the coalhole  he halfexpected that this would be shock enough and that eppie would begin to cry  but instead of that she began to shake herself on his knee as if the proposition opened a pleasing novelty seeing that he must proceed to extremities he put her into the coalhole and held the door closed with a trembling sense that he was using a strong measure  for a moment there was silence but then came a little cry opy opy  and silas let her out again saying now eppie ull never be naughty again else she must go in the coalholea black naughty place  the weaving must stand still a long while this morning for now eppie must be washed and have clean clothes on but it was to be hoped that this punishment would have a lasting effect and save time in futurethough perhaps it would have been better if eppie had cried more  in half an hour she was clean again and silas having turned his back to see what he could do with the linen band threw it down again with the reflection that eppie would be good without fastening for the rest of the morning  he turned round again and was going to place her in her little chair near the loom when she peeped out at him with black face and hands again and said eppie in de toalhole  this total failure of the coalhole discipline shook silass belief in the efficacy of punishment  shed take it all for fun he observed to dolly if i didnt hurt her and that i cant do mrs winthrop if she makes me a bit o trouble i can bear it and shes got no tricks but what shell grow out of  well thats partly true master marner said dolly sympathetically and if you cant bring your mind to frighten her off touching things you must do what you can to keep em out of her way  thats what i do wi the pups as the lads are allays arearing  they will worry and gnawworry and gnaw they will if it was ones sunday cap as hung anywhere so as they could drag it  they know no difference god help em its the pushing o the teeth as sets em on thats what it is  so eppie was reared without punishment the burden of her misdeeds being borne vicariously by father silas  the stone hut was made a soft nest for her lined with downy patience and also in the world that lay beyond the stone hut she knew nothing of frowns and denials  notwithstanding the difficulty of carrying her and his yarn or linen at the same time silas took her with him in most of his journeys to the farmhouses unwilling to leave her behind at dolly winthrops who was always ready to take care of her and little curlyheaded eppie the weavers child became an object of interest at several outlying homesteads as well as in the village  hitherto he had been treated very much as if he had been a useful gnome or browniea queer and unaccountable creature who must necessarily be looked at with wondering curiosity and repulsion and with whom one would be glad to make all greetings and bargains as brief as possible but who must be dealt with in a propitiatory way and occasionally have a present of pork or garden stuff to carry home with him seeing that without him there was no getting the yarn woven  but now silas met with open smiling faces and cheerful questioning as a person whose satisfactions and difficulties could be understood  everywhere he must sit a little and talk about the child and words of interest were always ready for him ah master marner youll be lucky if she takes the measles soon and easyor why there isnt many lone men ud ha been wishing to take up with a little un like that but i reckon the weaving makes you handier than men as do outdoor workyoure partly as handy as a woman for weaving comes next to spinning  elderly masters and mistresses seated observantly in large kitchen armchairs shook their heads over the difficulties attendant on rearing children felt eppies round arms and legs and pronounced them remarkably firm and told silas that if she turned out well which however there was no telling it would be a fine thing for him to have a steady lass to do for him when he got helpless  servant maidens were fond of carrying her out to look at the hens and chickens or to see if any cherries could be shaken down in the orchard and the small boys and girls approached her slowly with cautious movement and steady gaze like little dogs face to face with one of their own kind till attraction had reached the point at which the soft lips were put out for a kiss no child was afraid of approaching silas when eppie was near him there was no repulsion around him now either for young or old for the little child had come to link him once more with the whole world there was love between him and the child that blent them into one and there was love between the child and the worldfrom men and women with parental looks and tones to the red ladybirds and the round pebbles  silas began now to think of raveloe life entirely in relation to eppie she must have everything that was a good in raveloe and he listened docilely that he might come to understand better what this life was from which for fifteen years he had stood aloof as from a strange thing with which he could have no communion as some man who has a precious plant to which he would give a nurturing home in a new soil thinks of the rain and the sunshine and all influences in relation to his nursling and asks industriously for all knowledge that will help him to satisfy the wants of the searching roots or to guard leaf and bud from invading harm  the disposition to hoard had been utterly crushed at the very first by the loss of his longstored gold the coins he earned afterwards seemed as irrelevant as stones brought to complete a house suddenly buried by an earthquake the sense of bereavement was too heavy upon him for the old thrill of satisfaction to arise again at the touch of the newlyearned coin  and now something had come to replace his hoard which gave a growing purpose to the earnings drawing his hope and joy continually onward beyond the money  in old days there were angels who came and took men by the hand and led them away from the city of destruction  we see no whitewinged angels now  but yet men are led away from threatening destruction a hand is put into theirs which leads them forth gently towards a calm and bright land so that they look no more backward and the hand may be a little childs    chapter xv  there was one person as you will believe who watched with keener though more hidden interest than any other the prosperous growth of eppie under the weavers care  he dared not do anything that would imply a stronger interest in a poor mans adopted child than could be expected from the kindliness of the young squire when a chance meeting suggested a little present to a simple old fellow whom others noticed with goodwill but he told himself that the time would come when he might do something towards furthering the welfare of his daughter without incurring suspicion  was he very uneasy in the meantime at his inability to give his daughter her birthright i cannot say that he was  the child was being taken care of and would very likely be happy as people in humble stations often werehappier perhaps than those brought up in luxury  that famous ring that pricked its owner when he forgot duty and followed desirei wonder if it pricked very hard when he set out on the chase or whether it pricked but lightly then and only pierced to the quick when the chase had long been ended and hope folding her wings looked backward and became regret  godfrey casss cheek and eye were brighter than ever now  he was so undivided in his aims that he seemed like a man of firmness  no dunsey had come back people had made up their minds that he was gone for a soldier or gone out of the country and no one cared to be specific in their inquiries on a subject delicate to a respectable family  godfrey had ceased to see the shadow of dunsey across his path and the path now lay straight forward to the accomplishment of his best longestcherished wishes  everybody said mr godfrey had taken the right turn and it was pretty clear what would be the end of things for there were not many days in the week that he was not seen riding to the warrens  godfrey himself when he was asked jocosely if the day had been fixed smiled with the pleasant consciousness of a lover who could say yes if he liked  he felt a reformed man delivered from temptation and the vision of his future life seemed to him as a promised land for which he had no cause to fight  he saw himself with all his happiness centred on his own hearth while nancy would smile on him as he played with the children  and that other childnot on the hearthhe would not forget it he would see that it was well provided for  that was a fathers duty     part two    chapter xvi  it was a bright autumn sunday sixteen years after silas marner had found his new treasure on the hearth  the bells of the old raveloe church were ringing the cheerful peal which told that the morning service was ended and out of the arched doorway in the tower came slowly retarded by friendly greetings and questions the richer parishioners who had chosen this bright sunday morning as eligible for churchgoing  it was the rural fashion of that time for the more important members of the congregation to depart first while their humbler neighbours waited and looked on stroking their bent heads or dropping their curtsies to any large ratepayer who turned to notice them  foremost among these advancing groups of wellclad people there are some whom we shall recognize in spite of time who has laid his hand on them all  the tall blond man of forty is not much changed in feature from the godfrey cass of sixandtwenty he is only fuller in flesh and has only lost the indefinable look of youtha loss which is marked even when the eye is undulled and the wrinkles are not yet come perhaps the pretty woman not much younger than he who is leaning on his arm is more changed than her husband the lovely bloom that used to be always on her cheek now comes but fitfully with the fresh morning air or with some strong surprise yet to all who love human faces best for what they tell of human experience nancys beauty has a heightened interest  often the soul is ripened into fuller goodness while age has spread an ugly film so that mere glances can never divine the preciousness of the fruit  but the years have not been so cruel to nancy  the firm yet placid mouth the clear veracious glance of the brown eyes speak now of a nature that has been tested and has kept its highest qualities and even the costume with its dainty neatness and purity has more significance now the coquetries of youth can have nothing to do with it  mr and mrs godfrey cass any higher title has died away from raveloe lips since the old squire was gathered to his fathers and his inheritance was divided have turned round to look for the tall aged man and the plainly dressed woman who are a little behindnancy having observed that they must wait for father and priscillaand now they all turn into a narrower path leading across the churchyard to a small gate opposite the red house  we will not follow them now for may there not be some others in this departing congregation whom we should like to see againsome of those who are not likely to be handsomely clad and whom we may not recognize so easily as the master and mistress of the red house  but it is impossible to mistake silas marner  his large brown eyes seem to have gathered a longer vision as is the way with eyes that have been shortsighted in early life and they have a less vague a more answering gaze but in everything else one sees signs of a frame much enfeebled by the lapse of the sixteen years  the weavers bent shoulders and white hair give him almost the look of advanced age though he is not more than fiveandfifty but there is the freshest blossom of youth close by his sidea blonde dimpled girl of eighteen who has vainly tried to chastise her curly auburn hair into smoothness under her brown bonnet the hair ripples as obstinately as a brooklet under the march breeze and the little ringlets burst away from the restraining comb behind and show themselves below the bonnetcrown eppie cannot help being rather vexed about her hair for there is no other girl in raveloe who has hair at all like it and she thinks hair ought to be smooth  she does not like to be blameworthy even in small things you see how neatly her prayerbook is folded in her spotted handkerchief  that goodlooking young fellow in a new fustian suit who walks behind her is not quite sure upon the question of hair in the abstract when eppie puts it to him and thinks that perhaps straight hair is the best in general but he doesnt want eppies hair to be different  she surely divines that there is some one behind her who is thinking about her very particularly and mustering courage to come to her side as soon as they are out in the lane else why should she look rather shy and take care not to turn away her head from her father silas to whom she keeps murmuring little sentences as to who was at church and who was not at church and how pretty the red mountainash is over the rectory wall  i wish we had a little garden father with double daisies in like mrs winthrops said eppie when they were out in the lane only they say it ud take a deal of digging and bringing fresh soiland you couldnt do that could you father  anyhow i shouldnt like you to do it for it ud be too hard work for you  yes i could do it child if you want a bit o garden these long evenings i could work at taking in a little bit o the waste just enough for a root or two o flowers for you and again i the morning i could have a turn wi the spade before i sat down to the loom  why didnt you tell me before as you wanted a bit o garden  i can dig it for you master marner said the young man in fustian who was now by eppies side entering into the conversation without the trouble of formalities  itll be play to me after ive done my days work or any odd bits o time when the works slack  and ill bring you some soil from mr casss gardenhell let me and willing  eh aaron my lad are you there  said silas i wasnt aware of you for when eppies talking o things i see nothing but what shes asaying  well if you could help me with the digging we might get her a bit o garden all the sooner  then if you think well and good said aaron ill come to the stonepits this afternoon and well settle what lands to be taken in and ill get up an hour earlier i the morning and begin on it  but not if you dont promise me not to work at the hard digging father said eppie  for i shouldnt ha said anything about it she added halfbashfully halfroguishly only mrs winthrop said as aaron ud be so good and  and you might ha known it without mother telling you said aaron and master marner knows too i hope as im able and willing to do a turn o work for him and he wont do me the unkindness to anyways take it out o my hands  there now father you wont work in it till its all easy said eppie and you and me can mark out the beds and make holes and plant the roots  itll be a deal livelier at the stonepits when weve got some flowers for i always think the flowers can see us and know what were talking about  and ill have a bit o rosemary and bergamot and thyme because theyre so sweetsmelling but theres no lavender only in the gentlefolks gardens i think  thats no reason why you shouldnt have some said aaron for i can bring you slips of anything im forced to cut no end of em when im gardening and throw em away mostly  theres a big bed o lavender at the red house the missis is very fond of it  well said silas gravely so as you dont make free for us or ask for anything as is worth much at the red house for mr casss been so good to us and built us up the new end o the cottage and given us beds and things as i couldnt abide to be imposin for gardenstuff or anything else  no no theres no imposin said aaron theres never a garden in all the parish but what theres endless waste in it for want o somebody as could use everything up  its what i think to myself sometimes as there need nobody run short o victuals if the land was made the most on and there was never a morsel but what could find its way to a mouth  it sets one thinking o thatgardening does  but i must go back now else mother ull be in trouble as i arent there  bring her with you this afternoon aaron said eppie i shouldnt like to fix about the garden and her not know everything from the firstshould you father  aye bring her if you can aaron said silas shes sure to have a word to say asll help us to set things on their right end  aaron turned back up the village while silas and eppie went on up the lonely sheltered lane  o daddy  she began when they were in privacy clasping and squeezing silass arm and skipping round to give him an energetic kiss  my little old daddy  im so glad  i dont think i shall want anything else when weve got a little garden and i knew aaron would dig it for us she went on with roguish triumphi knew that very well  youre a deep little puss you are said silas with the mild passive happiness of lovecrowned age in his face but youll make yourself fine and beholden to aaron  oh no i shant said eppie laughing and frisking he likes it  come come let me carry your prayerbook else youll be dropping it jumping i that way  eppie was now aware that her behaviour was under observation but it was only the observation of a friendly donkey browsing with a log fastened to his foota meek donkey not scornfully critical of human trivialities but thankful to share in them if possible by getting his nose scratched and eppie did not fail to gratify him with her usual notice though it was attended with the inconvenience of his following them painfully up to the very door of their home  but the sound of a sharp bark inside as eppie put the key in the door modified the donkeys views and he limped away again without bidding the sharp bark was the sign of an excited welcome that was awaiting them from a knowing brown terrier who after dancing at their legs in a hysterical manner rushed with a worrying noise at a tortoiseshell kitten under the loom and then rushed back with a sharp bark again as much as to say i have done my duty by this feeble creature you perceive while the ladymother of the kitten sat sunning her white bosom in the window and looked round with a sleepy air of expecting caresses though she was not going to take any trouble for them  the presence of this happy animal life was not the only change which had come over the interior of the stone cottage  there was no bed now in the livingroom and the small space was well filled with decent furniture all bright and clean enough to satisfy dolly winthrops eye the oaken table and threecornered oaken chair were hardly what was likely to be seen in so poor a cottage they had come with the beds and other things from the red house for mr godfrey cass as every one said in the village did very kindly by the weaver and it was nothing but right a man should be looked on and helped by those who could afford it when he had brought up an orphan child and been father and mother to herand had lost his money too so as he had nothing but what he worked for week by week and when the weaving was going down toofor there was less and less flax spunand master marner was none so young  nobody was jealous of the weaver for he was regarded as an exceptional person whose claims on neighbourly help were not to be matched in raveloe  any superstition that remained concerning him had taken an entirely new colour and mr macey now a very feeble old man of fourscore and six never seen except in his chimneycorner or sitting in the sunshine at his doorsill was of opinion that when a man had done what silas had done by an orphan child it was a sign that his money would come to light again or leastwise that the robber would be made to answer for itfor as mr macey observed of himself his faculties were as strong as ever  silas sat down now and watched eppie with a satisfied gaze as she spread the clean cloth and set on it the potatopie warmed up slowly in a safe sunday fashion by being put into a dry pot over a slowlydying fire as the best substitute for an oven  for silas would not consent to have a grate and oven added to his conveniences he loved the old brick hearth as he had loved his brown potand was it not there when he had found eppie  the gods of the hearth exist for us still and let all new faith be tolerant of that fetishism lest it bruise its own roots  silas ate his dinner more silently than usual soon laying down his knife and fork and watching halfabstractedly eppies play with snap and the cat by which her own dining was made rather a lengthy business  yet it was a sight that might well arrest wandering thoughts eppie with the rippling radiance of her hair and the whiteness of her rounded chin and throat set off by the darkblue cotton gown laughing merrily as the kitten held on with her four claws to one shoulder like a design for a jughandle while snap on the right hand and puss on the other put up their paws towards a morsel which she held out of the reach of bothsnap occasionally desisting in order to remonstrate with the cat by a cogent worrying growl on the greediness and futility of her conduct till eppie relented caressed them both and divided the morsel between them  but at last eppie glancing at the clock checked the play and said o daddy youre wanting to go into the sunshine to smoke your pipe but i must clear away first so as the house may be tidy when godmother comes  ill make hastei wont be long  silas had taken to smoking a pipe daily during the last two years having been strongly urged to it by the sages of raveloe as a practice good for the fits and this advice was sanctioned by dr kimble on the ground that it was as well to try what could do no harma principle which was made to answer for a great deal of work in that gentlemans medical practice  silas did not highly enjoy smoking and often wondered how his neighbours could be so fond of it but a humble sort of acquiescence in what was held to be good had become a strong habit of that new self which had been developed in him since he had found eppie on his hearth it had been the only clew his bewildered mind could hold by in cherishing this young life that had been sent to him out of the darkness into which his gold had departed  by seeking what was needful for eppie by sharing the effect that everything produced on her he had himself come to appropriate the forms of custom and belief which were the mould of raveloe life and as with reawakening sensibilities memory also reawakened he had begun to ponder over the elements of his old faith and blend them with his new impressions till he recovered a consciousness of unity between his past and present the sense of presiding goodness and the human trust which come with all pure peace and joy had given him a dim impression that there had been some error some mistake which had thrown that dark shadow over the days of his best years and as it grew more and more easy to him to open his mind to dolly winthrop he gradually communicated to her all he could describe of his early life  the communication was necessarily a slow and difficult process for silass meagre power of explanation was not aided by any readiness of interpretation in dolly whose narrow outward experience gave her no key to strange customs and made every novelty a source of wonder that arrested them at every step of the narrative  it was only by fragments and at intervals which left dolly time to revolve what she had heard till it acquired some familiarity for her that silas at last arrived at the climax of the sad storythe drawing of lots and its false testimony concerning him and this had to be repeated in several interviews under new questions on her part as to the nature of this plan for detecting the guilty and clearing the innocent  and yourns the same bible youre sure o that master marnerthe bible as you brought wi you from that countryits the same as what theyve got at church and what eppies alearning to read in  yes said silas every bit the same and theres drawing o lots in the bible mind you he added in a lower tone  oh dear dear said dolly in a grieved voice as if she were hearing an unfavourable report of a sick mans case  she was silent for some minutes at last she said  theres wise folks happen as know how it all is the parson knows ill be bound but it takes big words to tell them things and such as poor folks cant make much out on  i can never rightly know the meaning o what i hear at church only a bit here and there but i know its good wordsi do  but what lies upo your mindits this master marner as if them above had done the right thing by you theyd never ha let you be turned out for a wicked thief when you was innicent  ah  said silas who had now come to understand dollys phraseology that was what fell on me like as if it had been redhot iron because you see there was nobody as cared for me or clave to me above nor below  and him as id gone out and in wi for ten year and more since when we was lads and went halvesmine own familiar friend in whom i trusted had lifted up his heel again me and worked to ruin me  eh but he was a bad uni cant think as theres another such said dolly  but im oercome master marner im like as if id waked and didnt know whether it was night or morning i feel somehow as sure as i do when ive laid something up though i cant justly put my hand on it as there was a rights in what happened to you if one could but make it out and youd no call to lose heart as you did  but well talk on it again for sometimes things come into my head when im leeching or poulticing or such as i could never think on when i was sitting still  dolly was too useful a woman not to have many opportunities of illumination of the kind she alluded to and she was not long before she recurred to the subject  master marner she said one day that she came to bring home eppies washing ive been sore puzzled for a good bit wi that trouble o yourn and the drawing o lots and it got twisted backards and forards as i didnt know which end to lay hold on but it come to me all clear like that night when i was sitting up wi poor bessy fawkes as is dead and left her children behind god help emit come to me as clear as daylight but whether ive got hold on it now or can anyways bring it to my tongues end that i dont know  for ive often a deal inside me asll never come out and for what you talk o your folks in your old country niver saying prayers by heart nor saying em out of a book they must be wonderful cliver for if i didnt know our father and little bits o good words as i can carry out o church wi me i might down o my knees every night but nothing could i say  but you can mostly say something as i can make sense on mrs winthrop said silas  well then master marner it come to me summat like this i can make nothing o the drawing o lots and the answer coming wrong it ud mayhap take the parson to tell that and he could only tell us i big words  but what come to me as clear as the daylight it was when i was troubling over poor bessy fawkes and it allays comes into my head when im sorry for folks and feel as i cant do a power to help em not if i was to get up i the middle o the nightit comes into my head as them above has got a deal tenderer heart nor what ive gotfor i cant be anyways better nor them as made me and if anything looks hard to me its because theres things i dont know on and for the matter o that there may be plenty o things i dont know on for its little as i knowthat it is and so while i was thinking o that you come into my mind master marner and it all come pouring inif i felt i my inside what was the right and just thing by you and them as prayed and drawed the lots all but that wicked un if theyd ha done the right thing by you if they could isnt there them as was at the making on us and knows better and has a better will  and thats all as ever i can be sure on and everything else is a big puzzle to me when i think on it  for there was the fever come and took off them as were fullgrowed and left the helpless children and theres the breaking o limbs and them as ud do right and be sober have to suffer by them as are contrairyeh theres trouble i this world and theres things as we can niver make out the rights on and all as weve got to do is to trusten master marnerto do the right thing as fur as we know and to trusten  for if us as knows so little can see a bit o good and rights we may be sure as theres a good and a rights bigger nor what we can knowi feel it i my own inside as it must be so  and if you could but ha gone on trustening master marner you wouldnt ha run away from your fellowcreaturs and been so lone  ah but that ud ha been hard said silas in an undertone it ud ha been hard to trusten then  and so it would said dolly almost with compunction them things are easier said nor done and im partly ashamed o talking  nay nay said silas youre i the right mrs winthropyoure i the right  theres good i this worldive a feeling o that now and it makes a man feel as theres a good more nor he can see i spite o the trouble and the wickedness  that drawing o the lots is dark but the child was sent to me theres dealings with ustheres dealings  this dialogue took place in eppies earlier years when silas had to part with her for two hours every day that she might learn to read at the dame school after he had vainly tried himself to guide her in that first step to learning  now that she was grown up silas had often been led in those moments of quiet outpouring which come to people who live together in perfect love to talk with her too of the past and how and why he had lived a lonely man until she had been sent to him for it would have been impossible for him to hide from eppie that she was not his own child even if the most delicate reticence on the point could have been expected from raveloe gossips in her presence her own questions about her mother could not have been parried as she grew up without that complete shrouding of the past which would have made a painful barrier between their minds so eppie had long known how her mother had died on the snowy ground and how she herself had been found on the hearth by father silas who had taken her golden curls for his lost guineas brought back to him  the tender and peculiar love with which silas had reared her in almost inseparable companionship with himself aided by the seclusion of their dwelling had preserved her from the lowering influences of the village talk and habits and had kept her mind in that freshness which is sometimes falsely supposed to be an invariable attribute of rusticity  perfect love has a breath of poetry which can exalt the relations of the leastinstructed human beings and this breath of poetry had surrounded eppie from the time when she had followed the bright gleam that beckoned her to silass hearth so that it is not surprising if in other things besides her delicate prettiness she was not quite a common village maiden but had a touch of refinement and fervour which came from no other teaching than that of tenderlynurtured unvitiated feeling  she was too childish and simple for her imagination to rove into questions about her unknown father for a long while it did not even occur to her that she must have had a father and the first time that the idea of her mother having had a husband presented itself to her was when silas showed her the weddingring which had been taken from the wasted finger and had been carefully preserved by him in a little lackered box shaped like a shoe  he delivered this box into eppies charge when she had grown up and she often opened it to look at the ring but still she thought hardly at all about the father of whom it was the symbol  had she not a father very close to her who loved her better than any real fathers in the village seemed to love their daughters on the contrary who her mother was and how she came to die in that forlornness were questions that often pressed on eppies mind  her knowledge of mrs winthrop who was her nearest friend next to silas made her feel that a mother must be very precious and she had again and again asked silas to tell her how her mother looked whom she was like and how he had found her against the furze bush led towards it by the little footsteps and the outstretched arms  the furze bush was there still and this afternoon when eppie came out with silas into the sunshine it was the first object that arrested her eyes and thoughts  father she said in a tone of gentle gravity which sometimes came like a sadder slower cadence across her playfulness we shall take the furze bush into the garden itll come into the corner and just against it ill put snowdrops and crocuses cause aaron says they wont die out butll always get more and more  ah child said silas always ready to talk when he had his pipe in his hand apparently enjoying the pauses more than the puffs it wouldnt do to leave out the furze bush and theres nothing prettier to my thinking when its yallow with flowers  but its just come into my head what were to do for a fencemayhap aaron can help us to a thought but a fence we must have else the donkeys and things ull come and trample everything down  and fencings hard to be got at by what i can make out  oh ill tell you daddy said eppie clasping her hands suddenly after a minutes thought  theres lots o loose stones about some of em not big and we might lay em atop of one another and make a wall you and me could carry the smallest and aaron ud carry the resti know he would  eh my precious un said silas there isnt enough stones to go all round and as for you carrying why wi your little arms you couldnt carry a stone no bigger than a turnip  youre dillicate made my dear he added with a tender intonationthats what mrs winthrop says  oh im stronger than you think daddy said eppie and if there wasnt stones enough to go all round why theyll go part o the way and then itll be easier to get sticks and things for the rest  see here round the big pit what a many stones  she skipped forward to the pit meaning to lift one of the stones and exhibit her strength but she started back in surprise  oh father just come and look here she exclaimedcome and see how the waters gone down since yesterday  why yesterday the pit was ever so full  well to be sure said silas coming to her side  why thats the draining theyve begun on since harvest i mr osgoods fields i reckon  the foreman said to me the other day when i passed by em master marner he said i shouldnt wonder if we lay your bit o waste as dry as a bone  it was mr godfrey cass he said had gone into the draining hed been taking these fields o mr osgood  how odd itll seem to have the old pit dried up  said eppie turning away and stooping to lift rather a large stone  see daddy i can carry this quite well she said going along with much energy for a few steps but presently letting it fall  ah youre fine and strong arent you  said silas while eppie shook her aching arms and laughed  come come let us go and sit down on the bank against the stile there and have no more lifting you might hurt yourself child  youd need have somebody to work for youand my arm isnt over strong  silas uttered the last sentence slowly as if it implied more than met the ear and eppie when they sat down on the bank nestled close to his side and taking hold caressingly of the arm that was not over strong held it on her lap while silas puffed again dutifully at the pipe which occupied his other arm  an ash in the hedgerow behind made a fretted screen from the sun and threw happy playful shadows all about them  father said eppie very gently after they had been sitting in silence a little while if i was to be married ought i to be married with my mothers ring  silas gave an almost imperceptible start though the question fell in with the undercurrent of thought in his own mind and then said in a subdued tone why eppie have you been athinking on it  only this last week father said eppie ingenuously since aaron talked to me about it  and what did he say  said silas still in the same subdued way as if he were anxious lest he should fall into the slightest tone that was not for eppies good  he said he should like to be married because he was agoing in fourandtwenty and had got a deal of gardening work now mr motts given up and he goes twice aweek regular to mr casss and once to mr osgoods and theyre going to take him on at the rectory  and who is it as hes wanting to marry  said silas with rather a sad smile  why me to be sure daddy said eppie with dimpling laughter kissing her fathers cheek as if hed want to marry anybody else  and you mean to have him do you  said silas  yes some time said eppie i dont know when  everybodys married some time aaron says  but i told him that wasnt true for i said look at fatherhes never been married  no child said silas your father was a lone man till you was sent to him  but youll never be lone again father said eppie tenderly that was what aaron saidi could never think o taking you away from master marner eppie  and i said it ud be no use if you did aaron  and he wants us all to live together so as you neednt work a bit father only whats for your own pleasure and hed be as good as a son to youthat was what he said  and should you like that eppie  said silas looking at her  i shouldnt mind it father said eppie quite simply  and i should like things to be so as you neednt work much  but if it wasnt for that id sooner things didnt change  im very happy i like aaron to be fond of me and come and see us often and behave pretty to youhe always does behave pretty to you doesnt he father  yes child nobody could behave better said silas emphatically hes his mothers lad  but i dont want any change said eppie  i should like to go on a long long while just as we are  only aaron does want a change and he made me cry a bitonly a bitbecause he said i didnt care for him for if i cared for him i should want us to be married as he did  eh my blessed child said silas laying down his pipe as if it were useless to pretend to smoke any longer youre oer young to be married  well ask mrs winthropwell ask aarons mother what she thinks if theres a right thing to do shell come at it  but theres this to be thought on eppie things will change whether we like it or no things wont go on for a long while just as they are and no difference  i shall get older and helplesser and be a burden on you belike if i dont go away from you altogether  not as i mean youd think me a burdeni know you wouldntbut it ud be hard upon you and when i look forard to that i like to think as youd have somebody else besides mesomebody young and strong asll outlast your own life and take care on you to the end  silas paused and resting his wrists on his knees lifted his hands up and down meditatively as he looked on the ground  then would you like me to be married father  said eppie with a little trembling in her voice  ill not be the man to say no eppie said silas emphatically but well ask your godmother  shell wish the right thing by you and her son too  there they come then said eppie  let us go and meet em oh the pipe  wont you have it lit again father  said eppie lifting that medicinal appliance from the ground  nay child said silas ive done enough for today  i think mayhap a little of it does me more good than so much at once    chapter xvii  while silas and eppie were seated on the bank discoursing in the fleckered shade of the ash tree miss priscilla lammeter was resisting her sisters arguments that it would be better to take tea at the red house and let her father have a long nap than drive home to the warrens so soon after dinner  the family party of four only were seated round the table in the dark wainscoted parlour with the sunday dessert before them of fresh filberts apples and pears duly ornamented with leaves by nancys own hand before the bells had rung for church  a great change has come over the dark wainscoted parlour since we saw it in godfreys bachelor days and under the wifeless reign of the old squire  now all is polish on which no yesterdays dust is ever allowed to rest from the yards width of oaken boards round the carpet to the old squires gun and whips and walkingsticks ranged on the stags antlers above the mantelpiece  all other signs of sporting and outdoor occupation nancy has removed to another room but she has brought into the red house the habit of filial reverence and preserves sacredly in a place of honour these relics of her husbands departed father  the tankards are on the sidetable still but the bossed silver is undimmed by handling and there are no dregs to send forth unpleasant suggestions the only prevailing scent is of the lavender and roseleaves that fill the vases of derbyshire spar  all is purity and order in this once dreary room for fifteen years ago it was entered by a new presiding spirit  now father said nancy is there any call for you to go home to tea  maynt you just as well stay with ussuch a beautiful evening as its likely to be  the old gentleman had been talking with godfrey about the increasing poorrate and the ruinous times and had not heard the dialogue between his daughters  my dear you must ask priscilla he said in the once firm voice now become rather broken  she manages me and the farm too  and reason good as i should manage you father said priscilla else youd be giving yourself your death with rheumatism  and as for the farm if anything turns out wrong as it cant but do in these times theres nothing kills a man so soon as having nobody to find fault with but himself  its a deal the best way o being master to let somebody else do the ordering and keep the blaming in your own hands  it ud save many a man a stroke i believe  well well my dear said her father with a quiet laugh i didnt say you dont manage for everybodys good  then manage so as you may stay tea priscilla said nancy putting her hand on her sisters arm affectionately  come now and well go round the garden while father has his nap  my dear child hell have a beautiful nap in the gig for i shall drive  and as for staying tea i cant hear of it for theres this dairymaid now she knows shes to be married turned michaelmas shed as lief pour the new milk into the pigtrough as into the pans  thats the way with em all its as if they thought the world ud be newmade because theyre to be married  so come and let me put my bonnet on and therell be time for us to walk round the garden while the horse is being put in  when the sisters were treading the neatlyswept gardenwalks between the bright turf that contrasted pleasantly with the dark cones and arches and walllike hedges of yew priscilla said  im as glad as anything at your husbands making that exchange o land with cousin osgood and beginning the dairying  its a thousand pities you didnt do it before for itll give you something to fill your mind  theres nothing like a dairy if folks want a bit o worrit to make the days pass  for as for rubbing furniture when you can once see your face in a table theres nothing else to look for but theres always something fresh with the dairy for even in the depths o winter theres some pleasure in conquering the butter and making it come whether or no  my dear added priscilla pressing her sisters hand affectionately as they walked side by side youll never be low when youve got a dairy  ah priscilla said nancy returning the pressure with a grateful glance of her clear eyes but it wont make up to godfrey a dairys not so much to a man  and its only what he cares for that ever makes me low  im contented with the blessings we have if he could be contented  it drives me past patience said priscilla impetuously that way o the menalways wanting and wanting and never easy with what theyve got they cant sit comfortable in their chairs when theyve neither ache nor pain but either they must stick a pipe in their mouths to make em better than well or else they must be swallowing something strong though theyre forced to make haste before the next meal comes in  but joyful be it spoken our father was never that sort o man and if it had pleased god to make you ugly like me so as the men wouldnt ha run after you we might have kept to our own family and had nothing to do with folks as have got uneasy blood in their veins  oh dont say so priscilla said nancy repenting that she had called forth this outburst nobody has any occasion to find fault with godfrey  its natural he should be disappointed at not having any children every man likes to have somebody to work for and lay by for and he always counted so on making a fuss with em when they were little  theres many another man ud hanker more than he does hes the best of husbands  oh i know said priscilla smiling sarcastically i know the way o wives they set one on to abuse their husbands and then they turn round on one and praise em as if they wanted to sell em  but fatherll be waiting for me we must turn now  the large gig with the steady old grey was at the front door and mr lammeter was already on the stone steps passing the time in recalling to godfrey what very fine points speckle had when his master used to ride him  i always would have a good horse you know said the old gentleman not liking that spirited time to be quite effaced from the memory of his juniors  mind you bring nancy to the warrens before the weeks out mr cass was priscillas parting injunction as she took the reins and shook them gently by way of friendly incitement to speckle  i shall just take a turn to the fields against the stonepits nancy and look at the draining said godfrey  youll be in again by teatime dear  oh yes i shall be back in an hour  it was godfreys custom on a sunday afternoon to do a little contemplative farming in a leisurely walk  nancy seldom accompanied him for the women of her generationunless like priscilla they took to outdoor managementwere not given to much walking beyond their own house and garden finding sufficient exercise in domestic duties  so when priscilla was not with her she usually sat with mants bible before her and after following the text with her eyes for a little while she would gradually permit them to wander as her thoughts had already insisted on wandering  but nancys sunday thoughts were rarely quite out of keeping with the devout and reverential intention implied by the book spread open before her  she was not theologically instructed enough to discern very clearly the relation between the sacred documents of the past which she opened without method and her own obscure simple life but the spirit of rectitude and the sense of responsibility for the effect of her conduct on others which were strong elements in nancys character had made it a habit with her to scrutinize her past feelings and actions with selfquestioning solicitude  her mind not being courted by a great variety of subjects she filled the vacant moments by living inwardly again and again through all her remembered experience especially through the fifteen years of her married time in which her life and its significance had been doubled  she recalled the small details the words tones and looks in the critical scenes which had opened a new epoch for her by giving her a deeper insight into the relations and trials of life or which had called on her for some little effort of forbearance or of painful adherence to an imagined or real dutyasking herself continually whether she had been in any respect blamable  this excessive rumination and selfquestioning is perhaps a morbid habit inevitable to a mind of much moral sensibility when shut out from its due share of outward activity and of practical claims on its affectionsinevitable to a noblehearted childless woman when her lot is narrow  i can do so littlehave i done it all well  is the perpetually recurring thought and there are no voices calling her away from that soliloquy no peremptory demands to divert energy from vain regret or superfluous scruple  there was one main thread of painful experience in nancys married life and on it hung certain deeplyfelt scenes which were the oftenest revived in retrospect  the short dialogue with priscilla in the garden had determined the current of retrospect in that frequent direction this particular sunday afternoon  the first wandering of her thought from the text which she still attempted dutifully to follow with her eyes and silent lips was into an imaginary enlargement of the defence she had set up for her husband against priscillas implied blame  the vindication of the loved object is the best balm affection can find for its woundsa man must have so much on his mind is the belief by which a wife often supports a cheerful face under rough answers and unfeeling words  and nancys deepest wounds had all come from the perception that the absence of children from their hearth was dwelt on in her husbands mind as a privation to which he could not reconcile himself  yet sweet nancy might have been expected to feel still more keenly the denial of a blessing to which she had looked forward with all the varied expectations and preparations solemn and prettily trivial which fill the mind of a loving woman when she expects to become a mother  was there not a drawer filled with the neat work of her hands all unworn and untouched just as she had arranged it there fourteen years agojust but for one little dress which had been made the burialdress  but under this immediate personal trial nancy was so firmly unmurmuring that years ago she had suddenly renounced the habit of visiting this drawer lest she should in this way be cherishing a longing for what was not given  perhaps it was this very severity towards any indulgence of what she held to be sinful regret in herself that made her shrink from applying her own standard to her husband  it is very differentit is much worse for a man to be disappointed in that way a woman can always be satisfied with devoting herself to her husband but a man wants something that will make him look forward moreand sitting by the fire is so much duller to him than to a woman  and always when nancy reached this point in her meditationstrying with predetermined sympathy to see everything as godfrey saw itthere came a renewal of selfquestioning  had she done everything in her power to lighten godfreys privation  had she really been right in the resistance which had cost her so much pain six years ago and again four years agothe resistance to her husbands wish that they should adopt a child adoption was more remote from the ideas and habits of that time than of our own still nancy had her opinion on it  it was as necessary to her mind to have an opinion on all topics not exclusively masculine that had come under her notice as for her to have a precisely marked place for every article of her personal property and her opinions were always principles to be unwaveringly acted on  they were firm not because of their basis but because she held them with a tenacity inseparable from her mental action  on all the duties and proprieties of life from filial behaviour to the arrangements of the evening toilette pretty nancy lammeter by the time she was threeandtwenty had her unalterable little code and had formed every one of her habits in strict accordance with that code  she carried these decided judgments within her in the most unobtrusive way they rooted themselves in her mind and grew there as quietly as grass  years ago we know she insisted on dressing like priscilla because it was right for sisters to dress alike and because she would do what was right if she wore a gown dyed with cheesecolouring  that was a trivial but typical instance of the mode in which nancys life was regulated  it was one of those rigid principles and no petty egoistic feeling which had been the ground of nancys difficult resistance to her husbands wish  to adopt a child because children of your own had been denied you was to try and choose your lot in spite of providence the adopted child she was convinced would never turn out well and would be a curse to those who had wilfully and rebelliously sought what it was clear that for some high reason they were better without when you saw a thing was not meant to be said nancy it was a bounden duty to leave off so much as wishing for it  and so far perhaps the wisest of men could scarcely make more than a verbal improvement in her principle  but the conditions under which she held it apparent that a thing was not meant to be depended on a more peculiar mode of thinking  she would have given up making a purchase at a particular place if on three successive times rain or some other cause of heavens sending had formed an obstacle and she would have anticipated a broken limb or other heavy misfortune to any one who persisted in spite of such indications  but why should you think the child would turn out ill  said godfrey in his remonstrances  she has thriven as well as child can do with the weaver and he adopted her  there isnt such a pretty little girl anywhere else in the parish or one fitter for the station we could give her  where can be the likelihood of her being a curse to anybody  yes my dear godfrey said nancy who was sitting with her hands tightly clasped together and with yearning regretful affection in her eyes  the child may not turn out ill with the weaver  but then he didnt go to seek her as we should be doing  it will be wrong i feel sure it will  dont you remember what that lady we met at the royston baths told us about the child her sister adopted that was the only adopting i ever heard of and the child was transported when it was twentythree  dear godfrey dont ask me to do what i know is wrong i should never be happy again  i know its very hard for youits easier for mebut its the will of providence  it might seem singular that nancywith her religious theory pieced together out of narrow social traditions fragments of church doctrine imperfectly understood and girlish reasonings on her small experienceshould have arrived by herself at a way of thinking so nearly akin to that of many devout people whose beliefs are held in the shape of a system quite remote from her knowledgesingular if we did not know that human beliefs like all other natural growths elude the barriers of system  godfrey had from the first specified eppie then about twelve years old as a child suitable for them to adopt  it had never occurred to him that silas would rather part with his life than with eppie surely the weaver would wish the best to the child he had taken so much trouble with and would be glad that such good fortune should happen to her she would always be very grateful to him and he would be well provided for to the end of his lifeprovided for as the excellent part he had done by the child deserved  was it not an appropriate thing for people in a higher station to take a charge off the hands of a man in a lower  it seemed an eminently appropriate thing to godfrey for reasons that were known only to himself and by a common fallacy he imagined the measure would be easy because he had private motives for desiring it  this was rather a coarse mode of estimating silass relation to eppie but we must remember that many of the impressions which godfrey was likely to gather concerning the labouring people around him would favour the idea that deep affections can hardly go along with callous palms and scant means and he had not had the opportunity even if he had had the power of entering intimately into all that was exceptional in the weavers experience  it was only the want of adequate knowledge that could have made it possible for godfrey deliberately to entertain an unfeeling project his natural kindness had outlived that blighting time of cruel wishes and nancys praise of him as a husband was not founded entirely on a wilful illusion  i was right she said to herself when she had recalled all their scenes of discussioni feel i was right to say him nay though it hurt me more than anything but how good godfrey has been about it many men would have been very angry with me for standing out against their wishes and they might have thrown out that theyd had illluck in marrying me but godfrey has never been the man to say me an unkind word  its only what he cant hide everything seems so blank to him i know and the landwhat a difference it ud make to him when he goes to see after things if hed children growing up that he was doing it all for  but i wont murmur and perhaps if hed married a woman whod have had children shed have vexed him in other ways  this possibility was nancys chief comfort and to give it greater strength she laboured to make it impossible that any other wife should have had more perfect tenderness  she had been forced to vex him by that one denial  godfrey was not insensible to her loving effort and did nancy no injustice as to the motives of her obstinacy  it was impossible to have lived with her fifteen years and not be aware that an unselfish clinging to the right and a sincerity clear as the flowerborn dew were her main characteristics indeed godfrey felt this so strongly that his own more wavering nature too averse to facing difficulty to be unvaryingly simple and truthful was kept in a certain awe of this gentle wife who watched his looks with a yearning to obey them  it seemed to him impossible that he should ever confess to her the truth about eppie she would never recover from the repulsion the story of his earlier marriage would create told to her now after that long concealment  and the child too he thought must become an object of repulsion the very sight of her would be painful the shock to nancys mingled pride and ignorance of the worlds evil might even be too much for her delicate frame  since he had married her with that secret on his heart he must keep it there to the last whatever else he did he could not make an irreparable breach between himself and this longloved wife  meanwhile why could he not make up his mind to the absence of children from a hearth brightened by such a wife  why did his mind fly uneasily to that void as if it were the sole reason why life was not thoroughly joyous to him  i suppose it is the way with all men and women who reach middle age without the clear perception that life never can be thoroughly joyous under the vague dullness of the grey hours dissatisfaction seeks a definite object and finds it in the privation of an untried good  dissatisfaction seated musingly on a childless hearth thinks with envy of the father whose return is greeted by young voicesseated at the meal where the little heads rise one above another like nursery plants it sees a black care hovering behind every one of them and thinks the impulses by which men abandon freedom and seek for ties are surely nothing but a brief madness  in godfreys case there were further reasons why his thoughts should be continually solicited by this one point in his lot his conscience never thoroughly easy about eppie now gave his childless home the aspect of a retribution and as the time passed on under nancys refusal to adopt her any retrieval of his error became more and more difficult  on this sunday afternoon it was already four years since there had been any allusion to the subject between them and nancy supposed that it was for ever buried  i wonder if hell mind it less or more as he gets older she thought im afraid more  aged people feel the miss of children what would father do without priscilla  and if i die godfrey will be very lonelynot holding together with his brothers much  but i wont be overanxious and trying to make things out beforehand i must do my best for the present  with that last thought nancy roused herself from her reverie and turned her eyes again towards the forsaken page  it had been forsaken longer than she imagined for she was presently surprised by the appearance of the servant with the teathings  it was in fact a little before the usual time for tea but jane had her reasons  is your master come into the yard jane  no m he isnt said jane with a slight emphasis of which however her mistress took no notice  i dont know whether youve seen em m continued jane after a pause but theres folks making haste all one way afore the front window  i doubt somethings happened  theres niver a man to be seen i the yard else id send and see  ive been up into the top attic but theres no seeing anything for trees  i hope nobodys hurt thats all  oh no i daresay theres nothing much the matter said nancy its perhaps mr snells bull got out again as he did before  i wish he maynt gore anybody then thats all said jane not altogether despising a hypothesis which covered a few imaginary calamities  that girl is always terrifying me thought nancy i wish godfrey would come in  she went to the front window and looked as far as she could see along the road with an uneasiness which she felt to be childish for there were now no such signs of excitement as jane had spoken of and godfrey would not be likely to return by the village road but by the fields she continued to stand however looking at the placid churchyard with the long shadows of the gravestones across the bright green hillocks and at the glowing autumn colours of the rectory trees beyond  before such calm external beauty the presence of a vague fear is more distinctly feltlike a raven flapping its slow wing across the sunny air  nancy wished more and more that godfrey would come in    chapter xviii  some one opened the door at the other end of the room and nancy felt that it was her husband  she turned from the window with gladness in her eyes for the wifes chief dread was stilled  dear im so thankful youre come she said going towards him i began to get  she paused abruptly for godfrey was laying down his hat with trembling hands and turned towards her with a pale face and a strange unanswering glance as if he saw her indeed but saw her as part of a scene invisible to herself  she laid her hand on his arm not daring to speak again but he left the touch unnoticed and threw himself into his chair  jane was already at the door with the hissing urn  tell her to keep away will you  said godfrey and when the door was closed again he exerted himself to speak more distinctly  sit down nancythere he said pointing to a chair opposite him i came back as soon as i could to hinder anybodys telling you but me  ive had a great shockbut i care most about the shock itll be to you  it isnt father and priscilla  said nancy with quivering lips clasping her hands together tightly on her lap  no its nobody living said godfrey unequal to the considerate skill with which he would have wished to make his revelation its dunstanmy brother dunstan that we lost sight of sixteen years ago weve found himfound his bodyhis skeleton  the deep dread godfreys look had created in nancy made her feel these words a relief  she sat in comparative calmness to hear what else he had to tell  he went on  the stonepit has gone dry suddenlyfrom the draining i suppose and there he lieshas lain for sixteen years wedged between two great stones  theres his watch and seals and theres my goldhandled huntingwhip with my name on he took it away without my knowing the day he went hunting on wildfire the last time he was seen  godfrey paused it was not so easy to say what came next  do you think he drowned himself  said nancy almost wondering that her husband should be so deeply shaken by what had happened all those years ago to an unloved brother of whom worse things had been augured  no he fell in said godfrey in a low but distinct voice as if he felt some deep meaning in the fact  presently he added dunstan was the man that robbed silas marner  the blood rushed to nancys face and neck at this surprise and shame for she had been bred up to regard even a distant kinship with crime as a dishonour  o godfrey  she said with compassion in her tone for she had immediately reflected that the dishonour must be felt still more keenly by her husband  there was the money in the pit he continuedall the weavers money  everythings been gathered up and theyre taking the skeleton to the rainbow  but i came back to tell you there was no hindering it you must know  he was silent looking on the ground for two long minutes  nancy would have said some words of comfort under this disgrace but she refrained from an instinctive sense that there was something behindthat godfrey had something else to tell her  presently he lifted his eyes to her face and kept them fixed on her as he said  everything comes to light nancy sooner or later  when god almighty wills it our secrets are found out  ive lived with a secret on my mind but ill keep it from you no longer  i wouldnt have you know it by somebody else and not by mei wouldnt have you find it out after im dead  ill tell you now  its been i will and i wont with me all my lifeill make sure of myself now  nancys utmost dread had returned  the eyes of the husband and wife met with awe in them as at a crisis which suspended affection  nancy said godfrey slowly when i married you i hid something from yousomething i ought to have told you  that woman marner found dead in the snoweppies motherthat wretched womanwas my wife eppie is my child  he paused dreading the effect of his confession  but nancy sat quite still only that her eyes dropped and ceased to meet his  she was pale and quiet as a meditative statue clasping her hands on her lap  youll never think the same of me again said godfrey after a little while with some tremor in his voice  she was silent  i oughtnt to have left the child unowned i oughtnt to have kept it from you  but i couldnt bear to give you up nancy  i was led away into marrying heri suffered for it  still nancy was silent looking down and he almost expected that she would presently get up and say she would go to her fathers how could she have any mercy for faults that must seem so black to her with her simple severe notions  but at last she lifted up her eyes to his again and spoke  there was no indignation in her voiceonly deep regret  godfrey if you had but told me this six years ago we could have done some of our duty by the child  do you think id have refused to take her in if id known she was yours  at that moment godfrey felt all the bitterness of an error that was not simply futile but had defeated its own end  he had not measured this wife with whom he had lived so long  but she spoke again with more agitation  andoh godfreyif wed had her from the first if youd taken to her as you ought shed have loved me for her motherand youd have been happier with me i could better have bore my little baby dying and our life might have been more like what we used to think it ud be  the tears fell and nancy ceased to speak  but you wouldnt have married me then nancy if id told you said godfrey urged in the bitterness of his selfreproach to prove to himself that his conduct had not been utter folly  you may think you would now but you wouldnt then  with your pride and your fathers youd have hated having anything to do with me after the talk thered have been  i cant say what i should have done about that godfrey  i should never have married anybody else  but i wasnt worth doing wrong fornothing is in this world  nothing is so good as it seems beforehandnot even our marrying wasnt you see  there was a faint sad smile on nancys face as she said the last words  im a worse man than you thought i was nancy said godfrey rather tremulously  can you forgive me ever  the wrong to me is but little godfrey youve made it up to meyouve been good to me for fifteen years  its another you did the wrong to and i doubt it can never be all made up for  but we can take eppie now said godfrey  i wont mind the world knowing at last  ill be plain and open for the rest o my life  itll be different coming to us now shes grown up said nancy shaking her head sadly  but its your duty to acknowledge her and provide for her and ill do my part by her and pray to god almighty to make her love me  then well go together to silas marners this very night as soon as everythings quiet at the stonepits    chapter xix  between eight and nine oclock that evening eppie and silas were seated alone in the cottage  after the great excitement the weaver had undergone from the events of the afternoon he had felt a longing for this quietude and had even begged mrs winthrop and aaron who had naturally lingered behind every one else to leave him alone with his child  the excitement had not passed away it had only reached that stage when the keenness of the susceptibility makes external stimulus intolerablewhen there is no sense of weariness but rather an intensity of inward life under which sleep is an impossibility  any one who has watched such moments in other men remembers the brightness of the eyes and the strange definiteness that comes over coarse features from that transient influence  it is as if a new fineness of ear for all spiritual voices had sent wonderworking vibrations through the heavy mortal frameas if beauty born of murmuring sound had passed into the face of the listener  silass face showed that sort of transfiguration as he sat in his armchair and looked at eppie  she had drawn her own chair towards his knees and leaned forward holding both his hands while she looked up at him  on the table near them lit by a candle lay the recovered goldthe old longloved gold ranged in orderly heaps as silas used to range it in the days when it was his only joy  he had been telling her how he used to count it every night and how his soul was utterly desolate till she was sent to him  at first id a sort o feeling come across me now and then he was saying in a subdued tone as if you might be changed into the gold again for sometimes turn my head which way i would i seemed to see the gold and i thought i should be glad if i could feel it and find it was come back  but that didnt last long  after a bit i should have thought it was a curse come again if it had drove you from me for id got to feel the need o your looks and your voice and the touch o your little fingers  you didnt know then eppie when you were such a little unyou didnt know what your old father silas felt for you  but i know now father said eppie  if it hadnt been for you theyd have taken me to the workhouse and thered have been nobody to love me  eh my precious child the blessing was mine  if you hadnt been sent to save me i should ha gone to the grave in my misery  the money was taken away from me in time and you see its been keptkept till it was wanted for you  its wonderfulour life is wonderful  silas sat in silence a few minutes looking at the money  it takes no hold of me now he said ponderinglythe money doesnt  i wonder if it ever could againi doubt it might if i lost you eppie  i might come to think i was forsaken again and lose the feeling that god was good to me  at that moment there was a knocking at the door and eppie was obliged to rise without answering silas  beautiful she looked with the tenderness of gathering tears in her eyes and a slight flush on her cheeks as she stepped to open the door  the flush deepened when she saw mr and mrs godfrey cass  she made her little rustic curtsy and held the door wide for them to enter  were disturbing you very late my dear said mrs cass taking eppies hand and looking in her face with an expression of anxious interest and admiration  nancy herself was pale and tremulous  eppie after placing chairs for mr and mrs cass went to stand against silas opposite to them  well marner said godfrey trying to speak with perfect firmness its a great comfort to me to see you with your money again that youve been deprived of so many years  it was one of my family did you the wrongthe more grief to meand i feel bound to make up to you for it in every way  whatever i can do for you will be nothing but paying a debt even if i looked no further than the robbery  but there are other things im beholdenshall be beholden to you for marner  godfrey checked himself  it had been agreed between him and his wife that the subject of his fatherhood should be approached very carefully and that if possible the disclosure should be reserved for the future so that it might be made to eppie gradually  nancy had urged this because she felt strongly the painful light in which eppie must inevitably see the relation between her father and mother  silas always ill at ease when he was being spoken to by betters such as mr casstall powerful florid men seen chiefly on horsebackanswered with some constraint  sir ive a deal to thank you for aready  as for the robbery i count it no loss to me  and if i did you couldnt help it you arent answerable for it  you may look at it in that way marner but i never can and i hope youll let me act according to my own feeling of whats just i know youre easily contented youve been a hardworking man all your life  yes sir yes said marner meditatively  i should ha been bad off without my work it was what i held by when everything else was gone from me  ah said godfrey applying marners words simply to his bodily wants it was a good trade for you in this country because theres been a great deal of linenweaving to be done  but youre getting rather past such close work marner its time you laid by and had some rest  you look a good deal pulled down though youre not an old man are you  fiftyfive as near as i can say sir said silas  oh why you may live thirty years longerlook at old macey and that money on the table after all is but little  it wont go far either waywhether its put out to interest or you were to live on it as long as it would last it wouldnt go far if youd nobody to keep but yourself and youve had two to keep for a good many years now  eh sir said silas unaffected by anything godfrey was saying im in no fear o want  we shall do very welleppie and me ull do well enough  theres few workingfolks have got so much laid by as that  i dont know what it is to gentlefolks but i look upon it as a dealalmost too much  and as for us its little we want  only the garden father said eppie blushing up to the ears the moment after  you love a garden do you my dear  said nancy thinking that this turn in the point of view might help her husband  we should agree in that i give a deal of time to the garden  ah theres plenty of gardening at the red house said godfrey surprised at the difficulty he found in approaching a proposition which had seemed so easy to him in the distance  youve done a good part by eppie marner for sixteen years  it ud be a great comfort to you to see her well provided for wouldnt it  she looks blooming and healthy but not fit for any hardships she doesnt look like a strapping girl come of working parents  youd like to see her taken care of by those who can leave her well off and make a lady of her shes more fit for it than for a rough life such as she might come to have in a few years time  a slight flush came over marners face and disappeared like a passing gleam  eppie was simply wondering mr cass should talk so about things that seemed to have nothing to do with reality but silas was hurt and uneasy  i dont take your meaning sir he answered not having words at command to express the mingled feelings with which he had heard mr casss words  well my meaning is this marner said godfrey determined to come to the point  mrs cass and i you know have no childrennobody to benefit by our good home and everything else we havemore than enough for ourselves  and we should like to have somebody in the place of a daughter to uswe should like to have eppie and treat her in every way as our own child  it ud be a great comfort to you in your old age i hope to see her fortune made in that way after youve been at the trouble of bringing her up so well  and its right you should have every reward for that  and eppie im sure will always love you and be grateful to you shed come and see you very often and we should all be on the lookout to do everything we could towards making you comfortable  a plain man like godfrey cass speaking under some embarrassment necessarily blunders on words that are coarser than his intentions and that are likely to fall gratingly on susceptible feelings while he had been speaking eppie had quietly passed her arm behind silass head and let her hand rest against it caressingly she felt him trembling violently  he was silent for some moments when mr cass had endedpowerless under the conflict of emotions all alike painful eppies heart was swelling at the sense that her father was in distress and she was just going to lean down and speak to him when one struggling dread at last gained the mastery over every other in silas and he said faintly  eppie my child speak  i wont stand in your way  thank mr and mrs cass  eppie took her hand from her fathers head and came forward a step her cheeks were flushed but not with shyness this time the sense that her father was in doubt and suffering banished that sort of selfconsciousness  she dropped a low curtsy first to mrs cass and then to mr cass and said  thank you maamthank you sir  but i cant leave my father nor own anybody nearer than him  and i dont want to be a ladythank you all the same here eppie dropped another curtsy  i couldnt give up the folks ive been used to  eppies lips began to tremble a little at the last words  she retreated to her fathers chair again and held him round the neck while silas with a subdued sob put up his hand to grasp hers  the tears were in nancys eyes but her sympathy with eppie was naturally divided with distress on her husbands account  she dared not speak wondering what was going on in her husbands mind  godfrey felt an irritation inevitable to almost all of us when we encounter an unexpected obstacle  he had been full of his own penitence and resolution to retrieve his error as far as the time was left to him he was possessed with allimportant feelings that were to lead to a predetermined course of action which he had fixed on as the right and he was not prepared to enter with lively appreciation into other peoples feelings counteracting his virtuous resolves  the agitation with which he spoke again was not quite unmixed with anger  but ive a claim on you eppiethe strongest of all claims its my duty marner to own eppie as my child and provide for her she is my own childher mother was my wife  ive a natural claim on her that must stand before every other  eppie had given a violent start and turned quite pale  silas on the contrary who had been relieved by eppies answer from the dread lest his mind should be in opposition to hers felt the spirit of resistance in him set free not without a touch of parental fierceness  then sir he answered with an accent of bitterness that had been silent in him since the memorable day when his youthful hope had perishedthen sir why didnt you say so sixteen year ago and claim her before id come to love her istead o coming to take her from me now when you might as well take the heart out o my body  god gave her to me because you turned your back upon her and he looks upon her as mine youve no right to her  when a man turns a blessing from his door it falls to them as take it in  i know that marner  i was wrong  ive repented of my conduct in that matter said godfrey who could not help feeling the edge of silass words  im glad to hear it sir said marner with gathering excitement but repentance doesnt alter whats been going on for sixteen year your coming now and saying im her father doesnt alter the feelings inside us  its me shes been calling her father ever since she could say the word  but i think you might look at the thing more reasonably marner said godfrey unexpectedly awed by the weavers direct truthspeaking  it isnt as if she was to be taken quite away from you so that youd never see her again  shell be very near you and come to see you very often  shell feel just the same towards you  just the same  said marner more bitterly than ever  howll she feel just the same for me as she does now when we eat o the same bit and drink o the same cup and think o the same things from one days end to another  just the same  thats idle talk youd cut us i two  godfrey unqualified by experience to discern the pregnancy of marners simple words felt rather angry again  it seemed to him that the weaver was very selfish a judgment readily passed by those who have never tested their own power of sacrifice to oppose what was undoubtedly for eppies welfare and he felt himself called upon for her sake to assert his authority  i should have thought marner he said severelyi should have thought your affection for eppie would make you rejoice in what was for her good even if it did call upon you to give up something you ought to remember your own lifes uncertain and shes at an age now when her lot may soon be fixed in a way very different from what it would be in her fathers home she may marry some low workingman and then whatever i might do for her i couldnt make her welloff  youre putting yourself in the way of her welfare and though im sorry to hurt you after what youve done and what ive left undone i feel now its my duty to insist on taking care of my own daughter  i want to do my duty  it would be difficult to say whether it were silas or eppie that was more deeply stirred by this last speech of godfreys  thought had been very busy in eppie as she listened to the contest between her old longloved father and this new unfamiliar father who had suddenly come to fill the place of that black featureless shadow which had held the ring and placed it on her mothers finger  her imagination had darted backward in conjectures and forward in previsions of what this revealed fatherhood implied and there were words in godfreys last speech which helped to make the previsions especially definite  not that these thoughts either of past or future determined her resolutionthat was determined by the feelings which vibrated to every word silas had uttered but they raised even apart from these feelings a repulsion towards the offered lot and the newlyrevealed father  silas on the other hand was again stricken in conscience and alarmed lest godfreys accusation should be truelest he should be raising his own will as an obstacle to eppies good  for many moments he was mute struggling for the selfconquest necessary to the uttering of the difficult words  they came out tremulously  ill say no more  let it be as you will  speak to the child ill hinder nothing  even nancy with all the acute sensibility of her own affections shared her husbands view that marner was not justifiable in his wish to retain eppie after her real father had avowed himself  she felt that it was a very hard trial for the poor weaver but her code allowed no question that a father by blood must have a claim above that of any fosterfather  besides nancy used all her life to plenteous circumstances and the privileges of respectability could not enter into the pleasures which early nurture and habit connect with all the little aims and efforts of the poor who are born poor to her mind eppie in being restored to her birthright was entering on a too long withheld but unquestionable good  hence she heard silass last words with relief and thought as godfrey did that their wish was achieved  eppie my dear said godfrey looking at his daughter not without some embarrassment under the sense that she was old enough to judge him itll always be our wish that you should show your love and gratitude to one whos been a father to you so many years and we shall want to help you to make him comfortable in every way but we hope youll come to love us as well and though i havent been what a father should ha been to you all these years i wish to do the utmost in my power for you for the rest of my life and provide for you as my only child  and youll have the best of mothers in my wifethatll be a blessing you havent known since you were old enough to know it  my dear youll be a treasure to me said nancy in her gentle voice we shall want for nothing when we have our daughter  eppie did not come forward and curtsy as she had done before  she held silass hand in hers and grasped it firmlyit was a weavers hand with a palm and fingertips that were sensitive to such pressurewhile she spoke with colder decision than before  thank you maamthank you sir for your offerstheyre very great and far above my wish  for i should have no delight i life any more if i was forced to go away from my father and knew he was sitting at home athinking of me and feeling lone  weve been used to be happy together every day and i cant think o no happiness without him  and he says hed nobody i the world till i was sent to him and hed have nothing when i was gone  and hes took care of me and loved me from the first and ill cleave to him as long as he lives and nobody shall ever come between him and me  but you must make sure eppie said silas in a low voiceyou must make sure as you wont ever be sorry because youve made your choice to stay among poor folks and with poor clothes and things when you might ha had everything o the best  his sensitiveness on this point had increased as he listened to eppies words of faithful affection  i can never be sorry father said eppie  i shouldnt know what to think on or to wish for with fine things about me as i havent been used to  and it ud be poor work for me to put on things and ride in a gig and sit in a place at church as ud make them as im fond of think me unfitting company for em  what could i care for then  nancy looked at godfrey with a pained questioning glance  but his eyes were fixed on the floor where he was moving the end of his stick as if he were pondering on something absently  she thought there was a word which might perhaps come better from her lips than from his  what you say is natural my dear childits natural you should cling to those whove brought you up she said mildly but theres a duty you owe to your lawful father  theres perhaps something to be given up on more sides than one  when your father opens his home to you i think its right you shouldnt turn your back on it  i cant feel as ive got any father but one said eppie impetuously while the tears gathered  ive always thought of a little home where hed sit i the corner and i should fend and do everything for him i cant think o no other home  i wasnt brought up to be a lady and i cant turn my mind to it  i like the workingfolks and their victuals and their ways  and she ended passionately while the tears fell im promised to marry a workingman asll live with father and help me to take care of him  godfrey looked up at nancy with a flushed face and smarting dilated eyes  this frustration of a purpose towards which he had set out under the exalted consciousness that he was about to compensate in some degree for the greatest demerit of his life made him feel the air of the room stifling  let us go he said in an undertone  we wont talk of this any longer now said nancy rising were your wellwishers my dearand yours too marner  we shall come and see you again  its getting late now  in this way she covered her husbands abrupt departure for godfrey had gone straight to the door unable to say more    chapter xx  nancy and godfrey walked home under the starlight in silence  when they entered the oaken parlour godfrey threw himself into his chair while nancy laid down her bonnet and shawl and stood on the hearth near her husband unwilling to leave him even for a few minutes and yet fearing to utter any word lest it might jar on his feeling  at last godfrey turned his head towards her and their eyes met dwelling in that meeting without any movement on either side  that quiet mutual gaze of a trusting husband and wife is like the first moment of rest or refuge from a great weariness or a great dangernot to be interfered with by speech or action which would distract the sensations from the fresh enjoyment of repose  but presently he put out his hand and as nancy placed hers within it he drew her towards him and said  thats ended  she bent to kiss him and then said as she stood by his side yes im afraid we must give up the hope of having her for a daughter  it wouldnt be right to want to force her to come to us against her will we cant alter her bringing up and whats come of it  no said godfrey with a keen decisiveness of tone in contrast with his usually careless and unemphatic speechtheres debts we cant pay like money debts by paying extra for the years that have slipped by while ive been putting off and putting off the trees have been growingits too late now  marner was in the right in what he said about a mans turning away a blessing from his door it falls to somebody else  i wanted to pass for childless once nancyi shall pass for childless now against my wish  nancy did not speak immediately but after a little while she askedyou wont make it known then about eppies being your daughter  no where would be the good to anybodyonly harm  i must do what i can for her in the state of life she chooses  i must see who it is shes thinking of marrying  if it wont do any good to make the thing known said nancy who thought she might now allow herself the relief of entertaining a feeling which she had tried to silence before i should be very thankful for father and priscilla never to be troubled with knowing what was done in the past more than about dunsey it cant be helped their knowing that  i shall put it in my willi think i shall put it in my will i shouldnt like to leave anything to be found out like this of dunsey said godfrey meditatively  but i cant see anything but difficulties that ud come from telling it now  i must do what i can to make her happy in her own way  ive a notion he added after a moments pause its aaron winthrop she meant she was engaged to  i remember seeing him with her and marner going away from church  well hes very sober and industrious said nancy trying to view the matter as cheerfully as possible  godfrey fell into thoughtfulness again  presently he looked up at nancy sorrowfully and said  shes a very pretty nice girl isnt she nancy  yes dear and with just your hair and eyes i wondered it had never struck me before  i think she took a dislike to me at the thought of my being her father i could see a change in her manner after that  she couldnt bear to think of not looking on marner as her father said nancy not wishing to confirm her husbands painful impression  she thinks i did wrong by her mother as well as by her  she thinks me worse than i am  but she must think it she can never know all its part of my punishment nancy for my daughter to dislike me  i should never have got into that trouble if id been true to youif i hadnt been a fool  id no right to expect anything but evil could come of that marriageand when i shirked doing a fathers part too  nancy was silent her spirit of rectitude would not let her try to soften the edge of what she felt to be a just compunction  he spoke again after a little while but the tone was rather changed there was tenderness mingled with the previous selfreproach  and i got you nancy in spite of all and yet ive been grumbling and uneasy because i hadnt something elseas if i deserved it  youve never been wanting to me godfrey said nancy with quiet sincerity  my only trouble would be gone if you resigned yourself to the lot thats been given us  well perhaps it isnt too late to mend a bit there  though it is too late to mend some things say what they will    chapter xxi  the next morning when silas and eppie were seated at their breakfast he said to her  eppie theres a thing ive had on my mind to do this two year and now the moneys been brought back to us we can do it  ive been turning it over and over in the night and i think well set out tomorrow while the fine days last  well leave the house and everything for your godmother to take care on and well make a little bundle o things and set out  where to go daddy  said eppie in much surprise  to my old countryto the town where i was bornup lantern yard  i want to see mr paston the minister something may ha come out to make em know i was innicent o the robbery  and mr paston was a man with a deal o lighti want to speak to him about the drawing o the lots  and i should like to talk to him about the religion o this countryside for i partly think he doesnt know on it  eppie was very joyful for there was the prospect not only of wonder and delight at seeing a strange country but also of coming back to tell aaron all about it  aaron was so much wiser than she was about most thingsit would be rather pleasant to have this little advantage over him  mrs winthrop though possessed with a dim fear of dangers attendant on so long a journey and requiring many assurances that it would not take them out of the region of carriers carts and slow waggons was nevertheless well pleased that silas should revisit his own country and find out if he had been cleared from that false accusation  youd be easier in your mind for the rest o your life master marner said dollythat you would  and if theres any light to be got up the yard as you talk on weve need of it i this world and id be glad on it myself if you could bring it back  so on the fourth day from that time silas and eppie in their sunday clothes with a small bundle tied in a blue linen handkerchief were making their way through the streets of a great manufacturing town silas bewildered by the changes thirty years had brought over his native place had stopped several persons in succession to ask them the name of this town that he might be sure he was not under a mistake about it  ask for lantern yard fatherask this gentleman with the tassels on his shoulders astanding at the shop door he isnt in a hurry like the rest said eppie in some distress at her fathers bewilderment and ill at ease besides amidst the noise the movement and the multitude of strange indifferent faces  eh my child he wont know anything about it said silas gentlefolks didnt ever go up the yard  but happen somebody can tell me which is the way to prison street where the jail is i know the way out o that as if id seen it yesterday  with some difficulty after many turnings and new inquiries they reached prison street and the grim walls of the jail the first object that answered to any image in silass memory cheered him with the certitude which no assurance of the towns name had hitherto given him that he was in his native place  ah he said drawing a long breath theres the jail eppie thats just the same i arent afraid now  its the third turning on the left hand from the jail doorsthats the way we must go  oh what a dark ugly place  said eppie  how it hides the sky its worse than the workhouse  im glad you dont live in this town now father  is lantern yard like this street  my precious child said silas smiling it isnt a big street like this  i never was easy i this street myself but i was fond o lantern yard  the shops here are all altered i thinki cant make em out but i shall know the turning because its the third  here it is he said in a tone of satisfaction as they came to a narrow alley  and then we must go to the left again and then straight forard for a bit up shoe lane and then we shall be at the entry next to the oerhanging window where theres the nick in the road for the water to run  eh i can see it all  o father im like as if i was stifled said eppie  i couldnt ha thought as any folks lived i this way so close together  how pretty the stonepits ull look when we get back  it looks comical to me child nowand smells bad  i cant think as it usened to smell so  here and there a sallow begrimed face looked out from a gloomy doorway at the strangers and increased eppies uneasiness so that it was a longedfor relief when they issued from the alleys into shoe lane where there was a broader strip of sky  dear heart  said silas why theres people coming out o the yard as if theyd been to chapel at this time o daya weekday noon  suddenly he started and stood still with a look of distressed amazement that alarmed eppie  they were before an opening in front of a large factory from which men and women were streaming for their midday meal  father said eppie clasping his arm whats the matter  but she had to speak again and again before silas could answer her  its gone child he said at last in strong agitationlantern yards gone  it must ha been here because heres the house with the oerhanging windowi know thatits just the same but theyve made this new opening and see that big factory its all gonechapel and all  come into that little brushshop and sit down fathertheyll let you sit down said eppie always on the watch lest one of her fathers strange attacks should come on  perhaps the people can tell you all about it  but neither from the brushmaker who had come to shoe lane only ten years ago when the factory was already built nor from any other source within his reach could silas learn anything of the old lantern yard friends or of mr paston the minister  the old place is all swep away silas said to dolly winthrop on the night of his returnthe little graveyard and everything the old homes gone ive no home but this now  i shall never know whether they got at the truth o the robbery nor whether mr paston could ha given me any light about the drawing o the lots  its dark to me mrs winthrop that is i doubt itll be dark to the last  well yes master marner said dolly who sat with a placid listening face now bordered by grey hairs i doubt it may  its the will o them above as a many things should be dark to us but theres some things as ive never felt i the dark about and theyre mostly what comes i the days work  you were hard done by that once master marner and it seems as youll never know the rights of it but that doesnt hinder there being a rights master marner for all its dark to you and me  no said silas no that doesnt hinder  since the time the child was sent to me and ive come to love her as myself ive had light enough to trusten by and now she says shell never leave me i think i shall trusten till i die    conclusion  there was one time of the year which was held in raveloe to be especially suitable for a wedding  it was when the great lilacs and laburnums in the oldfashioned gardens showed their golden and purple wealth above the lichentinted walls and when there were calves still young enough to want bucketfuls of fragrant milk people were not so busy then as they must become when the full cheesemaking and the mowing had set in and besides it was a time when a light bridal dress could be worn with comfort and seen to advantage  happily the sunshine fell more warmly than usual on the lilac tufts the morning that eppie was married for her dress was a very light one she had often thought though with a feeling of renunciation that the perfection of a weddingdress would be a white cotton with the tiniest pink sprig at wide intervals so that when mrs godfrey cass begged to provide one and asked eppie to choose what it should be previous meditation had enabled her to give a decided answer at once  seen at a little distance as she walked across the churchyard and down the village she seemed to be attired in pure white and her hair looked like the dash of gold on a lily  one hand was on her husbands arm and with the other she clasped the hand of her father silas  you wont be giving me away father she had said before they went to church youll only be taking aaron to be a son to you  dolly winthrop walked behind with her husband and there ended the little bridal procession  there were many eyes to look at it and miss priscilla lammeter was glad that she and her father had happened to drive up to the door of the red house just in time to see this pretty sight  they had come to keep nancy company today because mr cass had had to go away to lytherley for special reasons  that seemed to be a pity for otherwise he might have gone as mr crackenthorp and mr osgood certainly would to look on at the weddingfeast which he had ordered at the rainbow naturally feeling a great interest in the weaver who had been wronged by one of his own family  i could ha wished nancy had had the luck to find a child like that and bring her up said priscilla to her father as they sat in the gig i should ha had something young to think of then besides the lambs and the calves  yes my dear yes said mr lammeter one feels that as one gets older  things look dim to old folks theyd need have some young eyes about em to let em know the worlds the same as it used to be  nancy came out now to welcome her father and sister and the wedding group had passed on beyond the red house to the humbler part of the village  dolly winthrop was the first to divine that old mr macey who had been set in his armchair outside his own door would expect some special notice as they passed since he was too old to be at the weddingfeast  mr maceys looking for a word from us said dolly hell be hurt if we pass him and say nothingand him so racked with rheumatiz  so they turned aside to shake hands with the old man  he had looked forward to the occasion and had his premeditated speech  well master marner he said in a voice that quavered a good deal ive lived to see my words come true  i was the first to say there was no harm in you though your looks might be again you and i was the first to say youd get your money back  and its nothing but rightful as you should  and id ha said the amens and willing at the holy matrimony but tookeys done it a good while now and i hope youll have none the worse luck  in the open yard before the rainbow the party of guests were already assembled though it was still nearly an hour before the appointed feast time  but by this means they could not only enjoy the slow advent of their pleasure they had also ample leisure to talk of silas marners strange history and arrive by due degrees at the conclusion that he had brought a blessing on himself by acting like a father to a lone motherless child  even the farrier did not negative this sentiment on the contrary he took it up as peculiarly his own and invited any hardy person present to contradict him  but he met with no contradiction and all differences among the company were merged in a general agreement with mr snells sentiment that when a man had deserved his good luck it was the part of his neighbours to wish him joy  as the bridal group approached a hearty cheer was raised in the rainbow yard and ben winthrop whose jokes had retained their acceptable flavour found it agreeable to turn in there and receive congratulations not requiring the proposed interval of quiet at the stonepits before joining the company  eppie had a larger garden than she had ever expected there now and in other ways there had been alterations at the expense of mr cass the landlord to suit silass larger family  for he and eppie had declared that they would rather stay at the stonepits than go to any new home the garden was fenced with stones on two sides but in front there was an open fence through which the flowers shone with answering gladness as the four united people came within sight of them  o father said eppie what a pretty home ours is  i think nobody could be happier than we are
