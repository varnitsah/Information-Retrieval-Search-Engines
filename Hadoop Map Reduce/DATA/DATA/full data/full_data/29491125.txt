29491125	andrew langs introduction to the compleat angler   to write on walton is indeed to hold a candle to the sun  the editor has been content to give a summary of the chief or rather the only known events in waltons long life adding a notice of his character as displayed in his biographies and in the compleat angler with comments on the ancient and modern practice of fishing illustrated by passages from waltons foregoers and contemporaries  like all editors of walton he owes much to his predecessors sir john hawkins oldys major and above all to the learned sir harris nicolas     his life   the few events in the long life of izaak walton have been carefully investigated by sir harris nicolas  all that can be extricated from documents by the alchemy of research has been selected and i am unaware of any important acquisitions since sir harris nicolass second edition of 1860  izaak was of an old family of staffordshire yeomen probably descendants of george walton of yoxhall who died in 1571  izaaks father was jarvis walton who died in february 15956 of izaaks mother nothing is known  izaak himself was born at stafford on august 9 1593 and was baptized on september 21  he died on december 15 1683 having lived in the reigns of elizabeth james i charles i under the commonwealth and under charles ii  the anxious and changeful age through which he passed is in contrast with his very pacific character and tranquil pursuits  of waltons education nothing is known except on the evidence of his writings  he may have read latin but most of the books he cites had english translations  did he learn his religion from his mother or his nurse  it will be seen that the free speculation of his age left him untouched perhaps his piety was awakened from childhood under the instruction of a pious mother  had he been orphaned of both parents as has been suggested he might have been less amenable to authority and a less notable example of the virtues which anglicanism so vainly opposed to puritanismism  his literary beginnings are obscure  there exists a copy of a work the loves of amos and laura written by s p published in 1613 and again in 1619  the edition of 1619 is dedicated to iz wa     thou being cause it is as now it is  the dedication does not occur in the one imperfect known copy of 1613 conceivably the words as now it is refer to the edition of 1619 which might have been emended by waltons advice  but there are no emendations hence it is more probable that walton revised the poem in 1613 when he was a man of twenty or that he merely advised the author to publish     for hadst thou held thy tongue by silence might    these have been buried in oblivions night  s p also remarks     no ill thing can be clothed in thy verse  hence izaak was already a rhymer and a harmless one under the royal prentice gentle king jamie  by this time walton was probably settled in london  a deed in the possession of his biographer dr johnsons friend sir john hawkins shows that in 1614 walton held half of a shop on the north side of fleet street two doors west of chancery lane the other occupant was a hosier  mr nicholl has discovered that walton was made free of the ironmongers company on nov 12 1618  he is styled an ironmonger in his marriage licence  the facts are given in mr marstons life of walton prefixed to his edition of the compleat angler 1888  it is odd that a prentice ironmonger should have been a poet and a critic of poetry  dr donne before 1614 was vicar of st dunstans in the west and in walton had a parishioner a disciple and a friend  izaak greatly loved the society of the clergy he connected himself with episcopal families and had a natural taste for a bishop  through donne perhaps or it may be in converse across the counter he made acquaintance with hales of eton dr king and sir henry wotton himself an angler and one who like donne and izaak loved a ghost story and had several in his family drayton the riverpoet author of the polyolbion is also spoken of by walton as my old deceased friend  on dec 27 1626 walton married at canterbury rachel floud a niece on the maternal side by several descents of cranmer the famous archbishop of canterbury  the cranmers were intimate with the family of the judicious hooker and walton was again connected with kinsfolk of that celebrated divine  donne died in 1631 leaving to walton and to other friends a bloodstone engraved with christ crucified on an anchor the seal is impressed on waltons will  when donnes poems were published in 1633 walton added commendatory verses     as all lament    or should this general cause of discontent  the parenthetic or should is much in waltons manner  witness my mild pen not used to upbraid the world is also a pleasant and accurate piece of selfcriticism  i am his convert walton exclaims  in a citation from a manuscript which cannot be found and perhaps never existed walton is spoken of as a very sweet poet in his youth and more than all in matters of love 1  donne had been in the same case he or time may have converted walton from amorous ditties  walton in an edition of donnes poems of 1635 writes of     this book dry emblem which begins    with love but ends with tears and sighs for sins  the preacher and his convert had probably a similar history of the heart as we shall see walton like the cyclops had known love  early in 1639 wotton wrote to walton about a proposed life of donne to be written by himself and hoped to enjoy your own ever welcome company in the approaching time of the fly and the cork  wotton was a flyfisher the cork or float or trembling quill marks izaak for the bottomfisher he was  wotton died in december 1639 walton prefixed his own life of donne to that divines sermons in 1640  he says in the dedication of the reprint of 1658 that it had the approbation of our late learned and eloquent king the martyred charles i  living in or at the corner of chancery lane walton is known to have held parochial office he was even elected scavenger  he had the misfortune to lose seven childrenof whom the last died in 1641his wife and his mother inlaw  in 1644 he left chancery lane and probably retired from trade he was of course a royalist  speaking of the entry of the scots who came as one of them said for the goodsand chattels of the english he remarks i saw and suffered by it 2  he also mentions that he saw shops shut by their owners till laud should be put to death in january 1645  in his life of sanderson walton vouches for an anecdote of the knowing and conscientious king charles who he says meant to do public penance for straffords death and for the abolishing of episcopacy in scotland  but the condition peaceable possession of the crown was not granted to charles nor could have been granted to a prince who wished to reintroduce bishops in scotland  walton had his information from dr morley  on nov 25 1645 walton probably wrote though john marriott signed an address to the reader printed in 1646 with quarless shepherds eclogues  the piece is a little idyll in prose and angle lines and flies are not omitted in the description of the fruitful month of may while pan is implored to restore arcadian peace to britannia and grant that each honest shepherd may again sit under his own vine and figtree and feed his own flock when the king comes no doubt  about 1646 walton married anne halfsister of bishop ken a lady of much christian meeknesse  sir harris nicolas thinks that he only visited stafford occasionally in these troubled years  he mentions fishing in shawford brook he was likely to fish wherever there was water and the brook flowed through land which as mr marston shows he acquired about 1656  in 1650 a child was born to walton in clerkenwell it died but another isaac was born in september 1651  in 1651 he published the reliquiae wottonianae with a memoir of sir henry wotton  the knight had valued waltons company as a cure for those splenetic vapours that are called hypochondriacal  worcester fight was on september 3 1651 the king was defeated and fled escaping thanks to a stand made by wogan and to the loyalty of mistress jane lane and of many other faithful adherents  a jewel of charless the lesser george was preserved by colonel blague who intrusted it to mr barlow of blore pipe house in staffordshire  mr barlow gave it to mr milward a royalist prisoner in stafford and he in turn intrusted it to walton who managed to convey it to colonel blague in the tower  the colonel escaped and the george was given back to the king  ashmole who tells the story mentions walton as well beloved of all good men  this incident is perhaps the only known adventure in the long life of old izaak  the peaceful angler with a royal jewel in his pocket must have encountered many dangers on the highway  he was a man of sixty when he published his compleat angler in 1653 and so secured immortality  the quiet beauties of his manner in his various biographies would only have made him known to a few students who could never have recognised byrons quaint old cruel coxcomb in their author  the whole discourse is a kind of picture of my own disposition at least of my disposition in such days and times as i allow myself when honest nat and r r and i go afishing together  izaak speaks of the possibility that his book may reach a second edition  there are now editions more than a hundred  waltonians should read mr thomas westwoods preface to his chronicle of the compleat angler it is reprinted in mr marstons edition  mr westwood learned to admire walton at the feet of charles lamb     no fisher    but a wellwisher    to the game  as scott describes himself  3  lamb recommended walton to coleridge it breathes the very spirit of innocence purity and simplicity of heart    it would sweeten a mans temper at any time to read it it would christianise every angry discordant passion pray make yourself acquainted with it  oct 28 1796  according to mr westwood lamb had an early copy found in a repository of marine stores but not even then to be bought a bargain mr westwood fears that lambs copy was only hawkinss edition of 1760 the original is extremely scarce  mr locker had a fine copy there is another in the library of dorchester house both are in their primitive livery of brown sheep or calf  the book is one which only the wealthy collector can hope with luck to call his own  a small octavo sold at eighteenpence the compleat angler was certain to be thumbed into nothingness after enduring much from may showers july suns and fishy companionship  it is almost a wonder that any examples of waltons and bunyans first editions have survived into our day  the little volume was meant to find a place in the bulging pockets of anglers and was well adapted to that end  the work should be reprinted in a similar format quarto editions are out of place  the fortunes of the book the fata libelli have been traced by mr westwood  there are several misprints later corrected in the earliest copies as p 88 fordig for fordidg p 152 pudoch for pudock  the appearance of the work was advertised in the perfect diurnal may 916 and in no 154 of the mercurius politicus may 19 26 also in an almanack for 1654  izaak or his publisher marriott cunningly brought out the book at a season when men expect the mayfly just a month before oliver cromwell had walked into the house of commons in a plain suit of black clothes with grey stockings  his language when he spoke was reckoned unparliamentary as it undeniably was and he dissolved the long parliament  while marriott was advertising waltons work cromwell was making a parliament of saints faithful fearing god and hating covetousness  this is a good description of izaak but he was not selected  in the midst of revolutions came the compleat angler to the light a possession for ever  its original purchasers are not likely to have taken a hand in royalist plots or saintly conventicles  they were peaceful men  a certain cromwellian trooper richard franck was a better angler than walton and he has left to us the only contemporary and contemptuous criticism of his book to this we shall return but anglers as a rule unlike franck must have been for the king and on izaaks side in controversy  walton brought out a second edition in 1655  he rewrote the book adding more than a third suppressing viator and introducing venator  new plates were added and after the manner of the time commendatory verses  a third edition appeared in 1661 a fourth published by simon gape not by marriott came out in 1664 a fifth in 1668 counting gapes of 1664 as a new edition and in 1676 the work with treatises by venables and charles cotton was given to the world as the universal angler  five editions in twelve years is not bad evidence of waltons popularity  but times now altered  walton is really an elizabethan he has the quaint freshness the apparently artless music of language of the great age  he is a friend of country contents no lover of the town no keen student of urban ways and mundane men  a new taste modelled on that of the wits of louis xiv had come in we are in the period of dryden and approaching that of pope  there was no new edition of walton till moses browne by johnsons desire published him with improvements in 1750  then came hawkinss edition in 1760  johnson said of hawkins why maam i believe him to be an honest man at the bottom but to be sure he is penurious and he is mean and it must be owned he has a degree of brutality and a tendency to savageness that cannot easily be defended  this was hardly the editor for izaak  however hawkins probably by aid of oldys the antiquary as mr marston shows laid a good foundation for a biography of walton  errors he made but sir harris nicolas has corrected them  johnson himself reckoned waltons lives as one of his most favourite books  he preferred the life of donne and justly complained that waltons story of donnes vision of his absent wife had been left out of a modern edition  he explained waltons friendship with persons of higher rank by his being a great panegyrist  the eighteenth century we see came back to walton as the nineteenth has done  he was precisely the author to suit charles lamb  he was reprinted again and again and illustrated by stoddart and others  among his best editors are major 1839 ephemera 1853 nicolas 1836 1860 and mr marston 1888  the only contemporary criticism known to me is that of richard franck who had served with cromwell in scotland and not liking the aspect of changing times returned to the north and fished from the esk to strathnaver  in 1658 he wrote his northern memoirs an itinerary of sport heavily cumbered by dull reflections and pedantic style  franck however was a practical angler especially for salmon a fish of which walton knew nothing he also appreciated the character of the great montrose  he went to america wrote a wild cosmogonic work and the admirable and indefatigable adventures of the nine pious pilgrims one pilgrim catches a trout london 1708  the northern memoirs of 1658 were not published till 1694  sir walter scott edited a new issue in 1821 and defended izaak from the strictures of the salmonfisher  izaak says franck lays the stress of his arguments upon other mens observations wherewith he stuffs his indigested octavo so brings himself under the anglers censure and the common calamity of a plagiary to be pitied poor man for his loss of time in scribbling and transcribing other mens notions    i remember in stafford i urged his own argument upon him that pickerel weed of itself breeds pickerel pike  franck proposed a rational theory which my compleat angler no sooner deliberated but dropped his argument and leaves gesner to defend it so huffed away      so note the true character of an industrious angler more deservedly falls upon merrill and faulkner or rather izaak ouldham a man that fished salmon with but three hairs at hook whose collections and experiments were lost with himselfa matter much to be regretted  it will be observed of course that hair was then used and gut is first mentioned for angling purposes by mr pepys  indeed the flies which scott was hunting for when he found the lost ms of the first part of waverley are tied on horsehairs  they are in the possession of the descendants of scotts friend mr william laidlaw  the curious angler consulting franck will find that his salmon flies are much like our own but less variegated  scott justly remarks that while walton was habit and repute a baitfisher even cotton knows nothing of salmon  scott wished that walton had made the northern tour but izaak would have been sadly to seek running after a fish down a gorge of the shin or the brora and the discomforts of the north would have finished his career  in scotland he would not have found fresh sheets smelling of lavender  walton was in london in the dangerous year 1655  he speaks of his meeting bishop sanderson there in sadcoloured clothes and god knows far from being costly  the friends were driven by wind and rain into a cleanly house where we had bread cheese ale and a fire for our ready money  the rain and wind were so obliging to me as to force our stay there for at least an hour to my great content and advantage for in that time he made to me many useful observations of the present times with much clearness and conscientious freedom  it was a year of republican and royalist conspiracies the clergy were persecuted and banished from london  no more is known of walton till the happy year 1660 when the king came to his own again and waltons episcopal friends to their palaces  izaak produced an eglog on may 29     the king  the kings returned  and now    lets banish all sad thoughts and sing    we have our laws and have our king  if izaak was so eccentric as to go to bed sober on that glorious twenty ninth of may i greatly misjudge him  but he grew elderly  in 1661 he chronicles the deaths of honest nat and r roethey are gone and with them most of my pleasant hours even as a shadow that passeth away and returns not  on april 17 1662 walton lost his second wife she died at worcester probably on a visit to bishop morley  in the same year the bishop was translated to winchester where the palace became izaaks home  the itchen where no doubt he angled with worm must have been his constant haunt  he was busy with his life of richard hooker 1665  the peroration as it were was altered and expanded in 1670 and this is but one example of waltons care of his periods  one beautiful passage he is known to have rewritten several times till his ear was satisfied with its cadences  in 1670 he published his life of george herbert  i wish if god shall be so pleased that i may be so happy as to die like him  in 1673 in a dedication of the third edition of reliquiae wottonianae walton alludes to his friendship with a much younger and gayer man than himself charles cotton born 1630 the friend of colonel richard lovelace and of sir john suckling the translator of scarrons travesty of virgil and of montaignes essays cotton was a roisterer a man at one time deep in debt but he was a royalist a scholar and an angler  the friendship between him and walton is creditable to the freshness of the old man and to the kindness of the younger who to be sure laughed at izaaks heavily dubbed london flies  in him says cotton i have the happiness to know the worthiest man and to enjoy the best and the truest friend any man ever had  we are reminded of johnson with langton and topham beauclerk meanwhile izaak the younger had grown up was educated under dr fell at christ church and made the grand tour in 1675 visiting rome and venice in march 1676 he proceeded ma and took holy orders  in this year cotton wrote his treatise on flyfishing to be published with waltons new edition and the famous fishing house on the dove with the blended initials of the two friends was built  in 1678 walton wrote his life of sanderson    tis now too late to wish that my life may be like his for i am in the eightyfifth year of my age but i humbly beseech almighty god that my death may be and do as earnestly beg of every reader to say amen  he wrote in 1678 a preface to thealma and clearchus 1683  the poem is attributed to john chalkhill a fellow of winchester college who died a man of eighty in 1679  two of his songs are in the compleat angler  probably the attribution is right chalkhills tomb commemorates a man after waltons own heart but some have assigned the volume to walton himself  chalkhill is described on the titlepage as an acquaintant and friend of edmund spencer which is impossible 4  on august 9 1683 walton wrote his will in the neintyeth year of my age and in perfect memory for which praised be god  he professes the anglican faith despite a very long and very trew friendship for some of the roman church  his worldly estate he has acquired neither by falsehood or flattery or the extreme crewelty of the law of this nation his property was in two houses in london the lease of norington farm a farm near stafford besides books linen and a hanging cabinet inscribed with his name now it seems in the possession of mr elkin mathews  a bequest is made of money for coals to the poor of stafford every last weike in janewary or in every first weike in febrewary i say then because i take that time to be the hardest and most pinching times with pore people  to the bishop of winchester he bequeathed a ring with the posy a mite for a million  there are other bequests including ten pounds to my old friend mr richard marriott waltons bookseller this good man died in peace with his publisher leaving him also a ring a ring was left to a lady of the portsmouth family mrs doro wallop  walton died at the house of his soninlaw dr hawkins in winchester on dec 15 1683 he is buried in the south aisle of the cathedral  the cathedral library possesses many of waltons books with his name written in them 5  his eusebius 1636 contains on the flyleaf repetitions in various forms of one of his studied passages  simple as he seems he is a careful artist in language  such are the scanty records and scantier relics of a very long life circumstances and inclination combined to make walpole choose the fallentis semita vitae  without ambition save to be in the society of good men he passed through turmoil ever companioned by content  for him existence had its trials he saw all that he held most sacred overthrown laws broken up his king publicly murdered his friends outcasts his worship proscribed he himself suffered in property from the raid of the kirk into england  he underwent many bereavements child after child he lost but content he did not lose nor sweetness of heart nor belief  his was one of those happy characters which are never found disassociated from unquestioning faith  of old he might have been the ancient religious athenian in the opening of platos republic or virgils aged gardener  the happiness of such natures would be incomplete without religion but only by such tranquil and blessed souls can religion be accepted with no doubt or scruple no dread and no misgiving  in his preface to thealma and clearchus walton writes and we may use his own words about his own works the reader will here find such various events and rewards of innocent truth and undissembled honesty as is like to leave in him if he be a goodnatured reader more sympathising and virtuous impressions than ten times so much time spent in impertinent critical and needless disputes about religion  walton relied on authority on a plain unperplexed catechism  in an age of the strangest and most dissident theological speculations an age of quakers anabaptists antinomians fifth monarchy men covenanters independents gibbites presbyterians and what not walton was true to the authority of the church of england with no prejudice against the ancient catholic faith  as gesner was his authority for pickerel weed begetting pike so the anglican bishops were security for waltons creed  to him if we may say so it was easy to be saved while bunyan a greater humorist could be saved only in following a path that skirted madness and as by fire  to bunyan walton would have seemed a figure like his own ignorance a pilgrim who never stuck in the slough of despond nor met apollyon in the valley of the shadow nor was captive in doubting castle nor stoned in vanity fair  and of bunyan walton would have said that he was among those nonconformists who might be sincere wellmeaning men whose indiscreet zeal might be so like charity as thereby to cover a multitude of errors  to walton there seemed spiritual solace in remembering that we have comforted and been helpful to a dejected or distressed family  bunyan would have regarded this belief as a heresy and theoretically charitable deeds as filthy rags  differently constituted these excellent men accepted religion in different ways  christian bows beneath a burden of sin piscator beneath a basket of trout  let us be grateful for the diversities of human nature and the dissimilar paths which lead piscator and christian alike to the city not built with hands  both were seekers for a city which to have sought through life in patience honesty loyalty and love is to have found it  of waltons book we may say     laudis amore tumes  sunt certa piacula quae te    ter pure lecto poterunt recreare libello     walton as a biographer   it was probably by his lives rather than in the first instance by his angler that walton won the liking of dr johnson whence came his literary resurrection  it is true that moses browne and hawkins both friends of johnsons edited the compleat angler before 17751776 when we find dr home of magdalene oxford contemplating a benoted edition of the lives by johnsons advice  but the walton of the lives is rather than the walton of the angler the man after johnsons own heart  the angler is a picture of my own disposition on holidays the lives display the same disposition in serious moods and in face of the eternal problems of mans life in society  johnson we know was very fond of biography had thought much on the subject and as boswell notes varied from himself in talk when he discussed the measure of truth permitted to biographers  if a man is to write a panegyrick he may keep vices out of sight but if he professes to write a life he must represent it as it really was  peculiarities were not to be concealed he said and his own were not veiled by boswell  nobody can write the life of a man but those who have eat and drunk and lived in social intercourse with him  they only who live with a man can write his life with any genuine exactness and discrimination and few people who have lived with a man know what to remark about him  walton had lived much in the society of his subjects donne and wotton with sanderson he had a slighter acquaintance george herbert he had only met hooker of course he had never seen in the flesh  it is obvious to every reader that his biographies of donne and wotton are his best  in donnes life he feels that he is writing of an english st austinfor i think none was so like him before his conversion none so like st ambrose after it and if his youth had the infirmities of the one his age had the excellencies of the other the learning and holiness of both  st augustine made free confession of his own infirmities of youth  with great delicacy walton lets donne also confess himself printing a letter in which he declines to take holy orders because his course of life when very young had been too notorious  delicacy and tact are as notable in waltons account of donnes poverty melancholy and conversion through the blessed means of gentle king jamie  walton had an awful loyalty a sincere reverence for the office of a king  but wherever he introduces king james either in his donne or his wotton you see a subdued version of the king james of the fortunes of nigel  the pedantry the good nature the touchiness the humour the nervousness are all here  it only needs a touch of the kings broad accent to set before us as vividly as in scott the interviews with donne and that singular scene when wotton disguised as octavio baldi deposits his long rapier at the door of his majestys chamber  wotton in florence was warned of a plot to murder james vi  the duke gave him such italian antidotes against poison as the scots till then had been strangers to indeed there is no antidote for a dirk and the scots were not poisoners  introduced by lindsay as octavio baldi wotton found his nervous majesty accompanied by four scottish nobles  he spoke in italian then drawing near hastily whispered that he was an englishman and prayed for a private interview  this by some art he obtained delivered his antidotes and when james succeeded elizabeth rose to high favour  izaaks suppressed humour makes it plain that wotton had acted the scene for him from the moment of leaving the long rapier at the door  again telling how wotton in his peaceful hours as provost of eton intended to write a life of luther he says that king charles diverted him from his purpose to attempting a history of england by a persuasive loving violence to which may be added a promise of 500 pounds a year  he likes these parenthetic touches as in his description of donne always preaching to himself like an angel from a cloudbut in none  again of a commendation of one of his heroes he says it is a known truththough it be in verse  a memory of the days when izaak was an amorist and shone in love ditties appears thus  he is speaking of donne     love is a flattering mischief    a passion that carries us to    commit errors with as much ease as whirlwinds remove feathers     the tears of lovers or beauty dressed in sadness are observed to    have in them a charming sadness and to become very often too strong    to be resisted  these are examples of waltons sympathy his power of portraitdrawing is especially attested by his study of donne as the young gallant and poet the unhappy lover the man of state out of place and neglected the heavily burdened father the conscientious scholar the charming yet ascetic preacher and divine the saint who dying makes himself in his own shroud an emblem of mortality  as an example of waltons style take the famous vision of dr donne in paris  he had left his wife expecting her confinement     two days after their arrival there mr donne was left alone in that    room in which sir robert and he and some other friends had dined    together  to this place sir robert returned within half an hour and    as he left so he found mr donne alone but in such an ecstacy and    so altered as to his looks as amazed sir robert to behold him    insomuch that he earnestly desired mr donne to declare what had    befallen him in the short time of his absence  to which mr donne was    not able to make a present answer but after a long and perplexed    pause did at last say i have seen a dreadful vision since i saw    you i have seen my dear wife pass twice by me through this room with    her hair hanging about her shoulders and a dead child in her arms    this i have seen since i saw you  to which sir robert replied    sure sir you have slept since i saw you and this is the result of    some melancholy dream which i desire you to forget for you are now    awake  to which mr donnes reply was i cannot be surer that i now    live than that i have not slept since i saw you and i am as sure that    at her second appearing she stopped and looked me in the face and    vanished      and upon examination the abortion proved to be the    same day and about the very hour that mr donne affirmed he saw her    pass by him in his chamber         and though it is most certain that two lutes being both    strung and tuned to an equal pitch and then one played upon the    other that is not touched being laid upon a table at a fit distance    will like an echo to a trumpet warble a faint audible harmony in    answer to the same tune yet many will not believe there is any such    thing as a sympathy of souls and i am well pleased that every reader    do enjoy his own opinion      he then appeals to authority as of brutus st monica saul st peter     more observations of this nature and inferences from them might be    made to gain the relation a firmer belief but i forbear lest i that    intended to be but a relator may be thought to be an engaged person    for the proving what was related to me    by one who had it from    dr donne  walpole was no boswell worthy boswell would have crossexamined dr donne himself  of dreams he writes     common dreams are but a senseless paraphrase on our waking thoughts    or of the business of the day past or are the result of our over    engaged affections when we betake ourselves to rest    yet    almighty god though the causes of dreams be often unknown hath even    in these latter times also by a certain illumination of the soul in    sleep discovered many things that human wisdom could not foresee  walton is often charged with superstition and the enlightened editor of the eighteenth century excised all the scene of mrs donnes wraith as too absurd  but walton is a very fair witness  donne a man of imagination was he tells us in a perturbed anxiety about mrs donne the event was after dinner  the story is by waltons admission at second hand  thus in the language of the learned in such matters the tale is not evidential  walton explains it if true as a result of sympathy of soulswhat is now called telepathy  but he is content that every man should have his own opinion  in the same way he writes of the seers in the wotton family god did seem to speak to many of this family the wottons in dreams and thomas wottons dreams did usually prove true both in foretelling things to come and discovering things past  thus he dreamed that five townsmen and poor scholars were robbing the university chest at oxford  he mentioned this in a letter to his son at oxford and the letter arriving just after the robbery led to the discovery of the culprits  yet walton states the causes and nature of dreams in general with perfect sobriety and clearness  his tales of this sort were much to johnsons mind as to southeys  but walton cannot fairly be called superstitious granting the age in which he lived  visions like dr donnes still excite curious comment  to that cruel superstition of his age witchcraft i think there is no allusion in walton  almost as uncanny however is his account of donnes preparation for death     several charcoal fires being first made in his large study he    brought with him into that place his windingsheet in his hand and    having put off all his clothes had this sheet put on him and so tied    with knots at his head and feet and his hands so placed as dead    bodies are usually fitted to be shrouded and put into their coffin or    grave  upon this urn he thus stood with his eyes shut and with so    much of the sheet turned aside as might show his lean pale and death    like face which was purposely turned towards the east from which he    expected the second coming of his and our saviour jesus  in this    posture he was drawn at his just height and when the picture was    fully finished he caused it to be set by his bedside where it    continued and became his hourly object till death  thus donne made ready to meet the common fate     that body which once was a temple of the holy ghost is now become a    small quantity of christian ashes  but i shall see it reanimated  this is the very voice of faith  walton was indeed an assured believer and to his mind the world offered no insoluble problem  but we may say of him in the words of a poet whom he quotes     many a one    owes to his country his religion    and in another would as strongly grow    had but his nurse or mother taught him so  in his account of donnes early theological studies of the differences between rome and anglicanism it is manifest that izaak thinks these differences matters of no great moment  they are not for simple men to solve donne has taken that trouble for him besides he is an englishman and     owes to his country his religion  he will be no covenanter and writes with disgust of an intruded scots minister whose first action was to cut down the ancient yews in the churchyard  izaaks religion and all his life were rooted in the past like the yewtree  he is what he calls the passive peaceable protestant  the common people in this nation he writes think they are not wise unless they be busy about what they understand not and especially about religion as bunyan was busy at that very moment  in waltons opinion the plain facts of religion and of consequent morality are visible as the sun at noonday  the vexed questions are for the learned and are solved variously by them  a man must follow authority as he finds it established in his own country unless he has the learning and genius of a donne  to these or equivalents for these in a special privy inspiration the common people of his day and ever since elizabeths day were pretending  this was the inevitable result of the translation of the bible into english  walton quotes with approval a remark of a witty italian on a populace which was universally occupied with freewill and predestination  the fruits walton saw in preaching corporals antinomian trusty tompkinses quakers who ran about naked barking presbyterians who cut down old yewtrees and a parliament of saints  walton took no kind of joy in the general emancipation of the human spirit  the clergy he confessed were not what he wished them to be but they were better than quakers naked and ululant  to love god and his neighbour and to honour the king was waltons unperplexed religion  happily he was saved from the view of the errors and the fall of james ii a king whom it was not easy to honour his social philosophy was one of established rank tempered by equity and christian charity  if anything moves his tranquil spirit it is the remorseless greed of him who takes his fellowservant by the throat and exacts the uttermost penny  how sanderson saved a poor farmer from the greed of an extortionate landlord walton tells in his life of the prelate adding this reflection     it may be noted that in this age there are a sort of people so unlike    the god of mercy so void of the bowels of pity that they love only    themselves and their children love them so as not to be concerned    whether the rest of mankind waste their days in sorrow or shame    people that are cursed with riches and a mistake that nothing but    riches can make them and theirs happy  thus walton appears this is the picture of his own disposition in the lives  he is a kind of antithesis to john knox  men like walton are not to be approached for new ideas  they will never make a new world at a blow they will never enable us to understand but they can teach us to endure and even to enjoy the world  their example is alluring     even the ashes of the just    smell sweet and blossom in the dust     the compleat angler   franck as we saw called walton a plagiary  he was a plagiary in the same sense as virgil and lord tennyson and robert burns and indeed homer and all poets  the compleat angler the father of so many books is the child of a few  walton not only adopts the opinions and advice of the authors whom he cites but also follows the manner to a certain extent of authors whom he does not quote  his very exordium his keynote echoes as sir harris nicolas observes the opening of a treatise of the nature of god london 1599  the treatise starts with a conversation between a gentleman and a scholar it commences     gent  well overtaken sir     scholar  you are welcome gentleman  a more important source is the treatyse of fysshynge wyth an angle commonly attributed to dame juliana barnes printed at westminster 1496  a manuscript probably of 14301450 has been published by mr satchell london 1883  this book may be a translation of an unknown french original  it opens     soloman in hys paraboles seith that a glad spirit maket a flowryng    age  that ys to sey a feyre age and a longe like waltons own    and sith hyt ys so i aske this question wyche bynne the menys and    cause to reduce a man to a mery spryte  the angler schall have hys    holsom walke and mery at hys owne ease and also many a sweyt eayr of    divers erbis and flowres that schall make hym ryght hongre and well    disposed in hys body  he schall heyr the melodies melodious of the    ermony of byrde he schall se also the yong swannes and signetes    folowing ther eyrours duckes cootes herons and many other fowlys    with ther brodys wyche me semyt better then all the noyse of houndes    and blastes of hornes and other gamys that fawkners or hunters can    make and yf the angler take the fyssche hardly then ys ther no man    meryer then he in his sprites  this is the very sprite of walton this has that vernal and matutinal air of opening european literature full of birds music and redolent of dawn  this is the note to which the age following walton would not listen  in matter of fact again izaak follows the ancient treatise  we know his jury of twelve flies the treatise says     these ben the xij flyes wyth whyche ye shall angle to the trought and    graylling and dubbe like as ye shall now here me tell     marche  the donne fly the body of the donne woll and the wyngis    of the pertryche  another donne flye the body of blacke woll the    wyngis of the blackyst drake and the lay under the wynge and under    the tayle  walton has     the first is the dun fly in march the body is made of dun wool the    wings of the partridges feathers  the second is another dun fly the    body of black wool and the wings made of the black drakes feathers    and of the feathers under his tail  again the treatise has     auguste  the drake fly  the body of black wull and lappyd abowte    wyth blacke sylke winges of the mayle of the blacke drake wyth a    blacke heed  walton has     the twelfth is the dark drakefly good in august the body made with    black wool lapt about with black silk his wings are made with the    mail of the black drake with a black head  this is word for word a transcript of the fifteenth century treatise but izaak cites not the ancient treatise but mr thomas barker 6 barker in fact gives many more and more variegated flies than izaak offers in the jury of twelve which he rendered from the old treatise into modern english  sir harris nicolas says that the jury is from leonard mascalls booke of fishing with hooke and line london 1609 but mascall merely stole from the fifteenthcentury book  in cottons practice and that of the anglers vade mecum 1681 flies were as numerous as among ourselves and had in many cases the same names walton absurdly bids us let no part of the line touch the water but the fly only  barker says let the fly light first into the water  both men insist on fishing down stream which is of course the opposite of the true art for fish lie with their heads up stream and trout are best approached from behind  cotton admits of fishing both up and down as the wind and stream may serve and of course in heavy water in scotland this is all very well  but none of the old anglers to my knowledge was a dryfly fisher and izaak was no flyfisher at all  he took what he said from mascall who took it from the old treatise in which it is probable walton read and followed the pleasant and to him congenial spirit of the mediaeval angler  all these writers tooled with huge rods fifteen or eighteen feet in length and izaak had apparently never used a reel  for salmon he says some use a wheel about the middle of their rods or near their hand which is to be observed better by seeing one of them than by a large demonstration of words  mr westwood has made a catalogue of books cited by walton in his compleat angler  there is aelian who makes the first known reference to flyfishing aldrovandus de piscibus 1638 dubravius de piscibus 1559 and the english translation 1599 gerards herball 1633 gesner de piscibus sa and historia naturalis 1558 phil hollands pliny 1601 rondelet de piscibus marines 1554 silvianus aquatilium historiae 1554 these nearly exhaust waltons supply of authorities in natural history  he was devoted as we saw to authority and had a childlike faith in the fantastic theories which date from pliny  pliny hath an opinion that many flies have their birth or being from a dew that in the spring falls upon the leaves of trees  it is a pious opinion  izaak is hardly so superstitious as the author of the anglers vade mecum  i cannot imagine him taking mans fat and cats fat of each half an ounce mummy finely powdered three drains and a number of other abominations to make an oyntment according to art and when you angle anoint 8 inches of the line next the hook therewith  or take the bones and scull of a deadman at the opening of a grave and beat the same into pouder and put of this pouder in the moss wherein you keep your wormsbut others like grave earth as well  no doubt grave earth is quite as efficacious  these remarks show how izaak was equipped in books and in practical information it follows that his book is to be read not for instruction but for human pleasure  so much for what walton owed to others  for all the rest for what has made him the favourite of schoolboys and sages of poets and philosophers he is indebted to none but his maker and his genius  that he was a lover of montaigne we know and had montaigne been a fisher he might have written somewhat like izaak but without the piety the perfume and the charm  there are authors whose living voices if we know them in the flesh we seem to hear in our ears as we peruse their works  of such was mr jowett sometime master of balliol college a good man now with god  it has ever seemed to me that friends of walton must thus have heard his voice as they read him and that it reaches us too though faintly  indeed we have here a kind of picture of his own disposition as he tells us piscator is the walton whom honest nat and r roe and sir henry wotton knew on fishingdays  the book is a set of confessions without their commonly morbid turn  i write not for money but for pleasure he says methinks he drove no hard bargain with good richard marriott nor was careful and troubled about royalties on his eighteenpenny book  he regards scoffers as an abomination to mankind for indeed even dr johnson who a century later set moses browne on reprinting the compleat angler broke his jest on our suffering tribe many grave serious men pity anglers says auceps and venator styles them patient men as surely they have great need to be  for our toil like that of the husbandman hangs on the weather that heaven sends and on the flies that have their birth or being from a kind of dew and on the inscrutable caprice of fish also in england on the miller who giveth or withholdeth at his pleasure the very water that is our element the inquiring rustic who shambles up erect when we are lying low among the reeds even he disposes of our fortunes with whom as with all men we must be patient dwelling ever     with closelipped patience for our only friend    sad patience too near neighbour of despair  o the tangles more than gordian of gut on a windy day  o bitter east wind that bloweth down stream  o the young ducks that swimming between us and the trout contend with him for the blue duns in their season  o the hay grass behind us that entangles the hook  o the rocky wall that breaks it the boughs that catch it the drought that leaves the salmon stream dry the floods that fill it with turbid impossible waters  alas for the knot that breaks and for the iron that bends for the lost landingnet and the gillie with the gaff that scrapes the fish  izaak believed that fish could hear if they can their vocabulary must be full of strange oaths for all anglers are not patient men  a malison on the trout that bulge and tail on the salmon that jiggers or sulks or lightly gambols over and under the line  these things and many more we anglers endure meekly being patient men and a light world fleers at us for our very virtue  izaak of course justifies us by the example of the primitive christians and in the manner of the age drowns opposition in a flood of erudition out of place but never pedantic futile yet diverting erroneous but not dull  god is said to have spoken to a fish but never to a beast  there is a modern greek phrase by the first word of god and the second of the fish  as for angling it is somewhat like poetry men are to be born so and many are born to be both rhymers and anglers  but unlike many poets the angler resembles the adonis or darling of the sea so called because it is a loving and innocent fish and a peaceful and truly i think most anglers are so disposed to most of mankind  our saviours peculiar affection for fishermen is of course a powerful argument  and it is certain that peter james and john made converts among the twelve for the greater number of them were found together fishing by jesus after his resurrection  that amos was a goodnatured plain fisherman only walton had faith enough to believe he fixes gladly on mentions of hooks in the bible omitting homer and that excellent theocritean dialogue of the two old anglers and the fish of gold which would have delighted izaak had he known it but he was no great scholar  and let me tell you that in the scripture angling is always taken in the best sense though izaak does not dwell on tobiass enormous capture  so he ends with commendations of angling by wotton and davors dennys more probably author of the secrets of angling 1613  to these we may add wordsworth thomson scott hogg stoddart and many minor poets who loved the music of the reel  izaak next illustrates his idea of becoming mirth which excludes scripture jests and lascivious jests both of them highly distasteful to anglers  then he comes to practice beginning with chub for which i have never angled but have taken them by misadventure with a salmon fly  thence we proceed to trout and to the charming scene of the milkmaid and her songs by raleigh and marlowe i think much better than the strong lines that are now in fashion in this critical age for walton we have said was the last of the elizabethans and the new times were all for waller and dryden  chevy chace and johnny armstrong were dear to walton as to scott but through a century these old favourites were to be neglected save by mr pepys and addison  indeed there is no more curious proof of the great unhappy change then coming to make poetry a mechanic art than the circumstance that walton is much nearer to us in his likings than to the men between 1670 and 1770  gay was to sing of angling but in the strong lines that are now in fashion  all this while piscator has been angling with worm and minnow to no purpose though he picks up a trout will fill six reasonable bellies in the evening  so we leave them after their ale in fresh sheets that smell of lavender  izaaks practical advice is not of much worth we read him rather for sentences like this ill tell you scholar when i sat last on this primrose bank and looked down these meadows i thought of them as charles the emperor did of the city of florence that they were too pleasant to be looked upon but only on holydays  he did not say like fox when burke spoke of a seat under a tree with a friend a bottle and a book why a book  izaak took his book with hima practice in which at least i am fain to imitate this excellent old man  as to salmon walton scarcely speaks a true word about their habits except by accident  concerning pike he quotes the theory that they are bred by pickerel weed only as what some think  in describing the use of frogs as bait he makes the famous or infamous remark use him as though you loved him    that he may live the longer  a baitfisher may be a good man as izaak was but it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle  as coarse fish are usually caught only with bait i shall not follow izaak on to this unholy and unfamiliar ground wherein none the less grow flowers of waltons fancy and the songs of the old poets are heard  the practical angler indeed is a book to be marked with flowers marsh marigolds and fritillaries and petals of the yellow iris for the whole provokes us to content and whispers that word of the apostle study to be quiet     fishing then and now   since maui the maori hero invented barbs for hooks angling has been essentially one and the same thing  south sea islanders spin for fish with a motherofpearl lure which is also a hook and answers to our spoon  we have hooks of stone and hooks of bone and a bronze hook found in ireland has the familiar limerick bend  what homer meant by making anglers throw the horn of an ox of the stall into the sea we can only guess perhaps a horn minnow is meant or a little sheath of horn to protect the line  dead bait live bait and imitations of bait have all been employed and aelian mentions artificial mayflies used with a very short line by the illyrians  but while the same in essence angling has been improved by human ingenuity  the waltonian angler and still more his english predecessors dealt much in the homemade  the treatise of the fifteenth century bids you make your rodde of a fair staff even of a six foot long or more as ye list of hazel willow or aspe ash and beke hym in an ovyn when ye bake and let him cool and dry a four weeks or more  the pith is taken out of him with a hot iron and a yard of white hazel is similarly treated also a fair shoot of blackthorn or crabtree for a top  the butt is bound with hoops of iron the top is accommodated with a noose a hair line is looped in the noose and the angler is equipped  splicing is not used but the joints have holes to receive each other and with this instrument ye may walk and there is no man shall wit whereabout ye go  recipes are given for colouring and plaiting hair lines and directions for forging hooks  the smallest quarell needles are used for the tiniest hooks  barker 1651 makes the rod of a hasel of one piece or of two pieces set together in the most convenient manner light and gentle  he recommends the use of a single hair next the flyyou shall have more rises which is true and kill more fish which is not so likely  the most delicate striking is required with fine gut and with a single hair there must be many breakages  for salmon barker uses a rod ten feet in the butt that will carry a top of six foot pretty stiffe and strong the winder or reel barker illustrates with a totally unintelligible design  his salmon fly carries six wings perhaps he only means wings composed of six kinds of feathers but here franck is a better authority his flies being sensible and sober in colour  not many old salmon flies are in existence nor have i seen more ancient specimens than a few chiefly of peacocks feathers in the flyleaf of a book at abbotsford they were used in ireland by sir walter scotts eldest son  the controversy as to whether fish can distinguish colours was unknown to our ancestors  i am inclined to believe that for salmon size and perhaps shade light or dark with more or less of tinsel are the only important points  izaak stumbled on the idea of mr stewart author of the practical angler saying for the generality three or four flies neat and rightly made and not too big serve for a trout in most rivers all the summer  our ancestors though they did not fish with the dry fly were intent on imitating the insect on the water  as far as my own experience goes if trout are feeding on duns one dun will take them as well as another if it be properly presented  but my friend mr charles longman tells me that after failing with two trout he examined the fly on the water an olive dun and found in his book a fly which exactly matched the natural insect in colour  with this he captured his brace  such incidents look as if trout were particular to a shade but we can never be certain that the angler did not make an especially artful and delicate cast when he succeeded  sir herbert maxwell intends to make the experiment of using duns of impossible and unnatural colours if he succeeds with these on several occasions as well as with orthodox flies perhaps we may decide that trout do not distinguish hues  on a sutherland loch an angler found that trout would take flies of any colour except that of a lightgreen leaf of a tree  this rejection decidedly looked as if even sutherland loch trout exercised some discrimination  often on a loch out of three flies they will favour one and that perhaps not the trail fly  the best rule is when you find a favourite fly on a salmon river use it its special favouritism may be a superstition but at all events salmon do take it  we cannot afford to be always making experiments but mr herbert spencer busking his flies the reverse way used certainly to be at least as successful with sea trout as his less speculative neighbours in argyllshire  in making rods walton is most concerned with painting them i think a good top is worth preserving or i had not taken care to keep a top above twenty years  cotton prefers rods made in yorkshire having advanced from the homemade stage  his were spliced and kept up all through the season as he had his water at his own door while walton trudged to the lee and other streams near london when he was not fishing the itchen or shawford brook  the anglers vade mecum recommends eighteenfeet rods preferring a fir butt fashioned by the arrowmaker a hazel top and a tip of whalebone  this authority even more than walton deals in mysterious oyntments of gum ivy horseleek asafoetida mans fat cats fat powdered skulls and grave earth  a ghoulish body is the angler of the vade mecum  he recommends upstream fishing with worm in a clear water and so is a predecessor of mr stewart  when you have hooked a good fish have an especial care to keep the rod bent lest he run to the end of the line he means as does walton lest he pull the rod horizontal and break either hook or hold  an old owner of my copy adds in manuscript and hale him not to near ye top of the water lest in flaskering he break ye line  this is a favourite device of sea trout which are very apt to flasker on the top of the water  the vade mecum in advance of walton on this point recommends a swivel in minnowfishing but has no idea of an artificial minnow of silk  i have known an ingenious lady who when the bodies of her phantom minnows gave out in norway supplied their place successfully with bedquilting artfully sewn  in fact anything bright and spinning will allure fish though in the upper ettrick where large trout exist they will take the natural but perhaps never the phantom or angel minnow  i once tried a spinning alexandra fly over some large pond trout  they followed it eagerly but never took hold on the first day afterwards they would not look at it at all  the vade mecum man like dr hamilton recommends a light fly for a light day a dark fly for a dark day and dark weather others hold the converse opinion  every one agrees that the smallness of the flies should be in proportion to the lowness of the water and the advance of summer 7  our ancestors apparently used only one fly at a time in rapid rivers with wet fly two three or in lochs like loch leven even four are employed  to my mind more than two only cause entanglements of the tackle  the old english anglers knew of course little or nothing of loch fishing using bait in lakes  the great length of their rods made reels less necessary and they do not seem to have waded much  a modern angler casting upwards from the middle of the stream with a ninefoot rod would have astonished walton  they dealt with trout less educated than ours and tooled with much coarser and heavier implements  they had no fine scruples about bait of every kind any more than the scots have and barker loved a lobworm fished on the surface in a dark night  he was a potfisher and had been a cook  he could catch a huge basket of trout and dress them in many different waysbroyled calvored hot with antchovaes sauce boyled soused stewed fried battered with eggs roasted baked calvored cold and marilled or potted also marrionated barker instructs my lord montague to fish with salmon roe a thing prohibited and very popular in scotland  if i had known it but twenty years agoe i would have gained a hundred pounds onely with that bait  i am bound in duty to divulge it to your honour and not to carry it to my grave with me  i do desire that men of quality should have it that delight in that pleasure the greedy angler will murmur at me but for that i care not  barker calls salmon roe an experience i have found of late the best bait for a trout that i have seen in all my time and it is the most deadly in the eddy of a turbid water  perhaps trout would take caviare which is not forbidden by the law of the land  any unscrupulous person may make the experiment and argue the matter out with the waterbailie  but in my country it is more usual to duck that official and go on netting sniggling salmonroeing and destroying sport in the sacred name of liberty     scots wha fish wi salmon roe    scots wha sniggle as ye go    wull ye stand the bailie  no    let the limmer die     nows the day and nows the time    poison a the burns wi lime    fishing fairs a dastard crime    were for fishing free  ydle persones sholde have but lyttyl mesure in the sayd disporte of fysshyng says our old treatise but in southern scotland they have left few fish to dysporte with and the trout is like to become an extinct animal  izaak would especially have disliked fishing competitions which by dint of the multitude of anglers turn the contemplative mans recreation into a crowded skirmish and we would repeat his remark the rabble herd themselves together a dozen in one pool often and endeavour to govern and act in spite of authority  for my part had i a river i would gladly let all honest anglers that use the fly cast line in it but where there is no protection then nets poison dynamite slaughter of fingerlings and unholy baits devastate the fish so that free fishing spells no fishing at all  this presses most hardly on the artisan who fishes fair a member of a large class with whose pastime only a churl would wish to interfere  we are now compelled if we would catch fish to seek
