a longlived family and the gout is an uncertain disease  we have active at the present writing place aux dames  1 lady caroline coventry niece of sir frederick  2 faraday huxley little son of henry and grace little deceased  sequitur to the above a hero and heroine    chapter ii  on the death of his parents faraday little was taken to raby hall in accepting his guardianship mr raby struggled stoutly against two prejudices faraday was plainlooking and sceptical  handsome is as handsome does sweetheart pleaded jael interceding for the orphan with arms that were still beautiful dear knows it is not his fault if he does not look likehis father she added with a great gulp  jael was a woman and vindicated her womanhood by never entirely forgiving a former rival  its not that alone madam screamed raby but dm it the little rascals a scientistan atheist a radical a scoffer disbelieves in the bible maam is full of this darwinian stuff about natural selection and descent  descent forsooth  in my day madam gentlemen were content to trace their ancestors back to gentlemen and not tomonkeys  dear heart the boy is clever urged jael  clever roared raby what does a gentleman want with cleverness    chapter iii  young little was clever  at seven he had constructed a telescope at nine a flyingmachine  at ten he saved a valuable life  norwood park was the adjacent estatea lordly domain dotted with red deer and black trunks but scrupulously kept with gravelled roads as hard and blue as steel  there little was strolling one summer morning meditating on a new top with concealed springs  at a little distance before him he saw the flutter of lace and ribbons  a young lady a very young ladysay of seven summerstricked out in the crying abominations of the present fashion stood beside a low bush  her nurserymaid was not present possibly owing to the fact that john the footman was also absent  suddenly little came towards her  excuse me but do you know what those berries are  he was pointing to the low bush filled with dark clusters of shiningsuspiciously shiningfruit  certainly they are blueberries  pardon me you are mistaken  they belong to quite another family  miss impudence drew herself up to her full height exactly three feet nine and a half inches and curling an eight of an inch of scarlet lip said scornfully  your family perhaps  faraday little smiled in the superiority of boyhood over girlhood  i allude to the classification  that plant is the belladonna or deadly nightshade  its alkaloid is a narcotic poison  sauciness turned pale  ihavejusteatensome  and began to whimper  o dear what shall i do  then did it i e wrung her small fingers and cried  pardon me one moment  little passed his arm around her neck and with his thumb opened widely the patricianveined lids of her sweet blue eyes  thank heaven there is yet no dilation of the pupil it is not too late  he cast a rapid glance around  the nozzle and about three feet of garden hose lay near him  open your mouth quick  it was a pretty kissable mouth  but young little meant business he put the nozzle down her pink throat as far as it would go  now dont move  he wrapped his handkerchief around a hoopstick  then he inserted both in the other end of the stiff hose  it fitted snugly  he shoved it in and then drew it back  nature abhors a vacuum  the young patrician was as amenable to this law as the child of the lowest peasant  she succumbed  it was all over in a minute  then she burst into a small fury  you nasty badugly boy  young little winced but smiled  stimulants he whispered to the frightened nurserymaid who approached good evening  he was gone    chapter iv  the breach between young little and mr raby was slowly widening little found objectionable features in the hall  this black oak ceiling and wainscoating is not as healthful as plaster besides it absorbs the light  the bedroom ceiling is too low the elizabethan architects knew nothing of ventilation  the color of that oak panelling which you admire is due to an excess of carbon and the exuvia from the pores of your skin  leave the house bellowed raby before the roof falls on your sacrilegious head  as little left the house lady caroline and a handsome boy of about littles age entered  lady caroline recoiled and thenblushed little glared he instinctively felt the presence of a rival    chapter v  little worked hard  he studied night and day  in five years he became a lecturer then a professor  he soared as high as the clouds he dipped as low as the cellars of the london poor  he analyzed the london fog and found it two parts smoke one disease one unmentionable abominations  he published a pamphlet which was violently attacked  then he knew he had done something  but he had not forgotten caroline  he was walking one day in the zoological gardens and he came upon a pretty pictureflesh and blood too  lady caroline feeding buns to the bears  an exquisite thrill passed through his veins  she turned her sweet face and their eyes met  they recollected their first meeting seven years before but it was his turn to be shy and timid  wonderful power of age and sex  she met him with perfect selfpossession  well meant but indigestible i fear he alluded to the buns  a clever person like yourself can easily correct that she the slyboots was thinking of something else  in a few moments they were chatting gayly  little eagerly descanted upon the different animals she listened with delicious interest  an hour glided delightfully away  after this sunshine clouds  to them suddenly entered mr raby and a handsome young man  the gentlemen bowed stiffly and looked viciousas they felt  the lady of this quartette smiled amiably as she did not feel  looking at your ancestors i suppose said mr raby pointing to the monkeys we will not disturb you  come  and he led caroline away  little was heartsick  he dared not follow them  but an hour later he saw something which filled his heart with bliss unspeakable  lady caroline with a divine smile on her face feeding the monkeys    chapter vi  encouraged by love little worked hard upon his new flyingmachine his labors were lightened by talking of the beloved one with her french maid therese whom he had discreetly bribed  mademoiselle therese was venal like all her class but in this instance i fear she was not bribed by british gold  strange as it may seem to the british mind it was british genius british eloquence british thought that brought her to the feet of this young savan  i believe said lady caroline one day interrupting her maid in a glowing eulogium upon the skill of m leetelli believe you are in love with this professor  a quick flush crossed the olive cheek of therese which lady caroline afterward remembered  the eventful day of trial came  the public were gathered impatient and scornful as the pigheaded public are apt to be  in the open area a long cylindrical balloon in shape like a bologna sausage swayed above the machine from which like some enormous bird caught in a net it tried to free itself  a heavy rope held it fast to the ground  little was waiting for the ballast when his eye caught lady carolines among the spectators  the glance was appealing  in a moment he was at her side  i should like so much to get into the machine said the archhypocrite demurely  are you engaged to marry young raby said little bluntly  as you please she said with a courtesy do i take this as a refusal  little was a gentleman  he lifted her and her lapdog into the car  how nice it wont go off  no the rope is strong and the ballast is not yet in  a report like a pistol a cry from the spectators a thousand hands stretched to grasp the parted rope and the balloon darted upward  only one hand of that thousand caught the ropelittles  but in the same instant the horrorstricken spectators saw him whirled from his feet and borne upward still clinging to the rope into space    chapter vii   the right of dramatization of this and succeeding chapters is reserved by the writer   lady caroline fainted  the cold watery nose of her dog on her cheek brought her to herself  she dared not look over the edge of the car she dared not look up to the bellying monster above her bearing her to death  she threw herself on the bottom of the car and embraced the only living thing spared herthe poodle  then she cried  then a clear voice came apparently out of the circumambient air  may i trouble you to look at the barometer  she put her head over the car  little was hanging at the end of a long rope  she put her head back again  in another moment he saw her perplexed blushing face over the edgeblissful sight  o please dont think of coming up  stay there do  little stayed  of course she could make nothing out of the barometer and said so  little smiled  will you kindly send it down to me  but she had no string or cord  finally she said wait a moment  little waited  this time her face did not appear  the barometer came slowly down at the end ofa staylace  the barometer showed a frightful elevation  little looked up at the valve and said nothing  presently he heard a sigh  then a sob  then rather sharply  why dont you do something    chapter viii  little came up the rope hand over hand  lady caroline crouched in the farther side of the car  fido the poodle whined  poor thing said lady caroline its hungry  do you wish to save the dog said little  yes  give me your parasol  she handed little a goodsized affair of lace and silk and whalebone none of your sunshades  little examined its ribs carefully  give me the dog  lady caroline hurriedly slipped a note under the dogs collar and passed over her pet  little tied the dog to the handle of the parasol and launched them both into space  the next moment they were slowly but tranquilly sailing to the earth  a parasol and a parachute are distinct but not different  be not alarmed he will get his dinner at some farmhouse  where are we now  that opaque spot you see is london fog  those twin clouds are north and south america  jerusalem and madagascar are those specks to the right  lady caroline moved nearer she was becoming interested  then she recalled herself and said freezingly how are we going to descend  by opening the valve  why dont you open it then  because the valvestring is broken    chapter ix  lady caroline fainted  when she revived it was dark  they were apparently cleaving their way through a solid block of black marble she moaned and shuddered  i wish we had a light  i have no lucifers said little  i observe however that you wear a necklace of amber  amber under certain conditions becomes highly electrical  permit me  he took the amber necklace and rubbed it briskly  then he asked her to present her knuckle to the gem  a bright spark was the result  this was repeated for some hours  the light was not brilliant but it was enough for the purposes of propriety and satisfied the delicately minded girl  suddenly there was a tearing hissing noise and a smell of gas little looked up and turned pale  the balloon at what i shall call the pointed end of the bologna sausage was evidently bursting from increased pressure  the gas was escaping and already they were beginning to descend  little was resigned but firm  if the silk gives way then we are lost  unfortunately i have no rope nor material for binding it  the womans instinct had arrived at the same conclusion sooner than the mans reason  but she was hesitating over a detail  will you go down the rope for a moment she said with a sweet smile  little went down  presently she called to him  she held something in her handa wonderful invention of the seventeenth century improved and perfected in this a pyramid of sixteen circular hoops of light yet strong steel attached to each other by cloth bands  with a cry of joy little seized them climbed to the balloon and fitted the elastic hoops over its conical end  then he returned to the car  we are saved  lady caroline blushing gathered her slim but antique drapery against the other end of the car    chapter x  they were slowly descending  presently lady caroline distinguished the outlines of raby hall  i think i will get out here she said  little anchored the balloon and prepared to follow her  not so my friend she said with an arch smile  we must not be seen together  people might talk  farewell  little sprang again into the balloon and sped away to america  he came down in california oddly enough in front of hardins door at dutch flat  hardin was just examining a specimen of ore  you are a scientist can you tell me if that is worth anything he said handing it to little  little held it to the light  it contains ninety per cent of silver  hardin embraced him  can i do anything for you and why are you here  little told his story  hardin asked to see the rope  then he examined it carefully  ah this was cut not broken  with a knife asked little  no  observe both sides are equally indented  it was done with a scissors  just heaven gasped little  therese    chapter xi  little returned to london  passing through london one day he met a dogfancier  buy a nice poodle sir  something in the animal attracted his attention  fido he gasped  the dog yelped  little bought him  on taking off his collar a piece of paper rustled to the floor  he knew the handwriting and kissed it  it ran   to the hon augustus rabyi cannot marry you  if i marry any one sly puss it will be the man who has twice saved my lifeprofessor little  caroline coventry   and she did     lothaw  or  the adventures of a young gentleman in search of a religion  by mr benjamins    chapter i  i remember him a little boy said the duchess  his mother was a dear friend of mine you know she was one of my bridesmaids  and you have never seen him since mamma asked the oldest married daughter who did not look a day older than her mother  never he was an orphan shortly after  i have often reproached myself but it is so difficult to see boys  this simple yet firstclass conversation existed in the morningroom of plusham where the mistress of the palatial mansion sat involved in the sacred privacy of a circle of her married daughters  one dexterously applied golden knittingneedles to the fabrication of a purse of floss silk of the rarest texture which none who knew the almost fabulous wealth of the duke would believe was ever destined to hold in its silken meshes a less sum than l1000000 another adorned a slipper exclusively with seed pearls a third emblazoned a page with rare pigments and the finest quality of gold leaf  beautiful forms leaned over frames glowing with embroidery and beautiful frames leaned over forms inlaid with motherofpearl  others more remote occasionally burst into melody as they tried the passages of a new and exclusive air given to them in ms by some titled and devoted friend for the private use of the aristocracy alone and absolutely prohibited for publication  the duchess herself the superlative of beauty wealth and position was married to the highest noble in the three kingdoms those who talked about such matters said that their progeny were exactly like their parentsa peculiarity of the aristocratic and wealthy  they all looked like brothers and sisters except their parents who such was their purity of blood the perfection of their manners and the opulence of their condition might have been taken for their own childrens elder son and daughter  the daughters with one exception were all married to the highest nobles in the land  that exception was the lady coriander who there being no vacancy above a marquis and a rental of l1000000 waited  gathered around the refined and sacred circle of their breakfasttable with their glittering coronets which in filial respect to their fathers tory instincts and their mothers ritualistic tastes they always wore on their regal brows the effect was dazzling as it was refined  it was this peculiarity and their strong family resemblance which led their brotherinlaw the goodhumored st addlegourd to say that pon my soul you know the whole precious mob looked like a ghastly pack of court cards you know  st addlegourd was a radical  having a rentroll of l15000000 and belonging to one of the oldest families in britain he could afford to be  mamma ive just dropped a pearl said the lady coriander bending over the persian hearthrug  from your lips sweet friend said lothaw who came of age and entered the room at the same moment  no from my work  it was a very valuable pearl mamma papa gave isaacs and sons l50000 for the two  ah indeed said the duchess languidly rising let us go to luncheon  but your grace interposed lothaw who was still quite young and had dropped on allfours on the carpet in search of the missing gem consider the value  dear friend interposed the duchess with infinite tact gently lifting him by the tails of his dresscoat i am waiting for your arm    chapter ii  lothaw was immensely rich  the possessor of seventeen castles fifteen villas nine shootingboxes and seven town houses he had other estates of which he had not even heard  everybody at plusham played croquet and none badly  next to their purity of blood and great wealth the family were famous for this accomplishment  yet lothaw soon tired of the game and after seriously damaging his aristocratically large foot in an attempt to tight croquet the lady aniseeds ball he limped away to join the duchess  im going to the hennery she said  let me go with you i dearly love fowlsbroiled he added thoughtfully  the duke gave lady montairy some large cochins the other day continued the duchess changing the subject with delicate tact           lady montairy          quite contrairy      how do your cochins grow   sang lothaw gayly  the duchess looked shocked  after a prolonged silence lothaw abruptly and gravely said  if you please maam when i come into my property i should like to build some improved dwellings for the poor and marry lady coriander  you amaze me dear friend and yet both your aspirations are noble and eminently proper said the duchess coriander is but a childand yet she added looking graciously upon her companion for the matter of that so are you    chapter iii  mr putney giless was lothaws first grand dinnerparty  yet by carefully watching the others he managed to acquit himself creditably and avoided drinking out of the fingerbowl by first secretly testing its contents with a spoon  the conversation was peculiar and singularly interesting  then you think that monogamy is simply a question of the thermometer said mrs putney giles to her companion  i certainly think that polygamy should be limited by isothermal lines replied lothaw  i should say it was a matter of latitude observed a loud talkative man opposite  he was an oxford professor with a taste for satire and had made himself very obnoxious to the company during dinner by speaking disparagingly of a former wellknown chancellor of the exchequera great statesman and brilliant novelistwhom he feared and hated  suddenly there was a sensation in the room among the females it absolutely amounted to a nervous thrill  his eminence the cardinal was announced  he entered with great suavity of manner and after shaking hands with everybody asking after their relatives and chucking the more delicate females under the chin with a highbred grace peculiar to his profession he sat down saying and how do we all find ourselves this evening my dears in several different languages which he spoke fluently  lothaws heart was touched  his deeply religious convictions were impressed  he instantly went up to this gifted being confessed and received absolution  tomorrow he said to himself i will partake of the communion and endow the church with my vast estates  for the present ill let the improved cottages go    chapter iv  as lothaw turned to leave the cardinal he was struck by a beautiful face  it was that of a matron slim but shapely as an ionic column her face was grecian with corinthian temples hellenic eyes that looked from jutting eyebrows like dormerwindows in an attic forehead completed her perfect athenian outline  she wore a black frockcoat tightly buttoned over her bloomer trousers and a standing collar  your lordship is struck by that face said a social parasite  i am who is she  her name is mary ann  she is married to an american and has lately invented a new religion  ah said lothaw eagerly with difficulty restraining himself from rushing toward her  yes shall i introduce you  lothaw thought of lady corianders high church proclivities of the cardinal and hesitated no i thank you not now    chapter v  lothaw was maturing  he had attended two womans rights conventions three fenian meetings had dined at whites and had danced visavis to a prince of the blood and eaten off of gold plates at crecy house  his stables were near oxford and occupied more ground than the university  he was driving over there one day when he perceived some rustics and menials endeavoring to stop a pair of runaway horses attached to a carriage in which a lady and gentleman were seated calmly awaiting the termination of the accident with highbred courtesy lothaw forbore to interfere until the carriage was overturned the occupants thrown out and the runaways secured by the servants when he advanced and offered the lady the exclusive use of his oxford stables  turning upon him a face whose perfect hellenic details he remembered she slowly dragged a gentleman from under the wheels into the light and presented him with ladylike dignity as her husband majorgeneral camperdown an american  ah said lothaw carelessly i believe i have some land there if i mistake not my agent mr putney giles lately purchased the state ofillinoisi think you call it  exactly  as a former resident of the city of chicago let me introduce myself as your tenant  lothaw bowed graciously to the gentleman who except that he seemed better dressed than most englishmen showed no other signs of inferiority and plebeian extraction  we have met before said lothaw to the lady as she leaned on his arm while they visited his stables the university and other places of interest in oxford  pray tell me what is this new religion of yours  it is woman suffrage free love mutual affinity and communism embrace it and me  lothaw did not know exactly what to do  she however soothed and sustained his agitated frame and sealed with an embrace his speechless form  the general approached and coughed slightly with gentlemanly tact  my husband will be too happy to talk with you further on this subject she said with quiet dignity as she regained the generals side  come with us to oneida  brook farm is a thing of the past    chapter vi  as lothaw drove toward his countryseat the mural enclosure he observed a crowd apparently of the working class gathered around a singularlooking man in the picturesque garb of an ethiopian serenader what does he say inquired lothaw of his driver  the man touched his hat respectfully and said my mary ann  my mary ann  lothaws heart beat rapidly  who was this mysterious foreigner  he had heard from lady coriander of a certain popish plot but could he connect mr camperdown with it  the spectacle of two hundred men at arms who advanced to meet him at the gates of the mural enclosure drove all else from the still youthful and impressible mind of lothaw  immediately behind them on the steps of the baronial halls were ranged his retainers led by the chief cook and bottlewasher and head crumbremover  on either side were two companies of laundrymaids preceded by the chief crimper and fluter supporting a long ancestral line on which depended the family linen and under which the youthful lord of the manor passed into the halls of his fathers  twentyfour scullions carried the massive gold and silver plate of the family on their shoulders and deposited it at the feet of their master the spoons were then solemnly counted by the steward and the perfect ceremony ended  lothaw sighed  he sought out the gorgeously gilded taj or sacred mausoleum erected to his grandfather in the second story front room and wept over the man he did not know  he wandered alone in his magnificent park and then throwing himself on a grassy bank pondered on the great first cause and the necessity of religion  i will send mary ann a handsome present said lothaw thoughtfully    chapter vii  each of these pearls my lord is worth fifty thousand guineas said mr amethyst the fashionable jeweler as he lightly lifted a large shovelful from a convenient bin behind his counter  indeed said lothaw carelessly i should prefer to see some expensive ones  some number sixes i suppose said mr amethyst taking a couple from the apex of a small pyramid that lay piled on the shelf these are about the size of the duchess of billingsgates but they are in finer condition  the fact is her grace permits her two children the marquis of smithfield and the duke of st gilestwo sweet pretty boys my lordto use them as marbles in their games  pearls require some attention and i go down there regularly twice a week to clean them  perhaps your lordship would like some ropes of pearls  about half a cables length said lothaw shortly and send them to my lodgings  mr amethyst became thoughtful  i am afraid i have not the exact numberthat isexcuse me one moment  i will run over to the tower and borrow a few from the crown jewels  and before lothaw could prevent him he seized his hat and left lothaw alone  his position certainly was embarrassing  he could not move without stepping on costly gems which had rolled from the counter the rarest diamonds lay scattered on the shelves untold fortunes in priceless emeralds lay within his grasp  although such was the aristocratic purity of his blood and the strength of his religious convictions that he probably would not have pocketed a single diamond still he could not help thinking that he might be accused of taking some  you can search me if you like he said when mr amethyst returned but i assure you upon the honor of a gentleman that i have taken nothing  enough my lord said mr amethyst with a low bow we never search the aristocracy    chapter viii  as lothaw left mr amethysts he ran against general camperdown how is mary ann he asked hurriedly  i regret to state that she is dying said the general with a grave voice as he removed his cigar from his lips and lifted his hat to lothaw  dying said lothaw incredulously  alas too true replied the general  the engagements of a long lecturing season exposure in travelling by railway during the winter and the imperfect nourishment afforded by the refreshments along the road have told on her delicate frame  but she wants to see you before she dies  here is the key of my lodging  i will finish my cigar out here  lothaw hardly recognized those wasted hellenic outlines as he entered the dimly lighted room of the dying woman  she was already a classic ruinas wrecked and yet as perfect as the parthenon he grasped her hand silently  openair speaking twice a week and saleratus bread in the rural districts have brought me to this she said feebly but it is well the cause progresses  the tyrant man succumbs  lothaw could only press her hand  promise me one thing  dontwhatever you dobecome a catholic  why  the church does not recognize divorce  and now embrace me  i would prefer at this supreme moment to introduce myself to the next world through the medium of the best society in this  good by when i am dead be good enough to inform my husband of the fact    chapter ix  lothaw spent the next six months on an aryan island in an aryan climate and with an aryan race  this is an aryan landscape said his host and that is a mary ann statue  it was in fact a fulllength figure in marble of mrs general camperdown  if you please i should like to become a pagan said lothaw one day after listening to an impassioned discourse on greek art from the lips of his host  but that night on consulting a wellknown spiritual medium lothaw received a message from the late mrs general camperdown advising him to return to england  two days later he presented himself at plusham  the young ladies are in the garden said the duchess  dont you want to go and pick a rose she added with a gracious smile and the nearest approach to a wink that was consistent with her patrician bearing and aquiline nose  lothaw went and presently returned with the blushing coriander upon his arm  bless you my children said the duchess  then turning to lothaw she said you have simply fulfilled and accepted your inevitable destiny  it was morally impossible for you to marry out of this family  for the present the church of england is safe     muckamuck  a modern indian novel  after cooper    chapter i  it was toward the close of a bright october day  the last rays of the setting sun were reflected from one of those sylvan lakes peculiar to the sierras of california  on the right the curling smoke of an indian village rose between the columns of the lofty pines while to the left the log cottage of judge tompkins embowered in buckeyes completed the enchanting picture  although the exterior of the cottage was humble and unpretentious and in keeping with the wildness of the landscape its interior gave evidence of the cultivation and refinement of its inmates  an aquarium containing goldfishes stood on a marble centretable at one end of the apartment while a magnificent grand piano occupied the other  the floor was covered with a yielding tapestry carpet and the walls were adorned with paintings from the pencils of van dyke rubens tintoretto michael angelo and the productions of the more modern turner kensett church and bierstadt  although judge tompkins had chosen the frontiers of civilization as his home it was impossible for him to entirely forego the habits and tastes of his former life  he was seated in a luxurious armchair writing at a mahogany ecritoire while his daughter a lovely young girl of seventeen summers plied her crochetneedle on an ottoman beside him  a bright fire of pine logs flickered and flamed on the ample hearth  genevra octavia tompkins was judge tompkinss only child  her mother had long since died on the plains  reared in affluence no pains had been spared with the daughters education  she was a graduate of one of the principal seminaries and spoke french with a perfect benicia accent  peerlessly beautiful she was dressed in a white moire antique robe trimmed with tulle  that simple rosebud with which most heroines exclusively decorate their hair was all she wore in her raven locks  the judge was the first to break the silence  genevra the logs which compose yonder fire seem to have been incautiously chosen  the sibilation produced by the sap which exudes copiously therefrom is not conducive to composition  true father but i thought it would be preferable to the constant crepitation which is apt to attend the combustion of more seasoned ligneous fragments  the judge looked admiringly at the intellectual features of the graceful girl and half forgot the slight annoyances of the green wood in the musical accents of his daughter  he was smoothing her hair tenderly when the shadow of a tall figure which suddenly darkened the doorway caused him to look up    chapter ii  it needed but a glance at the newcomer to detect at once the form and features of the haughty aboriginethe untaught and untrammelled son of the forest  over one shoulder a blanket negligently but gracefully thrown disclosed a bare and powerful breast decorated with a quantity of threecent postagestamps which he had despoiled from an overland mail stage a few weeks previous  a castoff beaver of judge tompkinss adorned by a simple feather covered his erect head from beneath which his straight locks descended  his right hand hung lightly by his side while his left was engaged in holding on a pair of pantaloons which the lawless grace and freedom of his lower limbs evidently could not brook  why said the indian in a low sweet tonewhy does the pale face still follow the track of the red man  why does he pursue him even as okeechow the wildcat chases kaka the skunk why are the feet of sorreltop the white chief among the acorns of muckamuck the mountain forest  why he repeated quietly but firmly abstracting a silver spoon from the tablewhy do you seek to drive him from the wigwams of his fathers  his brothers are already gone to the happy huntinggrounds  will the pale face seek him there  and averting his face from the judge he hastily slipped a silver cakebasket beneath his blanket to conceal his emotion  muckamuck has spoken said genevra softly  let him now listen are the acorns of the mountain sweeter than the esculent and nutritious bean of the pale face miner  does my brother prize the edible qualities of the snail above that of the crisp and oleaginous bacon delicious are the grasshoppers that sport on the hillsideare they better than the dried apples of the pale faces pleasant is the gurgle of the torrent kishkish but is it better than the cluckcluck of old bourbon from the old stone bottle  ugh said the indianugh good  the white rabbit is wise her words fall as the snow on tootoonolo and the rocky heart of muckamuck is hidden  what says my brother the gray gopher of dutch flat  she has spoken muckamuck said the judge gazing fondly on his daughter  it is well  our treaty is concluded  no thank youyou need not dance the dance of snow shoes or the moccasin dance the dance of green corn or the treaty dance  i would be alone  a strange sadness overpowers me  i go said the indian  tell your great chief in washington the sachem andy that the red man is retiring before the footsteps of the adventurous pioneer  inform him if you please that westward the star of empire takes its way that the chiefs of the piute nation are for reconstruction to a man and that klamath will poll a heavy republican vote in the fall  and folding his blanket more tightly around him muckamuck withdrew    chapter iii  genevra tompkins stood at the door of the logcabin looking after the retreating overland mail stage which conveyed her father to virginia city  he may never return again sighed the young girl as she glanced at the frightfully rolling vehicle and wildly careering horsesat least with unbroken bones  should he meet with an accident  i mind me now a fearful legend familiar to my childhood can it be that the drivers on this line are privately instructed to despatch all passengers maimed by accident to prevent tedious litigation  no no  but why this weight upon my heart  she seated herself at the piano and lightly passed her hand over the keys  then in a clear mezzosoprano voice she sang the first verse of one of the most popular irish ballads        o arrah ma dheelish the distant dudheen       lies soft in the moonlight ma bouchal vourneen       the springing gossoons on the heather are still       and the caubeens and colleens are heard on the hills   but as the ravishing notes of her sweet voice died upon the air her hands sank listlessly to her side  music could not chase away the mysterious shadow from her heart  again she rose  putting on a white crape bonnet and carefully drawing a pair of lemoncolored gloves over her taper fingers she seized her parasol and plunged into the depths of the pine forest    chapter iv  genevra had not proceeded many miles before a weariness seized upon her fragile limbs and she would fain seat herself upon the trunk of a prostrate pine which she previously dusted with her handkerchief  the sun was just sinking below the horizon and the scene was one of gorgeous and sylvan beauty  how beautiful is nature murmured the innocent girl as reclining gracefully against the root of the tree she gathered up her skirts and tied a handkerchief around her throat but a low growl interrupted her meditation  starting to her feet her eyes met a sight which froze her blood with terror  the only outlet to the forest was the narrow path barely wide enough for a single person hemmed in by trees and rocks which she had just traversed  down this path in indian file came a monstrous grizzly closely followed by a california lion a wildcat and a buffalo the rear being brought up by a wild spanish bull  the mouths of the three first animals were distended with frightful significance the horns of the last were lowered as ominously  as genevra was preparing to faint she heard a low voice behind her  eternally doggone my skin ef this aint the puttiest chance yet  at the same moment a long shining barrel dropped lightly from behind her and rested over her shoulder  genevra shuddered  dern yedont move  genevra became motionless  the crack of a rifle rang through the woods  three frightful yells were heard and two sullen roars  five animals bounded into the air and five lifeless bodies lay upon the plain  the wellaimed bullet had done its work  entering the open throat of the grizzly it had traversed his body only to enter the throat of the california lion and in like manner the catamount until it passed through into the respective foreheads of the bull and the buffalo and finally fell flattened from the rocky hillside  genevra turned quickly  my preserver she shrieked and fell into the arms of natty bumpo the celebrated pike ranger of donner lake    chapter v  the moon rose cheerfully above donner lake  on its placid bosom a dugout canoe glided rapidly containing natty bumpo and genevra tompkins  both were silent  the same thought possessed each and perhaps there was sweet companionship even in the unbroken quiet  genevra bit the handle of her parasol and blushed  natty bumpo took a fresh chew of tobacco  at length genevra said as if in halfspoken revery  the soft shining of the moon and the peaceful ripple of the waves seem to say to us various things of an instructive and moral tendency  you may bet yer pile on that miss said her companion gravely its all the preachin and psalmsingin ive heern since i was a boy  noble being said miss tompkins to herself glancing at the stately pike as he bent over his paddle to conceal his emotion reared in this wild seclusion yet he has become penetrated with visible consciousness of a great first cause  then collecting herself she said aloud methinks twere pleasant to glide ever thus down the stream of life hand in hand with the one being whom the soul claims as its affinity but what am i sayingand the delicateminded girl hid her face in her hands  a long silence ensued which was at length broken by her companion  ef you mean youre on the marry he said thoughtfully i aint in no wise partikler  my husband faltered the blushing girl and she fell into his arms  in ten minutes more the loving couple had landed at judge tompkinss    chapter vi  a year has passed away  natty bumpo was returning from gold hill where he had been to purchase provisions  on his way to donner lake rumors of an indian uprising met his ears  dern their pesky skins ef they dare to touch my jenny he muttered between his clenched teeth  it was dark when he reached the borders of the lake  around a glittering fire he dimly discerned dusky figures dancing  they were in war paint  conspicuous among them was the renowned muckamuck  but why did the fingers of natty bumpo tighten convulsively around his rifle  the chief held in his hand long tufts of raven hair  the heart of the pioneer sickened as he recognized the clustering curls of genevra  in a moment his rifle was at his shoulder and with a sharp ping muckamuck leaped into the air a corpse  to knock out the brains of the remaining savages tear the tresses from the stiffening hand of muckamuck and dash rapidly forward to the cottage of judge tompkins was the work of a moment  he burst open the door  why did he stand transfixed with open mouth and distended eyeballs  was the sight too horrible to be borne  on the contrary before him in her peerless beauty stood genevra tompkins leaning on her fathers arm  yer not scalped then gasped her lover  no  i have no hesitation in saying that i am not but why this abruptness responded genevra  bumpo could not speak but frantically produced the silken tresses genevra turned her face aside  why thats her waterfall said the judge  bumpo sank fainting to the floor  the famous pike chieftain never recovered from the deceit and refused to marry genevra who died twenty years afterwards of a broken heart judge tompkins lost his fortune in wild cat  the stage passes twice a week the deserted cottage at donner lake thus was the death of muckamuck avenged     terence denville  by chls lvr    chapter i  my home  the little village of pilwiddle is one of the smallest and obscurest hamlets on the western coast of ireland  on a lofty crag overlooking the hoarse atlantic stands denvilles shot towera corruption by the peasantry of denvilles chateau so called from my greatgrandfather phelim st kemy denville who assumed the name and title of a french heiress with whom he ran away  to this fact my familiar knowledge and excellent pronunciation of the french language may be attributed as well as many of the events which covered my after life  the denvilles were always passionately fond of field sports  at the age of four i was already the boldest rider and the best shot in the country  when only eight i won the st remy cup at the pilwiddle racesriding my favorite bloodmare hellfire  as i approached the stand amidst the plaudits of the assembled multitude and cries of thrue for ye masther terence and o but its a dinville there was a slight stir among the gentry who surrounded the lord lieutenant and other titled personages whom the race had attracted thither  how young he isa mere child and yet how noblelooking said a sweet low voice which thrilled my soul  i looked up and met the full liquid orbs of the hon blanche fitzroy sackville youngest daughter of the lord lieutenant  she blushed deeply  i turned pale and almost fainted  but the cold sneering tones of a masculine voice sent the blood back again into my youthful cheek  very likely the ragged scion of one of these banditti irish gentry who has taken naturally to the road  he should be at schoolthough i warrant me his knowledge of terence will not extend beyond his own name said lord henry somerset aiddecamp to the lord lieutenant  a moment and i was perfectly calm though cold as ice dismounting and stepping to the side of the speaker i said in a low firm voice  had your lordship read terence more carefully you would have learned that banditti are sometimes proficient in other arts beside horsemanship and i touched his holster significantly with my hand  i had not read terence myself but with the skilful audacity of my race i calculated that a vague allusion coupled with a threat would embarrass him  it did  ahwhat mean you he said white with rage  enough we are observed i replied father tom will wait on you this evening and tomorrow morning my lord in the glen below pilwiddle we will meet again  father tomglen ejaculated the englishman with genuine surprise what do priests carry challenges and act as seconds in your infernal country  yes i answered scornfully why should they not  their services are more often necessary than those of a surgeon i added significantly turning away  the party slowly rode off with the exception of the hon blanche sackville who lingered for a moment behind  in an instant i was at her side  bending her blushing face over the neck of her white filly she said hurriedly  words have passed between lord somerset and yourself  you are about to fight  dont deny itbut hear me  you will meet himi know your skill of weapons  he will be at your mercy  i entreat you to spare his life  i hesitated  never i cried passionately he has insulted a denville  terence she whispered terencefor my sake  the blood rushed to my cheeks and her eyes sought the ground in bashful confusion  you love him then i cried bitterly  no no she said agitatedly no you do me wrong  iicannot explain myself  my fatherthe lady dowager sackvillethe estate of sackvillethe boroughmy uncle fitzroy somerset  ah what am i saying  forgive me  o terence she said as her beautiful head sank on my shoulder you know not what i suffer  i seized her hand and covered it with passionate kisses  but the highbred english girl recovering something of her former hauteur said hastily leave me leave me but promise  i promise i replied enthusiastically i will spare his life  thanks terencethanks and disengaging her hand from my lips she rode rapidly away  the next morning the hon captain henry somerset and myself exchanged nineteen shots in the glen and at each fire i shot away a button from his uniform  as my last bullet shot off the last button from his sleeve i remarked quietly you seem now my lord to be almost as ragged as the gentry you sneered at and rode haughtily away    chapter ii  the fighting fiftysixth  when i was nineteen years old my father sold the chateau denville and purchased my commission in the fiftysixth with the proceeds i say denville said young mcspadden a boyfaced ensign who had just joined youll represent the estate in the army if you wont in the house  poor fellow he paid for his meaningless joke with his life for i shot him through the heart the next morning youre a good fellow denville said the poor boy faintly as i knelt beside him good by  for the first time since my grandfathers death i wept  i could not help thinking that i would have been a better man if blanchebut why proceed  was she not now in florencethe belle of the english embassy  but napoleon had returned from elba  europe was in a blaze of excitement  the allies were preparing to resist the man of destiny we were ordered from gibraltar home and were soon again en route for brussels  i did not regret that i was to be placed in active service i was ambitious and longed for an opportunity to distinguish myself my garrison life in gibraltar had been monotonous and dull  i had killed five men in duel and had an affair with the colonel of my regiment who handsomely apologized before the matter assumed a serious aspect  i had been twice in love  yet these were but boyish freaks and follies  i wished to be a man  the time soon camethe morning of waterloo  but why describe that momentous battle on which the fate of the entire world was hanging twice were the fiftysixth surrounded by french cuirassiers and twice did we mow them down by our fire  i had seven horses shot under me and was mounting the eighth when an orderly rode up hastily touched his cap and handing me a despatch galloped rapidly away  i opened it hurriedly and read  let picton advance immediately on the right  i saw it all at a glance  i had been mistaken for a general officer but what was to be done  pictons division was two miles away only accessible through a heavy cross fire of artillery and musketry  but my mind was made up  in an instant i was engaged with an entire squadron of cavalry who endeavored to surround me  cutting my way through them i advanced boldly upon a battery and sabred the gunners before they could bring their pieces to bear  looking around i saw that i had in fact penetrated the french centre  before i was well aware of the locality i was hailed by a sharp voice in french  come here sir  i obeyed and advanced to the side of a little man in a cocked hat  has grouchy come  not yet sire i repliedfor it was the emperor  ha he said suddenly bending his piercing eyes on my uniform a prisoner  no sire i said proudly  a spy  i placed my hand upon my sword but a gesture from the emperor bade me forbear  you are a brave man he said  i took my snuffbox from my pocket and taking a pinch replied by handing it with a bow to the emperor  his quick eye caught the cipher on the lid  what a denville ha this accounts for the purity of your accent  any relation to roderick denville  my father sire  he was my schoolfellow at the ecole polytechnique  embrace me and the emperor fell upon my neck in the presence of his entire staff then recovering himself he gently placed in my hand his own magnificent snuffbox in exchange for mine and hanging upon my breast the cross of the legion of honor which he took from his own he bade one of his marshals conduct me back to my regiment  i was so intoxicated with the honor of which i had been the recipient that on reaching our lines i uttered a shout of joy and put spurs to my horse  the intelligent animal seemed to sympathize with my feelings and fairly flew over the ground  on a rising eminence a few yards before me stood a grayhaired officer surrounded by his staff  i dont know what possessed me but putting spurs to my horse i rode at him boldly and with one bound cleared him horse and all  a shout of indignation arose from the assembled staff  i wheeled suddenly with the intention of apologizing but my mare misunderstood me and again dashing forward once more vaulted over the head of the officer this time unfortunately uncovering him by a vicious kick of her hoof seize him roared the entire army  i was seized  as the soldiers led me away i asked the name of the grayhaired officer  thatwhy thats the duke of wellington  i fainted                                            for six months i had brainfever  during my illness ten grapeshot were extracted from my body which i had unconsciously received during the battle  when i opened my eyes i met the sweet glance of a sister of charity  blanche i stammered feebly  the same she replied  you here  yes dear but hush  its a long story  you see dear terence your grandfather married my greataunts sister and your father again married my grandmothers niece who dying without a will was according to the french law  but i do not comprehend i said  of course not said blanche with her old sweet smile youve had brainfever so go to sleep  i understood however that blanche loved me and i am now dear reader sir terence sackville k c b and lady blanche is lady sackville     selina sedilia  by miss m e bddn and mrs hny wd    chapter i  the sun was setting over sloperton grange and reddened the window of the lonely chamber in the western tower supposed to be haunted by sir edward sedilia the founder of the grange  in the dreamy distance arose the gilded mausoleum of lady felicia sedilia who haunted that portion of sedilia manor known as stiffuns acre a little to the left of the grange might have been seen a mouldering ruin known as guys keep haunted by the spirit of sir guy sedilia who was found one morning crushed by one of the fallen battlements  yet as the setting sun gilded these objects a beautiful and almost holy calm seemed diffused about the grange  the lady selina sat by an oriel window overlooking the park  the sun sank gently in the bosom of the german ocean and yet the lady did not lift her beautiful head from the finely curved arm and diminutive hand which supported it  when darkness finally shrouded the landscape she started for the sound of horsehoofs clattered over the stones of the avenue  she had scarcely risen before an aristocratic young man fell on his knees before her  my selina  edgardo  you here  yes dearest  andyouyouhaveseen nothing said the lady in an agitated voice and nervous manner turning her face aside to conceal her emotion  nothingthat is nothing of any account said edgardo  i passed the ghost of your aunt in the park noticed the spectre of your uncle in the ruined keep and observed the familiar features of the spirit of your greatgrandfather at his usual post  but nothing beyond these trifles my selina  nothing more love absolutely nothing  the young man turned his dark liquid orbs fondly upon the ingenuous face of his betrothed  my own edgardoand you still love me  you still would marry me in spite of this dark mystery which surrounds me  in spite of the fatal history of my race  in spite of the ominous predictions of my aged nurse  i would selina and the young man passed his arm around her yielding waist  the two lovers gazed at each others faces in unspeakable bliss  suddenly selina started  leave me edgardo leave me  a mysterious somethinga fatal misgivinga dark ambiguityan equivocal mistrust oppresses me  i would be alone  the young man arose and cast a loving glance on the lady  then we will be married on the seventeenth  the seventeenth repeated selina with a mysterious shudder  they embraced and parted  as the clatter of hoofs in the courtyard died away the lady selina sank into the chair she had just quitted  the seventeenth she repeated slowly with the same fateful shudder ahwhat if he should know that i have another husband living  dare i reveal to him that i have two legitimate and three natural children dare i repeat to him the history of my youth dare i confess that at the age of seven i poisoned my sister by putting verdigris in her creamtartsthat i threw my cousin from a swing at the age of twelve that the ladysmaid who incurred the displeasure of my girlhood now lies at the bottom of the horsepond  no no he is too puretoo goodtoo innocent to hear such improper conversation and her whole body writhed as she rocked to and fro in a paroxysm of grief  but she was soon calm  rising to her feet she opened a secret panel in the wall and revealed a slowmatch ready for lighting  this match said the lady selina is connected with a mine beneath the western tower where my three children are confined another branch of it lies under the parish church where the record of my first marriage is kept  i have only to light this match and the whole of my past life is swept away she approached the match with a lighted candle  but a hand was laid upon her arm and with a shriek the lady selina fell on her knees before the spectre of sir guy    chapter ii  forbear selina said the phantom in a hollow voice  why should i forbear responded selina haughtily as she recovered her courage  you know the secret of our race  i do  understand mei do not object to the eccentricities of your youth  i know the fearful destiny which pursuing you led you to poison your sister and drown your ladysmaid  i know the awful doom which i have brought upon this house  but if you make way with these children  well said the lady selina hastily  they will haunt you  well i fear them not said selina drawing her superb figure to its full height  yes but my dear child what place are they to haunt  the ruin is sacred to your uncles spirit  your aunt monopolizes the park and i must be allowed to state not unfrequently trespasses upon the grounds of others  the horsepond is frequented by the spirit of your maid and your murdered sister walks these corridors  to be plain there is no room at sloperton grange for another ghost i cannot have them in my roomfor you know i dont like children think of this rash girl and forbear  would you selina said the phantom mournfullywould you force your greatgrandfathers spirit to take lodgings elsewhere  lady selinas hand trembled the lighted candle fell from her nerveless fingers  no she cried passionately never and fell fainting to the floor    chapter iii  edgardo galloped rapidly towards sloperton  when the outline of the grange had faded away in the darkness he reined his magnificent steed beside the ruins of guys keep  it wants but a few minutes of the hour he said consulting his watch by the light of the moon  he dare not break his word  he will come he paused and peered anxiously into the darkness but come what may she is mine he continued as his thoughts reverted fondly to the fair lady he had quitted  yet if she knew all  if she knew that i were a disgraced and ruined mana felon and an outcast  if she knew that at the age of fourteen i murdered my latin tutor and forged my uncles will  if she knew that i had three wives already and that the fourth victim of misplaced confidence and my unfortunate peculiarity is expected to be at sloperton by tonights train with her baby  but no she must not know it  constance must not arrive  burke the slogger must attend to that  ha here he is  well  these words were addressed to a ruffian in a slouched hat who suddenly appeared from guys keep  i bes here measter said the villain with a disgracefully low accent and complete disregard of grammatical rules  it is well  listen im in possession of facts that will send you to the gallows  i know of the murder of bill smithers the robbery of the tollgatekeeper and the making away of the youngest daughter of sir reginald de walton  a word from me and the officers of justice are on your track  burke the slogger trembled  hark ye serve my purpose and i may yet save you  the 530 train from clapham will be due at sloperton at 925  it must not arrive  the villains eyes sparkled as he nodded at edgardo  enoughyou understand leave me    chapter iv  about half a mile from sloperton station the south clapham and medway line crossed a bridge over slopertonontrent  as the shades of evening were closing a man in a slouched hat might have been seen carrying a saw and axe under his arm hanging about the bridge  from time to time he disappeared in the shadow of its abutments but the sound of a saw and axe still betrayed his vicinity  at exactly nine oclock he reappeared and crossing to the sloperton side rested his shoulder against the abutment and gave a shove  the bridge swayed a moment and then fell with a splash into the water leaving a space of one hundred feet between the two banks  this done burke the sloggerfor it was hewith a fiendish chuckle seated himself on the divided railway track and awaited the coming of the train  a shriek from the woods announced its approach  for an instant burke the slogger saw the glaring of a red lamp  the ground trembled  the train was going with fearful rapidity  another second and it had reached the bank  burke the slogger uttered a fiendish laugh  but the next moment the train leaped across the chasm striking the rails exactly even and dashing out the life of burke the slogger sped away to sloperton  the first object that greeted edgardo as he rode up to the station on the arrival of the train was the body of burke the slogger hanging on the cowcatcher the second was the face of his deserted wife looking from the windows of a secondclass carriage    chapter v  a nameless terror seemed to have taken possession of clarissa lady selinas maid as she rushed into the presence of her mistress  o my lady such news  explain yourself said her mistress rising  an accident has happened on the railway and a man has been killed  whatnot edgardo almost screamed selina  no burke the slogger your ladyship  my first husband said lady selina sinking on her knees  just heaven i thank thee    chapter vi  the morning of the seventeenth dawned brightly over sloperton  a fine day for the wedding said the sexton to swipes the butler of sloperton grange  the aged retainer shook his head sadly  alas theres no trusting in signs he continued  seventyfive years ago on a day like this my young mistress  but he was cut short by the appearance of a stranger  i would see sir edgardo said the newcomer impatiently  the bridegroom who with the rest of the weddingtrain was about stepping into the carriage to proceed to the parish church drew the stranger aside  its done said the stranger in a hoarse whisper  ah and you buried her  with the others  enough  no more at present  meet me after the ceremony and you shall have your reward  the stranger shuffled away and edgardo returned to his bride  a trifling matter of business i had forgotten my dear selina let us proceed  and the young man pressed the timid hand of his blushing bride as he handed her into the carriage  the cavalcade rode out of the courtyard  at the same moment the deep bell on guys keep tolled ominously    chapter vii  scarcely had the weddingtrain left the grange than alice sedilia youngest daughter of lady selina made her escape from the western tower owing to a lack of watchfulness on the part of clarissa the innocent child freed from restraint rambled through the lonely corridors and finally opening a door found herself in her mothers boudoir  for some time she amused herself by examining the various ornaments and elegant trifles with which it was filled then in pursuance of a childish freak she dressed herself in her mothers laces and ribbons  in this occupation she chanced to touch a peg which proved to be a spring that opened a secret panel in the wall  alice uttered a cry of delight as she noticed what to her childish fancy appeared to be the slowmatch of a firework taking a lucifer match in her hand she approached the fuse she hesitated a moment  what would her mother and her nurse say  suddenly the ringing of the chimes of sloperton parish church met her ear  alice knew that the sound signified that the marriage party had entered the church and that she was secure from interruption  with a childish smile upon her lips alice sedilia touched off the slowmatch    chapter viii  at exactly two oclock on the seventeenth rupert sedilia who had just returned from india was thoughtfully descending the hill toward sloperton manor  if i can prove that my aunt lady selina was married before my father died i can establish my claim to sloperton grange he uttered half aloud  he paused for a sudden trembling of the earth beneath his feet and a terrific explosion as of a park of artillery arrested his progress  at the same moment he beheld a dense cloud of smoke envelop the churchyard of sloperton and the western tower of the grange seemed to be lifted bodily from its foundation  the air seemed filled with falling fragments and two dark objects struck the earth close at his feet rupert picked them up  one seemed to be a heavy volume bound in brass  a cry burst from his lips  the parish records  he opened the volume hastily  it contained the marriage of lady selina to burke the slogger  the second object proved to be a piece of parchment  he tore it open with trembling fingers  it was the missing will of sir james sedilia    chapter ix  when the bells again rang on the new parish church of sloperton it was for the marriage of sir rupert sedilia and his cousin the only remaining members of the family  five more ghosts were added to the supernatural population of sloperton grange  perhaps this was the reason why sir rupert sold the property shortly afterward and that for many years a dark shadow seemed to hang over the ruins of sloperton grange     the ninetynine guardsmen  by alxdr dms    chapter i  showing the quality of the customers of the innkeeper of provins  twenty years after the gigantic innkeeper of provins stood looking at a cloud of dust on the highway  this cloud of dust betokened the approach of a traveller travellers had been rare that season on the highway between paris and provins  the heart of the innkeeper rejoiced  turning to dame perigord his wife he said stroking his white apron  st denis make haste and spread the cloth  add a bottle of charlevoix to the table  this traveller who rides so fast by his pace must be a monseigneur  truly the traveller clad in the uniform of a musketeer as he drew up to the door of the hostelry did not seem to have spared his horse throwing his reins to the landlord he leaped lightly to the ground he was a young man of fourandtwenty and spoke with a slight gascon accent  i am hungry morbleu  i wish to dine  the gigantic innkeeper bowed and led the way to a neat apartment where a table stood covered with tempting viands  the musketeer at once set to work  fowls fish and pates disappeared before him perigord sighed as he witnessed the devastations  only once the stranger paused  wine  perigord brought wine  the stranger drank a dozen bottles finally he rose to depart  turning to the expectant landlord he said  charge it  to whom your highness said perigord anxiously  to his eminence  mazarin ejaculated the innkeeper  the same  bring me my horse and the musketeer remounting his favorite animal rode away  the innkeeper slowly turned back into the inn  scarcely had he reached the courtyard before the clatter of hoofs again called him to the doorway  a young musketeer of a light and graceful figure rode up  parbleu my dear perigord i am famishing  what have you got for dinner  venison capons larks and pigeons your excellency replied the obsequious landlord bowing to the ground  enough  the young musketeer dismounted and entered the inn seating himself at the table replenished by the careful perigord he speedily swept it as clean as the first comer  some wine my brave perigord said the graceful young musketeer as soon as he could find utterance  perigord brought three dozen of charlevoix  the young man emptied them almost at a draught  byby perigord he said lightly waving his hand as preceding the astonished landlord he slowly withdrew  but your highnessthe bill said the astounded perigord  ah the bill  charge it  to whom  the queen  what madame  the same  adieu my good perigord  and the graceful stranger rode away  an interval of quiet succeeded in which the innkeeper gazed wofully at his wife  suddenly he was startled by a clatter of hoofs and an aristocratic figure stood in the doorway  ah said the courtier goodnaturedly  what do my eyes deceive me no it is the festive and luxurious perigord  perigord listen  i famish  i languish  i would dine  the innkeeper again covered the table with viands  again it was swept clean as the fields of egypt before the miraculous swarm of locusts the stranger looked up  bring me another fowl my perigord  impossible your excellency the larder is stripped clean  another flitch of bacon then  impossible your highness there is no more  well then wine  the landlord brought one hundred and fortyfour bottles  the courtier drank them all  one may drink if one cannot eat said the aristocratic stranger goodhumoredly  the innkeeper shuddered  the guest rose to depart  the innkeeper came slowly forward with his bill to which he had covertly added the losses which he had suffered from the previous strangers  ah the bill  charge it  charge it to whom  to the king said the guest  what his majesty  certainly  farewell perigord  the innkeeper groaned  then he went out and took down his sign then remarked to his wife  i am a plain man and dont understand politics  it seems however that the country is in a troubled state  between his eminence the cardinal his majesty the king and her majesty the queen i am a ruined man  stay said dame perigord i have an idea  and that is  become yourself a musketeer    chapter ii  the combat  on leaving provins the first musketeer proceeded to nangis where he was reinforced by thirtythree followers  the second musketeer arriving at nangis at the same moment placed himself at the head of thirtythree more  the third guest of the landlord of provins arrived at nangis in time to assemble together thirtythree other musketeers  the first stranger led the troops of his eminence  the second led the troops of the queen  the third led the troops of the king  the fight commenced  it raged terribly for seven hours  the first musketeer killed thirty of the queens troops  the second musketeer killed thirty of the kings troops  the third musketeer killed thirty of his eminences troops  by this time it will be perceived the number of musketeers had been narrowed down to four on each side  naturally the three principal warriors approached each other  they simultaneously uttered a cry  aramis  athos  dartagnan  they fell into each others arms  and it seems that we are fighting against each other my children said the count de la fere mournfully  how singular exclaimed aramis and dartagnan  let us stop this fratricidal warfare said athos  we will they exclaimed together  but how to disband our followers queried dartagnan  aramis winked  they understood each other  let us cut em down  they cut em down  aramis killed three  dartagnan three  athos three  the friends again embraced  how like old times said aramis how touching exclaimed the serious and philosophic count de la fere  the galloping of hoofs caused them to withdraw from each others embraces  a gigantic figure rapidly approached  the innkeeper of provins they cried drawing their swords  perigord down with him shouted dartagnan  stay said athos  the gigantic figure was beside them  he uttered a cry  athos aramis dartagnan  porthos exclaimed the astonished trio  the same  they all fell in each others arms  the count de la fere slowly raised his hands to heaven  bless you bless us my children  however different our opinion may be in regard to politics we have but one opinion in regard to our own merits where can you find a better man than aramus  than porthos said aramis  than dartagnan said porthos  than athos said dartagnan    chapter iii  showing how the king of france went up a ladder  the king descended into the garden  proceeding cautiously along the terraced walk he came to the wall immediately below the windows of madame  to the left were two windows concealed by vines  they opened into the apartments of la valliere  the king sighed  it is about nineteen feet to that window said the king  if i had a ladder about nineteen feet long it would reach to that window  this is logic  suddenly the king stumbled over something  st denis he exclaimed looking down  it was a ladder just nineteen feet long  the king placed it against the wall  in so doing he fixed the lower end upon the abdomen of a man who lay concealed by the wall the man did not utter a cry or wince  the king suspected nothing he ascended the ladder  the ladder was too short  louis the grand was not a tall man  he was still two feet below the window  dear me said the king  suddenly the ladder was lifted two feet from below  this enabled the king to leap in the window  at the farther end of the apartment stood a young girl with red hair and a lame leg  she was trembling with emotion  louise  the king  ah my god mademoiselle  ah my god sire  but a low knock at the door interrupted the lovers  the king uttered a cry of rage louise one of despair  the door opened and dartagnan entered  good evening sire said the musketeer  the king touched a bell  porthos appeared in the doorway  good evening sire  arrest m dartagnan  porthos looked at dartagnan and did not move  the king almost turned purple with rage  he again touched the bell athos entered  count arrest porthos and dartagnan  the count de la fere glanced at porthos and dartagnan and smiled sweetly  sacre  where is aramis said the king violently  here sire and aramis entered  arrest athos porthos and dartagnan  aramis bowed and folded his arms  arrest yourself  aramis did not move  the king shuddered and turned pale  am i not king of france  assuredly sire but we are also severally porthos aramis dartagnan and athos  ah said the king  yes sire  what does this mean  it means your majesty said aramis stepping forward that your conduct as a married man is highly improper  i am an abbe and i object to these improprieties  my friends here dartagnan athos and porthos pureminded young men are also terribly shocked observe sire how they blush  athos porthos and dartagnan blushed  ah said the king thoughtfully  you teach me a lesson  you are devoted and noble young gentlemen but your only weakness is your excessive modesty from this moment i make you all marshals and dukes with the exception of aramis  and me sire said aramis  you shall be an archbishop  the four friends looked up and then rushed into each others arms the king embraced louise de la valliere by way of keeping them company  a pause ensued  at last athos spoke  swear my children that next to yourselves you will respect the king of france and remember that forty years after we will meet again     the dweller of the threshold  by sir edd lttn blwr    book i  the promptings of the ideal  it was noon  sir edward had stepped from his brougham and was proceeding on foot down the strand  he was dressed with his usual faultless taste but in alighting from his vehicle his foot had slipped and a small round disk of conglomerated soil which instantly appeared on his high arched instep marred the harmonious glitter of his boots  sir edward was fastidious  casting his eyes around at a little distance he perceived the stand of a youthful bootblack thither he sauntered and carelessly placing his foot on the low stool he waited the application of the polishers art tis true said sir edward to himself yet half aloud the contact of the foul and the disgusting mars the general effect of the shiny and the beautifuland yet why am i here  i repeat it calmly and deliberatelywhy am i here  ha  boy  the boy looked uphis dark italian eyes glanced intelligently at the philosopher and as with one hand he tossed back his glossy curls from his marble brow and with the other he spread the equally glossy day  martin over the baronets boot he answered in deep rich tones the ideal is subjective to the real  the exercise of apperception gives a distinctiveness to idiocracy which is however subject to the limits of me  you are an admirer of the beautiful sir  you wish your boots blacked  the beautiful is attainable by means of the coin  ah said sir edward thoughtfully gazing upon the almost supernal beauty of the child before him you speak well  you have read kant  the boy blushed deeply  he drew a copy of kant from his blouse but in his confusion several other volumes dropped from his bosom on the ground  the baronet picked them up  ah said the philosopher whats this  ciceros de senectute at your age too  martials epigrams caesars commentaries what a classical scholar  e pluribus unum  nux vomica  nil desperandum  nihil fit said the boy enthusiastically  the philosopher gazed at the child  a strange presence seemed to transfuse and possess him  over the brow of the boy glittered the pale nimbus of the student  ah and schillers robbers too queried the philosopher  das ist ausgespielt said the boy modestly  then you have read my translation of schillers ballads continued the baronet with some show of interest  i have and infinitely prefer them to the original said the boy with intellectual warmth  you have shown how in actual life we strive for a goal we cannot reach how in the ideal the goal is attainable and there effort is victory  you have given us the antithesis which is a key to the remainder and constantly balances before us the conditions of the actual and the privileges of the ideal  my very words said the baronet wonderful wonderful and he gazed fondly at the italian boy who again resumed his menial employment alas the wings of the ideal were folded  the student had been absorbed in the boy  but sir edwards boots were blacked and he turned to depart placing his hand upon the clustering tendrils that surrounded the classic nob of the infant italian he said softly like a strain of distant music  boy you have done well  love the good  protect the innocent provide for the indigent  respect the philosopher     stay can you tell we what is the true the beautiful the innocent the virtuous  they are things that commence with a capital letter said the boy promptly  enough  respect everything that commences with a capital letter respect me and dropping a halfpenny in the hand of the boy he departed  the boy gazed fixedly at the coin  a frightful and instantaneous change overspread his features  his noble brow was corrugated with baser lines of calculation  his black eye serpentlike glittered with suppressed passion  dropping upon his hands and feet he crawled to the curbstone and hissed after the retreating form of the baronet the single word  bilk    book ii  in the world  eleven years ago said sir edward to himself as his brougham slowly rolled him toward the committee room just eleven years ago my natural son disappeared mysteriously  i have no doubt in the world but that this little bootblack is he  his mother died in italy  he resembles his mother very much  perhaps i ought to provide for him  shall i disclose myself  no no  better he should taste the sweets of labor penury ennobles the mind and kindles the love of the beautiful  i will act to him not like a father not like a guardian not like a friendbut like a philosopher  with these words sir edward entered the committee room  his secretary approached him  sir edward there are fears of a division in the house and the prime minister has sent for you  i will be there said sir edward as he placed his hand on his chest and uttered a hollow cough  no one who heard the baronet that night in his sarcastic and withering speech on the drainage and sewerage bill would have recognized the lover of the ideal and the philosopher of the beautiful  no one who listened to his eloquence would have dreamed of the spartan resolution this iron man had taken in regard to the lost boyhis own beloved lionel  none  a fine speech from sir edward tonight said lord billingsgate as armandarm with the premier he entered his carriage  yes but how dreadfully he coughs  exactly  dr bolus says his lungs are entirely gone he breathes entirely by an effort of will and altogether independent of pulmonary assistance  how strange and the carriage rolled away    book iii  the dweller of the threshold  adon ai appear appear  and as the seer spoke the awful presence glided out of nothingness and sat sphinxlike at the feet of the alchemist  i am come said the thing  you should say i have comeits better grammar said the boyneophyte thoughtfully accenting the substituted expression  hush rash boy said the seer sternly  would you oppose your feeble knowledge to the infinite intelligence of the unmistakable a word and you are lost forever  the boy breathed a silent prayer and handing a sealed package to the seer begged him to hand it to his father in case of his premature decease  you have sent for me hissed the presence  behold me apokatharticonthe unpronounceable  in me all things exist that are not already coexistent  i am the unattainable the intangible the cause and the effect  in me observe the brahma of mr emerson not only brahma himself but also the sacred musical composition rehearsed by the faithful hindoo  i am the real gyges none others are genuine  and the veiled son of the starbeam laid himself loosely about the room and permeated space generally  unfathomable mystery said the rosicrucian in a low sweet voice brave child with the vitreous optic  thou who pervadest all things and rubbest against us without abrasion of the cuticle  i command thee speak  and the misty intangible indefinite presence spoke    book iv  myself  after the events related in the last chapter the reader will perceive that nothing was easier than to reconcile sir edward to his son lionel nor to resuscitate the beautiful italian girl who it appears was not dead and to cause sir edward to marry his first and boyish love whom he had deserted  they were married in st georges hanover square as the bridal party stood before the altar sir edward with a sweet sad smile said in quite his old manner  the sublime and beautiful are the real the only ideal is the ridiculous and homely  let us always remember this  let us through life endeavor to personify the virtues and always begin em with a capital letter  let us whenever we can find an opportunity deliver our sentiments in the form of roundhand copies  respect the aged eschew vulgarity  admire ourselves regard the novelist     the haunted man  a christmas story  by chrs dckns    part i  the first phantom  dont tell me that it wasnt a knocker  i had seen it often enough and i ought to know  so ought the threeoclock beer in dirty highlows swinging himself over the railing or executing a demoniacal jig upon the doorstep so ought the butcher although butchers as a general thing are scornful of such trifles so ought the postman to whom knockers of the most extravagant description were merely human weaknesses that were to be pitied and used  and so ought for the matter of that etc etc etc  but then it was such a knocker  a wild extravagant and utterly incomprehensible knocker  a knocker so mysterious and suspicious that policeman x 37 first coming upon it felt inclined to take it instantly in custody but compromised with his professional instincts by sharply and sternly noting it with an eye that admitted of no nonsense but confidently expected to detect its secret yet  an ugly knocker a knocker with a hard human face that was a type of the harder human face within  a human face that held between its teeth a brazen rod  so hereafter in the mysterious future should be held etc etc  but if the knocker had a fierce human aspect in the glare of day you should have seen it at night when it peered out of the gathering shadows and suggested an ambushed figure when the light of the street lamps fell upon it and wrought a play of sinister expression in its hard outlines when it seemed to wink meaningly at a shrouded figure who as the night fell darkly crept up the steps and passed into the mysterious house when the swinging door disclosed a black passage into which the figure seemed to lose itself and become a part of the mysterious gloom when the night grew boisterous and the fierce wind made furious charges at the knocker as if to wrench it off and carry it away in triumph  such a night as this  it was a wild and pitiless wind  a wind that had commenced life as a gentle country zephyr but wandering through manufacturing towns had become demoralized and reaching the city had plunged into extravagant dissipation and wild excesses  a roistering wind that indulged in bacchanalian shouts on the street corners that knocked off the hats from the heads of helpless passengers and then fulfilled its duties by speeding away like all young prodigalsto sea  he sat alone in a gloomy library listening to the wind that roared in the chimney  around him novels and storybooks were strewn thickly in his lap he held one with its pages freshly cut and turned the leaves wearily until his eyes rested upon a portrait in its frontispiece  and as the wind howled the more fiercely and the darkness without fell blacker a strange and fateful likeness to that portrait appeared above his chair and leaned upon his shoulder  the haunted man gazed at the portrait and sighed  the figure gazed at the portrait and sighed too  here again said the haunted man  here again it repeated in a low voice  another novel  another novel  the old story  the old story  i see a child said the haunted man gazing from the pages of the book into the firea most unnatural child a model infant  it is prematurely old and philosophic  it dies in poverty to slow music  it dies surrounded by luxury to slow music  it dies with an accompaniment of golden water and rattling carts to slow music previous to its decease it makes a will it repeats the lords prayer it kisses the boofer lady  that child  is mine said the phantom  i see a good woman undersized  i see several charming women but they are all undersized  they are more or less imbecile and idiotic but always fascinating and undersized  they wear coquettish caps and aprons  i observe that feminine virtue is invariably below the medium height and that it is always simple and infantine  these women  are mine  i see a haughty proud and wicked lady  she is tall and queenly i remark that all proud and wicked women are tall and queenly that woman  is mine said the phantom wringing his hands  i see several things continually impending  i observe that whenever an accident a murder or death is about to happen there is something in the furniture in the locality in the atmosphere that foreshadows and suggests it years in advance  i cannot say that in real life i have noticed itthe perception of this surprising fact belongs  to me said the phantom  the haunted man continued in a despairing tone  i see the influence of this in the magazines and daily papers i see weak imitators rise up and enfeeble the world with senseless formula i am getting tired of it  it wont do charles it wont do and the haunted man buried his head in his hands and groaned the figure looked down upon him sternly the portrait in the frontispiece frowned as he gazed  wretched man said the phantom and how have these things affected you  once i laughed and cried but then i was younger  now i would forget them if i could  have then your wish  and take this with you man whom i renounce from this day henceforth you shall live with those whom i displace without forgetting me t will be your lot to walk through life as if we had not met  but first you shall survey these scenes that henceforth must be yours  at one tonight prepare to meet the phantom i have raised  farewell  the sound of its voice seemed to fade away with the dying wind and the haunted man was alone  but the firelight flickered gayly and the light danced on the walls making grotesque figures of the furniture  ha ha said the haunted man rubbing his hands gleefully now for a whiskey punch and a cigar    book ii  the second phantom  one  the stroke of the faroff bell had hardly died before the front door closed with a reverberating clang  steps were heard along the passage the library door swung open of itself and the knockeryes the knockerslowly strode into the room  the haunted man rubbed his eyesno there could be no mistake about itit was the knockers face mounted on a misty almost imperceptible body  the brazen rod was transferred from its mouth to its right hand where it was held like a ghostly truncheon  its a cold evening said the haunted man  it is said the goblin in a hard metallic voice  it must be pretty cold out there said the haunted man with vague politeness  do you everwill youtake some hot water and brandy  no said the goblin  perhaps youd like it cold by way of change continued the haunted man correcting himself as he remembered the peculiar temperature with which the goblin was probably familiar  time flies said the goblin coldly  we have no leisure for idle talk  come  he moved his ghostly truncheon toward the window and laid his hand upon the others arm  at his touch the body of the haunted man seemed to become as thin and incorporeal as that of the goblin himself and together they glided out of the window into the black and blowy night  in the rapidity of their flight the senses of the haunted man seemed to leave him  at length they stopped suddenly  what do you see asked the goblin  i see a battlemented mediaeval castle  gallant men in mail ride over the drawbridge and kiss their gauntleted fingers to fair ladies who wave their lily hands in return  i see fight and fray and tournament i hear roaring heralds bawling the charms of delicate women and shamelessly proclaiming their lovers  stay  i see a jewess about to leap from a battlement  i see knightly deeds violence rapine and a good deal of blood  ive seen pretty much the same at astleys  look again  i see purple moors glens masculine women barelegged men priggish bookworms more violence physical excellence and blood always bloodand the superiority of physical attainments  and how do you feel now said the goblin  the haunted man shrugged his shoulders  none the better for being carried back and asked to sympathize with a barbarous age  the goblin smiled and clutched his arm they again sped rapidly through the black night and again halted  what do you see said the goblin  i see a barrack room with a mess table and a group of intoxicated celtic officers telling funny stories and giving challenges to duel i see a young irish gentleman capable of performing prodigies of valor i learn incidentally that the acme of all heroism is the cornetcy of a dragoon regiment  i hear a good deal of french  no thank you said the haunted man hurriedly as he stayed the waving hand of the goblin i would rather not go to the peninsula and dont care to have a private interview with napoleon  again the goblin flew away with the unfortunate man and from a strange roaring below them he judged they were above the ocean  a ship hove in sight and the goblin stayed its flight  look he said squeezing his companions arm  the haunted man yawned  dont you think charles youre rather running this thing into the ground  of course its very moral and instructive and all that  but aint there a little too much pantomime about it  come now  look repeated the goblin pinching his arm malevolently  the haunted man groaned  o of course i see her majestys ship arethusa of course i am familiar with her stern first lieutenant her eccentric captain her one fascinating and several mischievous midshipmen  of course i know its a splendid thing to see all this and not to be seasick  o there the young gentlemen are going to play a trick on the purser  for gods sake let us go and the unhappy man absolutely dragged the goblin away with him  when they next halted it was at the edge of a broad and boundless prairie in the middle of an oak opening  i see said the haunted man without waiting for his cue but mechanically and as if he were repeating a lesson which the goblin had taught himi see the noble savage  he is very fine to look at  but i observe under his warpaint feathers and picturesque blanket dirt disease and an unsymmetrical contour  i observe beneath his inflated rhetoric deceit and hypocrisy beneath his physical hardihood cruelty malice and revenge  the noble savage is a humbug  i remarked the same to mr catlin  come said the phantom  the haunted man sighed and took out his watch  couldnt we do the rest of this another time  my hour is almost spent irreverent being but there is yet a chance for your reformation  come  again they sped through the night and again halted  the sound of delicious but melancholy music fell upon their ears  i see said the haunted man with something of interest in his manneri see an old mosscovered manse beside a sluggish flowing river  i see weird shapes witches puritans clergymen little children judges mesmerized maidens moving to the sound of melody that thrills me with its sweetness and purity  but although carried along its calm and evenly flowing current the shapes are strange and frightful an eating lichen gnaws at the heart of each  not only the clergymen but witch maiden judge and puritan all wear scarlet letters of some kind burned upon their hearts  i am fascinated and thrilled but i feel a morbid sensitiveness creeping over me  ii beg your pardon  the goblin was yawning frightfully  well perhaps we had better go  one more and the last said the goblin  they were moving home  streaks of red were beginning to appear in the eastern sky  along the banks of the blackly flowing river by moorland and stagnant fens by low houses clustering close to the waters edge like strange mollusks crawled upon the beach to dry by misty black barges the more misty and indistinct seen through its mysterious veil the river fog was slowly rising  so rolled away and rose from the heart of the haunted man etc etc  they stopped before a quaint mansion of red brick  the goblin waved his hand without speaking  i see said the haunted man a gay drawingroom  i see my old friends of the club of the college of society even as they lived and moved  i see the gallant and unselfish men whom i have loved and the snobs whom i have hated  i see strangely mingling with them and now and then blending with their forms our old friends dick steele addison and congreve  i observe though that these gentlemen have a habit of getting too much in the way  the royal standard of queen anne not in itself a beautiful ornament is rather too prominent in the picture  the long galleries of black oak the formal furniture the old portraits are picturesque but depressing  the house is damp i enjoy myself better here on the lawn where they are getting up a vanity fair  see the bell rings the curtain is rising the puppets are brought out for a new play  let me see  the haunted man was pressing forward in his eagerness but the hand of the goblin stayed him and pointing to his feet he saw between him and the rising curtain a newmade grave  and bending above the grave in passionate grief the haunted man beheld the phantom of the previous night                                                      the haunted man started andwoke  the bright sunshine streamed into the room  the air was sparkling with frost  he ran joyously to the window and opened it  a small boy saluted him with merry christmas the haunted man instantly gave him a bank of england note  how much like tiny tim tom and bobby that boy lookedbless my soul what a genius this dickens has  a knock at the door and boots entered  consider your salary doubled instantly  have you read david copperfield  yezzur  your salary is quadrupled  what do you think of the old curiosity shop  the man instantly burst into a torrent of tears and then into a roar of laughter  enough  here are five thousand pounds  open a porterhouse and call it our mutual friend  huzza  i feel so happy  and the haunted man danced about the room  and so bathed in the light of that blessed sun and yet glowing with the warmth of a good action the haunted man haunted no longer save by those shapes which make the dreams of children beautiful reseated himself in his chair and finished our mutual friend     miss mix  by chltte brnte    chapter i  my earliest impressions are of a huge misshapen rock against which the hoarse waves beat unceasingly  on this rock three pelicans are standing in a defiant attitude  a dark sky lowers in the background while two seagulls and a gigantic cormorant eye with extreme disfavor the floating corpse of a drowned woman in the foreground  a few bracelets coral necklaces and other articles of jewelry scattered around loosely complete this remarkable picture  it is one which in some vague unconscious way symbolizes to my fancy the character of a man  i have never been able to explain exactly why  i think i must have seen the picture in some illustrated volume when a baby or my mother may have dreamed it before i was born  as a child i was not handsome  when i consulted the triangular bit of lookingglass which i always carried with me it showed a pale sandy and freckled face shaded by locks like the color of seaweed when the sun strikes it in deep water  my eyes were said to be indistinctive they were a faint ashen gray but above them rosemy only beautya high massive domelike forehead with polished temples like doorknobs of the purest porcelain  our family was a family of governesses  my mother had been one and my sisters had the same occupation  consequently when at the age of thirteen my eldest sister handed me the advertisement of mr rawjester clipped from that days times i accepted it as my destiny  nevertheless a mysterious presentiment of an indefinite future haunted me in my dreams that night as i lay upon my little snowwhite bed  the next morning with two bandboxes tied up in silk handkerchiefs and a hair trunk i turned my back upon minerva cottage forever    chapter ii  blunderbore hall the seat of james rawjester esq was encompassed by dark pines and funereal hemlocks on all sides  the wind sang weirdly in the turrets and moaned through the longdrawn avenues of the park as i approached the house i saw several mysterious figures flit before the windows and a yell of demoniac laughter answered my summons at the bell  while i strove to repress my gloomy forebodings the housekeeper a timid scaredlooking old woman showed me into the library  i entered overcome with conflicting emotions  i was dressed in a narrow gown of dark serge trimmed with black bugles  a thick green shawl was pinned across my breast  my hands were encased with black halfmittens worked with steel beads on my feet were large pattens originally the property of my deceased grandmother i carried a blue cotton umbrella  as i passed before a mirror i could not help glancing at it nor could i disguise from myself the fact that i was not handsome  drawing a chair into a recess i sat down with folded hands calmly awaiting the arrival of my master  once or twice a fearful yell rang through the house or the rattling of chains and curses uttered in a deep manly voice broke upon the oppressive stillness  i began to feel my soul rising with the emergency of the moment  you look alarmed miss  you dont hear anything my dear do you asked the housekeeper nervously  nothing whatever i remarked calmly as a terrific scream followed by the dragging of chairs and tables in the room above drowned for a moment my reply  it is the silence on the contrary which has made me foolishly nervous  the housekeeper looked at me approvingly and instantly made some tea for me  i drank seven cups as i was beginning the eighth i heard a crash and the next moment a man leaped into the room through the broken window    chapter iii  the crash startled me from my selfcontrol  the housekeeper bent toward me and whispered  dont be excited  its mr rawjesterhe prefers to come in sometimes in this way  its his playfulness ha ha ha  i perceive i said calmly  its the unfettered impulse of a lofty soul breaking the tyrannizing bonds of custom  and i turned toward him  he had never once looked at me  he stood with his back to the fire which set off the herculean breadth of his shoulders  his face was dark and expressive his under jaw squarely formed and remarkably heavy  i was struck with his remarkable likeness to a gorilla  as he absently tied the poker into hard knots with his nervous fingers i watched him with some interest  suddenly he turned toward me  do you think im handsome young woman  not classically beautiful i returned calmly but you have if i may so express myself an abstract manlinessa sincere and wholesome barbarity which involving as it does the naturalness but i stopped for he yawned at that momentan action which singularly developed the immense breadth of his lower jawand i saw he had forgotten me presently he turned to the housekeeper  leave us  the old woman withdrew with a courtesy  mr rawjester deliberately turned his back upon me and remained silent for twenty minutes  i drew my shawl the more closely around my shoulders and closed my eyes  you are the governess at length he said  i am sir  a creature who teaches geography arithmetic and the use of the globeshaa wretched remnant of femininitya skimp pattern of girlhood with a premature flavor of tealeaves and morality  ugh  i bowed my head silently  listen to me girl he said sternly this child you have come to teachmy wardis not legitimate  she is the offspring of my mistressa common harlot  ah  miss mix what do you think of me now  i admire i replied calmly your sincerity  a mawkish regard for delicacy might have kept this disclosure to yourself  i only recognize in your frankness that perfect community of thought and sentiment which should exist between original natures  i looked up he had already forgotten my presence and was engaged in pulling off his boots and coat  this done he sank down in an armchair before the fire and ran the poker wearily through his hair i could not help pitying him  the wind howled dismally without and the rain beat furiously against the windows  i crept toward him and seated myself on a low stool beside his chair  presently he turned without seeing me and placed his foot absently in my lap  i affected not to notice it  but he started and looked down  you here yetcarrothead  ah i forgot  do you speak french  oui monsieur  taisezvous he said sharply with singular purity of accent  i complied  the wind moaned fearfully in the chimney and the light burned dimly  i shuddered in spite of myself  ah you tremble girl  it is a fearful night  fearful  call you this fearful ha ha ha  look you wretched little atom look and he dashed forward and leaping out of the window stood like a statue in the pelting storm with folded arms he did not stay long but in a few minutes returned by way of the hall chimney  i saw from the way that he wiped his feet on my dress that he had again forgotten my presence  you are a governess  what can you teach he asked suddenly and fiercely thrusting his face in mine  manners i replied calmly  ha teach me  you mistake yourself i said adjusting my mittens  your manners require not the artificial restraint of society  you are radically polite this impetuosity and ferociousness is simply the sincerity which is the basis of a proper deportment  your instincts are moral your better nature i see is religious  as st paul justly remarkssee chap 6 8 9 and 10  he seized a heavy candlestick and threw it at me  i dodged it submissively but firmly  excuse me he remarked as his under jaw slowly relaxed  excuse me miss mixbut i cant stand st paul  enoughyou are engaged    chapter iv  i followed the housekeeper as she led the way timidly to my room as we passed into a dark hall in the wing i noticed that it was closed by an iron gate with a grating  three of the doors on the corridor were likewise grated  a strange noise as of shuffling feet and the howling of infuriated animals rang through the hall bidding the housekeeper good night and taking the candle i entered my bedchamber  i took off my dress and putting on a yellow flannel nightgown which i could not help feeling did not agree with my complexion i composed myself to rest by reading blairs rhetoric and paleys moral philosophy  i had just put out the light when i heard voices in the corridor  i listened attentively  i recognized mr rawjesters stern tones  have you fed no 1 he asked  yes sir said a gruff voice apparently belonging to a domestic  hows no 2  shes a little off her feed just now but will pick up in a day or two  and no 3  perfectly furious sir  her tantrums are ungovernable  hush  the voices died away and i sank into a fitful slumber  i dreamed that i was wandering through a tropical forest  suddenly i saw the figure of a gorilla approaching me  as it neared me i recognized the features of mr rawjester  he held his hand to his side as if in pain  i saw that he had been wounded  he recognized me and called me by name but at the same moment the vision changed to an ashantee village where around the fire a group of negroes were dancing and participating in some wild obi festival  i awoke with the strain still ringing in my ears  hokeepokee wokee fum  good heavens could i be dreaming  i heard the voice distinctly on the floor below and smelt something burning  i arose with an indistinct presentiment of evil and hastily putting some cotton in my ears and tying a towel about my head i wrapped myself in a shawl and rushed down stairs  the door of mr rawjesters room was open  i entered  mr rawjester lay apparently in a deep slumber from which even the clouds of smoke that came from the burning curtains of his bed could not rouse him  around the room a large and powerful negress scantily attired with her head adorned with feathers was dancing wildly accompanying herself with bone castanets  it looked like some terrible fetich  i did not lose my calmness  after firmly emptying the pitcher basin and slopjar on the burning bed i proceeded cautiously to the garden and returning with the gardenengine i directed a small stream at mr rawjester  at my entrance the gigantic negress fled  mr rawjester yawned and woke  i explained to him as he rose dripping from the bed the reason of my presence  he did not seem to be excited alarmed or discomposed  he gazed at me curiously  so you risked your life to save mine eh you canarycolored teacher of infants  i blushed modestly and drew my shawl tightly over my yellow flannel nightgown  you love me mary janedont deny it  this trembling shows it he drew me closely toward him and said with his deep voice tenderly modulated  hows her pooty tootensdid she get her ittle tootens wetbess her  i understood his allusion to my feet  i glanced down and saw that in my hurry i had put on a pair of his old indiarubbers  my feet were not small or pretty and the addition did not add to their beauty  let me go sir i remarked quietly  this is entirely improper it sets a bad example for your child  and i firmly but gently extricated myself from his grasp  i approached the door  he seemed for a moment buried in deep thought  you say this was a negress  yes sir  humph no 1 i suppose  who is number one sir  my first he remarked with a significant and sarcastic smile then relapsing into his old manner he threw his boots at my head and bade me begone  i withdrew calmly    chapter v  my pupil was a bright little girl who spoke french with a perfect accent  her mother had been a french balletdancer which probably accounted for it  although she was only six years old it was easy to perceive that she had been several times in love  she once said to me  miss mix did you ever have the grande passion  did you ever feel a fluttering here and she placed her hand upon her small chest and sighed quaintly a kind of distaste for bonbons and caromels when the world seemed as tasteless and hollow as a broken cordial drop  then you have felt it nina i said quietly  o dear yes there was buttonsthat was our page you knowi loved him dearly but papa sent him away  then there was dick the groom but he laughed at me and i suffered misery and she struck a tragic french attitude there is to be company here tomorrow she added rattling on with childish naivete and papas sweetheartblanche maraboutis to be here  you know they say she is to be my mamma  what thrill was this shot through me  but i rose calmly and administering a slight correction to the child left the apartment  blunderbore house for the next week was the scene of gayety and merriment  that portion of the mansion closed with a grating was walled up and the midnight shrieks no longer troubled me  but i felt more keenly the degradation of my situation  i was obliged to help lady blanche at her toilet and help her to look beautiful  for what  to captivate him  ono nobut why this sudden thrill and faintness  did he really love her  i had seen him pinch and swear at her  but i reflected that he had thrown a candlestick at my head and my foolish heart was reassured  it was a night of festivity when a sudden message obliged mr rawjester to leave his guests for a few hours  make yourselves merry idiots he added under his breath as he passed me  the door closed and he was gone  an halfhour passed  in the midst of the dancing a shriek was heard and out of the swaying crowd of fainting women and excited men a wild figure strode into the room  one glance showed it to be a highwayman heavily armed holding a pistol in each hand  let no one pass out of this room he said in a voice of thunder the house is surrounded and you cannot escape  the first one who crosses yonder threshold will be shot like a dog  gentlemen ill trouble you to approach in single file and hand me your purses and watches  finding resistance useless the order was ungraciously obeyed  now ladies please to pass up your jewelry and trinkets  this order was still more ungraciously complied with  as blanche handed to the bandit captain her bracelet she endeavored to conceal a diamond necklace the gift of mr rawjester in her bosom  but with a demoniac grin the powerful brute tore it from its concealment and administering a hearty box on the ear of the young girl flung her aside  it was now my turn  with a beating heart i made my way to the robber chieftain and sank at his feet  o sir i am nothing but a poor governess pray let me go  o ho  a governess  give me your last months wages then  give me what you have stolen from your master and he laughed fiendishly  i gazed at him quietly and said in a low voice i have stolen nothing from you mr rawjester  ah discovered  hush listen girl he hissed in a fiercer whisper utter a syllable to frustrate my plans and you die aid me and but he was gone  in a few moments the party with the exception of myself were gagged and locked in the cellar  the next moment torches were applied to the rich hangings and the house was in flames  i felt a strong hand seize me and bear me out in the open air and place me upon the hillside where i could overlook the burning mansion it was mr rawjester  burn he said as he shook his fist at the flames  then sinking on his knees before me he said hurriedly  mary jane i love you the obstacles to our union are or will be soon removed  in yonder mansion were confined my three crazy wives  one of them as you know attempted to kill me  ha this is vengeance  but will you be mine  i fell without a word

schoolyard filled with a mob of riotous boys  a lot of us standing outside  suddenly came a dull crashing sound from the schoolroom  at the ominous interruption i shuddered involuntarily and called to smithsye  whats up smithums  guys cleaning out the fourth form he replied  at the same moment george de coverly passed me holding his nose from whence the bright norman blood streamed redly  to him the plebeian smithsye laughingly  cully hows his nibs  i pushed the door of the schoolroom open  there are some spectacles which a man never forgets  the burning of troy probably seemed a largesized conflagration to the pious aeneas and made an impression on him which he carried away with the feeble anchises  in the centre of the room lightly brandishing the pistonrod of a steamengine stood guy heavystone alone  i say alone for the pile of small boys on the floor in the corner could hardly be called company  i will try and sketch him for the reader  guy heavystone was then only fifteen  his broad deep chest his sinewy and quivering flank his straight pastern showed him to be a thoroughbred perhaps he was a trifle heavy in the fetlock but he held his head haughtily erect  his eyes were glittering but pitiless  there was a sternness about the lower part of his facethe old heavystone looka sternness heightened perhaps by the snafflebit which in one of his strange freaks he wore in his mouth to curb his occasional ferocity  his dress was well adapted to his squareset and herculean frame  a striped knit undershirt closefitting striped tights and a few spangles set off his figure a neat glengarry cap adorned his head  on it was displayed the heavystone crest a cock regardant on a dunghill or and the motto devil a better  i thought of horatius on the bridge of hector before the walls  i always make it a point to think of something classical at such times  he saw me and his sternness partly relaxed  something like a smile struggled through his grim lineaments  it was like looking on the jungfrau after having seen mont blanca trifle only a trifle less sublime and awful  resting his hand lightly on the shoulder of the headmaster who shuddered and collapsed under his touch he strode toward me  his walk was peculiar  you could not call it a stride  it was like the cresttossing bellerophona kind of prancing gait guy heavystone pranced toward me    chapter ii    lord lovel he stood at the garden gate   acombing his milkwhite steed   it was the winter of 186 when i next met guy heavystone  he had left the university and had entered the 76th heavies  i have exchanged the gown for the sword you see he said grasping my hand and fracturing the bones of my little finger as he shook it  i gazed at him with unmixed admiration  he was squarer sterner and in every way smarter and more remarkable than ever  i began to feel toward this man as phalaster felt towards phyrgino as somebody must have felt toward archididasculus as boswell felt toward johnson  come into my den he said and lifting me gently by the seat of my pantaloons he carried me up stairs and deposited me before i could apologize on the sofa  i looked around the room  it was a bachelors apartment characteristically furnished in the taste of the proprietor a few claymores and battleaxes were ranged against the wall and a culverin captured by sir ralph heavystone occupied the corner the other end of the room being taken up by a light battery  foils boxinggloves saddles and fishingpoles lay around carelessly  a small pile of billetsdoux lay upon a silver salver  the man was not an anchorite nor yet a sir galahad  i never could tell what guy thought of women  poor little beasts he would often say when the conversation turned on any of his fresh conquests  then passing his hand over his marble brow the old look of stern fixedness of purpose and unflinching severity would straighten the lines of his mouth and he would mutter half to himself sdeath  come with me to heavystone grange  the exmoor hounds throw off tomorrow  ill give you a mount he said as he amused himself by rolling up a silver candlestick between his fingers  you shall have cleopatra  but stay he added thoughtfully now i remember i ordered cleopatra to be shot this morning  and why i queried  she threw her rider yesterday and fell on him  and killed him  no  thats the reason why i have ordered her to be shot  i keep no animals that are not dangerousi should adddeadly  he hissed the last sentence between his teeth and a gloomy frown descended over his calm brow  i affected to turn over the tradesmans bills that lay on the table for like all of the heavystone race guy seldom paid cash and said  you remind me of the time when leonidas  o bother leonidas and your classical allusions  come  we descended to dinner    chapter iii    he carries weight he rides a race   tis for a thousand pound   there is flora billingsgate the greatest coquette and hardest rider in the country said my companion ralph mortmain as we stood upon dingleby common before the meet  i looked up and beheld guy heavystone bending haughtily over the saddle as he addressed a beautiful brunette  she was indeed a splendidly groomed and highspirited woman  we were near enough to overhear the following conversation which any hightoned reader will recognize as the common and natural expression of the higher classes  when diana takes the field the chase is not wholly confined to objects ferae naturae said guy darting a significant glance at his companion  flora did not shrink either from the glance or the meaning implied in the sarcasm  if i were looking for an endymion now she said archly as she playfully cantered over a few hounds and leaped a fivebarred gate  guy whispered a few words inaudible to the rest of the party and curvetting slightly cleverly cleared two of the huntsmen in a flying leap galloped up the front steps of the mansion and dashing at full speed through the hall leaped through the drawingroom window and rejoined me languidly on the lawn  be careful of flora billingsgate he said to me in low stern tones while his pitiless eye shot a baleful fire  gardez vous  gnothi seauton i replied calmly not wishing to appear to be behind him in perception or verbal felicity  guy started off in high spirits  he was well carried  he and the first whip a tenstone man were head and head at the last fence while the hounds were rolling over their fox a hundred yards farther in the open  but an unexpected circumstance occurred  coming back his chestnut mare refused a tenfoot wall  she reared and fell backward  again he led her up to it lightly again she refused falling heavily from the coping  guy started to his feet  the old pitiless fire shone in his eyes the old stern look settled around his mouth seizing the mare by the tail and mane he threw her over the wall she landed twenty feet on the other side erect and trembling lightly leaping the same obstacle himself he remounted her  she did not refuse the wall the next time    chapter iv  he holds him by his glittering eye   guy was in the north of ireland cockshooting  so ralph mortmain told me and also that the match between mary brandagee and guy had been broken off by flora billingsgate  i dont like those billingsgates said ralph theyre a bad stock  her father smithfield de billingsgate had an unpleasant way of turning up the knave from the bottom of the pack  but nous verrons let us go and see guy  the next morning we started for finmacouls crossing  when i reached the shootingbox where guy was entertaining a select company of friends flora billingsgate greeted me with a saucy smile  guy was even squarer and sterner than ever  his gusts of passion were more frequent and it was with difficulty that he could keep an ablebodied servant in his family  his present retainers were more or less maimed from exposure to the fury of their master there was a strange cynicism a cutting sarcasm in his address piercing through his polished manner  i thought of timon etc etc  one evening we were sitting over our chambertin after a hard days work and guy was listlessly turning over some letters when suddenly he uttered a cry  did you ever hear the trumpeting of a wounded elephant  it was like that  i looked at him with consternation  he was glancing at a letter which he held at arms length and snorting as it were at it as he gazed the lower part of his face was stern but not as rigid as usual  he was slowly grinding between his teeth the fragments of the glass he had just been drinking from  suddenly he seized one of his servants and forcing the wretch upon his knees exclaimed with the roar of a tiger  dog why was this kept from me  why please sir miss flora said as how it was a reconciliation from miss brandagee and it was to be kept from you where you would not be likely to see itandand  speak dog and you  i put it among your bills sir  with a groan like distant thunder guy fell swooning to the floor  he soon recovered for the next moment a servant came rushing into the room with the information that a number of the ingenuous peasantry of the neighborhood were about to indulge that evening in the national pastime of burning a farmhouse and shooting a landlord  guy smiled a fearful smile without however altering his stern and pitiless expression  let them come he said calmly i feel like entertaining company  we barricaded the doors and windows and then chose our arms from the armory  guys choice was a singular one it was a landing net with a long handle and a sharp cavalry sabre  we were not destined to remain long in ignorance of its use  a howl was heard from without and a party of fifty or sixty armed men precipitated themselves against the door  suddenly the window opened  with the rapidity of lightning guy heavystone cast the net over the head of the ringleader ejaculated habet and with a back stroke of his cavalry sabre severed the member from its trunk and drawing the net back again cast the gory head upon the floor saying quietly  one  again the net was cast the steel flashed the net was withdrawn and an ominous two accompanied the head as it rolled on the floor  do you remember what pliny says of the gladiator said guy calmly wiping his sabre  how graphic is that passage commencing inter nos etc  the sport continued until the heads of twenty desperadoes had been gathered in  the rest seemed inclined to disperse  guy incautiously showed himself at the door a ringing shot was heard and he staggered back pierced through the heart grasping the doorpost in the last unconscious throes of his mighty frame the whole side of the house yielded to that earthquake tremor and we had barely time to escape before the whole building fell in ruins  i thought of samson the giant judge etc etc but all was over  guy heavystone had died as he had livedhard     mr midshipman breezy  a naval officer  by captain mrryt r n    chapter i  my father was a northcountry surgeon  he had retired a widower from her majestys navy many years before and had a small practice in his native village  when i was seven years old he employed me to carry medicines to his patients  being of a lively disposition i sometimes amused myself during my daily rounds by mixing the contents of the different phials  although i had no reason to doubt that the general result of this practice was beneficial yet as the death of a consumptive curate followed the addition of a strong mercurial lotion to his expectorant my father concluded to withdraw me from the profession and send me to school  grubbins the schoolmaster was a tyrant and it was not long before my impetuous and selfwilled nature rebelled against his authority  i soon began to form plans of revenge  in this i was assisted by tom snafflea schoolfellow  one day tom suggested  suppose we blow him up  ive got two pounds of powder  no thats too noisy i replied  tom was silent for a minute and again spoke  you remember how you flattened out the curate pills  couldnt you give grubbins somethingsomething to make him leathery sickeh  a flash of inspiration crossed my mind  i went to the shop of the village apothecary  he knew me i had often purchased vitriol which i poured into grubbinss inkstand to corrode his pens and burn up his coattail on which he was in the habit of wiping them i boldly asked for an ounce of chloroform  the young apothecary winked and handed me the bottle  it was grubbinss custom to throw his handkerchief over his head recline in his chair and take a short nap during recess  watching my opportunity as he dozed i managed to slip his handkerchief from his face and substitute my own moistened with chloroform  in a few minutes he was insensible  tom and i then quickly shaved his head beard and eyebrows blackened his face with a mixture of vitriol and burnt cork and fled  there was a row and scandal the next day  my father always excused me by asserting that grubbins had got drunkbut somehow found it convenient to procure me an appointment in her majestys navy at an early day    chapter ii  an official letter with the admiralty seal informed me that i was expected to join h m ship belcher captain boltrope at portsmouth without delay  in a few days i presented myself to a tall sternvisaged man who was slowly pacing the leeward side of the quarterdeck  as i touched my hat he eyed me sternly  so ho  another young suckling  the service is going to the devil nothing but babes in the cockpit and grannies in the board boatswains mate pass the word for mr cheek  mr cheek the steward appeared and touched his hat  introduce mr breezy to the young gentlemen  stop  wheres mr swizzle  at the masthead sir  wheres mr lankey  at the masthead sir  mr briggs  masthead too sir  and the rest of the young gentlemen roared the enraged officer  all masthead sir  ah said captain boltrope as he smiled grimly under the circumstances mr breezy you had better go to the masthead too    chapter iii  at the masthead i made the acquaintance of two youngsters of about my own age one of whom informed me that he had been there three hundred and thirtytwo days out of the year  in rough weather when the old cock is out of sorts you know we never come down added a young gentleman of nine years with a dirk nearly as long as himself who had been introduced to me as mr briggs by the way pills he continued how did you come to omit giving the captain a naval salute  why i touched my hat i said innocently  yes but that isnt enough you know  that will do very well at other times  he expects the naval salute when you first come on boardgreeny  i began to feel alarmed and begged him to explain  why you see after touching your hat you should have touched him lightly with your forefinger in his waistcoat so and asked hows his nibsyou see  hows his nibs i repeated  exactly  he would have drawn back a little and then you should have repeated the salute remarking hows his royal nibs asking cautiously after his wife and family and requesting to be introduced to the gunners daughter  the gunners daughter  the same you know she takes care of us young gentlemen now dont forget pillsy  when we were called down to the deck i thought it a good chance to profit by this instruction  i approached captain boltrope and repeated the salute without conscientiously omitting a single detail  he remained for a moment livid and speechless  at length he gasped out  boatswains mate  if you please sir i asked tremulously i should like to be introduced to the gunners daughter  o very good sir screamed captain boltrope rubbing his hands and absolutely capering about the deck with rage  o dn you  of course you shall  o ho the gunners daughter  o hll this is too much boatswains mate  before i well knew where i was i was seized borne to an eightpounder tied upon it and flogged    chapter iv  as we sat together in the cockpit picking the weevils out of our biscuit briggs consoled me for my late mishap adding that the naval salute as a custom seemed just then to be honored more in the breach than the observance  i joined in the hilarity occasioned by the witticism and in a few moments we were all friends  presently swizzle turned to me  we have been just planning how to confiscate a keg of claret which nips the purser keeps under his bunk  the old nipcheese lies there drunk half the day and theres no getting at it  lets get beneath the stateroom and bore through the deck and so tap it said lankey  the proposition was received with a shout of applause  a long halfinch auger and bit was procured from chips the carpenters mate and swizzle after a careful examination of the timbers beneath the wardroom commenced operations  the auger at last disappeared when suddenly there was a slight disturbance on the deck above  swizzle withdrew the auger hurriedly from its point a few bright red drops trickled  huzza send her up again cried lankey  the auger was again applied  this time a shriek was heard from the pursers cabin  instantly the light was doused and the party retreated hurriedly to the cockpit  a sound of snoring was heard as the sentry stuck his head into the door  all right sir he replied in answer to the voice of the officer of the deck  the next morning we heard that nips was in the surgeons hands with a bad wound in the fleshy part of his leg and that the auger had not struck claret    chapter v  now pills youll have a chance to smell powder said briggs as he entered the cockpit and buckled around his waist an enormous cutlass we have just sighted a french ship  we went on deck  captain boltrope grinned as we touched our hats he hated the purser  come young gentlemen if youre boring for french claret yonders a good quality  mind your con sir he added turning to the quartermaster who was grinning  the ship was already cleared for action  the men in their eagerness had started the coffee from the tubs and filled them with shot presently the frenchman yawed and a shot from a long thirtytwo came skipping over the water  it killed the quartermaster and took off both of lankeys legs  tell the purser our account is squared said the dying boy with a feeble smile  the fight raged fiercely for two hours  i remember killing the french admiral as we boarded but on looking around for briggs after the smoke had cleared away i was intensely amused at witnessing the following novel sight  briggs had pinned the french captain against the mast with his cutlass and was now engaged with all the hilarity of youth in pulling the captains coattails between his legs in imitation of a dancingjack as the frenchman lifted his legs and arms at each jerk of briggss i could not help participating in the general mirth  you young devil what are you doing said a stifled voice behind me i looked up and beheld captain boltrope endeavoring to calm his stern features but the twitching around his mouth betrayed his intense enjoyment of the scene  go to the mastheadup with you sir he repeated sternly to briggs  very good sir said the boy coolly preparing to mount the shrouds good by johnny crapaud  humph he added in a tone intended for my ear a pretty way to treat a hero  the service is going to the devil  i thought so too    chapter vi  we were ordered to the west indies  although captain boltropes manner toward me was still severe and even harsh i understood that my name had been favorably mentioned in the despatches  reader were you ever at jamaica  if so you remember the negresses the oranges port royal tomthe yellow fever  after being two weeks at the station i was taken sick of the fever  in a month i was delirious  during my paroxysms i had a wild distempered dream of a stern face bending anxiously over my pillow a rough hand smoothing my hair and a kind voice saying  bess his ittle heart  did he have the naughty fever  this face seemed again changed to the wellknown stern features of captain boltrope  when i was convalescent a packet edged in black was put in my hand it contained the news of my fathers death and a sealed letter which he had requested to be given to me on his decease  i opened it tremblingly  it read thus   my dear boyi regret to inform you that in all probability you are not my son  your mother i am grieved to say was a highly improper person  who your father may be i really cannot say but perhaps the honorable henry boltrope captain r n may be able to inform you circumstances over which i have no control have deferred this important disclosure  your stricken parent   and so captain boltrope was my father  heavens  was it a dream i recalled his stern manner his observant eye his illconcealed uneasiness when in my presence  i longed to embrace him staggering to my feet i rushed in my scanty apparel to the deck where captain boltrope was just then engaged in receiving the governors wife and daughter  the ladies shrieked the youngest a beautiful girl blushed deeply  heeding them not i sank at his feet and embracing them cried  my father  chuck him overboard roared captain boltrope  stay pleaded the soft voice of clara maitland the governors daughter  shave his head hes a wretched lunatic continued captain boltrope while his voice trembled with excitement  no let me nurse and take care of him said the lovely girl blushing as she spoke  mamma cant we take him home  the daughters pleading was not without effect  in the mean time i had fainted  when i recovered my senses i found myself in governor maitlands mansion    chapter vii  the reader will guess what followed  i fell deeply in love with clara maitland to whom i confided the secret of my birth  the generous girl asserted that she had detected the superiority of my manner at once we plighted our troth and resolved to wait upon events  briggs called to see me a few days afterward  he said that the purser had insulted the whole cockpit and all the midshipmen had called him out  but he added thoughtfully i dont see how we can arrange the duel  you see there are six of us to fight him  very easily i replied  let your fellows all stand in a row and take his fire that you see gives him six chances to one and he must be a bad shot if he cant hit one of you while on the other hand you see he gets a volley from you six and one of youll be certain to fetch him  exactly and away briggs went but soon returned to say that the purser had declinedlike a dd coward he added  but the news of the sudden and serious illness of captain boltrope put off the duel  i hastened to his bedside but too latean hour previous he had given up the ghost  i resolved to return to england  i made known the secret of my birth and exhibited my adopted fathers letter to lady maitland who at once suggested my marriage with her daughter before i returned to claim the property  we were married and took our departure next day  i made no delay in posting at once in company with my wife and my friend briggs to my native village  judge of my horror and surprise when my late adopted father came out of his shop to welcome me  then you are not dead i gasped  no my dear boy  and this letter  my fatheras i must still call himglanced on the paper and pronounced it a forgery  briggs roared with laughter  i turned to him and demanded an explanation  why dont you see greeny its all a jokea midshipmans joke  but i asked  dont be a fool  youve got a good wifebe satisfied  i turned to clara and was satisfied  although mrs maitland never forgave me the jolly old governor laughed heartily over the joke and so well used his influence that i soon became dear reader admiral breezy k c b     john jenkins  or  the smoker reformed  by t s athr    chapter i  one cigar a day said judge boompointer  one cigar a day repeated john jenkins as with trepidation he dropped his halfconsumed cigar under his workbench  one cigar a day is three cents a day remarked judge boompointer gravely and do you know sir what one cigar a day or three cents a day amounts to in the course of four years  john jenkins in his boyhood had attended the village school and possessed considerable arithmetical ability  taking up a shingle which lay upon his workbench and producing a piece of chalk with a feeling of conscious pride he made an exhaustive calculation  exactly fortythree dollars and eighty cents he replied wiping the perspiration from his heated brow while his face flushed with honest enthusiasm  well sir if you saved three cents a day instead of wasting it you would now be the possessor of a new suit of clothes an illustrated family bible a pew in the church a complete set of patent office reports a hymnbook and a paid subscription to arthurs home magazine which could be purchased for exactly fortythree dollars and eighty cents and added the judge with increasing sternness if you calculate leapyear which you seem to have strangely omitted you have three cents more sir three cents more  what would that buy you sir  a cigar suggested john jenkins but coloring again deeply he hid his face  no sir said the judge with a sweet smile of benevolence stealing over his stern features properly invested it would buy you that which passeth all price  dropped into the missionarybox who can tell what heathen now idly and joyously wantoning in nakedness and sin might be brought to a sense of his miserable condition and made through that three cents to feel the torments of the wicked  with these words the judge retired leaving john jenkins buried in profound thought  three cents a day he muttered  in forty years i might be worth four hundred and thirtyeight dollars and ten centsand then i might marry mary  ah mary  the young carpenter sighed and drawing a twentyfive cent daguerreotype from his vestpocket gazed long and fervidly upon the features of a young girl in book muslin and a coral necklace  then with a resolute expression he carefully locked the door of his workshop and departed  alas his good resolutions were too late  we trifle with the tide of fortune which too often nips us in the bud and casts the dark shadow of misfortune over the bright lexicon of youth  that night the halfconsumed fragment of john jenkinss cigar set fire to his workshop and burned it up together with all his tools and materials  there was no insurance    chapter ii  the downward path  then you still persist in marrying john jenkins queried judge boompointer as he playfully with paternal familiarity lifted the golden curls of the village belle mary jones  i do replied the fair young girl in a low voice that resembled rock candy in its saccharine firmnessi do  he has promised to reform  since he lost all his property by fire  the result of his pernicious habit though he illogically persists in charging it to me interrupted the judge  since then continued the young girl he has endeavored to break himself of the habit  he tells me that he has substituted the stalks of the indian ratan the outer part of a leguminous plant called the smokingbean and the fragmentary and unconsumed remainder of cigars which occur at rare and uncertain intervals along the road which as he informs me though deficient in quality and strength are comparatively inexpensive  and blushing at her own eloquence the young girl hid her curls on the judges arm  poor thing muttered judge boompointer  dare i tell her all yet i must  i shall cling to him continued the young girl rising with her theme as the young vine clings to some hoary ruin  nay nay chide me not judge boompointer  i will marry john jenkins  the judge was evidently affected  seating himself at the table he wrote a few lines hurriedly upon a piece of paper which he folded and placed in the fingers of the destined bride of john jenkins  mary jones said the judge with impressive earnestness take this trifle as a wedding gift from one who respects your fidelity and truthfulness  at the altar let it be a reminder of me  and covering his face hastily with a handkerchief the stern and ironwilled man left the room  as the door closed mary unfolded the paper  it was an order on the corner grocery for three yards of flannel a paper of needles four pounds of soap one pound of starch and two boxes of matches  noble and thoughtful man was all mary jones could exclaim as she hid her face in her hands and burst into a flood of tears                                                     the bells of cloverdale are ringing merrily  it is a wedding how beautiful they look is the exclamation that passes from lip to lip as mary jones leaning timidly on the arm of john jenkins enters the church  but the bride is agitated and the bridegroom betrays a feverish nervousness  as they stand in the vestibule john jenkins fumbles earnestly in his vestpocket  can it be the ring he is anxious about  no  he draws a small brown substance from his pocket and biting off a piece hastily replaces the fragment and gazes furtively around  surely no one saw him  alas the eyes of two of that wedding party saw the fatal act  judge boompointer shook his head sternly mary jones sighed and breathed a silent prayer  her husband chewed    chapter iii  and last  what more bread said john jenkins gruffly  youre always asking for money for bread  dnation  do you want to ruin me by your extravagance and as he uttered these words he drew from his pocket a bottle of whiskey a pipe and a paper of tobacco emptying the first at a draught he threw the empty bottle at the head of his eldest boy a youth of twelve summers  the missile struck the child full in the temple and stretched him a lifeless corpse  mrs jenkins whom the reader will hardly recognize as the once gay and beautiful mary jones raised the dead body of her son in her arms and carefully placing the unfortunate youth beside the pump in the back yard returned with saddened step to the house at another time and in brighter days she might have wept at the occurrence  she was past tears now  father your conduct is reprehensible said little harrison jenkins the youngest boy  where do you expect to go when you die  ah said john jenkins fiercely this comes of giving children a liberal education this is the result of sabbath schools  down viper  a tumbler thrown from the same parental fist laid out the youthful harrison cold  the four other children had in the mean time gathered around the table with anxious expectancy  with a chuckle the now changed and brutal john jenkins produced four pipes and filling them with tobacco handed one to each of his offspring and bade them smoke its better than bread laughed the wretch hoarsely  mary jenkins though of a patient nature felt it her duty now to speak  i have borne much john jenkins she said  but i prefer that the children should not smoke  it is an unclean habit and soils their clothes  i ask this as a special favor  john jenkins hesitatedthe pangs of remorse began to seize him  promise me this john urged mary upon her knees  i promise reluctantly answered john  and you will put the money in a savingsbank  i will repeated her husband and ill give up smoking too  tis well john jenkins said judge boompointer appearing suddenly from behind the door where he had been concealed during this interview  nobly said my man  cheer up  i will see that the children are decently buried  the husband and wife fell into each others arms  and judge boompointer gazing upon the affecting spectacle burst into tears  from that day john jenkins was an altered man     no title  by wlke cllns   prologue  the following advertisement appeared in the times of the 17th of june 1845   wanteda few young men for a light genteel employment

reporter and writer for the press  i live at pultneyville  i have always had a passion for the marvellous and have been distinguished for my facility in tracing out mysteries and solving enigmatical occurrences  on the night of the 17th june 1845 i left my office and walked homeward  the night was bright and starlight  i was revolving in my mind the words of a singular item i had just read in the times  i had reached the darkest portion of the road and found my self mechanically repeating an elderly gentleman a week ago left his lodgings on the kent road when suddenly i heard a step behind me  i turned quickly with an expression of horror in my face and by the light of the newly risen moon beheld an elderly gentleman with green cotton umbrella approaching me  his hair which was snow white was parted over a broad open forehead  the expression of his face which was slightly flushed was that of amiability verging almost upon imbecility  there was a strange inquiring look about the widely opened mild blue eyea look that might have been intensified to insanity or modified to idiocy  as he passed me he paused and partly turned his face with a gesture of inquiry  i see him still his white locks blowing in the evening breeze his hat a little on the back of his head and his figure painted in relief against the dark blue sky  suddenly he turned his mild eye full upon me  a weak smile played about his thin lips  in a voice which had something of the tremulousness of age and the selfsatisfied chuckle of imbecility in it he asked pointing to the rising moon whyhush  he had dodged behind me and appeared to be looking anxiously down the road  i could feel his aged frame shaking with terror as he laid his thin hands upon my shoulders and faced me in the direction of the supposed danger  hush did you not hear them coming  i listened there was no sound but the soughing of the roadside trees in the evening wind  i endeavored to reassure him with such success that in a few moments the old weak smile appeared on his benevolent face  why  but the look of interrogation was succeeded by a hopeless blankness  why i repeated with assuring accents  why he said a gleam of intelligence flickering over his face is yonder moon as she sails in the blue empyrean casting a flood of light oer hill and dale like  why he repeated with a feeble smile is yonder moon as she sails in the blue empyrean he hesitatedstammeredand gazed at me hopelessly with the tears dripping from his moist and widely opened eyes  i took his hand kindly in my own  casting a shadow oer hill and dale i repeated quietly leading him up the subject like  come now  ah he said pressing my hand tremulously you know it  i do  why is it liketheehthe commodious mansion on the limehouse road  a blank stare only followed  he shook his head sadly  like the young men wanted for a light genteel employment  he wagged his feeble old head cunningly  or mr ward i said with bold confidence like the mysterious disappearance from the kent road  the moment was full of suspense  he did not seem to hear me suddenly he turned  ha  i darted forward  but he had vanished in the darkness    chapter iii  no 27 limehouse road  it was a hot midsummer evening  limehouse road was deserted save by dust and a few rattling butchers carts and the bell of the muffin and crumpet man  a commodious mansion which stood on the right of the road as you enter pultneyville surrounded by stately poplars and a high fence surmounted by a chevaux de frise of broken glass looked to the passing and footsore pedestrian like the genius of seclusion and solitude  a bill announcing in the usual terms that the house was to let hung from the bell at the servants entrance  as the shades of evening closed and the long shadows of the poplars stretched across the road a man carrying a small kettle stopped and gazed first at the bill and then at the house  when he had reached the corner of the fence he again stopped and looked cautiously up and down the road  apparently satisfied with the result of his scrutiny he deliberately sat himself down in the dark shadow of the fence and at once busied himself in some employment so well concealed as to be invisible to the gaze of passersby  at the end of an hour he retired cautiously  but not altogether unseen  a slim young man with spectacles and notebook stepped from behind a tree as the retreating figure of the intruder was lost in the twilight and transferred from the fence to his notebook the freshly stencilled inscription st1860x    chapter iv  count moscows narrative  i am a foreigner  observe  to be a foreigner in england is to be mysterious suspicious intriguing  m collins has requested the history of my complicity with certain occurrences  it is nothing bah absolutely nothing  i write with ease and fluency  why should i not write  tra la la i am what you english call corpulent  ha ha  i am a pupil of macchiavelli  i find it much better to disbelieve everything and to approach my subject and wishes circuitously than in a direct manner you have observed that playful animal the cat  call it and it does not come to you directly but rubs itself against all the furniture in the room and reaches you finallyand scratches ah ha scratches  i am of the feline species  people call me a villainbah  i know the family living no 27 limehouse road  i respect the gentlemana fine burly specimen of your englishmanand madame charming ravishing delightful  when it became known to me that they designed to let their delightful residence and visit foreign shores i at once called upon them  i kissed the hand of madame i embraced the great englishman  madame blushed slightly  the great englishman shook my hand like a mastiff  i began in that dexterous insinuating manner of which i am truly proud  i thought madame was ill  ah no  a change then was all that was required  i sat down at the piano and sang  in a few minutes madame retired  i was alone with my friend  seizing his hand i began with every demonstration of courteous sympathy  i do not repeat my words for my intention was conveyed more in accent emphasis and manner than speech  i hinted to him that he had another wife living  i suggested that this was balancedhaby his wifes lover  that possibly he wished to fly hence the letting of his delightful mansion  that he regularly and systematically beat his wife in the english manner and that she repeatedly deceived me  i talked of hope of consolation of remedy  i carelessly produced a bottle of strychnine and a small vial of stramonium from my pocket and enlarged on the efficiency of drugs  his face which had gradually become convulsed suddenly became fixed with a frightful expression he started to his feet and roared you dd frenchman  i instantly changed my tactics and endeavored to embrace him  he kicked me twice violently  i begged permission to kiss madames hand he replied by throwing me down stairs  i am in bed with my head bound up and beefsteaks upon my eyes but still confident and buoyant  i have not lost faith in macchiavelli tra la la as they sing in the opera  i kiss everybodys hands    chapter v  dr diggss statement  my name is david diggs  i am a surgeon living at no 9 tottenham court  on the 15th of june 1854 i was called to see an elderly gentleman lodging on the kent road  found him highly excited with strong febrile symptoms pulse 120 increasing  repeated incoherently what i judged to be the popular form of a conundrum on closer examination found acute hydrocephalus and both lobes of the brain rapidly filling with water  in consultation with an eminent phrenologist it was further discovered that all the organs were more or less obliterated except that of comparison  hence the patient was enabled to only distinguish the most common points of resemblance between objects without drawing upon other faculties such as ideality or language for assistance  later in the day found him sinkingbeing evidently unable to carry the most ordinary conundrum to a successful issue  exhibited tinct val ext opii and camphor and prescribed quiet and emollients on the 17th the patient was missing    chapter last  statement of the publisher  on the 18th of june mr wilkie collins left a roll of manuscript with us for publication without title or direction since which time he has not been heard from  in spite of the care of the proofreaders and valuable literary assistance it is feared that the continuity of the story has been destroyed by some accidental misplacing of chapters during its progress  how and what chapters are so misplaced the publisher leaves to an indulgent public to discover     n n  being a novel in the french paragraphic style   mademoiselle i swear to you that i love you  you who read these pages  you who turn your burning eyes upon these wordswords that i trace  ah heaven the thought maddens me  i will be calm  i will imitate the reserve of the festive englishman who wears a spotted handkerchief which he calls a belchio who eats biftek and caresses a bulldog  i will subdue myself like him  ha  potobeer  all rightgoddam  or i will conduct myself as the freeborn americanthe gay brother jonathan  i will whittle me a stick  i will whistle to myself yankee doodle and forget my passion in excessive expectoration  hohowake snakes and walk chalks   the world is divided into two great divisionsparis and the provinces  there is but one paris  there are several provinces among which may be numbered england america russia and italy  n n was a parisian  but n n did not live in paris  drop a parisian in the provinces and you drop a part of paris with him  drop him in senegambia and in three days he will give you an omelette soufflee or a pate de foie gras served by the neatest of senegambian filles whom he will call mademoiselle  in three weeks he will give you an opera  n n was not dropped in senegambia but in san franciscoquite as awkward  they find gold in san francisco but they dont understand gilding  n n existed three years in this place  he became bald on the top of his head as all parisians do  look down from your box at the opera comique mademoiselle and count the bald crowns of the fast young men in the pit  ahyou tremble  they show where the arrows of love have struck and glanced off  n n was also nearsighted as all parisians finally become  this is a gallant provision of nature to spare them the mortification of observing that their lady friends grow old  after a certain age every woman is handsome to a parisian  one day n n was walking down washington street  suddenly he stopped  he was standing before the door of a mantuamaker  beside the counter at the farther extremity of the shop stood a young and elegantly formed woman  her face was turned from n n  he entered with a plausible excuse and seeming indifference he gracefully opened conversation with the mantuamaker as only a parisian can but he had to deal with a parisian  his attempts to view the features of the fair stranger by the counter were deftly combated by the shopwoman  he was obliged to retire  n n went home and lost his appetite  he was haunted by the elegant basque and graceful shoulders of the fair unknown during the whole night  the next day he sauntered by the mantuamaker  ah heavens  a thrill ran through his frame and his fingers tingled with a delicious electricity  the fair inconnue was there  he raised his hat gracefully  he was not certain but he thought that a slight motion of her faultless bonnet betrayed recognition  he would have wildly darted into the shop but just then the figure of the mantuamaker appeared in the doorway  did monsieur wish anything  misfortune  desperation  n n purchased a bottle of prussic acid a sack of charcoal and a quire of pink notepaper and returned home he wrote a letter of farewell to the closely fitting basque and opened the bottle of prussic acid  some one knocked at his door  it was a chinaman with his weekly linen  these chinese are docile but not intelligent  they are ingenious but not creative  they are cunning in expedients but deficient in tact in love they are simply barbarous  they purchase their wives openly and not constructively by attorney  by offering small sums for their sweethearts they degrade the value of the sex  nevertheless n n felt he was saved  he explained all to the faithful mongolian and exhibited the letter he had written  he implored him to deliver it  the mongolian assented  the race are not cleanly or sweetsavored but n n fell upon his neck  he embraced him with one hand and closed his nostrils with the other  through him he felt he clasped the closefitting basque  the next day was one of agony and suspense  evening came but no mercy  n n lit the charcoal  but to compose his nerves he closed his door and first walked mildly up and down montgomery street  when he returned he found the faithful mongolian on the steps  all lity  these chinese are not accurate in their pronunciation  they avoid the r like the english nobleman  n n gasped for breath  he leaned heavily against the chinaman  then you have seen her ching long  yes  all lity  she cum  top side of house  the docile barbarian pointed up the stairs and chuckled  she hereimpossible  ah heaven do i dream  yes  all litytop side of house  good by john  this is the familiar parting epithet of the mongolian  it is equivalent to our au revoir  n n gazed with a stupefied air on the departing servant  he placed his hand on his throbbing heart  she herealone beneath this roof  o heavens what happiness  but how  torn from her home  ruthlessly dragged perhaps from her evening devotions by the hands of a relentless barbarian could she forgive him  he dashed frantically up the stairs  he opened the door  she was standing beside his couch with averted face  a strange giddiness overtook him  he sank upon his knees at the threshold  pardon pardon  my angel can you forgive me  a terrible nausea now seemed added to the fearful giddiness  his utterance grew thick and sluggish  speak speak enchantress  forgiveness is all i ask  my love my life  she did not answer  he staggered to his feet  as he rose his eyes fell on the pan of burning charcoal  a terrible suspicion flashed across his mind  this giddinessthis nausea  the ignorance of the barbarian  this silence  o merciful heavens she was dying  he crawled toward her  he touched her  she fell forward with a lifeless sound upon the floor  he uttered a piercing shriek and threw himself beside her                                                     a file of gendarmes accompanied by the chef burke found him the next morning lying lifeless upon the floor  they laughed brutallythese cruel minions of the lawand disengaged his arm from the waist of the wooden dummy which they had come to reclaim for the mantuamaker  emptying a few bucketfuls of water over his form they finally succeeded in robbing him not only of his mistress but of that death he had coveted without her  ah we live in a strange world messieurs     fantine  after the french of victor hugo    prologue  as long as there shall exist three paradoxes a moral frenchman a religious atheist and a believing sceptic so long in fact as booksellers shall waitsay twentyfive yearsfor a new gospel so long as paper shall remain cheap and ink three sous a bottle i have no hesitation in saying that such books as these are not utterly profitless  victor hugo    i  to be good is to be queer  what is a good man  bishop myriel  my friend you will possibly object to this  you will say you know what a good man is  perhaps you will say your clergyman is a good man for instance  bah you are mistaken you are an englishman and an englishman is a beast  englishmen think they are moral when they are only serious  these englishmen also wear illshaped hats and dress horribly  bah they are canaille  still bishop myriel was a good manquite as good as you  better than you in fact  one day m myriel was in paris  this angel used to walk about the streets like any other man  he was not proud though finelooking well three gamins de paris called him bad names  says one  ah mon dieu there goes a priest look out for your eggs and chickens  what did this good man do  he called to them kindly  my children said he this is clearly not your fault  i recognize in this insult and irreverence only the fault of your immediate progenitors  let us pray for your immediate progenitors  they knelt down and prayed for their immediate progenitors  the effect was touching  the bishop looked calmly around  on reflection said he gravely i was mistaken this is clearly the fault of society  let us pray for society  they knelt down and prayed for society  the effect was sublimer yet  what do you think of that  you i mean  everybody remembers the story of the bishop and mother nez retrousse old mother nez retrouse sold asparagus  she was poor theres a great deal of meaning in that word my friend  some people say poor but honest  i say bah  bishop myriel bought six bunches of asparagus  this good man had one charming failing he was fond of asparagus  he gave her a franc and received three sous change  the sous were badcounterfeit  what did this good bishop do  he said i should not have taken change from a poor woman  then afterwards to his housekeeper never take change from a poor woman  then he added to himself for the sous will probably be bad    ii  when a man commits a crime society claps him in prison  a prison is one of the worst hotels imaginable  the people there are low and vulgar  the butter is bad the coffee is green  ah it is horrible  in prison as in a bad hotel a man soon loses not only his morals but what is much worse to a frenchman his sense of refinement and delicacy  jean valjean came from prison with confused notions of society  he forgot the modern peculiarities of hospitality  so he walked off with the bishops candlesticks  let us consider candlesticks were stolen that was evident society put jean valjean in prison that was evident too  in prison society took away his refinement that is evident likewise  who is society  you and i are society  my friend you and i stole those candlesticks    iii  the bishop thought so too  he meditated profoundly for six days on the morning of the seventh he went to the prefecture of police  he said monsieur have me arrested  i have stolen candlesticks  the official was governed by the law of society and refused  what did this bishop do  he had a charming ball and chain made affixed to his leg and wore it the rest of his life  this is a fact    iv  love is a mystery  a little friend of mine down in the country at auvergne said to me one day victor love is the worldit contains everything  she was only sixteen this sharpwitted little girl and a beautiful blonde  she thought everything of me  fantine was one of those women who do wrong in the most virtuous and touching manner  this is a peculiarity of french grisettes  you are an englishman and you dont understand  learn my friend learn  come to paris and improve your morals  fantine was the soul of modesty  she always wore highneck dresses highneck dresses are a sign of modesty  fantine loved tholmoyes  why  my god  what are you to do  it was the fault of her parents and she hadnt any  how shall you teach her you must teach the parent if you wish to educate the child  how would you become virtuous  teach your grandmother    v  when tholmoyes ran away from fantinewhich was done in a charming gentlemanly mannerfantine became convinced that a rigid sense of propriety might look upon her conduct as immoral she was a creature of sensitivenessand her eyes were opened  she was virtuous still and resolved to break off the liaison at once  so she put up her wardrobe and baby in a bundle  child as she was she loved them both  then left paris    vi  fantines native place had changed  m madelinean angel and inventor of jet workhad been teaching the villagers how to make spurious jet  this is a progressive age  those americanschildren of the westthey make nutmegs out of wood  i myself have seen hams made of pine in the wigwams of those children of the forest  but civilization has acquired deception too  society is made up of deception  even the best french society  still there was one sincere episode  eh  the french revolution    vii  m madeline was if anything better than myriel  m myriel was a saint  m madeline a good man  m myriel was dead  m madeline was living  that made all the difference  m madeline made virtue profitable  i have seen it written  be virtuous and you will be happy  where did i see this written  in the modern bible  no  in the koran no  in rousseau  no  diderot  no  where then  in a copybook    viii  m madeline was m le maire  this is how it came about  for a long time he refused the honor  one day an old woman standing on the steps said  bah a good mayor is a good thing  you are a good thing  be a good mayor  this woman was a rhetorician  she understood inductive ratiocination    ix  when this good m madeline whom the reader will perceive must have been a former convict and a very bad man gave himself up to justice as the real jean valjean about this same time fantine was turned away from the manufactory and met with a number of losses from society society attacked her and this is what she lost  first her lover  then her child  then her place  then her hair  then her teeth  then her liberty  then her life  what do you think of society after that  i tell you the present social system is a humbug    x  this is necessarily the end of fantine  there are other things that will be stated in other volumes to follow  dont be alarmed there are plenty of miserable people left  au revoirmy friend     la femme  after the french of m michelet    i  women as an institution  if it were not for women few of us would at present be in existence this is the remark of a cautious and discreet writer he was also sagacious and intelligent  woman  look upon her and admire her  gaze upon her and love her if she wishes to embrace you permit her  remember she is weak and you are strong  but dont treat her unkindly  dont make love to another woman before her face even if she be your wife  dont do it  always be polite even should she fancy somebody better than you  if your mother my dear amadis had not fancied your father better than somebody you might have been that somebodys son  consider this always be a philosopher even about women  few men understand women  frenchmen perhaps better than any one else  i am a frenchman    ii  the infant  she is a childa little thingan infant  she has a mother and father  let us suppose for example they are married  let us be moral if we cannot be happy and freethey are marriedperhapsthey love one anotherwho knows  but she knows nothing of this she is an infanta small thinga trifle  she is not lovely at first  it is cruel perhaps but she is red and positively ugly  she feels this keenly and cries  she weeps ah my god how she weeps  her cries and lamentations now are really distressing  tears stream from her in floods  she feels deeply and copiously like m alphonse de lamartine in his confessions  if you are her mother madame you will fancy worms you will examine her linen for pins and what not  ah hypocrite you even you misunderstand her  yet she has charming natural impulses  see how she tosses her dimpled arms  she looks longingly at her mother  she has a language of her own  she says goo goo and ga ga  she demands somethingthis infant  she is faint poor thing  she famishes  she wishes to be restored restore her mother  it is the first duty of a mother to restore her child    iii  the doll  she is hardly able to walk she already totters under the weight of a doll  it is a charming and elegant affair  it has pink cheeks and purpleblack hair  she prefers brunettes for she has already with the quick knowledge of a french infant perceived she is a blonde and that her doll cannot rival her  mon dieu how touching  happy child she spends hours in preparing its toilet she begins to show her taste in the exquisite details of its dress she loves it madly devotedly she will prefer it to bonbons  she already anticipates the wealth of love she will hereafter pour out on her lover her mother her father and finally perhaps her husband  this is the time the anxious parent will guide these first outpourings she will read her extracts from michelets lamour rousseaus heloise and the revue des deux mondes    iv  the mud pie  she was in tears today  she had stolen away from her bonne and was with some rustic infants they had noses in the air and large coarse hands and feet  they had seated themselves around a pool in the road and were fashioning fantastic shapes in the clayey soil with their hands her throat swelled and her eyes sparkled with delight as for the first time her soft palms touched the plastic mud  she made a graceful and lovely pie  she stuffed it with stones for almonds and plums  she forgot everything  it was being baked in the solar rays when madame came and took her away  she weeps  it is night and she is weeping still    v  her first love  she no longer doubts her beauty  she is loved  she saw him secretly he is vivacious and sprightly  he is famous  he has already had an affair with finfin the fille de chambre and poor finfin is desolate he is noble  she knows he is the son of madame la baronne couturiere she adores him  she affects not to notice him  poor little thing  hippolyte is distractedannihilatedinconsolable and charming  she admires his boots his cravat his little gloves his exquisite pantaloonshis coat and cane  she offers to run away with him  he is transported but magnanimous he is wearied perhaps  she sees him the next day offering flowers to the daughter of madame la comtesse blanchisseuse  she is again in tears  she reads paul et virginie  she is secretly transported  when she reads how the exemplary young woman laid down her life rather than appear en deshabille to her lover she weeps again  tasteful and virtuous bernardine de st pierrethe daughters of france admire you  all this time her doll is headless in the cabinet  the mud pie is broken on the road    vi  the wife  she is tired of loving and she marries  her mother thinks it on the whole the best thing  as the day approaches she is found frequently in tears  her mother will not permit the affianced one to see her and he makes several attempts to commit suicide  but something happens  perhaps it is winter and the water is cold perhaps there are not enough people present to witness his heroism  in this way her future husband is spared to her  the ways of providence are indeed mysterious  at this time her mother will talk with her  she will offer philosophy  she will tell her she was married herself  but what is this new and ravishing light that breaks upon her  the toilet and wedding clothes  she is in a new sphere  she makes out her list in her own charming writing  here it is let every mother heed it                                                                                                          she is married  on the day after she meets her old lover hippolyte he is again transported    the delicate reader will appreciate the omission of certain articles for which english synonymes are forbidden    vii  her old age  a frenchwoman never grows old     mary mcgillup  a southern novel  after belle boyd  with an introduction by g a sla    introduction  will you write me up  the scene was near temple bar  the speaker was the famous rebel mary mcgillupa young girl of fragile frame and long lustrous black hair  i must confess that the question was a peculiar one and under the circumstances somewhat puzzling  it was true i had been kindly treated by the northerners and though prejudiced against them was to some extent under obligations to them  it was true that i knew little or nothing of american politics history or geography  but when did an english writer ever weigh such trifles  turning to the speaker i inquired with some caution the amount of pecuniary compensation offered for the work  sir she said drawing her fragile form to its full height you insult meyou insult the south  but look ye here dye seethe tinthe bluntthe readythe stiff you know  dont ye see we cant do without that you know  it shall be contingent on the success of the story she answered haughtily  in the mean time take this precious gem  and drawing a diamond ring from her finger she placed it with a roll of mss in my hands and vanished  although unable to procure more than l1 2s 6 d from an intelligent pawnbroker to whom i stated the circumstances and with whom i pledged the ring my sympathies with the cause of a downtrodden and chivalrous people were at once enlisted  i could not help wondering that in rich england the home of the oppressed and the free a young and lovely woman like the fair author of those pages should be obliged to thus pawn her jewelsher marriage giftfor the means to procure her bread with the exception of the english aristocracywho much resemble themi do not know of a class of people that i so much admire as the southern planters may i become better acquainted with both  since writing the above the news of mr lincolns assassination has reached me  it is enough for me to say that i am dissatisfied with the result  i do not attempt to excuse the assassin  yet there will be men who will charge this act upon the chivalrous south  this leads me to repeat a remark once before made by me in this connection which has become justly celebrated  it is this  it is usual in cases of murder to look for the criminal among those who expect to be benefited by the crime  in the death of lincoln his immediate successor in office alone receives the benefit of his dying  if her majesty queen victoria were assassinated which heaven forbid the one most benefited by her decease would of course be his royal highness the prince of wales her immediate successor it would be unnecessary to state that suspicion would at once point to the real culprit which would of course be his royal highness this is logic  but i have done  after having thus stated my opinion in favor of the south i would merely remark that there is one who judgeth all thingswho weigheth the cause between brother and brotherand awardeth the perfect retribution and whose ultimate decision i as a british subject have only anticipated  g a s    chapter i  every reader of belle boyds narrative will remember an allusion to a lovely fragilelooking girl of nineteen who rivalled belle boyd in devotion to the southern cause and who like her earned the enviable distinction of being a rebel spy  i am that fragile young creature  although on friendly terms with the late miss boyd now mrs hardinge candor compels me to state that nothing but our common politics prevents me from exposing the ungenerous spirit she has displayed in this allusion to be dismissed in a single paragraph after years of  but i anticipate  to put up with this feeble and forced acknowledgment of services rendered would be a confession of a craven spirit which thank god though fragile and only nineteen i do not possess  i may not have the blood of a howard in my veins as some people whom i shall not disgrace myself by naming claim to have but i have yet to learn that the race of mcgillup ever yet brooked slight or insult  i shall not say that attention in certain quarters seems to have turned some peoples heads nor that it would have been more delicate if certain folks had kept quiet on the subject of their courtship and the rejection of certain offers when it is known that their forward conduct was all that procured them a husband  thank heaven the south has some daughters who are above such base considerations  while nothing shall tempt me to reveal the promises to share equally the fame of certain enterprises which were made by one who shall now be nameless i have deemed it only just to myself to put my own adventures upon record  if they are not equal to those of another individual it is because though fragile my education has taught me to have some consideration for the truth  i am done    chapter ii  i was born in missouri  my dislike for the northern scum was inherent this was shown at an early age in the extreme distaste i exhibited for websters spellingbookthe work of a wellknown eastern abolitionist  i cannot be too grateful for the consideration shown by my chivalrous fathera gentleman of the old schoolwho resisted to the last an attempt to introduce mitchells astronomy and geography into the public school of our district  when i state that this same mitchell became afterward a hireling helot in the yankee army every intelligent reader will appreciate the prophetic discrimination of this true son of the south  i was eight years old when i struck the first blow for southern freedom against the northern tyrant  it is hardly necessary to state that in this instance the oppressor was a pale overworked new england schoolmarm  the principle for which i was contending i felt however to be the same  resenting an affront put upon me i one day heaved a rock at the head of the vandal schoolmistress  i was seized and overpowered  my pen falters as i reach the climax  english readers will not give credit to this sickening storythe civilized world will avert its headbut i mary mcgillup was publicly spanked    note by g a sin the southwest any stone larger than a pea is termed a rock    chapter iii  but the chaotic vortex of civil war approached and fell destruction often procrastinated brooded in storm  as the english people may like to know what was really the origin of the rebellion i have no hesitation in giving them the true and only cause  slavery had nothing to do with it although the violation of the declaration of independence in the disregard by the north of the fugitive slave law might have provoked a less fiery people than the southrons  at the inception of the struggle a large amount of southern indebtedness was held by the people of the north  to force payment from the generous but insolvent debtorto obtain liquidation from the southern planterwas really the soulless and mercenary object of the craven northerners  let the common people of england look to this  let the improvident literary hack the starved impecunious grub street debtor the newspaper frequenter of sponginghouses remember this in their criticisms of the vile and slavish yankee    i make no pretension to fine writing but perhaps mrs hardinge can lay over that  o of course  m mcg   the declaration of independence grants to each subject the pursuit of life liberty and happiness  a fugitive slave may be said to personify life liberty and happiness  hence his pursuit is really legal  this is logic  g a s    chapter iv  the roasting of an abolitionist by a greatly infuriated community was my first taste of the horrors of civil war  heavens  why will the north persist in this fratricidal warfare  the expulsion of several union refugees which soon followed now fairly plunged my beloved state in the seething vortex  i was sitting at the piano one afternoon singing that stirring refrain so justly celebrated but which a craven spirit unworthy of england has excluded from some of her principal restaurants and was dwelling with some enthusiasm on the following line        huzza she spurns the northern scum   when a fragment of that scum clothed in that detestable blue uniform which is the symbol of oppression entered the apartment i have the honor of addressing the celebrated rebel spy miss mcgillup said the vandal officer  in a moment i was perfectly calm  with the exception of slightly expectorating twice in the face of the minion i did not betray my agitation  haughtily yet firmly i replied  i am  you looked as if you might be the brute replied as he turned on his heel to leave the apartment  in an instant i threw myself before him  you shall not leave here thus i shrieked grappling him with an energy which no one seeing my

stockings and placing a rose in my lustrous black hair proceeded at once to the camp of generals price and mosby to put them in possession of information which would lead to the destruction of a portion of the federal army  during a great part of my flight i was exposed to a running fire from the federal pickets of such coarse expressions as go it sally reb dust it my confederate beauty but i succeeded in reaching the glorious southern camp uninjured  in a week afterwards i was arrested by a lettre de cachet of mr stanton and placed in the bastile  british readers of my story will express
