11811651	fraternity  by john galsworthy     chapter i  the shadow  in the afternoon of the last day of april 190 a billowy sea of little broken clouds crowned the thin air above high street kensington this soft tumult of vapours covering nearly all the firmament was in onslaught round a patch of blue sky shaped somewhat like a star which still gleameda single gentian flower amongst innumerable grass each of these small clouds seemed fitted with a pair of unseen wings and as insects flight on their too constant journeys they were setting forth all ways round this starry blossom which burned so clear with the colour of its far fixity on one side they were massed in fleecy congeries so crowding each other that no edge or outline was preserved on the other higher stronger emergent from their fellowclouds they seemed leading the attack on that surviving gleam of the ineffable infinite was the variety of those million separate vapours infinite the unchanging unity of that fixed blue star  down in the street beneath this eternal warring of the various softwinged clouds on the unmisted ether men women children and their familiarshorses dogs and catswere pursuing their occupations with the sweet zest of the spring they streamed along and the noise of their frequenting rose in an unbroken roar i ii i  the crowd was perhaps thickest outside the premises of messrs rose and thorn every kind of being from the highest to the lowest passed in front of the hundred doors of this establishment and before the costume window a rather tall slight graceful woman stood thinking it really is gentian blue but i dont know whether i ought to buy it with all this distress about  her eyes which were greenishgrey and often ironical lest they should reveal her soul seemed probing a blue gown displayed in that window to the very heart of its desirability  and suppose stephen doesnt like me in it this doubt set her gloved fingers pleating the bosom of her frock into that little pleat she folded the essence of herself the wish to have and the fear of having the wish to be and the fear of being and her veil falling from the edge of her hat three inches from her face shrouded with its tissue her halfdecided little features her rather too high cheekbones her cheeks which were slightly hollowed as though time had kissed them just too much  the old man with a long face eyes rimmed like a parrots and discoloured nose who so long as he did not sit down was permitted to frequent the pavement just there and sell the westminster gazette marked her and took his empty pipe out of his mouth  it was his business to know all the passersby and his pleasure too his mind was thus distracted from the condition of his feet he knew this particular lady with the delicate face and found her puzzling she sometimes bought the paper which fate condemned him against his politics to sell the tory journals were undoubtedly those which her class of person ought to purchase he knew a lady when he saw one in fact before life threw him into the streets by giving him a disease in curing which his savings had disappeared he had been a butler and for the gentry had a respect as incurable as was his distrust of all that class of people who bought their things at these ere large establishments and attended these ere subscription dances at the town all over there he watched her with special interest not indeed attempting to attract attention though conscious in every fibre that he had only sold five copies of his early issues and he was sorry and surprised when she passed from his sight through one of the hundred doors  the thought which spurred her into messrs rose and thorns was this i am thirtyeight i have a daughter of seventeen i cannot afford to lose my husbands admiration the time is on me when i really must make myself look nice  before a long mirror in whose bright pool there yearly bathed hundreds of womens bodies divested of skirts and bodices whose unruffled surface reflected daily a dozen womens souls divested of everything her eyes became as bright as steel but having ascertained the need of taking two inches off the chest of the gentian frock one off its waist three off its hips and of adding one to its skirt they clouded again with doubt as though prepared to fly from the decision she had come to resuming her bodice she asked  when could you let me have it  at the end of the week madam  not till then  we are very pressed madam  oh but you must let me have it by thursday at the latest please  the fitter sighed i will do my best  i shall rely on you mrs stephen dallison 76 the old square  going downstairs she thought that poor girl looked very tired its a shame they give them such long hours and she passed into the street  a voice said timidly behind her westminister marm  thats the poor old creature thought cecilia dallison whose nose is so unpleasant i dont really think i and she felt for a penny in her little bag standing beside the poor old creature was a woman clothed in worn but neat black clothes and an ancient toque which had once known a better head the wan remains of a little bit of fur lay round her throat she had a thin face not without refinement mild very clear brown eyes and a twist of smooth black hair beside her was a skimpy little boy and in her arms a baby mrs dallison held out twopence for the paper but it was at the woman that she looked  oh mrs hughs she said weve been expecting you to hem the curtains  the woman slightly pressed the baby  i am very sorry maam i knew i was expected but ive had such trouble  cecilia winced oh really  yes mm its my husband  oh dear cecilia murmured but why didnt you come to us  i didnt feel up to it maam i didnt really  a tear ran down her cheek and was caught in a furrow near the mouth  mrs dallison said hurriedly yes yes im very sorry  this old gentleman mr creed lives in the same house with us and he is going to speak to my husband  the old man wagged his head on its lean stalk of neck  he ought to know better than beave imself so disrespectable he said  cecilia looked at him and murmured i hope he wont turn on you  the old man shuffled his feet  i likes to live at peace with everybody i shall have the police to im if he misdemeans hisself with me westminister sir and screening his mouth from mrs dallison he added in a loud whisper execution of the shoreditch murderer  cecilia felt suddenly as though the world were listening to her conversation with these two rather seedy persons  i dont really know what i can do for you mrs hughs ill speak to mr dallison and to mr hilary too  yes maam thank you maam  with a smile which seemed to deprecate its own appearance cecilia grasped her skirts and crossed the road i hope i wasnt unsympathetic she thought looking back at the three figures on the edge of the pavementthe old man with his papers and his discoloured nose thrust upwards under ironrimmed spectacles the seamstress in her black dress the skimpy little boy neither speaking nor moving they were looking out before them at the traffic and something in cecilia revolted at this sight it was lifeless hopeless unaesthetic  what can one do she thought for women like mrs hughs who always look like that and that poor old man i suppose i oughtnt to have bought that dress but stephen is tired of this  she turned out of the main street into a road preserved from commoner forms of traffic and stopped at a long low house half hidden behind the trees of its front garden  it was the residence of hilary dallison her husbands brother and himself the husband of bianca her own sister  the queer conceit came to cecilia that it resembled hilary its look was kindly and uncertain its colour a palish tan the eyebrows of its windows rather straight than arched and those deepset eyes the windows twinkled hospitably it had as it were a sparse moustache and beard of creepers and dark marks here and there like the lines and shadows on the faces of those who think too much beside it and apart though connected by a passage a studio stood and about that studioof white roughcast with a black oak door and peacockblue paintwas something a little hard and fugitive well suited to bianca who used it indeed to paint in it seemed to stand with its eyes on the house shrinking defiantly from too close company as though it could not entirely give itself to anything cecilia who often worried over the relations between her sister and her brotherinlaw suddenly felt how fitting and symbolical this was  but mistrusting inspirations which experience told her committed one too much she walked quickly up the stoneflagged pathway to the door lying in the porch was a little moonlightcoloured lady bulldog of toy breed who gazed up with eyes like agates delicately waving her bellrope tail as it was her habit to do towards everyone for she had been handed down clearer and paler with each generation till she had at last lost all the peculiar virtues of dogs that bait the bull  speaking the word miranda mrs stephen dallison tried to pat this daughter of the house the little bulldog withdrew from her caress being also unaccustomed to commit herself  mondays were blancas days and cecilia made her way towards the studio it was a large high room full of people  motionless by himself close to the door stood an old man very thin and rather bent with silvery hair and a thin silvery beard grasped in his transparent fingers he was dressed in a suit of smokegrey cottage tweed which smelt of peat and an oxford shirt whose collar ceasing prematurely exposed a lean brown neck his trousers too ended very soon and showed light socks in his attitude there was something suggestive of the patience and determination of a mule at cecilias approach he raised his eyes it was at once apparent why in so full a room he was standing alone those blue eyes looked as if he were about to utter a prophetic statement  they have been speaking to me of an execution he said  cecilia made a nervous movement  yes father  to take life went on the old man in a voice which though charged with strong emotion seemed to be speaking to itself was the chief mark of the insensate barbarism still prevailing in those days it sprang from that most irreligious fetish the belief in the permanence of the individual ego after death from the worship of that fetish had come all the sorrows of the human race  cecilia with an involuntary quiver of her little bag said  father how can you  they did not stop to love each other in this life they were so sure they had all eternity to do it in the doctrine was an invention to enable men to act like dogs with clear consciences love could never come to full fruition till it was destroyed  cecilia looked hastily round no one had heard she moved a little sideways and became merged in another group her fathers lips continued moving he had resumed the patient attitude which so slightly suggested mules a voice behind her said i do think your father is such an interesting man mrs dallison  cecilia turned and saw a woman of middle height with her hair done in the early italian fashion and very small dark lively eyes which looked as though her love of living would keep her busy each minute of her day and all the minutes that she could occupy of everybody elses days  mrs tallents smallpeace oh how do you do ive been meaning to come and see you for quite a long time but i know youre always so busy  with doubting eyes half friendly and half defensive as though chaffing to prevent herself from being chaffed cecilia looked at mrs tallents smallpeace whom she had met several times at biancas house the widow of a somewhat famous connoisseur she was now secretary of the league for educating orphans who have lost both parents vicepresident of the forlorn hope for maids in peril and treasurer to thursday hops for working girls she seemed to know every man and woman who was worth knowing and some besides to see all pictureshows to hear every new musician and attend the opening performance of every play with regard to literature she would say that authors bored her but she was always doing them good turns inviting them to meet their critics or editors and sometimesthough this was not generally knownpulling them out of the holes they were prone to get into by lending them a sum of moneyafter which as she would plaintively remark she rarely saw them more  she had a peculiar spiritual significance to mrs stephen dallison being just on the borderline between those of biancas friends whom cecilia did not wish and those whom she did wish to come to her own house for stephen a barrister in an official position had a keen sense of the ridiculous since hilary wrote books and was a poet and bianca painted their friends would naturally be either interesting or queer and though for stephens sake it was important to establish which was which they were so very often both such people stimulated taken in small doses but neither on her husbands account nor on her daughters did cecilia desire that they should come to her in swarms her attitude of mind towards them was in fact similara sort of pleasurable dreadto that in which she purchased the westminster gazette to feel the pulse of social progress  mrs tallents smallpeaces dark little eyes twinkled  i hear that mr stonethat is your fathers name i thinkis writing a book which will create quite a sensation when it comes out  cecilia bit her lips i hope it never will come out she was on the point of saying  what will it be called asked mrs tallents smallpeace i gather that its a book of universal brotherhood thats so nice  cecilia made a movement of annoyance who told you  ah said mrs tallents smallpeace i do think your sister gets such attractive people at her at homes they all take such interest in things  a little surprised at herself cecilia answered too much for me  mrs tallents smallpeace smiled i mean in art and social questions surely one cant be too interested in them  cecilia said rather hastily  oh no of course not and both ladies looked around them a buzz of conversation fell on cecilias ears  have you seen the aftermath its really quite wonderful  poor old chap hes so rococo  theres a new man  shes very sympathetic  but the condition of the poor  is that mr balladyce oh really  it gives you such a feeling of life  bourgeois  the voice of mrs tallents smallpeace broke through but do please tell me who is that young girl with the young man looking at the picture over there shes quite charming  cecilias cheeks went a very pretty pink  oh thats my little daughter  really have you a daughter as big as that why she must be seventeen  nearly eighteen  what is her name  thyme said cecilia with a little smile she felt that mrs tallents smallpeace was about to say how charming  mrs tallents smallpeace saw her smile and paused who is the young man with her  my nephew martin stone  the son of your brother who was killed with his wife in that dreadful alpine accident he looks a very decided sort of young man hes got that new look what is he  hes very nearly a doctor i never know whether hes quite finished or not  i thought perhaps he might have something to do with art  oh no he despises art  and does your daughter despise it too  no shes studying it  oh really how interesting i do think the rising generation amusing dont you theyre so independent  cecilia looked uneasily at the rising generation they were standing side by side before the picture curiously observant and detached exchanging short remarks and glances they seemed to watch all these circling chatting bending smiling people with a sort of youthful matteroffact halfhostile curiosity the young man had a pale face cleanshaven with a strong jaw a long straight nose a rather bumpy forehead which did not recede and clear grey eyes his sarcastic lips were firm and quick and he looked at people with disconcerting straightness the young girl wore a bluegreen frock her face was charming with eager hazelgrey eyes a bright colour and fluffy hair the colour of ripe nuts  thats your sisters picture the shadow theyre looking at isnt it asked mrs tallents smallpeace i remember seeing it on christmas day and the little model who was sitting for itan attractive type your brotherinlaw told me how interested you all were in her quite a romantic story wasnt it about her fainting from want of food when she first came to sit  cecilia murmured something her hands were moving nervously she looked ill at ease  these signs passed unperceived by mrs tallents smallpeace whose eyes were busy  in the fhmp of course i see a lot of young girls placed in delicate positions just on the borders dont you know you should really join the fhmp mrs dallison its a firstrate thingmost absorbing work  the doubting deepened in cecilias eyes  oh it must be she said ive so little time  mrs tallents smallpeace went on at once  dont you think that we live in the most interesting days there are such a lot of movements going on its quite exciting we all feel that we cant shut our eyes any longer to social questions i mean the condition of the people alone is enough to give one nightmare  yes yes said cecilia it is dreadful of course  politicians and officials are so hopeless one cant look for anything from them  cecilia drew herself up oh do you think so she said  i was just talking to mr balladyce he says that art and literature must be put on a new basis altogether  yes said cecilia really is he that funny little man  i think hes so monstrously clever  cecilia answered quickly i knowi know of course something must be done  yes said mrs tallents smallpeace absently i think we all feel that oh do tell me ive been talking to such a delightful personjust the type you see when you go into the citythousands of them all in such good black coats its so unusual to really meet one nowadays and theyre so refreshing they have such nice simple views there he is standing just behind your sister  cecilia by a nervous gesture indicated that she recognized the personality alluded to oh yes she said mr purcey i dont know why he comes to see us  i think hes so delicious said mrs tallents smallpeace dreamily her little dark eyes like bees had flown to sip honey from the flower in questiona man of broad build and medium height dressed with accuracy who seemed just a little out of his proper bed his mustachioed mouth wore a set smile his cheerful face was rather red with a forehead of no extravagant height or breadth and a conspicuous jaw his hair was thick and light in colour and his eyes were small grey and shrewd he was looking at a picture  hes so delightfully unconscious murmured mrs tallents smallpeace he didnt even seem to know that there was a problem of the lower classes  did he tell you that he had a picture asked cecilia gloomily  oh yes by harpignies with the accent on the pig its worth three times what he gave for it its so nice to be made to feel that there is still all that mass of people just simply measuring everything by what they gave for it  and did he tell you my grandfather carfaxs dictum in the banstock case muttered cecilia  oh yes the man who does not know his own mind should be made an irishman by act of parliament he said it was so awfully good  he would replied cecilia  he seems to depress you rather  oh no i believe hes quite a nice sort of person one cant be rude to him he really did what he thought a very kind thing to my father thats how we came to know him only its rather trying when he will come to call regularly he gets a little on ones nerves  ah thats just what i feel is so jolly about him no one would ever get on his nerves i do think weve got too many nerves dont you heres your brotherinlaw hes such an uncommonlooking man i want to have a talk with him about that little model a country girl wasnt she  she had turned her head towards a tall man with a very slight stoop and a brown thin bearded face who was approaching from the door she did not see that cecilia had flushed and was looking at her almost angrily the tall thin man put his hand on cecilias arm saying gently hallo cis stephen here yet  cecilia shook her head  you know mrs tallents smallpeace hilary  the tall man bowed his hazelcoloured eyes were shy gentle and deepset his eyebrows hardly ever still gave him a look of austere whimsicality his dark brown hair was very lightly touched with grey and a frequent kindly smile played on his lips his unmannerised manner was quiet to the point of extinction he had long thin brown hands and nothing peculiar about his dress  ill leave you to talk to mrs tallents smallpeace cecilia said  a knot of people round mr balladyce prevented her from moving far however and the voice of mrs smallpeace travelled to her ears  i was talking about that little model it was so good of you to take such interest in the girl i wondered whether we could do anything for her  cecilias hearing was too excellent to miss the tone of hilarys reply  oh thank you i dont think so  i fancied perhaps you might feel that our societyhers is an unsatisfactory profession for young girls  cecilia saw the back of hilarys neck grow red she turned her head away  of course there are many very nice models indeed said the voice of mrs tallents smallpeace i dont mean that they are necessarily at allif theyre girls of strong character and especially if they dont sit for thethe altogether  hilarys dry staccato answer came to cecilias ears thank you its very kind of you  oh of course if its not necessary your wifes picture was so clever mr dallisonsuch an interesting type  without intention cecilia found herself before that picture it stood with its face a little turned towards the wall as though somewhat in disgrace portraying the fulllength figure of a girl standing in deep shadow with her arms half outstretched as if asking for something her eyes were fixed on cecilia and through her parted lips breath almost seemed to come the only colour in the picture was the pale blue of those eyes the pallid red of those parted lips the still paler brown of the hair the rest was shadow in the foreground light was falling as though from a streetlamp  cecilia thought that girls eyes and mouth haunt me whatever made blanca choose such a subject it is clever of coursefor her     chapter ii  a family discussion  the marriage of sylvanus stone professor of the natural sciences to anne daughter of mr justice carfax of the wellknown county familythe carfaxes of spring deans hantswas recorded in the sixties the baptisms of martin cecilia and bianca son and daughters of sylvanus and anne stone were to be discovered registered in kensington in the three consecutive years following as though some singleminded person had been connected with their births after this the baptisms of no more offspring were to be found anywhere as if that single mind had encountered opposition but in the eighties there was noted in the register of the same church the burial of anne nee carfax wife of sylvanus stone in that nee carfax there was to those who knew something more than met the eye it summed up the mother of cecilia and bianca and in more subtle fashion cecilia and bianca too it summed up that fugitive barricading look in their bright eyes which though spoken of in the family as the carfax eyes were in reality far from coming from old mr justice carfax they had been his wifes in turn and had much annoyed a man of his decided character he himself had always known his mind and had let others know it too reminding his wife that she was an impracticable woman who knew not her own mind and devoting his lawful gains to securing the future of his progeny it would have disturbed him if he had lived to see his granddaughters and their times like so many able men of his generation farseeing enough in practical affairs he had never considered the possibility that the descendants of those who like himself had laid up treasure for their childrens children might acquire the quality of taking time balancing pros and cons looking ahead and not putting one foot down before picking the other up he had not foreseen in deed that to wobble might become an art in order that before anything was done people might know the full necessity for doing some thing and how impossible it would be to do indeed foolish to attempt to dothat which would fully meet the case he who had been a man of action all his life had not perceived how it would grow to be matter of common instinct that to act was to commit oneself and that while what one had was not precisely what one wanted what one had not if one had it would be as bad he had never been selfconsciousit was not the custom of his generationand having but little imagination had never suspected that he was laying up that quality for his descendants together with a competence which secured them a comfortable leisure  of all the persons in his granddaughters studio that afternoon that stray sheep mr purcey would have been perhaps the only one whose judgments he would have considered sound no one had laid up a competence for mr purcey who had been in business from the age of twenty  it is uncertain whether the mere fact that he was not in his own fold kept this visitor lingering in the studio when all other guests were gone or whether it was simply the feeling that the longer he stayed in contact with really artistic people the more distinguished he was becoming probably the latter for the possession of that harpignies a good specimen which he had bought by accident and subsequently by accident discovered to have a peculiar value had become a factor in his life marking him out from all his friends who went in more for a neat type of royal academy landscape together with reproductions of young ladies in eighteenthcentury costumes seated on horseback or in scotch gardens a junior partner in a bankinghouse of some importance he lived at wimbledon whence he passed up and down daily in his car to this he owed his acquaintance with the family of dallison for one day after telling his chauffeur to meet him at the albert gate he had set out to stroll down rotten row as he often did on the way home designing to nod to anybody that he knew it had turned out a somewhat barren expedition no one of any consequence had met his eye and it was with a certain almost fretful longing for distraction that in kensington gardens he came on an old man feeding birds out of a paper bag the birds having flown away on seeing him he approached the feeder to apologize  im afraid i frightened your birds sir he began  this old man who was dressed in smokegrey tweeds which exhaled a poignant scent of peat looked at him without answering  im afraid your birds saw me coming mr purcey said again  in those days said the aged stranger birds were afraid of men  mr purceys shrewd grey eyes perceived at once that he had a character to deal with  ah yes he said i seeyou allude to the present time thats very nice ha ha  the old man answered the emotion of fear is inseparably connected with a primitive state of fratricidal rivalry  this sentence put mr purcey on his guard  the old chap he thought is touched he evidently oughtnt to be out here by himself he debated therefore whether he should hasten away toward his car or stand by in case his assistance should be needed being a kindhearted man who believed in his capacity for putting things to rights and noticing a certain delicacya sort of something rather distinguished as he phrased it afterwardsin the old fellows face and figure he decided to see if he could be of any service they walked along together mr purcey watching his new friend askance and directing the march to where he had ordered his chauffeur to await him  you are very fond of birds i suppose he said cautiously  the birds are our brothers  the answer was of a nature to determine mr purcey in his diagnosis of the case  ive got my car here he said let me give you a lift home  this new but aged acquaintance did not seem to hear his lips moved as though he were following out some thought  in those days mr purcey heard him say the congeries of men were known as rookeries the expression was hardly just towards that handsome bird  mr purcey touched him hastily on the arm  ive got my car here sir he said do let me put you down  telling the story afterwards he had spoken thus  the old chap knew where he lived right enough but dash me if i believe he noticed that i was taking him there in my cari had the ai damyer out thats how i came to make the acquaintance of these dallisons hes the writer you know and she paintsrather the new schoolshe admires harpignies well when i got there in the car i found dallison in the garden of course i was careful not to put my foot into it i told him i found this old gentleman wandering about ive just brought him back in my car who should the old chap turn out to be but her father they were awfully obliged to me charmin people but very what dyou call it fin de sieclelike all these professors these artistic pigsseem to know rather a queer set advanced people and all that sort of cuckoo always talkin about the poor and societies and new religions and that kind of thing  though he had since been to see them several times the dallisons had never robbed him of the virtuous feeling of that good actionthey had never let him know that he had brought home not as he imagined a lunatic but merely a philosopher  it had been somewhat of a quiet shock to him to find mr stone close to the doorway when he entered biancas studio that afternoon for though he had seen him since the encounter in kensington gardens and knew that he was writing a book he still felt that he was not quite the sort of old man that one ought to meet about he had at once begun to tell him of the hanging of the shoreditch murderer as recorded in the evening papers mr stones reception of that news had still further confirmed his original views when all the guests were gonewith the exception of mr and mrs stephen dallison and miss dallison that awfully pretty girl and the young man who was always hangin about herhe had approached his hostess for some quiet talk she stood listening to him very well bred with just that habitual spice of mockery in her smile which to mr purceys eyes made her a very strikinlookin woman but rather there he would stop for it required a greater psychologist than he to describe a secret disharmony which a little marred her beauty due to some too violent cross of blood to an environment too unsuited to what notit was branded on her those who knew bianca dallison better than mr purcey were but too well aware of this fugitive proud spirit permeating one whose beauty would otherwise have passed unquestioned  she was a little taller than cecilia her figure rather fuller and more graceful her hair darker her eyes too darker and more deeply set her cheekbones higher her colouring richer that spirit of the age disharmony must have presided when a child so vivid and darkcoloured was christened bianca  mr purcey however was not a man who allowed the finest shades of feeling to interfere with his enjoyments she was a strikinlookin woman and there was thanks to harpignies a link between them  your father and i mrs dallison cant quite understand each other he began our views of life dont seem to hit it off exactly  really murmured bianca i should have thought that youd have got on so well  hes a little bit tooerscriptural for me perhaps said mr purcey with some delicacy  did we never tell you bianca answered softly that my father was a rather wellknown man of science before his illness  ah replied mr purcey a little puzzled that of course dyou know of all your pictures mrs dallison i think that one you call the shadow is the most rippin theres a something about it that gets hold of you that was the original wasnt it at your christmas partyattractive girlits an awfly good likeness  biancas face had changed but mr purcey was not a man to notice a little thing like that  if ever you want to part with it he said i hope youll give me a chance i mean itd be a pleasure to me to have it i think itll be worth a lot of money some day  bianca did not answer and mr purcey feeling suddenly a little awkward said ive got my car waiting i must be offreally shaking hands with all of them he went away  when the door had closed behind his back a universal sigh went up it was followed by a silence which hilary broke  well smoke stevie if cis doesnt mind  stephen dallison placed a cigarette between his moustacheless lips always rather screwed up and ready to nip with a smile anything that might make him feel ridiculous  phew he said our friend purcey becomes a little tedious he seems to take the whole of philistia about with him  hes a very decent fellow murmured hilary  a bit heavy surely stephen dallisons face though also long and narrow was not much like his brothers his eyes though not unkind were far more scrutinising inquisitive and practical his hair darker smoother  letting a puff of smoke escape he added  now thats the sort of man to give you a good sound opinion you should have asked him cis  cecilia answered with a frown  dont chaff stephen im perfectly serious about mrs hughs  well i dont see what i can do for the good woman my dear one cant interfere in these domestic matters  but it seems dreadful that we who employ her should be able to do nothing for her dont you think so b  i suppose we could do something for her if we wanted to badly enough  biancas voice which had the selfdistrustful ring of modern music suited her personality  a glance passed between stephen and his wife  thats b all over it seemed to say  hound street where they live is a horrid place  it was thyme who spoke and everybody looked round at her  how do you know that asked cecilia  i went to see  with whom  martin  the lips of the young man whose name she mentioned curled sarcastically  hilary asked gently  well my dear what did you see  most of the doors are open  bianca murmured that doesnt tell us much  on the contrary said martin suddenly in a deep bass voice it tells you everything go on  the hughs live on the top floor at no 1 its the best house in the street on the groundfloor are some people called budgen hes a labourer and shes lame theyve got one son the hughs have let off the firstfloor frontroom to an old man named creed  yes i know cecilia muttered  he makes about one and tenpence a day by selling papers the backroom on that floor they let of course to your little model aunt b  she is not my model now  there was a silence such as falls when no one knows how far the matter mentioned is safe to touch on thyme proceeded with her report  her rooms much the best in the house its airy and it looks out over someones garden i suppose she stays there because its so cheap the hughs rooms are she stopped wrinkling her straight nose  so thats the household said hilary two married couples one young man one young girlhis eyes travelled from one to another of the two married couples the young man and the young girl collected in this roomand one old man he added softly  not quite the sort of place for you to go poking about in thyme stephen said ironically do you think so martin  why not  stephen raised his brows and glanced towards his wife her face was dubious a little scared there was a silence then bianca spoke  well that word like nearly all her speeches seemed rather to disconcert her hearers  so hughs illtreats her said hilary  she says so replied ceciliaat least thats what i understood of course i dont know any details  she had better get rid of him i should think bianca murmured  out of the silence that followed thymes clear voice was heard saying  she cant get a divorce she could get a separation  cecilia rose uneasily these words concreted suddenly a wealth of halfacknowledged doubts about her little daughter this came of letting her hear people talk and go about with martin she might even have been listening to her grandfathersuch a thought was most disturbing and afraid on the one hand of gainsaying the liberty of speech and on the other of seeming to approve her daughters knowledge of the world she looked at her husband  but stephen did not speak feeling no doubt that to pursue the subject would be either to court an ethical even an abstract disquisition and this one did not do in anybodys presence much less ones wifes or daughters or to touch on sordid facts of doubtful character which was equally distasteful in the circumstances he too however was uneasy that thyme should know so much  the dusk was gathering outside the fire threw a flickering light fitfully outlining their figures making those faces so familiar to each other a little mysterious  at last stephen broke the silence of course im very sorry for her but youd better let it aloneyou cant tell with that sort of people you never can make out what they wantits safer not to meddle at all events its a matter for a society to look into first  cecilia answered but shes on my conscience stephen  theyre all on my conscience muttered hilary  bianca looked at him for the first time then turning to her nephew said what do you say martin  the young man whose face was stained by the firelight the colour of pale cheese made no answer  but suddenly through the stillness came a voice  i have thought of something  everyone turned round mr stone was seen emerging from behind the shadow his frail figure in its grey tweeds his silvery hair and beard were outlined sharply against the wall  why father cecilia said we didnt know that you were here  mr stone looked round bewildered it seemed as if he too had been ignorant of that fact  what is it that youve thought of  the firelight leaped suddenly on to mr stones thin yellow hand  each of us he said has a shadow in those placesin those streets  there was a vague rustling as of people not taking a remark too seriously and the sound of a closing door     chapter iii  hilarys brown study  what do you really think uncle hilary  turning at his writingtable to look at the face of his young niece hilary dallison answered  my dear we have had the same state of affairs since the beginning of the world there is no chemical process so far as my knowledge goes that does not make waste products what your grandfather calls our shadows are the waste products of the social process that there is a submerged tenth is as certain as that there is an emerged fiftieth like ourselves exactly who they are and how they come whether they can ever be improved away is i think as uncertain as anything can be  the figure of the girl seated in the big armchair did not stir her lips pouted contemptuously a frown wrinkled her forehead  martin says that a thing is only impossible when we think it so  faith and the mountain im afraid  thymes foot shot forth it nearly came into contact with miranda the little bulldog  oh duckie  but the little moonlight bulldog backed away  i hate these slums uncle theyre so disgusting  hilary leaned his face on his thin hand it was his characteristic attitude  they are hateful disgusting and heartrending that does not make the problem any the less difficult does it  i believe we simply make the difficulties ourselves by seeing them  hilary smiled does martin say that too  of course he does  speaking broadly murmured hilary i see only one difficultyhuman nature  thyme rose i think it horrible to have a low opinion of human nature  my dear said hilary dont you think perhaps that people who have what is called a low opinion of human nature are really more tolerant of it more in love with it in fact than those who looking to what human nature might be are bound to hate what human nature is  the look which thyme directed at her uncles amiable attractive face with its pointed beard high forehead and special little smile seemed to alarm hilary  i dont want you to have an unnecessarily low opinion of me my dear im not one of those people who tell you that everythings all right because the rich have their troubles as well as the poor a certain modicum of decency and comfort is obviously necessary to man before we can begin to do anything but pity him but that doesnt make it any easier to know how youre going to insure him that modicum of decency and comfort does it  weve got to do it said thyme it wont wait any longer  my dear said hilary think of mr purcey what proportion of the upper classes do you imagine is even conscious of that necessity we who have got what i call the social conscience rise from the platform of mr purcey were just a gang of a few thousands to mr purceys tens of thousands and how many even of us are prepared or for the matter of that fitted to act on our consciousness in spite of your grandfathers ideas im afraid were all too much divided into classes man acts and always has acted in classes  ohclasses answered thymethats the old superstition uncle  is it i thought ones class perhaps was only oneself exaggeratednot to be shaken off for instance what are you and i with our particular prejudices going to do  thyme gave him the cruel look of youth which seemed to say you are my very good uncle and a dear but you are more than twice my age that i think is conclusive  has something been settled about mrs hughs she asked abruptly  what does your father say this morning  thyme picked up her portfolio of drawings and moved towards the door  fathers hopeless he hasnt an idea beyond referring her to the spb  she was gone and hilary with a sigh took his pen up but he wrote nothing down   hilary and stephen dallison were grandsons of that canon dallison well known as friend and sometime adviser of a certain victorian novelist the canon who came of an old oxfordshire family which for three hundred years at least had served the church or state was himself the author of two volumes of socratic dialogues he had bequeathed to his sona permanent official in the foreign officeif not his literary talent the tradition at all events of culture this tradition had in turn been handed on to hilary and stephen  educated at a public school and cambridge blessed with competent though not large independent incomes and brought up never to allude to money if it could possibly be helped the two young men had been turned out of the mint with something of the same outward stamp on them both were kindly both fond of openair pursuits and neither of them lazy both too were very civilised with that bonedeep decency that dislike of violence nowhere so prevalent as in the upper classes of a country whose settled institutions are as old as its roads or the walls which insulate its parks but as time went on the one great quality which heredity and education environment and means had bred in both of themselfconsciousnessacted in these two brothers very differently to stephen it was preservative keeping him as it were in ice throughout hotweather seasons enabling him to know exactly when he was in danger of decomposition so that he might nip the process in the bud it was with him a healthy perhaps slightly chemical ingredient binding his component parts causing them to work together safely homogeneously in hilary the effect seemed to have been otherwise like some slow and subtle poison this great quality selfconsciousness had soaked his system through and through permeated every cranny of his spirit so that to think a definite thought or do a definite deed was obviously becoming difficult to him it took in the main the form of a sort of gentle desiccating humour  its a remarkable thing he had one day said to stephen that by the process of assimilating little bits of choppedup cattle one should be able to form the speculation of how remarkable a thing it is  stephen had paused a second before answeringthey were lunching off roast beef in the law courtshe had then said  youre surely not going to eschew the higher mammals like our respected fatherinlaw  on the contrary said hilary to chew them but it is remarkable for all that you missed my point  it was clear that a man who could see anything remarkable in such a thing was far gone and stephen had murmured  my dear old chap youre getting too introspective  hilary having given his brother the special retiring smile which seemed not only to say dont let me bore you but also well perhaps you had better wait outside the conversation closed  that smile of hilarys which jibbed away from things though disconcerting and apt to put an end to intercourse was natural enough a sensitive man who had passed his life amongst cultivated people in the making of books guarded from real wants by modest not vulgar affluence had not reached the age of fortytwo without finding his delicacy sharpened to the point of fastidiousness even his dog could see the sort of man he was she knew that he would take no liberties either with her ears or with her tail she knew that he would never hold her mouth ajar and watch her teeth as some men do that when she was lying on her back he would gently rub her chest without giving her the feeling that she was doing wrong as women will and if she sat as she was sitting now with her eyes fixed on his study fire he would never she knew even from afar prevent her thinking of the nothing she loved to think on  in his study which smelt of a particular mild tobacco warranted to suit the nerves of any literary man there was a bust of socrates which always seemed to have a strange attraction for its owner he had once described to a fellowwriter the impression produced on him by that plaster face so capaciously ugly as though comprehending the whole of human life sharing all mans gluttony and lust his violence and rapacity but sharing also his strivings toward love and reason and serenity  hes telling us said hilary to drink deep to dive down and live with mermaids to lie out on the hills under the sun to sweat with helots to know all things and all men no seat he says among the wise unless weve been through it all before we climb thats how he strikes menot too cheering for people of our sort  under the shadow of this bust hilary rested his forehead on his hand in front of him were three open books and a pile of manuscript and pushed to one side a little sheaf of pieces of greenwhite paper presscuttings of his latest book  the exact position occupied by his work in the life of such a man is not too easy to define he earned an income by it but he was not dependent on that income as poet critic writer of essays he had made himself a certain namenot a great name but enough to swear by whether his fastidiousness could have stood the conditions of literary existence without private means was now and then debated by his friends it could probably have done so better than was supposed for he sometimes startled those who set him down as a dilettante by a horny way of retiring into his shell for the finish of a piece of work  try as he would that morning to keep his thoughts concentrated on his literary labour they wandered to his conversation with his niece and to the discussion on mrs hughs the family seamstress in his wifes studio the day before stephen had lingered behind cecilia and thyme when they went away after dinner to deliver a last counsel to his brother at the garden gate  never meddle between man and wifeyou know what the lower classes are  and across the dark garden he had looked back towards the house one room on the groundfloor alone was lighted through its open window the head and shoulders of mr stone could be seen close to a small green readinglamp stephen shook his head murmuring  but i say our old friend eh in those placesin those streets its worse than simple crankinessthe poor old chap is getting almost  and touching his forehead lightly with two fingers he had hurried off with the everspringy step of one whose regularity habitually controls his imagination  pausing a minute amongst the bushes hilary too had looked at the lighted window which broke the dark front of his house and his little moonlight bulldog peering round his legs had gazed up also mr stone was still standing pen in hand presumably deep in thought his silvered head and beard moved slightly to the efforts of his brain he came over to the window and evidently not seeing his soninlaw faced out into the night  in that darkness were all the shapes and lights and shadows of a london night in spring the trees in dark bloom the wan yellow of the gaslamps pale emblems of the selfconsciousness of towns the clustered shades of the tiny leaves spilled purple on the surface of the road like bunches of black grapes squeezed down into the earth by the feet of the passersby there too were shapes of men and women hurrying home and the great blocked shapes of the houses where they lived a halo hovered above the citya high haze of yellow light dimming the stars the black slow figure of a policeman moved noiselessly along the railings opposite  from then till eleven oclock when he would make himself some cocoa on a little spiritlamp the writer of the book of universal brotherhood would alternate between his bent posture above his manuscript and his blank consideration of the night  with a jerk hilary came back to his reflections beneath the bust of socrates  each of us has a shadow in those placesin those streets  there certainly was a virus in that notion one must either take it as a jest like stephen or what must one do how far was it ones business to identify oneself with other people especially the helplesshow far to preserve oneself intactinteger vita hilary was no young person like his niece or martin to whom everything seemed simple nor was he an old person like their grandfather for whom life had lost its complications  and very conscious of his natural disabilities for a decision on a like or indeed on any subject except perhaps a point of literary technique he got up from his writingtable and taking his little bulldog went out his intention was to visit mrs hughs in hound street and see with his own eyes the state of things but he had another reason too for wishing to go there      chapter iv  the little model  when in the preceding autumn bianca began her picture called the shadow nobody was more surprised than hilary that she asked him to find her a model for the figure not knowing the nature of the picture nor having been for many yearsperhaps neveradmitted into the workings of his wifes spirit he said  why dont you ask thyme to sit for you  blanca answered shes not the type at alltoo matteroffact besides i dont want a lady the figures to be half draped  hilary smiled  blanca knew quite well that he was smiling at this distinction between ladies and other women and understood that he was smiling not so much at her but at himself for secretly agreeing with the distinction she had made  and suddenly she smiled too  there was the whole history of their married life in those two smiles they meant so much so many thousand hours of suppressed irritation so many baffled longings and earnest efforts to bring their natures together they were the supreme quiet evidence of the divergence of two livesthat slow divergence which had been far from being wilful and was the more hopeless in that it had been so gradual and so gentle they had never really had a quarrel having enlightened views of marriage but they had smiled they had smiled so often through so many years that no two people in the world could very well be further from each other their smiles had banned the revelation even to themselves of the tragedy of their wedded state it is certain that neither could help those smiles which were not intended to wound but came on their faces as naturally as moonlight falls on water out of their inimically constituted souls  hilary spent two afternoons among his artist friends trying by means of the indications he had gathered to find a model for the shadow he had found one at last her name barton and address had been given him by a painter of still life called french  shes never sat to me he said my sister discovered her in the west country somewhere shes got a story of some sort i dont know what she came up about three months ago i think  shes not sitting to your sister now hilary asked  no said the painter of still life my sisters married and gone out to india i dont know whether shed sit for the halfdraped but i should think so shell have to sooner or later she may as well begin especially to a woman theres a something about her thats attractiveyou might try her and with these words he resumed the painting of still life which he had broken off to talk to hilary  hilary had written to this girl to come and see him she had come just before dinner the same day  he found her standing in the middle of his study not daring as it seemed to go near the furniture and as there was very little light he could hardly see her face she was resting a foot very patient very still in an old brown skirt an illshaped blouse and a bluegreen tamoshanter cap hilary turned up the light he saw a round little face with broad cheekbones flowerblue eyes short lampblack lashes and slightly parted lips it was difficult to judge of her figure in those old clothes but she was neither short nor tall her neck was white and well set on her hair pale brown and abundant hilary noted that her chin though not receding was too soft and small but what he noted chiefly was her look of patient expectancy as though beyond the present she were seeing something not necessarily pleasant which had to come if he had not known from the painter of still life that she was from the country he would have thought her a townbred girl she looked so pale her appearance at all events was not too matteroffact her speech however with its slight westcountry burr was matteroffact enough concerned entirely with how long she would have to sit and the pay she was to get for it in the middle of their conversation she sank down on the floor and hilary was driven to restore her with biscuits and liqueur which in his haste he took for brandy it seemed she had not eaten since her breakfast the day before which had consisted of a cup of tea in answer to his remonstrance she made this matteroffact remark  if you havent money you cant buy things theres no one i can ask up here im a stranger  then you havent been getting work  no the little model answered sullenly i dont want to sit as most of them want me to till im obliged the blood rushed up in her face with startling vividness then left it white again  ah thought hilary she has had experience already  both he and his wife were accessible to cases of distress but the nature of their charity was different hilary was constitutionally unable to refuse his aid to anything that held out a hand for it bianca whose sociology was sounder while affirming that charity was wrong since in a properly constituted state no one should need help referred her cases like stephen to the society for the prevention of begging which took much time and many pains to ascertain the worst  but in this case what was of importance was that the poor girl should have a meal and after that to find out if she were living in a decent house and since she appeared not to be to recommend her somewhere better and as in charity it is always well to kill two birds with one expenditure of force it was found that mrs hughs the seamstress had a single room to let unfurnished and would be more than glad of four shillings or even three and six a week for it furniture was also found for her a bed that creaked a washstand table and chest of drawers a carpet two chairs and certain things to cook with some of those old photographs and prints that hide in cupboards and a peculiar little clock which frequently forgot the time of day all these and some elementary articles of dress were sent round in a little van with three ferns whose time had nearly come and a piece of the plant called honesty soon after this she came to sit she was a very quiet and passive little model and was not required to pose halfdraped bianca having decided that after all the shadow was better represented fully clothed for though she discussed the nude and looked on it with freedom when it came to painting unclothed people she felt a sort of physical aversion  hilary who was curious as a man naturally would be about anyone who had fainted from hunger at his feet came every now and then to see and would sit watching this little halfstarved girl with kindly and screwedup eyes about his personality there was all the evidence of that saying current among those who knew him hilary would walk a mile sooner than tread on an ant the little model from the moment when he poured liqueur between her teeth seemed to feel he had a claim on her for she reserved her small matteroffact confessions for his ears she made them in the garden coming in or going out or outside and now and then inside his study like a child who comes and shows you a sore finger thus quite suddenly  ive four shillings left over this week mr dallison or old mr creeds gone to the hospital today mr dallison  her face soon became less bloodless than on that first evening but it was still pale inclined to colour in wrong places on cold days with little blue veins about the temples and shadows under the eyes the lips were still always a trifle parted and she still seemed to be looking out for what was coming like a little madonna or venus in a botticelli picture this look of hers coupled with the matteroffactness of her speech gave its flavour to her personality  on christmas day the picture was on view to mr purcey who had chanced to give his car a run and to other connoisseurs bianca had invited her model to be present at this function intending to get her work but slipping at once into a corner the girl had stood as far as possible behind a canvas people seeing her standing there and noting her likeness to the picture looked at her with curiosity and passed on murmuring that she was an interesting type they did not talk to her either because they were afraid she could not talk of the things they could talk of or that they could not talk of the things she could talk of or because they were anxious not to seem to patronize her she talked to one therefore this occasioned hilary some distress he kept coming up and smiling at her or making tentative remarks or jests to which she would reply yes mr dallison or no mr dallison as the case might be  seeing him return from one of these little visits an art critic standing before the picture had smiled and his round cleanshaven sensual face had assumed a greenish tint in eyes and cheeks as of the fat in turtle soup  the only two other people who had noticed her particularly were those old acquaintances mr purcey and mr stone mr purcey had thought rather a goodlookin girl and his eyes strayed somewhat continually in her direction there was something piquant and as it were unlawfully enticing to him in the fact that she was a real artists model  mr stones way of noticing her had been different he had approached in his slightly inconvenient way as though seeing but one thing in the whole world  you are living by yourself he had said i shall come and see you  made by the art critic or by mr purcey that somewhat strange remark would have had one meaning made by mr stone it obviously had another having finished what he had to say the author of the book of universal brotherhood had bowed and turned to go perceiving that he saw before him the door and nothing else everybody made way for him at once the remarks that usually arose behind his back began to be heardextraordinary old man you know he bathes in the serpentine all the year round and he cooks his food himself and does his own room they say and all the rest of his time he writes a book a perfect crank     chapter v  the comedy begins  the art critic who had smiled waslike all mena subject for pity rather than for blame an irishman of real ability he had started life with high ideals and a belief that he could live with them he had hoped to serve art to keep his service pure but having one day let his acid temperament out of hand to revel in an orgy of personal retaliation he had since never known when she would slip her chain and come home smothered in mire moreover he no longer chastised her when she came his ideals had left him one by one he now lived alone immune from dignity and shame soothing himself with whisky a man of rancour meet for pity and in his cups contented he had lunched freely before coming to blancas christmas function but by four oclock the gases which had made him feel the world a pleasant place had nearly all evaporated and he was suffering from a wish to drink again or it may have been that this girl with her soft look gave him the feeling that she ought to have belonged to him and as she did not he felt perhaps a natural irritation that she belonged or might belong to somebody else or again it was possibly his natural male distaste for the works of women painters which induced an awkward frame of mind  two days later in a daily paper over no signature appeared this little paragraph we learn that the shadow painted by bianca stone who is not generally known to be the wife of the writer mr hilary dallison will soon be exhibited at the bencox gallery this very findesiecle creation with its unpleasant subject representing a woman presumably of the streets standing beneath a gaslamp is a somewhat anaemic piece of painting if mr dallison who finds the type an interesting one embodies her in one of his very charming poems we trust the result will be less bloodless  the little piece of greenwhite paper containing this information was handed to hilary by his wife at breakfast the blood mounted slowly in his cheeks biancas eyes fastened themselves on that flush whether or noas philosophers saylittle things are all big with the past of whose chain they are the latest links they frequently produce what apparently are great results  the marital relations of hilary and his wife which till then had been those of at all events formal conjugality changed from that moment after ten oclock at night their lives became as separate as though they lived in different houses and this change came about without expostulations reproach or explanation just by the turning of a key and even this was the merest symbol employed once only to save the ungracefulness of words such a hint was quite enough for a man like hilary whose delicacy sense of the ridiculous and peculiar faculty of starting back and retiring into himself put the need of anything further out of the question both must have felt too that there was nothing that could be explained an anonymous double entendre was not precisely evidence on which to found a rupture of the marital tie the trouble was so much deeper than thatthe throbbing of a womans wounded selfesteem of the feeling that she was no longer loved which had long cried out for revenge  one morning in the middle of the week after this incident the innocent author of it presented herself in hilarys study and standing in her peculiar patient attitude made her little statements as usual they were very little ones as usual she seemed helpless and suggested a child with a sore finger she had no other work she owed the weeks rent she did not know what would happen to her mrs dallison did not want her any more she could not tell what she had done the picture was finished she knew but mrs dallison had said she was going to paint her again in another picture  hilary did not reply  that old gentleman mrmr stone had been to see her he wanted her to come and copy out his book for two hours a day from four to six at a shilling an hour ought she to come please he said his book would take him years  before answering her hilary stood for a full minute staring at the fire the little model stole a look at him he suddenly turned and faced her his glance was evidently disconcerting to the girl it was indeed a critical and dubious look such as he might have bent on a folio of doubtful origin  dont you think he said at last that it would be much better for you to go back into the country  the little model shook her head vehemently  oh no  well but why not this is a most unsatisfactory sort of life  the girl stole another look at him then said sullenly  i cant go back there  what is it arent your people nice to you  she grew red  no and i dont want to go then evidently seeing from hilarys face that his delicacy forbade his questioning her further she brightened up and murmured the old gentleman said it would make me independent  well replied hilary with a shrug youd better take his offer  she kept turning her face back as she went down the path as though to show her gratitude and presently looking up from his manuscript he saw her face still at the railings peering through a lilac bush suddenly she skipped like a child let out of school hilary got up perturbed the sight of that skipping was like the rays of a lantern turned on the dark street of another human beings life it revealed as in a flash the loneliness of this child without money and without friends in the midst of this great town  the months of january february march passed and the little model came daily to copy the book of universal brotherhood  mr stones room for which he insisted on paying rent was never entered by a servant it was on the groundfloor and anyone passing the door between the hours of four and six could hear him dictating slowly pausing now and then to spell a word in these two hours it appeared to be his custom to read out for fair copying the labours of the other seven  at five oclock there was invariably a sound of plates and cups and out of it the little models voice would rise matteroffact soft monotoned making little statements and in turn mr stones also making statements which clearly lacked cohesion with those of his young friend on one occasion the door being open hilary heard distinctly the following conversation  the little model mr creed says he was a butler hes got an ugly nose a pause  mr stone in those days men were absorbed in thinking of their individualities their occupations seemed to them important  the little model mr creed says his savings were all swallowed up by illness  mr stone it was not so  the little model mr creed says he was always brought up to go to church  mr stone suddenly there has been no church worth going to since a d 700  the little model but he doesnt go  and with a flying glance through the just open door hilary saw her holding breadandbutter with inky fingers her lips a little parted expecting the next bite and her eyes fixed curiously on mr stone whose transparent hand held a teacup and whose eyes were immovably fixed on distance  it was one day in april that mr stone heralded by the scent of harris tweed and baked potatoes which habitually encircled him appeared at five oclock in hilarys study doorway  she has not come he said  hilary laid down his pen it was the first real spring day  will you come for a walk with me sir instead he asked  yes said mr stone  they walked out into kensington gardens hilary with his head rather bent towards the ground and mr stone with eyes fixed on his far thoughts slightly poking forward his silver beard  in their favourite firmaments the stars of crocuses and daffodils were shining almost every tree had its pigeon cooing every bush its blackbird in full song and on the paths were babies in perambulators these were their happy huntinggrounds and here they came each day to watch from a safe distance the little dirty girls sitting on the grass nursing little dirty boys to listen to the ceaseless chatter of these common urchins and learn to deal with the great problem of the lowest classes and babies sat in their perambulators thinking and sucking indiarubber tubes dogs went before them and nursemaids followed after  the spirit of colour was flying in the distant trees swathing them with brownishpurple haze the sky was saffroned by dying sunlight it was such a day as brings a longing to the heart like that which the moon brings to the hearts of children  mr stone and hilary sat down in the broad walk  elmtrees said mr stone it is not known when they assumed their present shape they have one universal soul it is the same with man he ceased and hilary looked round uneasily they were alone on the bench  mr stones voice rose again their form and balance is their single soul they have preserved it from century to century this is all they live for in those dayshis voice sank he had plainly forgotten that he was not alonewhen men had no universal conceptions they would have done well to look at the trees instead of fostering a number of little souls on the pabulum of varying theories of future life they should have been concerned to improve their present shapes and thus to dignify mans single soul  elms were always considered dangerous trees i believe said hilary  mr stone turned and seeing his soninlaw beside him asked  you spoke to me i think  yes sir  mr stone said wistfully  shall we walk  they rose from the bench and walked on  the explanation of the little models absence was thus stated by herself to hilary i had an appointment  more work  a friend of mr french  yeswho  mr lennard hes a sculptor hes got a studio in chelsea he wants me to pose to him  ah  she stole a glance at hilary and hung her head  hilary turned to the window you know what posing to a sculptor means of course  the little models voice sounded behind him matteroffact as ever he said i was just the figure he was looking for  hilary continued to stare through the window i thought you didnt mean to begin standing for the nude  i dont want to stay poor always  hilary turned round at the strange tone of these unexpected words  the girl was in a streak of sunlight her pale cheeks flushed her pale halfopened lips red her eyes in their setting of short black lashes wide and mutinous her young round bosom heaving as if she had been running  i dont want to go on copying books all my life  oh very well  mr dallison i didnt mean thati didnt really i want to do what you tell me to doi do  hilary stood contemplating her with the dubious critical look as though asking what is there behind you are you really a genuine edition or what which had so disconcerted her before at last he said you must do just as you like i never advise anybody  but you dont want me toi know you dont of course if you dont want me to then itll be a pleasure not to  hilary smiled  dont you like copying for mr stone  the little model made a face i like mr stonehes such a funny old gentleman  that is the general opinion answered hilary but mr stone you know thinks that we are funny  the little model smiled faintly too the streak of sunlight had slanted past her and standing there behind its glamour and million floating specks of golddust she looked for the moment like the young shade of spring watching with expectancy for what the year would bring her  with the words i am ready spoken from the doorway mr stone interrupted further colloquy  but though the girls position in the household had to all seeming become established now and then some little incidentstraws blowing down the windshowed feelings at work beneath the familys apparent friendliness beneath that tentative and almost apologetic manner towards the poor or helpless which marks out those who own what hilary had called the social conscience only three days indeed before he sat in his brown study meditating beneath the bust of socrates cecilia coming to lunch had let fall this remark  of course i know nobody can read his handwriting but i cant think why father doesnt dictate to a typist instead of to that little girl she could go twice the pace  blancas answer deferred for a few seconds was  hilary perhaps knows  do you dislike her coming here asked hilary  not particularly why  i thought from your tone you did  i dont dislike her coming here for that purpose  does she come for any other  cecilia dropping her quick glance to her fork said just a little hastily father is extraordinary of course  but the next three days hilary was out in the afternoon when the little model came  this then was the other reason on the morning of the first of may which made him not averse to go and visit mrs hughs in hound street kensington     chapter vi  first pilgrimage to hound street  hilary and his little bulldog entered hound street from its eastern end it was a grey street of threestoried houses all in one style of architecture nearly all their doors were open and on the doorsteps babes and children were enjoying easter holidays they sat in apathy varied by sudden little slaps and bursts of noise nearly all were dirty some had whole boots some half boots and two or three had none in the gutters more children were at play their shrill tongues and febrile movements gave hilary the feeling that their caste exacted of them a profession of this faith today we live tomorrowif there be onewill be like today  he had unconsciously chosen the very centre of the street to walk in and miranda who had never in her life demeaned herself to this extent ran at his heels turning up her eyes as though to say one thing i make a point ofno dog must speak to me  fortunately there were no dogs but there were many cats and these cats were thin  through the upper windows of the houses hilary had glimpses of women in poor habiliments doing various kinds of work but stopping now and then to gaze into the street he walked to the end where a wall stopped him and still in the centre of the road he walked the whole length back the children stared at his tall figure with indifference they evidently felt that he was not of those who like themselves had no tomorrow  no 1 hound street abutting on the garden of a house of better class was distinctly the show building of the street the door however was not closed and pulling the remnant of a bell hilary walked in  the first thing that he noticed was a smell it was not precisely bad but it might have been better it was a smell of walls and washing varied rather vaguely by red herrings the second thing he noticed was his moonlight bulldog who stood on the doorstep eyeing a tiny sandy cat this very little cat whose back was arched with fury he was obliged to chase away before his bulldog would come in the third thing he noticed was a lame woman of short stature standing in the doorway of a room her face with big cheekbones and wideopen light grey darklashed eyes was broad and patient she rested her lame leg by holding to the handle of the door  i dunno if youll find anyone upstairs id go and ask but my legs lame  so i see said hilary im sorry  the woman sighed been like that these five years and turned back into her room  is there nothing to be done for it  well i did think so once replied the woman but they say the bones diseased i neglected it at the start  oh dear  we hadnt the time to give to it the woman said defensively retiring into a room so full of china cups photographs coloured prints waxwork fruits and other ornaments that there seemed no room for the enormous bed  wishing her goodmorning hilary began to mount the stairs on the first floor he paused here in the back room the little model lived  he looked around him the paper on the passage walls was of a dingy orange colour the blind of the window torn and still pursuing him pervading everything was the scent of walls and washing and red herrings there came on him a sickness a sort of spiritual revolt to live here to pass up these stairs between these dingy bilious walls on this dirty carpet with thisugh every day twice four times six times who knew how many times a day and that sense the first to be attracted or revolted the first to become fastidious with the culture of the body the last to be expelled from the temple of the purespirit that sense to whose refinement all breeding and all education is devoted that sense which ever an inch at least in front of man is able to retard the development of nations and paralyse all social schemesthis sense of smell awakened within him the centuries of his gentility the ghosts of all those dallisons who for three hundred years and more had served church or state it revived the souls of scents he was accustomed to and with them subtly mingled the whole live fabric of aestheticism woven in fresh air and laid in lavender it roused the simple nonextravagant demand of perfect cleanliness and though he knew that chemists would have certified the composition of his blood to be the same as that of the dwellers in this house and that this smell composed of walls and washing and red herrings was really rather healthy he stood frowning fixedly at the girls door and the memory of his young nieces delicately wrinkled nose as she described the house rose before him he went on upstairs followed by his moonlight bulldog  hilarys tall thin figure appearing in the open doorway of the topfloor front his kind and worried face and the pale agate eyes of the little bulldog peeping through his legs were witnessed by nothing but a baby who was sitting in a wooden box in the centre of the room this baby who was very like a piece of putty to which nature had by some accident fitted two movable black eyes was clothed in a womans knitted undervest spreading beyond his feet and hands so that nothing but his head was visible this vest divided him from the wooden shavings on which he sat and since he had not yet attained the art of rising to his feet the box divided him from contacts of all other kinds as completely isolated from his kingdom as a czar of all the russias he was doing nothing in this realm there was a dingy bed two chairs and a washstand with one lame leg supported by an aged footstool clothes and garments were hanging on nails pans lay about the hearth a sewingmachine stood on a bare deal table over the bed was hung an oleograph from a christmas supplement of the birth of jesus and above it a bayonet under which was printed in an illiterate hand on a rough scroll of paper gave three of em what for at elandslaagte s hughs some photographs adorned the walls and two drooping ferns stood on the windowledge the room withal had a sort of desperate tidiness in a large cupboard slightly open could be seen stowed all that must not see the light of day the window of the babys kingdom was tightly closed the scent was the scent of walls and washing and red herrings andof other things  hilary looked at the baby and the baby looked at him the eyes of that tiny scrap of grey humanity seemed saying  you are not my mother i believe  he stooped down and touched its cheek the baby blinked its black eyes once  no it seemed to say again you are not my mother  a lump rose in hilarys throat he turned and went downstairs pausing outside the little models door he knocked and receiving no answer turned the handle the little square room was empty it was neat and clean enough with a pinkflowered paper of comparatively modern date through its open window could be seen a peartree in full bloom hilary shut the door again with care ashamed of having opened it  on the halflanding staring up at him with black eyes like the babys was a man of medium height and active build whose short face with broad cheekbones cropped dark hair straight nose and little black moustache was burnt a dark dun colour he was dressed in the uniform of those who sweep the streetsa loose blue blouse and trousers tucked into boots reaching halfway up his calves he held a peaked cap in his hand  after some seconds of mutual admiration hilary said  mr hughs i believe yes  ive been up to see your wife  have you  you know me i suppose  yes i know you  unfortunately theres only your baby at home  hughs motioned with his cap towards the little models room i thought perhaps youd been to see her he said his black eyes smouldered there was more than class resentment in the expression of his face  flushing slightly and giving him a keen look hilary passed down the stairs without replying but miranda had not followed she stood with one paw delicately held up above the topmost step  i dont know this man she seemed to say and i dont like his looks  hughs grinned i never hurt a dumb animal he said come on tykie  stimulated by a word she had never thought to hear miranda descended rapidly  he meant that for impudence thought hilary as he walked away  westminister sir oh dear  a skinny trembling hand was offering him a greenish newspaper  terrible cold wind for the time o year  a very aged man in blackrimmed spectacles with a distended nose and long upper lip and chin was tentatively fumbling out change for sixpence  i seem to know your face said hilary  oh dear yes you deals with this ere shopthe tobacco department ive often seen you when youve abeen agoin in sometimes you has the pell mell off o this man here he jerked his head a trifle to the left where a younger

fellow sellin it takin away my profits  i sells this ere westminister i reads it on sundaysits a gentlemans paper ighclass papernotwithstandin of its politics but lor sir with this ere man asellin the

visited you is her father  is he oh dear the old butler was silent evidently puzzled  hilarys eyebrows began to execute those intricate manoeuvres which always indicated that he was about to tax his delicacy  howhow does hughs treat the little girl who lives in the next room to you  the old butler replied in a rather gloomy tone  she takes my advice and dont ave nothin to say to im dreadful foreignlookin man e is wherever e was brought up i cant think  a soldier wasnt he  so he says hes one o these that works for the vestry an then ell go an get upon the drink an when that sets im off it

to put a paper on the walls and the big ground landlordsyou cant expect them to know whats happenin behind their backs theres some ignorant fellers like this hughs talks a lot o wild nonsense about the duty o ground landlords but you cant expect the real gentry to look into these sort o things theyve got their estates down in the country ive lived with them and of course i know  the little bulldog incommoded by the passersby now took the opportunity of beating with her tail against the old butlers legs  oh dear whats this he dont bite do e good sambo  miranda sought her masters eye at once you see what happens to her if a lady loiters in the streets she seemed to say  it must be hard standing about here all day after the life youve led said hilary  i mustnt complain its been the salvation o me  do you get shelter  again the old butler seemed to take him into confidence  sometimes of a wet night they lets me stand up in the archway there they know im respectable t wouldnt never do for that manhe nodded at his rivalor any of them boys to get standin there obstructin of the traffic  i wanted to ask you mr creed is there anything to be done for mrs hughs  the frail old body quivered with the vindictive force of his answer  accordin to what she says if im ato believe er id have him up before the magistrate sure as my names creed an get a separation an i wouldnt never live with im again thats what she ought to do an if he come to go for her after that id have im in prison if e killed me first ive no patience with a low class o man like that he insulted of me this morning  prisons a dreadful remedy murmured hilary  the old butler answered stoutly there aint but one way o treatin them low fellersketch hold o them until they holler  hilary was about to reply when he found himself alone at the edge of the pavement some yards away creed his face upraised to heaven was embracing with all his force the second edition of the westminster gazette which had been thrown him from a cart  well thought hilary walking on you know your own mind anyway  and trotting by his side with her jaw set very firm his little bulldog looked up above her eyes and seemed to say it was time we left that man of action     chapter vii  cecilias scattered thoughts  in her morning room mrs stephen dallison sat at an old oak bureau collecting her scattered thoughts they lay about on pieces of stamped notepaper beginning dear cecilia or mrs tallents smallpeace requests or on bits of pasteboard headed by the names of theatres galleries or concerthalls or again on paper of not quite so good a quality commencing dear friend and ending with a single wellknown name like wessex so that no suspicion should attach to the appeal contained between the two she had before her also sheets of her own writingpaper headed 76 the old square kensington and two little books one of these was bound in marbleised paper and on it written please keep this book in safety across the other cased in the skin of some small animal deceased was inscribed the solitary word engagements  cecilia had on a persiangreen silk blouse with sleeves that would have hidden her slim hands but for silver buttons made in the likeness of little roses at her wrists on her brow was a faint frown as though she were wondering what her thoughts were all about she sat there every morning catching those thoughts and placing them in one or other of her little books only by thus working hard could she keep herself her husband and daughter in due touch with all the different movements going on and that the touch might be as due as possible she had a little headache nearly every day for the dread of letting slip one movement or of being too much taken with another was very real to her there were so many people who were interesting so many sympathies of hers and stephens which she desired to cultivate that it was a matter of the utmost import not to cultivate any single one too much then too the duty of remaining feminine with all this going forward taxed her constitution she sometimes thought enviously of the splendid isolation now enjoyed by blanca of which some subtle instinct rather than definite knowledge had informed her but not often for she was a loyal little person to whom stephen and his comforts were of the first moment and though she worried somewhat because her thoughts would come by every post she did not worry very muchhardly more than the persian kitten on her lap who also sat for hours trying to catch her tail with a line between her eyes and two small hollows in her cheeks  when she had at last decided what concerts she would be obliged to miss paid her subscription to the league for the suppression of tinned milk and accepted an invitation to watch a man fall from a balloon she paused then dipping her pen in ink she wrote as follows  mrs stephen dallison would be glad to have the blue dress ordered by her yesterday sent home at once without alterationmessrs rose and thorn high street kensington  ringing the bell she thought it will be a job for mrs hughs poor thing i believe shell do it quite as well as rose and thornwould you please ask mrs hughs to come to meoh is that you mrs hughs come in  the seamstress who had advanced into the middle of the room stood with her worn hands against her sides and no sign of life but the liquid patience in her large brown eyes she was an enigmatic figure her presence always roused a sort of irritation in cecilia as if she had been suddenly confronted with what might possibly have been herself if certain little accidents had omitted to occur she was so conscious that she ought to sympathise so anxious to show that there was no barrier between them so eager to be all she ought to be that her voice almost purred  are you getting on with the curtains mrs hughs  yes mm thank you mm  i shall have another job for you tomorrowaltering a dress can you come  yes mm thank you mm  is the baby well  yes mm thank you mm  there was a silence  its no good talking of her domestic matters thought cecilia not that i dont care but the silence getting on her nerves she said quickly is your husband behaving himself better  there was no answer cecilia saw a tear trickle slowly down the womans cheek  oh dear oh dear she thought poor thing im in for it  mrs hughs whispering voice began hes behaving himself dreadful mm i was going to speak to you its ever since that young girlher face hardenedcome to live down in my room there he seem tohe seem tojust do nothing but neglect me  cecilias heart gave the little pleasurable flutter which the heart must feel at the love dramas of other people however painful  you mean the little model she said  the seamstress answered in an agitated voice i dont want to speak against her but shes put a spell on him thats what she has he dont seem able to do nothing but talk of her and hang about her room it was that troubling me when i saw you the other day and ever since yesterday midday when mr hilary camehes been talking that wildand he pushed meandand her lips ceased to form articulate words but since it was not etiquette to cry before her superiors she used them to swallow down her tears and something in her lean throat moved up and down  at the mention of hilarys name the pleasurable sensation in cecilia had undergone a change she felt curiosity fear offence  i dont quite understand you she said  the seamstress plaited at her frock of course i cant help the way he talks mm im sure i dont like to repeat the wicked things he says about mr hilary it seems as if he were out of his mind when he gets talkin about that young girl  the tone of those last three words was almost fierce  cecilia was on the point of saying that will do please i want to hear no more but her curiosity and queer subtle fear forced her instead to repeat i dont understand do you mean he insinuates that mr hilary has anything to do withwith this girl or what and she thought ill stop that at any rate  the seamstresss face was distorted by her efforts to control her voice  i tell him hes wicked to say such things mm and mr hilary such a kind gentleman and what business is it of his i say thats got a wife and children of his own ive seen him in the street ive watched him hanging about mrs hilarys house when ive been working there waiting for that girl and following herhome again her lips refused to do service except in the swallowing of her tears  cecilia thought i must tell stephen at once that man is dangerous a spasm gripped her heart usually so warm and snug vague feelings she had already entertained presented themselves now with startling force she seemed to see the face of sordid life staring at the family of dallison mrs hughs voice which did not dare to break resumed  ive said to him whatever are you thinking of and after mrs hilarys been so kind to me but hes like a madman when hes in liquor and he says hell go to mrs hilary  go to my sister what about the ruffian  at hearing her husband called a ruffian by another woman the shadow of resentment passed across mrs hughs face leaving it quivering and red the conversation had already made a strange difference in the manner of these two women to each other it was as though each now knew exactly how much sympathy and confidence could be expected of the other as though life had suddenly sucked up the mist and shown them standing one on either side of a deep trench in mrs hughs eyes there was the look of those who have long discovered that they must not answer back for fear of losing what little ground they have to stand on and cecilias eyes were cold and watchful i sympathise they seemed to say i sympathise but you must please understand that you cannot expect sympathy if your affairs compromise the members of my family her chief thought now was to be relieved of the company of this woman who had been betrayed into showing what lay beneath her dumb stubborn patience it was not callousness but the natural result of being fluttered her heart was like a bird agitated in its giltwire cage by the contemplation of a distant cat she did not however lose her sense of what was practical but said calmly your husband was wounded in south africa you told me it looks as if he wasnt quite i think you should have a doctor  the seamstresss answer slow and matteroffact was worse than her emotion  no mm he isnt mad  crossing to the hearthwhose persianblue tiling had taken her so long to findcecilia stood beneath a reproduction of botticellis primavera and looked doubtfully at mrs hughs the persian kitten sleepy and disturbed on the bosom of her blouse gazed up into her face consider me it seemed to say i am worth consideration i am of a piece with you and everything round you we are both elegant and rather slender we both love warmth and kittens we both dislike interference with our fur you took a long time to buy me so as to get me perfect you see that woman over there i sat on her lap this morning while she was sewing your curtains she has no right in here shes not what she seems she can bite and scratch i know her lap is skinny she drops water from her eyes she made me wet all down my back be careful what youre doing or shell make you wet down yours  all that was like the little persian kitten within ceciliacosiness and love of pretty things attachment to her own abode with its highart lining love for her mate and her own kitten thyme dread of disturbanceall made her long to push this woman from the room this woman with the skimpy figure and eyes that for all their patience had in them something viragolike this woman who carried about with her an atmosphere of sordid grief of squalid menaces and scandal she longed all the more because it could well be seen from the seamstresss helpless attitude that she too would have liked an easy life to dwell on things like this was to feel more than thirtyeight  cecilia had no pocket providence having removed it now for some time past but from her little bag she drew forth the two essentials of gentility taking her nose which she feared was shining gently within one she fumbled in the other and again she looked doubtfully at mrs hughs her heart said give the poor woman half a sovereign it might comfort her but her brain said i owe her fourandsix after what shes just been saying about her husband and that girl and hilary it maynt be safe to give her more she held out two halfcrowns and had an inspiration i shall mention to my sister what youve said you can tell your husband that  no sooner had she said this however than she saw from a little smile devoid of merriment and quickly extinguished that mrs hughs did not believe she would do anything of the kind from which she concluded that the seamstress was convinced of hilarys interest in the little model she said hastily  you can go now mrs hughs  mrs hughs went making no noise or sign of any sort  cecilia returned to her scattered thoughts they lay there still with a gleam of sun from the low window smearing their importance she felt somehow that it did not now matter very much whether she and stephen in the interests of science saw that man fall from his balloon or in the interests of art heard herr von kraaffe sing his polish songs she experienced too almost a revulsion in favour of tinned milk after meditatively tearing up her note to messrs rose and thorn she lowered the bureau lid and left the room  mounting the stairs whose old oak banisters on either side were a real joy she felt she was stupid to let vague sordid rumours which after all affected her but indirectly disturb her mornings work and entering stephens dressingroom she stood looking at his boots  inside each one of them was a wooden soul none had any creases none had any holes the moment they wore out their wooden souls were taken from them and their bodies given to the poor whilstin accordance with that theory to hear a course of lectures on which a scattered thought was even now inviting herthe wooden souls migrated instantly to other leathern bodies  looking at that polished row of boots cecilia felt lonely and unsatisfied stephen worked in the law courts thyme worked at art both were doing something definite she alone it seemed had to wait at home and order dinner answer letters shop pay calls and do a dozen things that failed to stop her thoughts from dwelling on that womans tale she was not often conscious of the nature of her life so like the lives of many hundred women in this london which she said she could not stand but which she stood very well as a rule with practical good sense she kept her doubting eyes fixed friendlily on every little phase in turn enjoying well enough fitting the chinese puzzle of her scattered thoughts setting out on each small adventure with a certain cautious zest and taking stephen with her as far as he allowed this last year or so now that thyme was a grown girl she had felt at once a loss of purpose and a gain of liberty she hardly knew whether to be glad or sorry it freed her for the tasting of more things more people and more stephen but it left a little void in her heart a little soreness round it what would thyme think if she heard this story about her uncle the thought started a whole train of doubts that had of late beset her was her little daughter going to turn out like herself if not why not stephen joked about his daughters skirts her hockey her friendship with young men he joked about the way thyme refused to let him joke about her art or about her interest in the people his joking was a source of irritation to cecilia for by womans instinct rather than by any reasoning process she was conscious of a disconcerting change amongst the people she knew young men were not now attracted by girls as they had been in her young days there was a kind of cool and friendly matteroffactness in the way they treated them a sort of almost scientific playfulness and cecilia felt uneasy as to how far this was to go she seemed left behind if young people were really becoming serious if youths no longer cared about the colour of thymes eyes or dress or hair what would there be left to care forthat is up to the point of definite relationship not that she wanted her daughter to be married it would be time enough to think of that when she was twentyfive but her own experiences had been so different she had spent so many youthful hours in wondering about men had seen so many men cast furtive looks at her and now there did not seem in men or girls anything left worth the others while to wonder or look furtive about she was not of a philosophic turn of mind and had attached no deep meaning to stephens jestif young people will reveal their ankles theyll soon have no ankles to reveal  to cecilia the extinction of the race seemed threatened in reality her species of the race alone was vanishing which to her of course was very much the same disaster with her eyes on stephens boots she thought how shall i prevent what ive heard from coming to biancas ears i know how she would take it how shall i prevent thymes hearing im sure i dont know what the effect would be on her i must speak to stephen hes so fond of hilary  and turning away from stephens boots she mused of course its nonsense hilarys much tootoo nice too fastidious to be more than just interested but hes so kind he might easily put himself in a false position andits ugly nonsense b can be so disagreeable even now shes noton terms with him and suddenly the thought of mr purcey leaped into her mindmr purcey who as mrs tallents smallpeace had declared was not even conscious that there was a problem of the poor to think of him seemed somehow at that moment comforting like rolling oneself in a blanket against a draught passing into her room she opened her wardrobe door  bother the woman she thought i do want that gentian dress got ready but now i simply cant give it to her to do     chapter viii  the single mind of mr stone  since in the flutter of her spirit caused by the words of mrs hughs cecilia felt she must do something she decided to change her dress  the furniture of the pretty room she shared with stephen had not been hastily assembled conscious even fifteen years ago when they moved into this house of the grave philistinism of the upper classes she and stephen had ever kept their duty to aestheticism green and in the matter of their bed had lain for two years on two little white affairs comfortable but purely temporary that they might give themselves a chance the chance had come at lasta bed in real keeping with the period they had settled on and going for twelve pounds they had not let it go and now slept in itnot quite so comfortable perhaps but comfortable enough and conscious of duty done  for fifteen years cecilia had been furnishing her house the process approached completion the only things remaining on her mindapart that is from thymes development and the condition of the peoplewere item a copper lantern that would allow some light to pass its framework item an old oak washstand not going back to cromwells time and now this third anxiety had come  she was rather touching as she stood before the wardrobe glass divested of her bodice with dimples of exertion in her thin white arms while she hooked her skirt behind and her greenish eyes troubled so anxious to do their best for everyone and save risk of any sort having put on a bramblecoloured frock which laced across her breast with silver latticework and a hat without feathers so as to encourage birds fastened to her head with pins bought to aid a novel school of metalwork she went to see what sort of day it was  the window looked out at the back over some dreary streets where the wind was flinging light drifts of smoke athwart the sunlight they had chosen this room not indeed for its view over the condition of the people but because of the sky effects at sunset which were extremely fine for the first time perhaps cecilia was conscious that a sample of the class she was so interested in was exposed to view beneath her nose the hughs live somewhere there she thought after all i think b ought to know about that man she might speak to father and get him to give up having the girl to copy for himthe whole things so worrying  in pursuance of this thought she lunched hastily and went out making her way to hilarys with every step she became more uncertain the fear of meddling too much of not meddling enough of seeming meddlesome timidity at touching anything so awkward distrust even ignorance of her sisters character which was like yet so very unlike her own a real itch to get the matter settled so that nothing whatever should come of itall this she felt she hurried dawdled finished the adventure almost at a run then told the servant not to announce her the vision of biancas eyes while she listened to this tale was suddenly too much for cecilia she decided to pay a visit to her father first  mr stone was writing attired in his working dressa thick brown woollen gown revealing his thin neck above the line of a blue shirt and tightly gathered round the waist with tasselled cord the lower portions of grey trousers were visible above woollenslippered feet his hair straggled over his thin long ears the window wide open admitted an east wind there was no fire cecilia shivered  come in quickly said mr stone turning to a big high desk of stained deal which occupied the middle of one wall he began methodically to place the inkstand a heavy paperknife a book and stones of several sizes on his guttering sheets of manuscript  cecilia looked about her she had not been inside her fathers room for several months there was nothing in it but that desk a camp bed in the far corner with blankets but no sheets a folding washstand and a narrow bookcase the books in which cecilia unconsciously told off on the fingers of her memory they never varied on the top shelf the bible and the works of plautus and diderot on the second from the top the plays of shakespeare in a blue edition on the third from the bottom don quixote in four volumes covered with brown paper a green milton the comedies of aristophanes a leather book partially burned comparing the philosophy of epicurus with the philosophy of spinoza and in a yellow binding mark twains huckleberry finn on the second from the bottom was lighter literature the iliad a life of francis of assisi spekes discovery of the sources of the nile the pickwick papers mr midshipman easy the verses of theocritus in a very old translation renans life of christ and the autobiography of benvenuto cellini the bottom shelf of all was full of books on natural science  the walls were whitewashed and as cecilia knew came off on anybody who leaned against them the floor was stained and had no carpet there was a little gas cookingstove with cooking things ranged on it a small bare table and one large cupboard no draperies no pictures no ornaments of any kind but by the window an ancient golden leather chair cecilia could never bear to sit in that oasis its colour in this wilderness was too precious to her spirit  its an east wind father arent you terribly cold without a fire  mr stone came from his writingdesk and stood so that light might fall on a sheet of paper in his hand cecilia noted the scent that went about with him of peat and baked potatoes he spoke  listen to this in the condition of society dignified in those days with the name of civilisation the only source of hope was the persistence of the quality called courage amongst a thousand nervedestroying habits amongst the dramshops patent medicines the undigested chaos of inventions and discoveries while hundreds were prating in their pulpits of things believed in by a negligible fraction of the population and thousands writing down today what nobody would want to read in two days time while men shut animals in cages and made bears jig to please their children and all were striving one against the other while in a word like gnats above a stagnant pool on a summers evening man danced up and down without the faintest notion whyin this condition of affairs the quality of courage was alive it was the only fire within that gloomy valley he stopped though evidently anxious to go on because he had read the last word on that sheet of paper he moved towards the writingdesk cecilia said hastily  do you mind if i shut the window father  mr stone made a movement of his head and cecilia saw that he held a second sheet of paper in his hand she rose and going towards him said  i want to talk to you dad taking up the cord of his dressinggown she pulled it by its tassel  dont said mr stone it secures my trousers  cecilia dropped the cord father is really terrible she thought  mr stone lifting the second sheet of paper began again  the reason however was not far to seek  cecilia said desperately  its about that girl who comes to copy for you  mr stone lowered the sheet of paper and stood slightly curved from head to foot his ears moved as though he were about to lay them back his blue eyes with little white spots of light alongside the tiny black pupils stared at his daughter  cecilia thought hes listening now  she made haste must you have her here cant you do without her  without whom said mr stone  without the girl who comes to copy for you  why  for this very good reason  mr stone dropped his eyes and cecilia saw that he had moved the sheet of paper up as far as his waist  does she copy better than any other girl could she asked hastily  no said mr stone  then father i do wish to please me youd get someone else i know what im talking about and i cecilia stopped her fathers lips and eyes were moving he was obviously reading to himself  ive no patience with him she thought he thinks of nothing but his wretched book  aware of his daughters silence mr stone let the sheet of paper sink and waited patiently again  what do you want my dear he said  oh father do listen just a minute  yes yes  its about that girl who comes to copy for you is there any reason why she should come instead of any other girl  yes said mr stone  what reason  because she has no friends  so awkward a reply was not expected by cecilia she looked at the floor forced to search within her soul silence lasted several seconds then mr stones voice rose above a whisper  the reason was not far to seek man differentiated from the other apes by his desire to know was from the first obliged to steel himself against the penalties of knowledge like animals subjected to the rigours of an arctic climate and putting forth more fur with each reduction in the temperature mans hide of courage thickened automatically to resist the spearthrusts dealt him by his own insatiate curiosity in those days of which we speak when undigested knowledge in a great invading horde had swarmed all his defences man suffering from a foul dyspepsia with a nervous system in the latest stages of exhaustion and a reeling brain survived by reason of his power to go on making courage little heroic as in the then general state of petty competition his deeds appeared to be there never had yet been a time when man in bulk was more courageous for there never had yet been a time when he had more need to be signs were not wanting that this desperate state of things had caught the eyes of the community a little sect mr stone stopped his eyes had again tumbled over the bottom edge he moved hurriedly towards the desk just as his hand removed a stone and took up a third sheet cecilia cried out  father  mr stone stopped and turned towards her his daughter saw that he had gone quite pink her annoyance vanished  father about that girl  mr stone seemed to reflect yes yes he said  i dont think bianca likes her coming here  mr stone passed his hand across his brow  forgive me for reading to you my dear he said its a great relief to me at times  cecilia went close to him and refrained with difficulty from taking up the tasselled cord  of course dear she said i quite understand that  mr stone looked full in her face and before a gaze which seemed to go through her and see things the other side cecilia dropped her eyes  it is strange he said how you came to be my daughter  to cecilia too this had often seemed a problem  there is a great deal in atavism said mr stone that we know nothing of at present  cecilia cried with heat i do wish you would attend a minute father its really an important matter and she turned towards the window tears being very near her eyes  the voice of mr stone said humbly i will try my dear  but cecilia thought i must give him a good lesson he really is too selfabsorbed and she did not move conveying by the posture of her shoulders how gravely she was vexed  she could see nursemaids wheeling babies towards the gardens and noted their faces gazing not at the babies but uppishly at other nursemaids or with a sort of cautious longing at men who passed how selfish they looked she felt a little glow of satisfaction that she was making this thin and bent old man behind her conscious of his egoism  he will know better another time she thought suddenly she heard a whistling squeaking soundit was mr stone whispering the third page of his manuscript  animated by some admirable sentiments but whose doctrinesriddled by the fact that life is but the change of form to formwere too constricted for the evils they designed to remedy this little sect who had as yet to learn the meaning of universal love were making the most strenuous efforts in advance of the community at large to understand themselves the necessary movement which they voicedreaction against the hightide of the fratricidal system then prevailingwas young and had the freshness and honesty of youth  without a word cecilia turned round and hurried to the door she saw her father drop the sheet of paper she saw his face all pink and silver stooping after it and remorse visited her anger  in the corridor outside she was arrested by a noise the uncertain light of london halls fell there on close inspection the sufferer was seen to be miranda who unable to decide whether she wanted to be in the garden or the house was seated beneath the hatrack snuffling to herself on seeing cecilia she came out  what do you want you little beast  peering at her over the tops of her eyes miranda vaguely lifted a white foot why ask me that she seemed to say how am i to know are we not all like this  her conduct coming at that moment overtried cecilias nerves she threw open hilarys studydoor saying sharply go in and find your master  miranda did not move but hilary came out instead he had been correcting proofs to catch the post and wore the look of a man abstracted faintly contemptuous of other forms of life  cecilia once more saved from the necessity of approaching her sister the mistress of the house so fugitive haunting and unseen yet so much the centre of this situation said  can i speak to you a minute hilary  they went into his study and miranda came creeping in behind  to cecilia her brotherinlaw always seemed an amiable and more or less pathetic figure in his literary preoccupations he allowed people to impose on him he looked unsubstantial beside the bust of socrates which moved cecilia strangelyit was so very massive and so very ugly she decided not to beat about the bush  ive been hearing some odd things from mrs hughs about that little model hilary  hilarys smile faded from his eyes but remained clinging to his lips  indeed  cecilia went on nervously mrs hughs says its because of her that hughs behaves so badly i dont want to say anything against the girl but she seemsshe seems to have  yes said hilary  to have cast a spell on hughs as the woman puts it  on hughs repeated hilary  cecilia found her eyes resting on the bust of socrates and hastily proceeded  she says he follows her about and comes down here to lie in wait for her its a most strange business altogether you went to see them didnt you  hilary nodded  ive been speaking to father cecilia murmured but hes hopelessi couldnt get him to pay the least attention  hilary seemed thinking deeply  i wanted him she went on to get some other girl instead to come and copy for him  why  under the seeming impossibility of ever getting any farther without saying what she had come to say cecilia blurted out  mrs hughs says that hughs has threatened you  hilarys face became ironical  really he said thats good of him what for  the frightful indelicacy of her situation at this moment the feeling of unfairness that she should be placed in it almost overwhelmed cecilia goodness knows i dont want to meddle i never meddle in anythingits horrible  hilary took her hand  my dear cis he said of course but wed better have this out  grateful for the pressure of his hand she gave it a convulsive squeeze  its so sordid hilary  sordid hm lets get it over then  cecilia had grown crimson do you want me to tell you everything  certainly  well hughs evidently thinks youre interested in the girl you cant keep anything from servants and people who work about your house they always think the worst of everythingand of course they know that you and b dontarent  hilary nodded  mrs hughs actually said the man meant to go to b  again the vision of her sister seemed to float into the room and she went on desperately and hilary i can see mrs hughs really thinks you are interested of course she wants to for if you were it would mean that a man like her husband could have no chance  astonished at this flash of cynical inspiration and ashamed of such plain speaking she checked herself hilary had turned away  cecilia touched his arm hilary dear she said isnt there any chance of you and b  hilarys lips twitched i should say not  cecilia looked sadly at the floor not since stephen was bad with pleurisy had she felt so worried the sight of hilarys face brought back her doubts with all their force it might of course be only anger at the mans impudence but it might beshe hardly liked to frame her thoughta more personal feeling  dont you think she said that anyway she had better not come here again  hilary paced the room  its her only safe and certain piece of work it keeps her independent its much more satisfactory than this sitting i cant have any hand in taking it away from her  cecilia had never seen him moved like this was it possible that he was not incorrigibly gentle but had in him some of that animality which she in a sense admired this uncertainty terribly increased the difficulties of the situation  but hilary she said at last are you satisfied about the girli mean are you satisfied that she really is worth helping  i dont understand  i mean murmured cecilia that we dont know anything about her past and seeing from the movement of his eyebrows that she was touching on what had evidently been a doubt with him she went on with great courage where are her friends and relations i mean she may have had aadventures  hilary withdrew into himself  you can hardly expect me he said to go into that with her  his reply made cecilia feel ridiculous  well she said in a hard little voice if this is what comes of helping the poor i dont see the use of it  the outburst evoked no reply from hilary she felt more tremulous than ever the whole thing was so confused so unnatural what with the dark malignant hughs and that haunting vision of bianca the matter seemed almost italian that a man of hughs class might be affected by the passion of love had somehow never come into her head she thought of the back streets she had looked out on from her bedroom window could anything like passion spring up in those dismal alleys the people who lived there poor downtrodden things had enough to do to keep themselves alive she knew all about them they were in the air their condition was deplorable could a person whose condition was deplorable find time or strength for any sort of lurid exhibition such as this it was incredible  she became aware that hilary was speaking  i daresay the man is dangerous  hearing her fears confirmed and in accordance with the secret vein of hardness which kept her living amid all her sympathies and hesitations cecilia felt suddenly that she had gone as far as it was in her to go  i shall have no more to do with them she said ive tried my best for mrs hughs i know quite as good a needlewoman wholl be only too glad to come instead any other girl will do as well to copy fathers book if you take my advice hilary youll give up trying to help them too  hilarys smile puzzled and annoyed her if she had known this was the smile that stood between him and her sister  you may be right he said and shrugged his shoulders  very well said cecilia ive done all i can i must go now goodbye  during her progress to the door she gave one look behind hilary was standing by the bust of socrates her heart smote her to leave him thus embarrassed but again the vision of biancafugitive in her own house and with something tragic in her mocking immobilitycame to her and she hastened away  a voice said how are you mrs dallison your sister at home  cecilia saw before her mr purcey rising and falling a little with the oscillation of his ai damyer  a sense as of having just left a house visited by sickness or misfortune made cecilia murmur  im afraid shes not  bad luck said mr purcey his face fell as far as so red and square a face could fall i was hoping perhaps i might be allowed to take them for a run shes wanting exercise mr purcey laid his hand on the flank of his palpitating car know these ai damyers mrs dallison best value you can get simply rippin little cars wish youd try her  the ai damyer diffusing an aroma of the finest petrol leaped and trembled as though conscious of her masters praise cecilia looked at her  yes she said shes very sweet  now do said mr purcey let me give you a runjust to please me i mean im sure youll like her  a little compunction a little curiosity a sudden revolt against all the discomfiture and sordid doubts she had been suffering from made cecilia glance softly at mr purceys figure almost before she knew it she was seated in the ai damyer it trembled emitted two small sounds one large scent and glided forward mr purcey said  thats rippin of you  a postman dog and bakers cart all hurrying at top speed seemed to stand still cecilia felt the wind beating her cheeks she gave a little laugh  you must just take me home please  mr purcey touched the chauffeurs elbow  round the park he said let her have it  the ai damyer uttered a tiny shriek cecilia leaning back in her padded corner glanced askance at mr purcey leaning back in his an unholy astonished little smile played on her lips  what am i doing it seemed to say the way he got me herereally and now i am here im just going to enjoy it  there were no hughs no little modelall that sordid life had vanished there was nothing but the wind beating her cheeks and the ai damyer leaping under her  mr purcey said it just makes all the difference to me keeps my nerves in order  oh cecilia murmured have you got nerves  mr purcey smiled when he smiled his cheeks formed two hard red blocks his trim moustache stood out and many little wrinkles ran from his light eyes  chock full of them he said least thing upsets me cant bear to see a hungrylookin child or anything  a strange feeling of admiration for this man had come upon cecilia why could not she and thyme and hilary and stephen and all the people they knew and mixed with be like him so sound and healthy so unravaged by disturbing sympathies so innocent of social conscience so content  as though jealous of these thoughts about her master the ai damyer stopped of her own accord  hallo said mr purcey hallo i say dont you get out shell be all right directly  oh said cecilia thanks but i must go in here anyhow i think ill say goodbye thank you so much i have enjoyed it  from the threshold of a shop she looked back mr purcey on foot was leaning forward from the waist staring at his ai damyer with profound concentration     chapter ix  hilary gives chase  the ethics of a man like hilary were not those of the million pure bred purceys of this life founded on a sense of property in this world and the next nor were they precisely the morals and religion of the aristocracy who though aestheticised in parts quietly used in bulk their fortified position to graft on mr purceys ethics the principle of you be damned in the eyes of the majority he was probably an immoral and irreligious man but in fact his morals and religion were those of his special section of societythe cultivated classes the professors the artistic pigs advanced people and all that sort of cuckoo as mr purcey called thema section of society supplemented by persons placed beyond the realms of want who speculated in ideas  had he been required to make confession of his creed he would probably have framed it in some such way as this i disbelieve in all church dogmas and do not go to church i have no definite ideas about a future state and do not want to have but in a private way i try to identify myself as much as possible with what i see about me feeling that if i could ever really be at one with the world i live in i should be happy i think it foolish not to trust my senses and my reason as for what my senses and my reason will not tell me i assume that all is as it had to be for if one could get to know the why of everything in one would be the universe i do not believe that chastity is a virtue in itself but only so far as it ministers to the health and happiness of the community i do not believe that marriage confers the rights of ownership and i loathe all public wrangling on such matters but i am temperamentally averse to the harming of my neighbours if in reason it can be avoided as to manners i think that to repeat a bit of scandal and circulate backbiting stories are worse offences than the actions that gave rise to them if i mentally condemn a person i feel guilty of moral lapse i hate selfassertion i am ashamed of selfadvertisement i dislike loudness of any kind probably i have too much tendency to negation of all sorts smalltalk bores me to extinction but i will discuss a point of ethics or psychology half the night to make capital out of a persons weakness is repugnant to me i want to be a decent man buti really cant take myself too seriously  though he had preserved his politeness towards cecilia he was in truth angry and grew angrier every minute he was angry with her himself and the man hughs and suffered from this anger as only they can who are not accustomed to the roughandtumble of things  such a retiring man as hilary was seldom given the opportunity for an obvious display of chivalry the tenor of his life removed him from those situations such chivalry as he displayed was of a negative order and confronted suddenly with the conduct of hughs who it seemed knocked his wife about and dogged the footsteps of a helpless girl he took it seriously to heart  when the little model came walking up the garden on her usual visit he fancied her face looked scared quieting the growling of miranda who from the first had stubbornly refused to know this girl he sat down with a book to wait for her to go away after sitting an hour or more turning over pages and knowing little of their sense he saw a man peer over his garden gate he was there for half a minute then lounged across the road and stood hidden by some railings  so thought hilary shall i go out and warn the fellow to clear off or shall i wait to see what happens when she goes away  he determined on the latter course presently she came out walking with her peculiar gait youthful and pretty but too matteroffact and yet as it were too purposeless to be a ladys she looked back at hilarys window and turned uphill  hilary took his hat and stick and waited in half a minute hughs came out from under cover of the railings and followed then hilary too set forth  there is left in every man something of the primeval love of stalking the delicate hilary in cooler blood would have revolted at the notion of dogging peoples footsteps he now experienced the holy pleasures of the chase certain that hughs was really following the girl he had but to keep him in sight and remain unseen this was not hard for a man given to mountainclimbing almost the only sport left to one who thought it immoral to hurt anybody but himself  taking advantage of shopwindows omnibuses passersby and other bits of cover he prosecuted the chase up the steepy heights of campden hill but soon a nearly fatal check occurred for chancing to take his eyes off hughs he saw the little model returning on her tracks ready enough in physical emergencies hilary sprang into a passing omnibus he saw her stopping before the window of a pictureshop from the expression of her face and figure she evidently had no idea that she was being followed but stood with a sort of slacklipped wonder lost in admiration of a wellknown print hilary had often wondered who could possibly admire that picturehe now knew it was obvious that the girls aesthetic sense was deeply touched  while this was passing through his mind he caught sight of hughs lurking outside a publichouse the dark mans face was sullen and dejected and looked as if he suffered hilary felt a sort of pity for him  the omnibus leaped forward and he sat down smartly almost on a ladys lap this was the lap of mrs tallents smallpeace who greeted him with a warm quiet smile and made a little room  your sisterinlaw has just been to see me mr dallison shes such a dearso interested in everything i tried to get her to come on to my meeting with me  raising his hat hilary frowned for once his delicacy was at fault he said  ah yes excuse me and got out  mrs tallents smallpeace looked after him and then glanced round the omnibus his conduct was very like the conduct of a man who had got in to keep an assignation with a lady and found that lady sitting next his aunt she was unable to see a soul who seemed to foster this view and sat thinking that he was rather attractive suddenly her dark busy eyes lighted on the figure of the little model strolling along again  oh she thought ah yes really how very interesting  hilary to avoid meeting the girl pointblank had turned up a bystreet and finding a convenient corner waited he was puzzled if this man were persecuting her with his attentions why had he not gone across when she was standing at the pictureshop  she passed across the opening of the bystreet still walking in the slack way of one who takes the pleasures of the streets she passed from view hilary strained his eyes to see if hughs were following he waited several minutes the man did not appear the chase was over and suddenly it flashed across him that hughs had merely dogged her to see that she had no assignation with anybody they had both been playing the same game he flushed up in that shady little street in which he was the only person to be seen cecilia was right it was a sordid business a man more in touch with facts than hilary would have had some mental pigeonhole into which to put an incident like this but being by profession concerned mainly with ideas and thoughts he did not quite know where he was the habit of his mind precluded him from thinking very definitely on any subject except his literary workprecluded him especially in a matter of this sort so inextricably entwined with that delicate dim question the impact of class on class  pondering deeply he ascended the leafy lane that leads between high railings from notting hill to kensington  it was so far from traffic that every tree on either side was loud with the spring songs of birds the scent of running sap came forth shyly as the sun sank low strange peace strange feeling of old mother earth up there above the town wild tunes and the quiet sight of clouds man in this lane might rest his troubled thoughts and for a while trust the goodness of the scheme that gave him birth the beauty of each day that laughs or broods itself into night some budding lilacs exhaled a scent of lemons a sandy cat on the coping of a garden wall was basking in the setting sun  in the centre of the lane a row of elmtrees displayed their gnarled knotted roots human beings were seated there whose matted hair clung round their tired faces their gaunt limbs were clothed in rags each had a stick and some sort of dirty bundle tied to it they were asleep on a bench beyond two toothless old women sat moving their eyes from side to side and a crimsonfaced woman was snoring under the next tree a cockney youth and his girl were sitting side by sidepale young things with loose mouths and hollow cheeks and restless eyes their arms were enlaced they were silent a little farther on two young men in working clothes were looking straight before them with desperately tired faces they too were silent  on the last bench of all hilary came on the little model seated slackly by herself     chapter x  the trousseau  this the first time these two had each other at large was clearly not a comfortable event for either of them the girl blushed and hastily got off her seat hilary who raised his hat and frowned sat down on it  dont get up he said i want to talk to you  the little model obediently resumed her seat a silence followed she had on the old brown skirt and knitted jersey the old bluegreen tamoshanter cap and there were marks of weariness beneath her eyes  at last hilary remarked how are you getting on  the little model looked at her feet  pretty well thank you mr dallison  i came to see you yesterday  she slid a look at him which might have meant nothing or meant much so perfect its shy stolidity  i was out she said sitting to miss boyle  so you have some work  its finished now  then youre only getting the two shillings a day from mr stone  she nodded  hm  the unexpected fervour of this grunt seemed to animate the little model  three and sixpence for my rent and breakfast costs threepence nearlyonly breadandbutterthats five and two and washings always at least tenpencethats six and little things last week was a shillingeven when i dont take busesseven that leaves five shillings for my dinners mr stone always gives me tea its my clothes worries me she tucked her feet farther beneath the seat and hilary refrained from looking down my hat is awful and i do want some she looked hilary in the face for the first time i do wish i was rich  i dont wonder  the little model gritted her teeth and twisting at her dirty gloves said mr dallison dyou know the first thing id buy if i was rich  no  id buy everything new on me from top to toe and i wouldnt ever wear any of these old things again  hilary got up come with me now and buy everything new from top to toe  oh  hilary had already perceived that he had made an awkward even dangerous proposal short however of giving her money the idea of which offended his sense of delicacy there was no way out of it he said brusquely come along  the little model rose obediently hilary noticed that her boots were split and thisas though he had seen someone strike a childso moved his indignation that he felt no more qualms but rather a sort of pleasant glow such as will come to the most studious man when he levels a blow at the conventions  he looked down at his companionher eyes were lowered he could not tell at all what she was thinking of  this is what i was going to speak to you about he said i dont like that house youre in i think you ought to be somewhere else what do you say  yes mr dallison  youd better make a change i think you could find another room couldnt you  the little model answered as before yes mr dallison  im afraid that hughs isa dangerous sort of fellow  hes a funny man  does he annoy you  her expression baffled hilary there seemed a sort of slow enjoyment in it she looked up knowingly  i dont mind himhe wont hurt me mr dallison do you think blue or green  hilary answered shortly blueygreen  she clasped her hands changed her feet with a hop and went on walking as before  listen to me said hilary has mrs hughs been talking to you about her husband  the little model smiled again  she goes on she said  hilary bit his lips  mr dallison pleaseabout my hat  what about your hat  would you like me to get a large one or a small one  for gods sake answered hilary a small oneno feathers  oh  can you attend to me a minute have either hughs or mrs hughs spoken to you aboutcoming to my house aboutme  the little models face remained impassive but by the movement of her fingers hilary saw that she was attending now  i dont care what they say  hilary looked away an angry flush slowly mounted in his face  with surprising suddenness the little model said  of course if i was a lady i might mind  dont talk like that said hilary every woman is a lady  the stolidity of the girls face more mocking far than any smile warned him of the cheapness of this verbiage  if i was a lady she repeated simply i shouldnt be livin there should i  no said hilary and you had better not go on living there anyway  the little model making no answer hilary did not quite know what to say it was becoming apparent to him that she viewed the situation with a very different outlook from himself and that he did not understand that outlook  he felt thoroughly at sea conscious that this girls life contained a thousand things he did not know a thousand points of view he did not share  their two figures attracted some attention in the crowded street for hilarytall and slight with his thin bearded face and soft felt hatwas what is known as a distinguishedlooking man and the little model though not distinguishedlooking in her old brown skirt and tamoshanter cap had the sort of face which made men and even women turn to look at her to men she was a little bit of strangely interesting not too usual flesh and blood to women she was that which made men turn to look at her yet now and again there would rise in some passerby a feeling more impersonal as though the god of pity had shaken wings overhead and dropped a tiny feather  so walking and exciting vague interest they reached the first of the hundred doors of messrs rose and thorn  hilary had determined on this end door for as the adventure grew warmer he was more alive to its dangers to take this child into the very shop frequented by his wife and friends seemed a little mad but that same reason which caused them to frequent itthe fact that there was no other shop of the sort half so handywas the reason which caused hilary to go there now he had acted on impulse he knew that if he let his impulse cool he would not act at all the bold course was the wise one this was why he chose the end door round the corner standing aside for her to go in first he noticed the girls brightened eyes and cheeks she had never looked so pretty he glanced hastily round the department was barren for their purposes filled entirely with pyjamas he felt a touch on his arm the little model rather pink was looking up at him  mr dallison am i to get more than one set ofunderthings  threethree muttered hilary and suddenly he saw that they were on the threshold of that sanctuary buy them he said and bring me the bill  he waited close beside a man with a pink face a moustache and an almost perfect figure who was standing very still dressed from head to foot in blueandwhite stripes he seemed the apotheosis of what a man should be his face composed in a deathless simper long long have been the struggles of man but civilization has produced me at last further than this it cannot go nothing shall make me continue my line in me the end is reached see my back the amateur this perfect style 8s 11d great reduction  he would not talk to hilary and the latter was compelled to watch the shopmen it was but half an hour to closing time the youths were moving languidly bickering a little in the absence of their customerslike flies on a pane unable to get out into the sun two of them came and asked him what they might serve him with they were so refined and pleasant that hilary was on the point of buying what he did not want the reappearance of the little model saved him  its thirty shillings five and eleven was the cheapest and stockings and i bought some sta  hilary produced the money hastily  this is a very dear shop she said  when she had paid the bill and hilary had taken from her a large brownpaper parcel they journeyed on together he had armoured his face now in a slightly startled quizzicality as though himself detached he were watching the adventure from a distance  on the central velvet seat of the boot and shoe department a lady with an egret in her hat was stretching out a slim silkstockinged foot waiting for a boot she looked with negligent amusement at this common little girl and her singular companion this look of hers seemed to affect the women serving for none came near the little model hilary saw them eyeing her boots and suddenly forgetting his role of lookeron he became very angry taking out his watch he went up to the eldest woman  if somebody he said does not attend this young lady within a minute i shall make a personal complaint to mr thorn  the hand of the watch however had not completed its round before a woman was at the little models side hilary saw her taking off her boot and by a sudden impulse he placed himself between her and the lady in doing this he so far forgot his delicacy as to fix his eyes on the little models foot the sense of physical discomfort which first attacked him became a sort of aching in his heart that brown dingy stocking was darned till no stocking only darning and one toe and two little white bits of foot were seen where the threads refused to hold together any longer  the little model wagged the toe uneasilyshe had hoped no doubt that it would not protrude then concealed it with her skirt hilary moved hastily away when he looked again it was not at her but at the lady  her face had changed it was no longer amused and negligent but stamped with an expression of offence intolerable it seemed to say to bring a girl like that into a shop like this i shall never come here again the expression was but the outward sign of that inner physical discomfort hilary himself had felt when he first saw the little models stocking this naturally did not serve to lessen his anger especially as he saw her animus mechanically reproduced on the faces of the serving women  he went back to the little model and sat down by her side  does it fit youd better walk in it and see  the little model walked  it squeezes me she said  try another then said hilary  the lady rose stood for a second with her eyebrows raised and her nostrils slightly distended then went away and left a peculiarly pleasant scent of violets behind  the second pair of boots not squeezing her the little model was soon ready to go down she had all her trousseau now except the dressselected and indeed paid for but which as she told hilary she was coming back to try on tomorrow whenwhen she had obviously meant to say when she was all new underneath she was laden with one large and two small parcels and in her eyes there was a holy look  outside the shop she gazed up in his face  well you are happy now asked hilary  between the short black lashes were seen two very bright wet shining eyes her parted lips began to quiver  goodnight then he said abruptly and walked away  but looking round he saw her still standing there half buried in parcels gazing after him raising his hat he turned into the high street towards home  the old man known to that low class of fellow with whom he was now condemned to associate as westminister was taking a whiff or two out of his old clay pipe and trying to forget his feet he saw hilary coming and carefully extended a copy of the last edition  goodevenin sir quite seasonable today for the time of year ho yes westminister  his eyes followed hilarys retreat he thought  oh dear hes agiven me an arfacrown he does look welli like to see im look as well as thatquite young oh dear  the sunthat smoky faring ball which in its time had seen so many last editions of the westminster gazettewas dropping down to pass the night in shepherds bush it made the old butlers eyelids blink when he turned to see if the coin really was a halfcrown or too good to be true  and all the spires and houseroofs and the spaces up above and underneath them glittered and swam and men and horses looked as if they had been powdered with golden dust     chapter xi  pear blossom  weighed down by her three parcels the little model pursued her way to hound street at the door of no 1 the son of the lame woman a tall weedy youth with a white face was resting his legs alternately and smoking a cigarette closing one eye he addressed her thus  allo miss kerry your parcels for you  the little model gave him a look mind your own business it said but there was that in the flicker of her eyelashes which more than nullified this snub  entering her room she deposited the parcels on her bed and untied the strings with quick pink fingers when she had freed the garments from wrappings and spread them out she knelt down and began to touch them putting her nose down once or twice to sniff the linen and feel its texture there were little frills attached here and there and to these she paid particular attention ruffling their edges with the palms of her hands while the holy look came back to her face rising at length she locked the door drew down the blind undressed from head to foot and put on the new garments letting her hair down she turned herself luxuriously round and round before the toosmall lookingglass there was utter satisfaction in each gesture of that whole operation as if her spirit long starved were having a good meal in this rapt contemplation of herself all childish vanity and expectancy and all that wonderful quality found in simple unspiritual natures of delighting in the present moment were perfectly displayed so motionless with her hair loose on her neck she was like one of those halfhours of spring that have lost their restlessness and are content just to be  presently however as though suddenly remembering that her happiness was not utterly complete she went to a drawer took out a packet of peardrops and put one in her mouth  the sun near to setting had found its way through a hole in the blind and touched her neck she turned as though she had received a kiss and raising a corner of the blind peered out the peartree which to the annoyance of its proprietor was placed so close to the back court of this lowclass house as almost to seem to belong to it was bathed in slanting sunlight no tree in all the world could have looked more fair than it did just then in its garb of gilded bloom with her hand up to her bare neck and her cheeks indrawn from sucking the sweet the little model fixed her eyes on the tree her expression did not change she showed no signs of admiration her gaze passed on to the back windows of the house that really owned the peartree spying out whether anyone could see herhoping perhaps someone would see her while she was feeling so nice and new then dropping the blind she went back to the glass and began to pin her hair up when this was done she stood for a long minute looking at her old brown skirt and blouse hesitating to defile her newfound purity at last she put them on and drew up the blind the sunlight had passed off the peartree its bloom was now white and almost as still as snow the little model put another sweet into her mouth and producing from her pocket an ancient leather purse counted out her money evidently discovering that it was no more than she expected she sighed and rummaged out of a top drawer an old illustrated magazine  she sat down on the bed and turning the leaves rapidly till she reached a certain page rested the paper in her lap her eyes were fixed on a photograph in the lefthand cornerone of those effigies of writers that appear occasionally in the public press under it were printed the words mr hilary dallison and suddenly she heaved a sigh  the room grew darker the wind getting up as the sun went down blew a few dropped petals of the peartree against the windowpane     chapter xii  ships in sail  in due accord with the old butlers comment on his looks hilary had felt so young that instead of going home he mounted an omnibus and went down to his clubthe pen and ink so called because the man who founded it could not think at the moment of any other words this literary person had left the club soon after its initiation having conceived for it a sudden dislike it had indeed a certain reputation for bad cooking and all its members complained bitterly at times that you never could go in without meeting someone you knew it stood in dover street unlike other clubs it was mainly used to talk in and had special arrangements for the safety of umbrellas and such books as had not yet vanished from the library not of course owing to any peculative tendency among its members but because after interchanging their ideas those members would depart in a long row each grasping some material object in his hand its marooncoloured curtains too were never drawn because in the heat of their discussions the members were always drawing them on the whole those members did not like each other much wondering a little one by one why the others wrote and when the printed reasons were detailed to them reading them with irritation if really compelled to hazard an opinion about each others merits they used to say that no doubt soandso was very good but they had never read him for it had early been established as the principle underlying membership not to read the writings of another man unless you could be certain he was dead lest you might have to tell him to his face that you disliked his work for they were very jealous of the purity of their literary consciences exception was made however in the case of those who lived by written criticism the opinions of such persons being read by all with a varying smile and a certain cerebral excitement now and then however some member violating every sense of decency would take a violent liking for another members books this he would express in words to the discomfort of his fellows who with a sudden chilly feeling in the stomach would wonder why it was not their books that he was praising  almost every year and generally in march certain aspirations would pass into the club members would ask each other why there was no academy of british letters why there was no concerted movement to limit the production of other authors books why there was no prize given for the best work of the year for a little time it almost seemed as if their individualism were in danger but the windows having been opened wider than usual some morning the aspirations would pass out and all would feel secretly as a man feels when he has swallowed the mosquito that has been worrying him all nightrelieved but just a little bit embarrassed socially sympathetic in their dealings with each otherthey were mostly quite nice fellowseach kept a little famemachine on which he might be seen sitting every morning about the time the papers and his correspondence came wondering if his fame were going up  hilary stayed in the club till halfpast nine then avoiding a discussion which was just setting in he took his own umbrella and bent his steps towards home  it was the moment of suspense in piccadilly the tide had flowed up to the theatres and had not yet begun to ebb the tranquil trees still feathery draped their branches along the farther bank of that broad river resting from their watch over the tragicomedies played on its surface by men their small companions the gentle sighs which distilled from their plumelike boughs seemed utterances of the softest wisdom not far beyond their trunks it was all dark velvet into which separate shapes adventuring were lost as wild birds vanishing in space or the souls of men received into their mothers heart  hilary walked hearing no sighs of wisdom noting no smooth darkness wrapped in thought the mere fact of having given pleasure was enough to produce a warm sensation in a man so naturally kind but as with all selfconscious selfdistrustful natures that sensation had not lasted he was left with a feeling of emptiness and disillusionment as of having given himself a good mark without reason  while walking he was a target for the eyes of many women who passed him rapidly like ships in sail the special fastidious shyness of his face attracted those accustomed to another kind of face and though he did not precisely look at them they in turn inspired in him the compassionate morbid curiosity which persons who live desperate lives necessarily inspire in the leisured speculative mind one of them deliberately approached him from a sidestreet though taller and fuller with heightened colour frizzy hair and a hat with feathers she was the image of the little modelthe same shape of face broad cheekbones mouth a little open the same flowercoloured eyes and short black lashes all coarsened and accentuated as art coarsens and accentuates the lines of life looking boldly into hilarys startled face she laughed hilary winced and walked on quickly  he reached home at halfpast ten the lamp was burning in mr stones room and his window was as usual open that which was not usual however was a light in hilarys own bedroom he went gently up through the doorajarhe saw to his surprise the figure of his wife she was reclining in a chair her elbows on its arms the tips of her fingers pressed together her face with its dark hair vivid colouring and sharp lines was touched with shadows her head turned as though towards somebody beside her her neck gleamed white somotionless dimly seenshe was like a woman sitting alongside her own life scrutinising criticising watching it live taking no part in it hilary wondered whether to go in or slip away from his strange visitor  ah its you she said  hilary approached her for all her mocking of her own charms this wife of his was strangely graceful after nineteen years in which to learn every line of her face and body every secret of her nature she still eluded him that elusiveness which had begun by being such a charm had got on his nerves and extinguished the flame it had once lighted he had so often tried to see and never seen the essence of her soul why was she made like this why was she for ever mocking herself himself and every other thing why was she so hard to her own life so bitter a foe to her own happiness leonardo da vinci might have painted her less sensual and cruel than his women more restless and disharmonic but physically spiritually enticing and by her refusals to surrender either to her spirit or her senses baffling her own enticements  i dont know why i came she said  hilary found no better answer than i am sorry i was out to dinner  has the wind gone round my room is cold  yes northeast stay here  her hand touched his that warm and restless clasp was agitating  its good of you to ask me but wed better not begin what we cant keep up  stay here said hilary again kneeling down beside her chair  and suddenly he began to kiss her face and neck he felt her answering kisses for a moment they were clasped together in a fierce embrace then as though by mutual consent their arms relaxed their eyes grew furtive like the eyes of children who have egged each other on to steal and on their lips appeared the faintest of faint smiles it was as though those lips were saying yes but we are not quite animals  hilary got up and sat down on his bed blanca stayed in the chair looking straight before her utterly inert her head thrown back her white throat gleaming on her lips and in her eyes that flickering smile not a word more nor a look passed between them  then rising without noise she passed behind him and went out  hilary had a feeling in his mouth as though he had been chewing ashes and a phraseas phrases sometimes fill the spirit of a man without rhyme or reasonkept forming on his lips the house of harmony  presently he went to her door and stood there listening he could hear no sound whatever if she had been crying if she had been laughingit would have been better than this silence he put his hands up to his ears and ran downstairs     chapter xiii  sound in the night  he passed his study door and halted at mr stones the thought of the old man so steady and absorbed in the face of all external things refreshed him  still in his brown woollen gown mr stone was sitting with his eyes fixed on something in the corner whence a little perfumed steam was rising  shut the door he said i am making cocoa will you have a cup  am i disturbing you asked hilary  mr stone looked at him steadily before answering  if i work after cocoa i find it clogs the liver  then if youll let me sir ill stay a little  it is boiling said mr stone he took the saucepan off the flame and distending his frail cheeks blew then while the steam mingled with his frosty beard he brought two cups from a cupboard filled one of them and looked at hilary  i should like you he said to hear three or four pages i have just completed you may perhaps be able to suggest a word or two  he placed the saucepan back on the stove and grasped the cup he had filled  i will drink my cocoa and read them to you  going to the desk he stood blowing at the cup  hilary turned up the collar of his coat against the night wind which was visiting the room and glanced at the empty cup for he was rather hungry he heard a curious sound mr stone was blowing his own tongue in his haste to read he had drunk too soon and deeply of the cocoa  i have burnt my mouth he said  hilary moved hastily towards him badly try cold milk sir  mr stone lifted the cup  there is none he said and drank again  what would i not give thought hilary to have his singleness of heart  there was the sharp sound of a cup set down then out of a rustling of papers a sort of droning rose  the proletariatwith a cynicism natural to those who really are in want and even amongst their leaders only veiled when these attained a certain position in the public eyedesired indeed the wealth and leisure of their richer neighbours but in their long night of struggle with existence they had only found the energy to formulate their pressing needs from day to day they were a heaving surging sea of creatures slowly without consciousness or real guidance rising in long tidal movements to set the limits of the shore a little farther back and cast afresh the form of social life and on its peagreen bosom  mr stone paused she has copied it wrong he said the word is seagreen and on its seagreen bosom sailed a fleet of silver cockleshells wafted by the breath of those not in themselves driven by the wind of need the voyage of these silver cockleshells all heading across each others bows was in fact the advanced movement of that time in the stern of each of these little craft blowing at the sails was seated a byproduct of the accepted system these byproducts we should now examine  mr stone paused and looked into his cup there were some grounds in it he drank them and went on  the fratricidal principle of the survival of the fittest which in those days was englands moral teaching had made the country one huge butchers shop amongst the carcasses of countless victims there had fattened and grown purple many butchers physically strengthened by the smell of blood and sawdust these had begotten many children following out the laws of nature providing against surfeit a proportion of these children were born with a feeling of distaste for blood and sawdust many of them compelled for the purpose of making money to follow in their fathers practices did so unwillingly some thanks to their fathers butchery were in a position to abstain from practising but whether in practice or at leisure distaste for the scent of blood and sawdust was the common feature that distinguished them qualities hitherto but little known and generally despisednot as we shall see without some reasonwere developed in them selfconsciousness aestheticism a dislike for waste a hatred of injustice theseor some one of these when coupled with that desire natural to men throughout all ages to accomplish somethingconstituted the motive forces which enabled them to work their bellows in practical affairs those who were under the necessity of labouring were driven under the then machinery of social life to the humaner and less exacting kinds of butchery such as the arts education the practice of religions and medicine and the paid representation of their fellowcreatures those not so driven occupied themselves in observing and complaining of the existing state of thing each year saw more of their silver cockleshells putting out from port and the cheeks of those who blew the sails more violently distended looking back on that pretty voyage we see the reason why those ships were doomed never to move but seated on the seagreen bosom of that sea to heave up and down heading across each others bows in the selfsame place for ever that reason in few words was this the man who blew should have been in the sea not on the ship  the droning ceased hilary saw that mr stone was staring fixedly at his sheet of paper as though the merits of this last sentence were surprising him the droning instantly began again in social effort as in the physical processes of nature there had ever been a single fertilising agentthe mysterious and wonderful attraction known as love to thisthat merging of one being in anotherhad been due all the progressive variance of form known by man under the name of life it was this merger this mysterious unconscious love which was lacking to the windy efforts of those who tried to sail that fleet they were full of reason conscience horror full of impatience contempt revolt but they did not love the masses of their fellowmen they could not fling themselves into the sea their hearts were glowing but the wind which made them glow was not the salt and universal zephyr it was the desert wind of scorn as with the flowering of the aloetreeso long awaited so strange and swift when once it comesman had yet to wait for his delirious impulse to universal brotherhood and the forgetfulness of self  mr stone had finished and stood gazing at his visitor with eyes that clearly saw beyond him hilary could not meet those eyes he kept his own fixed on the empty cocoa cup it was not in fact usual for those who heard mr stone read his manuscript to look him in the face he stood thus absorbed so long that hilary rose at last and glanced into the saucepan there was no cocoa in it mr stone had only made enough for one he had meant it for his visitor but selfforgetfulness had supervened  you know what happens to the aloe sir when it has flowered asked hilary with malice  mr stone moved but did not answer  it dies said hilary  no said mr stone it is at peace  when is self at peace sir the individual is surely as immortal as the universal that is the eternal comedy of life  what is said mr stone  the fight or game between the two  mr stone stood a moment looking wistfully at his soninlaw he laid down the sheet of manuscript it is time for me to do my exercises so saying he undid the tasselled cord tied round the middle of his gown  hilary hastened to the door from that point of vantage he looked back  divested of his gown and turned towards the window mr stone was already rising on his toes his arms were extended his palms pressed hard together in the attitude of prayer his trousers slowly slipping down  one two three four five there was a sudden sound of breath escaping  in the corridor upstairs flooded with moonlight from a window at the end hilary stood listening again the only sound that came to him was the light snoring of miranda who slept in the bathroom not caring to lie too near to anyone he went to his room and for a long time sat buried in thought then opening the side window he leaned out on the trees of the next garden and the sloping roofs of stables and outhouses the moonlight had come down like a flight of milkwhite pigeons with outspread wings vibrating faintly as though yet in motion they covered everything nothing stirred a clock was striking two past that flight of milkwhite pigeons were black walls as yet unvisited then in the stillness hilary seemed to hear deep and very faint the sound as of some monster breathing or the far beating of muffed drums from every side of the pale sleeping town it seemed to come under the moons cold glamour it rose and fell and rose with a weird creepy rhythm like a groaning of the hopeless and hungry a hansom cab rattled down the high street hilary strained his ears after the failing clatter of hoofs and bell they died there was silence creeping nearer drumming throbbing he heard again the beating of that vast heart it grew and grew his own heart began thumping then emerging from that sinister dumb groan he distinguished a crunching sound and knew that it was no muttering echo of mens struggles but only the waggons journeying to covent garden market     chapter xiv  a walk abroad  thyme dallison in the midst of her busy life found leisure to record her recollections and ideas in the pages of old school notebooks she had no definite purpose in so doing nor did she desire the solace of luxuriating in her private feelingsthis she would have scorned as out of date and silly it was done from the fulness of youthful energy and from the desire to express oneself that was in the air it was everywhere that desire among her fellowstudents among her young men friends in her mothers drawingroom and her aunts studio like sentiment and marriage to the victorian miss so was this duty to express herself to thyme and going handinhand with it the duty to have a good and jolly youth she never read again the thoughts which she recorded she took no care to lock them up knowing that her liberty development and pleasure were sacred things which no one would dream of touchingshe kept them stuffed down in a drawer among her handkerchiefs and ties and blouses together with the indelible fragment of a pencil  this journal naive and slipshod recorded without order the current impression of things on her mind  in the early morning of the 4th of may she sat nightgowned on the foot of her white bed with chestnut hair all fluffy about her neck eyes bright and cheeks still rosy with sleep scribbling away and rubbing one bare foot against the other in the ecstasy of selfexpression now and then in the middle of a sentence she would stop and look out of the window or stretch herself deliciously as though life were too full of joy for her to finish anything  i went into grandfathers room yesterday and stayed while he was dictating to the little model i do think grandfathers so splendid martin says an enthusiast is worse than useless people he says cant afford to dabble in ideas or dreams he calls grandfathers idea paleolithic i hate him to be laughed at martins so cocksure i dont think hed find many men of eighty whod bathe in the serpentine all the year round and do his own room cook his own food and live on about ninety pounds a year out of his pension of three hundred and give all the rest away martin says thats unsound and the book of universal brotherhood rot i dont care if it is its fine to go on writing it as he does all day martin admits that thats the worst of him hes so cool you cant score him off he seems to be always criticising you it makes me wild that little model is a hopeless duffer i could have taken it all down in half the time she kept stopping and looking up with that mouth of hers half open as if she had all day before her grandfathers so absorbed he doesnt notice he likes to read the thing over and over to hear how the words sound that girl would be no good at any sort of work except sitting i suppose aunt b used to say she sat well theres something queer about her face it reminds me a little of that botticelli madonna in the national gallery the fullface one not so much in the shape as in the expressionalmost stupid and yet as if things were going to happen to her her hands and arms are pretty and her feet are smaller than mine shes two years older than me i asked her why she went in for being a model which is beastly work she said she was glad to get anything i asked her why she didnt go into a shop or into service she didnt answer at once and then said she hadnt had any recommendationsdidnt know where to try then all of a sudden she grew quite sulky and said she didnt want to  thyme paused to pencil in a sketch of the little models profile  she had on a really pretty frock quite simple and well madeit must have cost three or four pounds she cant be so very badly off or somebody gave it her  and again thyme paused  she looked ever so much prettier in it than she used to in her old brown skirt i thought  uncle hilary came to dinner last night we talked of social questions we always discuss things when he comes i cant help liking uncle hilary he has such kind eyes and hes so gentle that you never lose your temper with him martin calls him weak and unsatisfactory because hes not in touch with life i should say it was more as if he couldnt bear to force anyone to do anything he seems to see both sides of every question and hes not good at making up his mind of course hes rather like hamlet might have been only nobody seems to know now what hamlet was really like i told him what i thought about the lower classes one can talk to him i hate fathers way of making feeble little jokes as if nothing were serious i said i didnt think it was any use to dabble we ought to go to the root of everything i said that money and class distinctions are two bogeys we have got to lay martin says when it comes to real dealing with social questions and the poor all the people we know are amateurs he says that we have got to shake ourselves free of all the old sentimental notions and just work at putting everything to the test of health father calls martin a sanitist and uncle hilary says that if you wash people by law theyll all be as dirty again tomorrow  thyme paused again a blackbird in the garden of the square was uttering a long low chuckling trill she ran to the window and peeped out the bird was on a planetree and with throat uplifted was letting through his yellow beak that delicious piece of selfexpression all things he seemed to praisethe sky the sun the trees the dewy grass himself  you darling thought thyme with a shudder of delight she dropped her notebook back into the drawer flung off her nightgown and flew into her bath  that same morning she slipped out quietly at ten oclock her saturdays were free of classes but she had to run the gauntlet of her mothers liking for her company and her fathers wish for her to go with him to richmond and play golf  for on saturdays stephen almost always left the precincts of the courts before three oclock then if he could induce his wife or daughter to accompany him he liked to get a round or two in preparation for sunday when he always started off at halfpast ten and played all day if cecilia and thyme failed him he would go to his club and keep himself in touch with every kind of social movement by reading the reviews  thyme walked along with her head up and a wrinkle in her brow as though she were absorbed in serious reflection if admiring glances were flung at her she did not seem aware of them passing not far from hilarys she entered the broad walk and crossed it to the farther end  on a railing stretching out his long legs and observing the passersby sat her cousin martin stone he got down as she came up  late again he said come on  where are we going first thyme asked  the notting hill districts all we can do today if were to go again to mrs hughs i must be down at the hospital this afternoon  thyme frowned i do envy you living by yourself martin its silly having to live at home  martin did not answer but one nostril of his long nose was seen to curve and thyme acquiesced in this without remark they walked for some minutes between tall houses looking about them calmly then martin said all purceys round here  thyme nodded again there was silence but in these pauses there was no embarrassment no consciousness apparently that it was silence and their eyesthose young impatient interested eyeswere for ever busy observing  boundary line we shall be in a patch directly  black asked thyme  dark blueblack farther on  they were passing down a long grey curving road whose narrow houses hopelessly unpainted showed marks of grinding poverty the spring wind was ruffling straw and little bits of paper in the gutters under the bright sunlight a bleak and bitter struggle seemed raging thyme said  this street gives me a hollow feeling  martin nodded worse than the real article theres half a mile of this here its all grim fighting farther on theyve given it up  and still they went on up the curving street with its few pinched shops and its unending narrow grimness  at the corner of a bystreet martin said well go down here  thyme stood still wrinkling her nose martin eyed her  dont funk  im not funking martin only i cant stand the smells  youll have to get used to them  yes i know butbut i forgot my eucalyptus  the young man took out a handkerchief which had not yet been unfolded  here take mine  they do make me feel soits a shame to take yours and she took the handkerchief  thats all right said martin come on  the houses of this narrow street inside and out seemed full of women many of them had babies in their arms they were working or looking out of windows or gossiping on doorsteps and all stopped to stare as the young couple passed thyme stole a look at her companion his long stride had not varied there was the usual pale observant sarcastic expression on his face clenching the handkerchief in readiness and trying to imitate his callous air she looked at a group of five women on the nearest doorstep  three were seated and two were standing one of these a young woman with a round open face was clearly very soon to have a child the other with a short dark face and irongrey straggling hair was smoking a clay pipe of the three seated one quite young had a face as grey white as a dirty sheet and a blackened eye the second with her ragged dress disarranged was nursing a baby the third in the centre on the top step with red arms akimbo her face scored with drink was shouting friendly obscenities to a neighbour in the window opposite in thymes heart rose the passionate feeling how disgusting how disgusting and since she did not dare to give expression to it she bit her lips and turned her head from them resenting with all a young girls horror that her sex had given her away the women stared at her and in those faces according to their different temperaments could be seen first the same vague hard interest that had been thymes when she first looked at them then the same secret hostility and criticism as though they too felt that by this young girls untouched modesty by her gushed cheeks and unsoiled clothes their sex had given them away with contemptuous movements of their lips and bodies on that doorstep they proclaimed their emphatic belief in the virtue and reality of their own existences and in the vice and unreality of her intruding presence  give the doll to bill ed make er work for once the in a burst of laughter the epithet was lost  martins lips curled  purple just here he said  thymes cheeks were crimson  at the end of the little street he stopped before a shop  come on he said youll see the sort of place where they buy their grub  in the doorway were standing a thin brown spaniel a small fair woman with a high bald forehead from which the hair was gleaned into curlpapers and a little girl with some affection of the skin  nodding coolly martin motioned them aside the shop was ten feet square its counters running parallel to two of the walls were covered with plates of cake sausages old hambones peppermint sweets and household soap there was also bread margarine suet in bowls sugar bloatersmany bloaterscaptains biscuits and other things besides two or three dead rabbits hung against the wall all was uncovered so that what flies there were sat feeding socialistically behind the counter a girl of seventeen was serving a thinfaced woman with portions of a cheese which she was holding down with her strong dirty hand while she sawed it with a knife on the counter next the cheese sat a quietlooking cat  they all glanced round at the two young people who stood and waited  finish what youre at said martin then give me three pennyworth of bullseyes  the girl with a violent effort finished severing the cheese the thinfaced woman took it and coughing above it went away the girl who could not take her eyes off thyme now served them with three pennyworth of bullseyes which she took out with her fingers for they had stuck putting them in a screw of newspaper she handed them to martin the young man who had been observing negligently touched thymes elbow she who had stood with eyes cast down now turned they went out martin handing the bullseyes to the little girl with an affection of the skin  the street now ended in a wide road formed of little low houses  black said martin here all down this roadcasual labour criminals loafers drunkards consumps look at the faces  thyme raised her eyes obediently in this main thoroughfare it was not as in the bystreet and only dull or sullen glances or none at all were bent on her some of the houses had ragged plants on the windowsills in one window a canary was singing then at a bend they came into a blacker reach of human river here were outbuildings houses with broken windows houses with windows boarded up friedfish shops low publichouses houses without doors there were more men here than women and those men were wheeling barrows full of rags and bottles or not even full of rags and bottles or they were standing by the publichouses gossiping or quarrelling in groups of three or four or very slowly walking in the gutters or on the pavements as though trying to remember if they were alive then suddenly some young man with gaunt violence in his face would pass pushing his barrow desperately striding fiercely by and every now and then from a friedfish or hardware shop would come out a man in a dirty apron to take the sun and contemplate the scene not finding in it seemingly anything that in any way depressed his spirit amongst the constant crawling shifting stream of passengers were seen women carrying food wrapped up in newspaper or with bundles beneath their shawls the faces of these women were generally either very red and coarse or of a sort of bluishwhite they wore the expression of such as know themselves to be existing in the way that providence has arranged they should exist no surprise revolt dismay or shame was ever to be seen on those faces in place of these emotions a drab and brutish acquiescence or mechanical coarse jocularity to pass like this about their business was their occupation each morning of the year it was needful to accept it not having any hope of ever being different not being able to imagine any other life they were not so wasteful of their strength as to attempt either to hope or to imagine here and there too very slowly passed old men and women crawling along like winter bees who in some strange and evil moment had forgotten to die in the sunlight of their toil and too old to be of use had been chivied forth from their hive to perish slowly in the cold twilight of their days  down the centre of the street thyme saw a brewers dray creeping its way due south under the sun three horses drew it with braided tails and beribboned manes the brass glittering on their harness high up like a god sat the drayman his little slits of eyes above huge red cheeks fixed immovably on his horses crests behind him with slow unceasing crunch the dray rolled piled up with hogsheads whereon the draymans mate lay sleeping like the slumbrous image of some mighty unrelenting power it passed proud that its monstrous bulk contained all the joy and blessing those shadows on the pavement had ever known  the two young people emerged on to the high road running east and west  cross here said martin and cut down into kensington nothing more of interest now till we get to hound street purceys and purceys all round about this part  thyme shook herself  o martin lets go down a road where theres some air i feel so dirty she put her hand up to her chest  theres one here said martin  they turned to the left into a road that had many trees now that she could breathe and look about her thyme once more held her head erect and began to swing her arms  martin something must be done  the young doctor did not reply his face still wore its pale sarcastic observant look he gave her arm a squeeze with a halfcontemptuous smile     chapter xv  second pilgrimage to hound street  arriving in hound street martin stone and his companion went straight up to mrs hughs front room they found her doing the weeks washing and hanging out before a scanty fire part of the little that the week had been suffered to soil her arms were bare her face and eyes red the steam of soapsuds had congealed on them  attached to the bolster by a towel under his fathers bayonet and the oleograph depicting the nativity sat the baby in the air there was the scent of him of walls and washing and red herrings the two young people took their seat on the windowsill  may we open the window mrs hughs said thyme or will it hurt the baby  no miss  whats the matter with your wrists asked martin  the seamstress muffing her arms with the garment she was dipping in soapy water did not answer  dont do that let me have a look  mrs hughs held out her arms the wrists were swollen and discoloured  the brute cried thyme  the young doctor muttered done last night got any arnica  no sir  of course not he laid a sixpence on the sill get some and rub it in mind you dont break the skin  thyme suddenly burst out why dont you leave him mrs hughs why do you live with a brute like that  martin frowned  any particular row he said or only just the ordinary  mrs hughs turned her face to the scanty fire her shoulders heaved spasmodically  thus passed three minutes then she again began rubbing the soapy garment  if you dont mind ill smoke said martin whats your babys name bill here bill he placed his little finger in the babys hand feeding him yourself  yes sir  whats his number  ive lost three sir theres only his brother stanley now  one a year  no sir i missed two years in the war of course  hughs wounded out there  yes sirin the head  ah and fever  yes sir  martin tapped his pipe against his forehead least drop of liquor goes to it i suppose  mrs hughs paused in the dipping of a cloth her tearstained face expressed resentment as though she had detected an attempt to find excuses for her husband  he didnt ought to treat me as he does she said  all three now stood round the bed over which the baby presided with solemn gaze  thyme said i wouldnt care what he did mrs hughs i wouldnt stay another day if i were you its your duty as a woman  to hear her duty as a woman mrs hughs turned slow vindictiveness gathered on her thin face  yes miss she said i dont know what to do  take the children and go whats the good of waiting well give you money if you havent got enough  but mrs hughs did not answer  well said martin blowing out a cloud of smoke  thyme burst out again just go the very minute your little boy comes back from school hughs ll never find you it ll serve him right no woman ought to put up with what you have its simply weakness mrs hughs  as though that word had forced its way into her very heart and set the blood free suddenly mrs hughs face turned the colour of tomatoes she poured forth words  and leave him to that young girland leave him to his wickedness after ive been his wife eight years and borne him five after ive done what i have for him i never want no better husband than what he used to be till she came with her pale face and her prinky manners andand her mouth that you can tell shes bad by let her keep to her professionsitting nakeds what shes fit forcoming here to decent folk and holding out her wrists to thyme who had shrunk back she cried hes never struck me before i got these all because of her new clothes  hearing his mother speak with such strange passion the baby howled mrs hughs stopped and took him up pressing him close to her thin bosom she looked above his little dingy head at the two young people  i got my wrists like this last night wrestling with him he swore hed go and leave me but i held him i did and dont you ever think that ill let him go to that young girlnot if he kills me first  with those words the passion in her face died down she was again a meek mute woman  during this outbreak thyme shrinking stood by the doorway with lowered eyes she now looked up at martin clearly asking him to come away the latter had kept his gaze fixed on mrs hughs smoking silently he took his pipe out of his mouth and pointed with it at the baby  this gentleman he said cant stand too much of that  in silence all three bent their eyes on the baby his little fists and nose and forehead even his little naked crinkled feet were thrust with all his feeble strength against his mothers bosom as though he were striving to creep into some hole away from life there was a sort of dumb despair in that tiny pushing of his way back to the place whence he had come his head covered with dingy down quivered with his effort to escape he had been alive so little that little had sufficed martin put his pipe back into his mouth  this wont do you know he said he cant stand it and look here if you stop feeding him i wouldnt give that for him tomorrow he held up the circle of his thumb and finger youre the best judge of what sort of chance youve got of going on in your present state of mind then motioning to thyme he went down the stairs     chapter xvi  beneath the elms  spring was in the hearts of men and their tall companions trees their troubles the stiflings of each others growth and all such things seemed of little moment spring had them by the throat it turned old men round and made them stare at women younger than themselves it made young men and women walking side by side touch each other and every bird on the branches tune his pipe flying sunlight speckled the fluttered leaves and gushed the cheeks of crippled boys who limped into the gardens till their pale cockney faces shone with a strange glow  in the broad walk beneath those dangerous trees the elms people sat and took the suncheek by jowl generals and nursemaids parsons and the unemployed above in that spring wind the elmtree boughs were swaying rustling creaking ever so gently carrying on the innumerable talk of treestheir sapient wordless conversation over the affairs of men it was pleasant too to see and hear the myriad movement of the million little separate leaves each shaped differently flighting never twice alike yet all obedient to the single spirit of their tree  thyme and martin were sitting on a seat beneath the largest of all the elms their manner lacked the unconcern and dignity of the moment when two hours before they had started forth on their discovery from the other end of the broad walk martin spoke  its given you the hump first sight of blood and youre like all the rest of them  im not martin how perfectly beastly of you  oh yes you are theres plenty of aestheticism about you and your peopleplenty of good intentionsbut not an ounce of real business  dont abuse my people theyre just as kind as you  oh theyre kind enough and they can see whats wrong its not that which stops them but your dads a regular official hes got so much sense of what he ought not to do that he never does anything just as hilarys got so much consciousness of what he ought to do that he never does anything you went to that womans this morning with your ideas of helping her all cut and dried and now that you find the facts arent what you thought youre stumped  one cant believe anything they say thats what i hate i thought hughs simply knocked her about i didnt know it was her jealousy  of course you didnt do you imagine those people give anything away to our sort unless theyre forced they know better  well i hate the whole thingits all so sordid  o lord  well it is i dont feel that i want to help a woman who can say and feel such horrid things or the girl or any of them  who cares what they say or feel thats not the point its simply a case of common sense your people put that girl there and they must get her to clear out again sharp its just a question of whats healthy  well i know its not healthy for me to have anything to do with and i wont i dont believe you can help people unless they want to be helped  martin whistled  youre rather a brute i think said thyme  a brute not rather a brute thats all the difference  for the worse  i dont think so thyme  there was no answer  look at me  very slowly thyme turned her eyes  well  are you one of us or are you not  of course i am  youre not  i am  well dont lets fight about it give me your hand  he dropped his hand on hers her face had flushed rose colour suddenly she freed herself heres uncle hilary  it was indeed hilary with miranda trotting in advance his hands were crossed behind him his face bent towards the ground the two young people on the bench sat looking at him  buried in selfcontemplation murmured martin thats the way he always walks i shall tell him about this  the colour of thymes face deepened from rose to crimson  no  why not  wellthose new she could not bring out that word clothes it would have given her thoughts away  hilary seemed making for their seat but miranda aware of martin stopped a man of action she appeared to say the one who pulls my ears and turning as though unconscious she endeavoured to lead hilary away her master however had already seen his niece he came and sat down on the bench beside her  we wanted you said martin eyeing him slowly as a young dog will eye another of a different age and breed thyme and i have been to see the hughs in hound street things are blowing up for a mess you or whoever put the girl there ought to get her away again as quick as possible  hilary seemed at once to withdraw into himself  well he said let us hear all about it  the womans jealous of her thats all the trouble  oh said hilary thats all the trouble  thyme murmured i dont see a bit why uncle hilary should bother if they will be so horridi didnt think the poor were like that i didnt think they had it in them im sure the girl isnt worth it or the woman either  i didnt say they were growled martin its a question of whats healthy  hilary looked from one of his young companions to the other  i see he said i thought perhaps the matter was more delicate  martins lip curled  ah your precious delicacy whats the good of that what did it ever do its the curse that youre all suffering from why dont you act you could think about it afterwards  a flush came into hilarys sallow cheeks  do you never think before you act martin  martin got up and stood looking down on hilary  look here he said i dont go in for your subtleties i use my eyes and nose i can see that the woman will never be able to go on feeding the baby in the neurotic state shes in its a matter of health for both of them  is everything a matter of health with you  it is take any subject that you like take the poor themselveswhats wanted health nothing on earth but health the discoveries and inventions of the last century have knocked the floor out of the old order weve got to put a new one in and were going to put it in toothe floor of health the crowd doesnt yet see what it wants but theyre looking for it and when we show it them theyll catch on fast enough  but who are you murmured hilary  who are we ill tell you one thing while all the reformers are pecking at each other we shall quietly come along and swallow up the lot weve simply grasped this elementary fact that theories are no basis for reform we go on the evidence of our eyes and noses what we see and smell is wrong we correct by practical and scientific means  will you apply that to human nature  its human nature to want health  i wonder it doesnt look much like it at present  take the case of this woman  yes said hilary take her case you cant make this too clear to me martin  shes no usepoor sort altogether the mans no use a man whos been wounded in the head and isnt a teetotaller is done for the girls no useregular pleasureloving type  thyme flushed crimson and seeing that flood of colour in his nieces face hilary bit his lips  the only things worth considering are the children theres this babywell as i said the important thing is that the mother should be able to look after it properly get hold of that and let the other facts go hang  forgive me but my difficulty is to isolate this question of the babys health from all the other circumstances of the case  martin grinned  and youll make that an excuse im certain for doing nothing  thyme slipped her hand into hilarys  you are a brute martin shemurmured  the young man turned on her a look that said its no use calling me a brute im proud of being one besides you know you dont dislike it  its better to be a brute than an amateur he said  thyme pressing close to hilary as though he needed her protection cried out  martin you really are a goth  hilary was still smiling but his face quivered  not at all he said martins powers of diagnosis do him credit  and raising his hat he walked away  the two young people both on their feet now looked after him martins face was a queer study of contemptuous compunction thymes was startled softened almost tearful  it wont do him any harm muttered the young man itll shake him up  thyme flashed a vicious look at him  i hate you sometimes she said youre so coarsegrainedyour skins just like leather  martins hand descended on her wrist  and yours he said is tissuepaper youre all the same you amateurs  id rather be an amateur than athan a bounder  martin made a queer movement of his jaw then smiled that smile seemed to madden thyme she wrenched her wrist away and darted after hilary  martin impassively looked after her taking out his pipe he filled it with tobacco slowly pressing the golden threads down into the bowl with his little finger     chapter xvii  two brothers  if has been said that stephen dallison when unable to get his golf on saturdays went to his club and read reviews the two forms of exercise in fact were very similar in playing golf you went round and round in reading reviews you did the same for in course of time you were assured of coming to articles that nullified articles already read in both forms of sport the balance was preserved which keeps a man both sound and young  and to be both sound and young was to stephen an everyday necessity he was essentially a cambridge man springy and undemonstrative with just that air of taking a continual pinch of really perfect snuff underneath this manner he was a good worker a good husband a good father and nothing could be urged against him except his regularity and the fact that he was never in the wrong where he worked and indeed in other places many men were like him in one respect he resembled them perhaps too muchhe disliked leaving the ground unless he knew precisely where he was coming down again  he and cecilia had got on from the first they had both desired to have one childno more they had both desired to keep up with the timesno more they now both considered hilarys position awkwardno more and when cecilia in the special jacobean bed and taking care to let him have his sleep out first had told him of this matter of the hughs they had both turned it over very carefully lying on their backs and speaking in grave tones stephen was of opinion that poor old hilary must look out what he was doing beyond this he did not go keeping even from his wife the more unpleasant of what seemed to him the possibilities  then in the words she had used to hilary cecilia spoke  its so sordid stephen  he looked at her and almost with one accord they both said  but its all nonsense  these speeches so simultaneous stimulated them to a robuster view what was this affair if real but the sort of episode that they read of in their papers what was it if true but a duplicate of some bit of fiction or drama which they daily saw described by that word sordid cecilia indeed had used this word instinctively it had come into her mind at once the whole affair disturbed her ideals of virtue and good tastethat particular mental atmosphere mysteriously inevitably woven round the soul by the conditions of special breeding and special life if then this affair were real it was sordid and if it were sordid it was repellent to suppose that her family could be mixed up in it but her people were mixed up in it therefore it must benonsense  so the matter rested until thyme came back from her visit to her grandfather and told them of the little models new and pretty clothes when she detailed this news they were all sitting at dinner over the ordering of which cecilias loyalty had been taxed till her little headache came so that there might be nothing too conventional to overnourish stephen or so essentially aesthetic as not to nourish him at all the man servant being in the room they neither of them raised their eyes but when he was gone to fetch the bird each found the other looking furtively across the table by some queer misfortune the word sordid had leaped into their minds again who had given her those clothes but feeling that it was sordid to pursue this thought they looked away and eating hastily began pursuing it being man and woman they naturally took a different line of chase cecilia hunting in one grove and stephen in another  thus ran stephens pack of meditations  if old hilary has been giving her money and clothes and that sort of thing hes either a greater duffer than i took him for or theres something in it bs got herself to thank but that wont help to keep hughs quiet he wants money i expect oh damn  cecilias pack ran other ways  i know the girl cant have bought those things out of her proper earnings i believe shes a really bad lot i dont like to think it but it must be so hilary cant have been so stupid after what i said to him if she really is bad it simplifies things very much but hilary is just the sort of man who will never believe it oh dear  it was to be quite fair immensely difficult for stephen and his wifeor any of their class and circlein spite of genuinely good intentions to really feel the existence of their shadows except in so far as they saw them on the pavements they knew that these people lived because they saw them but they did not feel itwith such extraordinary care had the web of social life been spun they were and were bound to be as utterly divorced from understanding of or faith in all that shadowy life as those shadows in their bystreets were from knowledge or belief that gentlefolk really existed except in so far as they had money from them  stephen and cecilia and their thousands knew these shadows as the people knew them as slums as districts as sweated industries of different sorts of workers knew them in the capacity of persons performing odd jobs for them but as human beings possessing the same faculties and passions with themselves they did not could not know them the reason the long reason extending back through generations was so plain so very simple that it was never mentionedin their heart of hearts where there was no room for cant they knew it to be just a little matter of the senses they knew that whatever they might say whatever money they might give or time devote their hearts could never open unlessunless they closed their ears and eyes and noses this little fact more potent than all the teaching of philosophers than every act of parliament and all the sermons ever preached reigned paramount supreme it divided class from class man from his shadowas the great underlying law had set dark apart from light  on this little fact too gross to mention they and their kind had in secret built and built till it was not too much to say that laws worship trade and every art were based on it if not in theory then in fact for it must not be thought that those eyes were dull or that nose plainno no those eyes could put two and two together that nose of myriad fancy could imagine countless things unsmelled which must lie behind a state of life not quite its own it could create as from the scent of an old slipper dogs create their masters  so stephen and cecilia sat and their butler brought in the bird it was a nice one nourished down in surrey and as he cut it into portions the butlers soul turned sick within himnot because he wanted some himself or was a vegetarian or for any sort of principle but because he was by natural gifts an engineer and deadly tired of cutting up and handing birds to other people and watching while they ate them without a glimmer of expression on his face he put the portions down before the persons who having paid him to do so could not tell his thoughts  that same night after working at a report on the present laws of bankruptcy which he was then drawing up stephen entered the joint apartment with excessive caution having first made all his dispositions and stealing to the bed slipped into it he lay there offering himself congratulations that he had not awakened cecilia and cecilia who was wide awake knew by his unwonted carefulness that he had come to some conclusion which he did not wish to impart to her devoured therefore by disquiet she lay sleepless till the clock struck two  the conclusion to which stephen had come was this having twice gone through the factshilarys corporeal separation from bianca communicated to him by cecilia cause unknowable hilarys interest in the little model cause unknown her known poverty her employment by mr stone her tenancy of mrs hughs room the latters outburst to cecilia hughs threat and finally the girls pretty clotheshe had summed it up as just a common plant to which his brothers possibly innocent but in any case imprudent conduct had laid him open it was a mans affair he resolutely tried to look on the whole thing as unworthy of attention to feel that nothing would occur he failed dismally for three reasons first his inherent love of regularity of having everything in proper order secondly his ingrained mistrust of and aversion from bianca thirdly his unavowed conviction for all his wish to be sympathetic to them that the lower classes always wanted something out of you it was a question of how much they would want and whether it were wise to give them anything he decided that it would not be wise at all what then impossible to say it worried him he had a natural horror of any sort of scandal and he was very fond of hilary if only he knew the attitude bianca would take up he could not even guess it  thus on that saturday afternoon the 4th of may he felt for once such a positive aversion from the reading of reviews as men will feel from their usual occupations when their nerves have been disturbed he stayed late at chambers and came straight home outside an omnibus  the tide of life was flowing in the town the streets were awash with wave on wave of humanity sucked into a thousand crossing currents here men and women were streaming out from the meeting of a religious congress there streaming in at the gates of some social function like bright water confined within long shelves of rock and dyed with myriad scales of shifting colour they thronged rotten row and along the closed shopfronts were woven into an inextricable network of little human runlets and everywhere amongst this sea of men and women could be seen their shadows meandering like streaks of grey slime stirred up from the lower depths by some huge neverceasing finger the innumerable roar of that human sea climbed out above the roofs and trees and somewhere in illimitable space blended and slowly reached the meetingpoint of sound and silencethat heart where life leaving its little forms and barriers clasps death and from that clasp springs forth newformed within new barriers  above this crowd of his fellowcreatures stephen drove and the same spring wind which had made the elmtrees talk whispered to him and tried to tell him of the million flowers it had fertilised the million leaves uncurled the million ripples it had awakened on the sea of the million flying shadows flung by it across the downs and how into mens hearts its scent had driven a million longings and sweet pains  it was but moderately successful for stephen like all men of culture and neat habits took nature only at those moments when he had gone out to take her and of her wild heart he had a secret fear  on his own doorstep he encountered hilary coming out  i ran across thyme and martin in the gardens the latter said thyme brought me back to lunch and here ive been ever since  did she bring our young sanitist in too asked stephen dubiously  no said hilary  good that young man gets on my nerves taking his elder brother by the arm he added will you come in again old boy or shall we go for a stroll  a stroll said hilary  though different enough perhaps because they were so different these two brothers had the real affection for each other which depends on something deeper and more elementary than a similarity of sentiments and is permanent because unconnected with the reasoning powers  it depended on the countless times they had kissed and wrestled as tiny boys slept in small beds alongside refusedto tell about each other and even now and then taken up the burden of each others peccadilloes they might get irritated or tired of being in each others company but it would have been impossible for either to have been disloyal to the other in any circumstances because of that traditional loyalty which went back to their cribs  preceded by miranda they walked along the flower walk towards the park talking of indifferent things though in his heart each knew well enough what was in the others  stephen broke through the hedge  cis has been telling me he said that this man hughs is making trouble of some sort  hilary nodded  stephen glanced a little anxiously at his brothers face it struck him as looking different neither so gentle nor so impersonal as usual  hes a ruffian isnt he  i cant tell you hilary answered probably not  he must be old chap murmured stephen then with a friendly pressure of his brothers arm he added look here old boy can i be of any use  in what asked hilary  stephen took a hasty mental view of his position he had been in danger of letting hilary see that he suspected him frowning slightly and with some colour in his cleanshaven face he said  of course theres nothing in it  in what said hilary again  in what this ruffian says  no said hilary theres nothing in it though what there may be if people give me credit for what there isnt is another thing  stephen digested this remark which hurt him he saw that his suspicions had been fathomed and this injured his opinion of his own diplomacy  you mustnt lose your head old man he said at last  they were crossing the bridge over the serpentine on the bright waters below young clerks were sculling their inamoratas up and down the ripples set free by their oars gleamed beneath the sun and ducks swam lazily along the banks hilary leaned over  look here stephen i take an interest in this childshes a helpless sort of little creature and she seems to have put herself under my protection i cant help that but thats all do you understand  this speech produced a queer turmoil in stephen as though his brother had accused him of a petty view of things feeling that he must justify himself somehow he began  oh of course i understand old boy but dont think anyway that i should care a damni mean as far as im concernedeven if you had gone as far as ever you liked considering what you have to put up with what im thinking of is the general situation  by this clear statement of his point of view stephen felt he had put things back on a broad basis and recovered his position as a man of liberal thought he too leaned over looking at the ducks there was a silence then hilary said  if bianca wont get that child into some fresh place i shall  stephen looked at his brother in surprise amounting almost to dismay he had spoken with such unwonted resolution  my dear old chap he said i wouldnt go to b women are so funny  hilary smiled stephen took this for a sign of restored impersonality  ill tell you exactly how the thing appeals to me itll be much better for you to chuck it altogether let cis see to it  hilarys eyes became bright with angry humour  many thanks he said but this is entirely our affair  stephen answered hastily  thats exactly what makes it difficult for you to look at it all round that fellow hughs could make himself quite nasty i wouldnt give him any sort of chance i mean to saygiving the girl clothes and that kind of thing  i see said hilary  you know old man stephen went on hastily i dont think youll get bianca to look at things in your light if you were onon terms of course it would be different i mean the girl you know is rather attractive in her way  hilary roused himself from contemplation of the ducks and they moved on towards the powder magazine stephen carefully abstained from looking at his brother the respect he had for hilaryresult perhaps of the latters seniority perhaps of the feeling that hilary knew more of him than he of hilarywas beginning to assert itself in a way he did not like with every word too of this talk the ground instead of growing firmer felt less and less secure hilary spoke  you mistrust my powers of action  no no said stephen i dont want you to act at all  hilary laughed hearing that rather bitter laugh stephen felt a little ache about his heart  come old boy he said we can trust each other anyway  hilary gave his brothers arm a squeeze  moved by that pressure stephen spoke  i hate you to be worried over such a rotten business  the whizz of a motorcar rapidly approaching them became a sort of roar and out of it a voice shouted how are you a hand was seen to rise in salute it was mr purcey driving his ai damyer back to wimbledon before him in the sunlight a little shadow fled behind him the reek of petrol seemed to darken the road  theres a symbol for you muttered hilary  how do you mean said stephen dryly the word symbol was distasteful to him  the machine in the middle moving on its business shadows like you and me skipping in front oil and usedup stuff dropping behind societybody beak and bones  stephen took time to answer thats rather farfetched he said you mean these hughs and people are the droppings  quite so was hilarys sardonic answer theres the body of that fellow and his car between our sort and themand no getting over it stevie  well who wants to if youre thinking of our old friends fraternity im not taking any and stephen suddenly added look here i believe this affair is all a plant  you see that powder magazine said hilary well this business that you call a plant is more like that i dont want to alarm you but i think you as well as our young friend martin are inclined to underrate the emotional capacity of human nature  disquietude broke up the customary mask on stephens face i dont understand he stammered  well were none of us machines not even amateurs like menot even underdogs like hughs i fancy you may find a certain warmth not to say violence about this business i tell you frankly that i dont live in married celibacy quite with impunity i cant answer for anything in fact you had better stand clear stephenthats all  stephen marked his thin hands quivering and this alarmed him as nothing else had done  they walked on beside the water stephen spoke quietly looking at the ground how can i stand clear old man if you are going to get into a mess thats impossible  he saw at once that this shot which indeed was from his heart had gone right home to hilarys he sought within him how to deepen the impression  you mean a lot to us he said cis and thyme would feel it awfully if you and b he stopped  hilary was looking at him that faintly smiling glance searching him through and through suddenly made stephen feel inferior he had been detected trying to extract capital from the effect of his little piece of brotherly love he was irritated at his brothers insight  i have no right to give advice i suppose he said but in my opinion you should drop itdrop it dead the girl is not worth your looking after turn her over to that societymrs tallents smallpeaces thing whatever its called  at a sound as of mirth stephen who was not accustomed to hear his brother laugh looked round  martin said hilary also wants the case to be treated on strictly hygienic grounds  nettled by this stephen answered  dont confound me with our young sanitist please i simply think there are probably a hundred things you dont know about the girl which ought to be cleared up  and then  then said stephen they coulderdeal with her accordingly  hilary shrank so palpably at this remark that he added rather hastily  you call that coldblooded i suppose but i think you know old chap that youre too sensitive  hilary stopped rather abruptly  if you dont mind stevie he said well part here i want to think it over so saying he turned back and sat down on a seat that faced the sun     chapter xviii  the perfect dog  hilary sat long in the sun watching the pale bright waters and many wellbred ducks circling about the shrubs searching with their round bright eyes for worms between the bench where he was sitting and the spiked iron railings people passed continuallymen women children of all kinds every now and then a duck would stop and cast her knowing glance at these creatures as though comparing the condition of their forms and plumage with her own if i had had the breeding of you she seemed to say i could have made a better fist of it than that a worselooking lot of ducks take you all round i never wish to see and with a quick but heavy movement of her shoulders she would turn away and join her fellows  hilary however got small distraction from the ducks the situation gradually developing was something of a dilemma to a man better acquainted with ideas than facts with the trimming of words than with the shaping of events he turned a queer perplexed almost quizzical eye on it stephen had irritated him profoundly he had such a way of pettifying things yet in truth the affair would seem ridiculous enough to an ordinary observer what would a man of sound common sense like mr purcey think of it why not as stephen had suggested drop it here however hilary approached the marshy ground of feeling  to give up befriending a helpless girl the moment he found himself personally menaced was exceedingly distasteful but would she be friendless were there not in stephens words a hundred things he did not know about her had she not other resources had she not a story but here too he was hampered by his delicacy one did not pry into the private lives of others  the matter too was hopelessly complicated by the domestic troubles of the hughs family no conscientious manand whatever hilary lacked no one ever accused him of a lack of consciencecould put aside that aspect of the case  wandering among these reflections were his thoughts about bianca she was his wife however he might feel towards her now whatever their relations he must not put her in a false position far from wishing to hurt her he desired to preserve her and everyone from trouble and annoyance he had told stephen that his interest in the girl was purely protective but since the night when leaning out into the moonlight he heard the waggons coming in to covent garden market a strange feeling had possessed himthe sensation of a man who lies with a touch of fever on him listening to the thrum of distant musicsensuous not unpleasurable  those who saw him sitting there so quietly with his face resting on his hand imagined no doubt that he was wrestling with some deep abstract proposition some great thought to be given to mankind for there was that about hilary which forced everyone to connect him instantly with the humaner arts  the sun began to leave the long pale waters  a nursemaid and two children came and sat down beside him then it was that underneath his seat miranda found what she had been looking for all her life it had no smell made no movement was palegrey in colour like herself it had no hair that she could find its tail was like her own it took no liberties was silent had no passions committed her to nothing standing a few inches from its head closer than she had ever been of her free will to any dog she smelt its smellessness with a long delicious snuffling wrinkling up the skin on her forehead and through her upturned eyes her little moonlight soul looked forth how unlike you are she seemed to say to all the other dogs i know i would love to live with you shall i ever find a dog like you again the lateststerilised clothsee white label underneath 4s 3d suddenly she slithered out her slender greypink tongue and licked its nose the creature moved a little way and stopped miranda saw that it had wheels she lay down close to it for she knew it was the perfect dog  hilary watched the little moonlight lady lying vigilant affectionate beside this perfect dog who could not hurt her she panted slightly and her tongue showed between her lips presently behind his seat he saw another idyll a thin white spaniel had come running up she lay down in the grass quite close and three other dogs who followed sat and looked at her a poor dirty little thing she was who seemed as if she had not seen a home for days her tongue lolled out she panted piteously and had no collar every now and then she turned her eyes but though they were so tired and desperate there was a gleam in them for all its thirst and hunger and exhaustion this is life they seemed to say the three dogs panting too and watching till it should be her pleasure to begin to run again seemed with their moist loving eyes to echo this is life  because of this idyll people near were moving on  and suddenly the thin white spaniel rose and like a little harried ghost slipped on amongst the trees and the three dogs followed her     chapter xix  bianca  in her studio that afternoon blanca stood before her picture of the little modelthe figure with parted palered lips and haunting paleblue eyes gazing out of shadow into lamplight  she was frowning as though resentful of a piece of work which had the power to kill her other pictures what force had moved her to paint like that what had she felt while the girl was standing before her still as some pale flower placed in a cup of water not lovethere was no love in the presentment of that twilight figure not hatethere was no hate in the painting of her dim appeal yet in the picture of this shadow girl between the gloom and glimmer was visible a spirit driving the artist on to create that which had the power to haunt the mind  blanca turned away and went up to a portrait of her husband painted ten years before she looked from one picture to the other with eyes as hard and stabbing as the points of daggers  in the more poignant relationships of human life there is a point beyond which men and women do not quite truthfully analyse their feelingsthey feel too much it was blancas fortune too to be endowed to excess with that quality which of all others most obscures the real significance of human issues her pride had kept her back from hilary till she had felt herself a failure her pride had so revolted at that failure that she had led the way to utter estrangement her pride had forced her to the attitude of one who says live your own life i should be ashamed to let you see that i care what happens between us her pride had concealed from her the fact that beneath her veil of mocking liberality there was an essential woman tenacious of her dues avid of affection and esteem her pride prevented the world from guessing that there was anything amiss her pride even prevented hilary from really knowing what had spoiled his married lifethis ungovernable itch to be appreciated governed by ungovernable pride hundreds of times he had been baffled by the hedge round that disharmonic nature with each failure something had shrivelled in him till the very roots of his affection had dried up she had worn out a man who to judge from his actions and appearance was naturally longsuffering to a fault beneath all manner of kindness and consideration for each otherfor their good taste at all events had never given waythis tragedy of a woman who wanted to be loved slowly killing the power of loving her in the man had gone on year after year it had ceased to be tragedy as far as hilary was concerned the nerve of his love for her was quite dead slowly frozen out of him it was still active tragedy with bianca the nerve of whose jealous desire for his appreciation was not dead her instinct too ironically informed her that had he been a man with some brutality a man who had set himself to ride and master her instead of one too delicate he might have trampled down the hedge this gave her a secret grudge against him a feeling that it was not she who was to blame  pride was biancas fate her flavour and her charm like a shadowy hillside behind glamorous bars of waning sunlight she was enveloped in smiling pridemysterious one thinks even to herself this pride of hers took part even in her many generous impulses kind actions which she did rather secretly and scoffed at herself for doing she scoffed at herself continually even for putting on dresses of colours which hilary was fond of she would not admit her longing to attract him  standing between those two pictures pressing her mahlstick against her bosom she suggested somewhat the image of an italian saint forcing the dagger of martyrdom into her heart  that other person who had once brought the thought of italy into cecilias mindthe man hughshad been for the last eight hours or so walking the streets placing in a cart the refuses of life nor had he at all suggested the aspect of one tortured by the passions of love and hate for the first two hours he had led the horse without expression of any sort on his dark face his neat soldiers figure garbed in the costume which had made westminister describe him as a dreadful foreignlookin man now and then he had spoken to the horse save for those speeches of no great importance he had been silent for the next two hours following the cart he had used a shovel and still his square short face with little black moustache and still blacker eyes had given no sign of conflict in his breast so he had passed the day apart from the fact indeed that men of any kind are not too given to expose private passions to public gaze the circumstances of a life devoted from the age of twenty onwards to the service of his country first as a soldier now in the more defensive part of vestry scavenger had given him a kind of gravity life had cloaked him with passivitythe normal look of men whose bread and cheese depends on their not caring much for anything had hughs allowed his inclinations play or sought to express himself he could hardly have been a private soldier still less on his retirement from that office with an honourable wound would he have been selected out of many others as a vestry scavenger for such an occupation as the lifting from the streets of the refuses of lifea calling greatly sought after and indeed one of the few open to a man who had served his countrycharm of manner individuality or the engaging quality of selfexpression were perhaps out of place  he had never been trained in the voicing of his thoughts and ever since he had been wounded felt at times a kind of desperate looseness in his head it was not therefore remarkable that he should be liable to misconstruction more especially by those who had nothing in common with him except that somewhat negligible factor common humanity the dallisons had misconstrued him as much as but no more than he had misconstrued them when as westminister had informed hilary he went on against the gentry he was in fact a ragged screen a broken vessel that let light through its holes a glass or two of beer the fumes of which his wounded head no longer dominated and he at once became dreadful foreign unfortunately it was his custom on finishing his work to call at the green glory on this particular afternoon the glass had become three and in sallying forth he had felt a confused sense of duty urging him to visit the house where this girl for whom he had conceived his strange infatuation carried on her games the notalebearing tradition of a soldier fought hard with this sense of duty his feelings were mixed when he rang the bell and asked for mrs dallison habit however masked his face and he stood before her at attention his black eyes lowered clutching his peaked cap  blanca noted curiously the scar on the left side of his cropped black head  whatever hughs had to say was not said easily  ive come he began at last in a dogged voice to let you know i never wanted to come into this house i never wanted to see no one  blanca could see his lips and eyelids quivering in a way strangely out of keeping with his general stolidity  my wife has told you tales of me i suppose shes told you i knock her about i daresay i dont care what she tells you or any o the people that she works for but this ill say i never touched her but she touched me first look here thats marks of hers and drawing up his sleeve he showed a scratch on his sinewy tattooed forearm ive not come here about her thats no business of anyones  bianca turned towards her pictures well she said but what have you come about please you see im busy  hughs face changed its stolidity vanished the eyes became as quick passionate and leaping as a dark torrent he was more violently alive than she had ever seen a man had it been a woman she would have feltas cecilia had felt with mrs hughsthe indecency the impudence of this exhibition but from that male violence the feminine in her derived a certain satisfaction so in spring when all seems lowering and grey the hedges and trees suddenly flare out against the purple clouds their twigs all in flame the next moment that white glare is gone the clouds are no longer purple fiery light no longer quivers and leaps along the hedgerows the passion in hughs face was gone as soon bianca felt a sense of disappointment as though she could have wished her life held a little more of that he stole a glance at her out of his dark eyes which when narrowed had a velvety look like the body of a wild bee then jerked his thumb at the picture of the little model  its about her i come to speak  blanca faced him frigidly  i have not the slightest wish to hear  hughs looked round as though to find something that would help him to proceed his eyes lighted on hilarys portrait  ah id put the two together if i was you he said  blanca walked past him to the door  either you or i must leave the room  the mans face was neither sullen now nor passionate but simply miserable  look here lady he said dont take it hard o me coming here im not out to do you a harm ive got a wife of my own and gawd knows ive enough to put up with from her about this girl ill be going in the water one of these days its him giving her them clothes that set me coming here  blanca opened the door please go she said  ill go quiet enough he muttered and hanging his head walked out  having seen him through the side door out into the street blanca went back to where she had been standing before he came she found some difficulty in swallowing for once there was no armour on her face she stood there a long time without moving then put the pictures back into their places and went down the little passage to the house listening outside her fathers door she turned the handle quietly and went in  mr stone holding some sheets of paper out before him was dictating to the little model who was writing laboriously with her face close above her arm she stopped at blancas entrance mr stone did not stop but holding up his other hand said  i will take you through the last three pages again follow  blanca sat down at the window  her fathers voice so thin and slow with each syllable disjointed from the other rose like monotony itself  there were traceaable indeed in those days certain rudimentary attempts to fuse the classes  it went on unwavering neither rising high nor falling low as though the reader knew he had yet far to go like a runner that brings great news across mountains plains and rivers  to blanca that thin voice might have been the customary sighing of the wind her attention was so fast fixed on the girl who sat following the words down the pages with her pens point  mr stone paused  have you got the word insane he asked  the little model raised her face yes mr stone  strike it out  with his eyes fixed on the trees he stood breathing audibly the little model moved her fingers freeing them from cramp blancas curious smiling scrutiny never left her as though trying to fix an indelible image on her mind there was something terrifying in that stare cruel to herself cruel to the girl  the precise word said mr stone eludes me leave a blank follow neither that sweet fraternal interest of man in man nor a curiosity in phenomena merely as phenomena his voice pursued its tenuous path through spaces frozen by the calm eternal presence of his beloved idea which like a golden moon far and cold presided glamorously above the thin track of words and still the girls penpoint traced his utterance across the pages mr stone paused again and looking at his daughter as though surprised to see her sitting there asked  do you wish to speak to me my dear  blanca shook her head  follow said mr stone  but the little models glance had stolen round to meet the scrutiny fixed on her  a look passed across her face which seemed to say what have i done to you that you should stare at me like this  furtive and fascinated her eyes remained fixed on bianca while her hand moved mechanically ticking the paragraphs that silent duel of eyes went onthe womans fixed cruel smiling the girls uncertain resentful neither of them heard a word that mr stone was reading they treated it as from the beginning life has treated philosophyand to the end will treat it  mr stone paused again seeming to weigh his last sentences  that i think he murmured to himself is true and suddenly he addressed his daughter do you agree with me my dear  he was evidently waiting with anxiety for her answer and the little silver hairs that straggled on his lean throat beneath his beard were clearly visible  yes father i agree  ah said mr stone i am glad that you confirm me i was anxious follow  bianca rose burning spots of colour had settled in her cheeks she went towards the door and the little model pursued her figure with a long look cringing mutinous and wistful     chapter xx  the husband and the wife  it was past six oclock when hilary at length reached home preceded a little by miranda who almost felt within her the desire to eat the lilac bushes not yet in flower were giving forth spicy fragrance the sun still netted their top boughs as with golden silk and a blackbird seated on a low branch of the acaciatree was summoning the evening mr stone accompanied by the little model dressed in her new clothes was coming down the path they were evidently going for a walk for mr stone wore his hat old and soft and black with a strong green tinge and carried a paper parcel which leaked crumbs of bread at every step  the girl grew very red she held her head down as though afraid of hilarys inspection of her new clothes at the gate she suddenly looked up his face said yes you look very nice and into her eyes a look leaped such as one may see in dogs eyes lifted in adoration to their masters faces manifestly disconcerted hilary turned to mr stone the old man was standing very still a thought had evidently struck him i have not i think he said given enough consideration to the question whether force is absolutely or only relatively evil if i saw a man illtreat a cat should i be justified in striking him  accustomed to such divagations hilary answered i dont know whether you would be justifed but i believe that you would strike him  i am not sure said mr stone we are going to feed the birds  the little model took the paper bag its all dropping out she said from across the road she turned her headwont you come too she seemed to say  but hilary passed rather hastily into the garden and shut the gate behind him he sat in his study with miranda near him for fully an hour without doing anything whatever sunk in a strange halfpleasurable torpor at this hour he should have been working at his book and the fact that his idleness did not trouble him might well have given him uneasiness many thoughts passed through his mind imaginings of things he had thought left behind foreversensations and longings which to the normal eye of middle age are but dried forms hung in the museum of memory they started up at the whip of the stillliving youth the lost wildness at the heart of every man like the reviving flame of halfspent fires longing for discovery leaped and flickered in hilaryto find out once again what things were like before he went down the hill of age  no trivial ghost was beckoning him it was the ghost with unseen face and rosy finger which comes to men when youth has gone  miranda hearing him so silent rose at this hour it was her masters habit to scratch paper she who seldom scratched anything because it was not delicate felt dimly that this was what he should be doing she held up a slim foot and touched his knee receiving no discouragement she delicately sprang into his lap and forgetting for once her modesty placed her arms on his chest and licked his face all over  it was while receiving this embrace that hilary saw mr stone and the little model returning across the garden the old man was walking very rapidly holding out the fragment of a broken stick he was extremely pink  hilary went to meet them  whats the matter sir he said  i cut him over the legs said mr stone i do not regret it and he walked on to his room  hilary turned to the little model  it was a little dog the man kicked it and mr stone hit him he broke his stick there were several men they threatened us she looked up at hilary ii was frightened oh mr dallison isnt he funny  all heroes are funny murmured hilary  he wanted to hit them again after his stick was broken then a policeman came and they all ran away  that was quite as it should be said hilary and what did you do  perceiving that she had not as yet made much effect the little model cast down her eyes  i shouldnt have been frightened if you had been there  heavens muttered hilary mr stone is far more valiant than i  i dont think he is she replied stubbornly and again looked up at him  well goodnight said hilary hastily you must run off  that same evening driving with his wife back from a long dull dinner hilary began  ive something to say to you  an ironic yes came from the other corner of the cab  there is some trouble with the little model  really  this man hughs has become infatuated with her he has even said i believe that he was coming to see you  what about  me  and what is he going to say about you  i dont know some vulgar gossipnothing true  there was a silence and in the darkness hilary moistened his dry lips  bianca spoke may i ask how you knew of this  cecilia told me  a curious noise like a little strangled laugh fell on hilarys ears  i am very sorry he muttered  presently bianca said  it was good of you to tell me considering that we go our own ways what made you  i thought it right  andof course the man might have come to me  that you need not have said  one does not always say what one ought  i have made the child a present of some clothes which she badly needed so far as i know thats all ive done  of course  this wonderful of course acted on hilary like a tonic he said dryly  what do you wish me to do  i no gust of the east wind making the young leaves curl and shiver the gas jets flare and die down in their lamps could so have nipped the flower of amity through hilarys mind flashed stephens almost imploring words oh i wouldnt go to her women are so funny  he looked round a blue gauze scarf was wrapped over his wifes dark head there in her corner as far away from him as she could get she was smiling for a moment hilary had the sensation of being stiffed by fold on fold of that blue gauze scarf as if he were doomed to drive for ever suffocated by the side of this woman who had killed his love for her  you will do what you like of course she said suddenly  a desire to laugh seized hilary what do you wish me to do you will do what you like of course could civilised restraint and tolerance go further  b he said with an effort the wife is jealous we put the girl into that housewe ought to get her out  blancas reply came slowly  from the first she said the girl has been your property do what you like with her i shall not meddle  i am not in the habit of regarding people as my property  no need to tell me thati have known you twenty years  doors sometimes slam in the minds of the mildest and most restrained of men  oh very well i have told you you can see hughs when he comesor not as you like  i have seen him  hilary smiled  well was his story very terrible  he told me no story  how was that  blanca suddenly sat forward and threw back the blue scarf as though she too were stifling in her flushed face her eyes were bright as stars her lips quivered  is it likely she said that i should listen thats enough please of these people  hilary bowed the cab bearing them fast home turned into the last short cut this narrow street was full of men and women circling round barrows and lighted booths the sound of coarse talk and laughter floated out into air thick with the reek of paraffin and the scent of frying fish in every couple of those men and women hilary seemed to see the hughs that other married couple going home to wedded happiness above the little models head the cab turned out of the gay alley  enough please of these people  that same night past one oclock he was roused from sleep by hearing bolts drawn back he got up hastened to the window and looked out at first he could distinguish nothing the moonless night like a dark bird had nested in the garden the sighing of the lilac bushes was the only sound then dimly just below him on the steps of the front door he saw a figure standing  who is that he called  the figure did not move  who are you said hilary again  the figure raised its face and by the gleam of his white beard hilary knew that it was mr stone  what is it sir he said can i do anything  no answered mr stone i am listening to the wind it has visited everyone tonight and lifting his hand he pointed out into the darkness     chapter xxi  a day of rest  cecilias house in the old square was steeped from roof to basement in the peculiar atmosphere brought by sunday to houses whose inmates have no need of religion or of rest  neither she nor stephen had been to church since thyme was christened they did not expect to go again till she was married and they felt that even to go on these occasions was against their principles but for the sake of other peoples feelings they had made the sacrifice and they meant to make it once more when the time came each sunday therefore everything tried to happen exactly as it happened on every other day with indifferent success this was because for all cecilias resolutions a joint of beef and yorkshire pudding would appear on the luncheontable notwithstanding the fact that mr stonewho came when he remembered that it was sundaydid not devour the higher mammals every week when it appeared cecilia who for some reason carved on sundays regarded it with a frown next week she would really discontinue it but when next week came there it was with its complexion that reminded her so uncomfortably of cabmen and she would partake of it with unexpected heartiness something very old and deep some horrible wholehearted appetite derived no doubt from mr justice carfax rose at that hour precisely every week to master her having given thyme the second helping which she invariably took cecilia who detested carving would look over the fearful joint at a piece of glass procured by her in venice and at the daffodils standing upright in it apparently without support had it not been for this joint of beef which had made itself smelt all the morning and would make itself felt all the afternoon it need never have come into her mind at all that it was sundayand she would cut herself another slice  to have told cecilia that there was still a strain of the puritan in her would have been to occasion her some uneasiness and provoked a strenuous denial yet her way of observing sunday furnished indubitable evidence of this singular fact she did more that day than any other for in the morning she invariably cleared off her correspondence at lunch she carved the beef after lunch she cleared off the novel or book on social questions she was reading went to a concert clearing off a call on the way back and on first sundaysa great borestayed at home to clear off the friends who came to visit her in the evening she went to some play or other produced by societies for the benefit of persons compelled like her to keep a sunday with which they felt no sympathy  on this particular first sunday having made the circuit of her drawingroom which extended the whole breadth of her house and through long low windows cut into leaded panes looked out both back and front she took up mr balladyces latest book she sat with her paperknife pressed against the tiny hollow in her flushed cheek and pretty little bits of lace and real old jewellery nestling close to her and while she turned the pages of mr balladyces book thyme sat opposite in a bright blue frock and turned the pages of darwins work on earthworms  regarding her little daughter who was so much more solid than herself cecilias face wore a very sweet faintly surprised expression  my kitten is a bonny thing it seemed to say it is queer that i should have a thing so large  outside in the square gardens a shower the sunlight and blossoms were entangled it was the time of year when all the world had kittens young things were everywheresoft sweet uncouth cecilia felt this in her heart it brought depth into her bright quick eyes what a secret satisfaction it was that she had once so far committed herself as to have borne a child what a queer vague feeling she sometimes experienced in the springalmost amounting to a desire to bear another so one may mark the warm eye of a staid mare following with her gaze the first strayings of her foal i must get used to it she seems to say i certainly do miss the little creature though i used to threaten her with my hoofs to show i couldnt be bullied by anything of that age and there she goes ah well  remembering suddenly however that she was sitting there to clear off mr balladyce because it was so necessary to keep up with what he wrote cecilia dropped her gaze to the page before her and instantly by uncomfortable chance not the choice pastures of mr balladyce appeared where women might browse at leisure but a vision of the little model she had not thought of her for quite an hour she had tired herself out with thinkingnot indeed of her but of all that hinged on her ever since stephen had spoken of his talk with hilary things hilary had said seemed to cecilias delicate and rather timid soul so ominous so unlike himself was there really going to be complete disruption between him and biancaworse an ugly scandal she who knew her sister better perhaps than anyone remembered from schoolroom days biancas moody violence when anything had occurred to wound herremembered too the long fits of brooding that followed this affair which she had tried to persuade herself was exaggerated loomed up larger than ever it was not an isolated squib it was a lighted match held to a train of gunpowder this girl of the people coming from who knew where destined for who knew whatthis young not very beautiful not even clever child with nothing but a sort of queer haunting naivete to give her charmmight even be a finger used by fate cecilia sat very still before that sudden vision of the girl there was no staid mare to guard that foal with the dark devotion of her eye there was no wise whinnying to answer back those tiny whinnies no long look round to watch the little creature nodding to sleep on its thin trembling legs in the hot sunlight no ears to prick up and hoofs to stamp at the approach of other living things these thoughts passed through cecilias mind and were gone being too far and pale to stay turning the page which she had not been reading she heaved a sigh thyme sighed also  these worms are fearfully interesting she said is anybody coming in this afternoon  mrs tallents smallpeace was going to bring a young man in a signor pozziegregio pozzi or some such name she says he is the coming pianist cecilias face was spiced with faint amusement some strain of her breeding the carfax strain no doubt still heard such names and greeted such proclivities with an inclination to derision  thyme snatched up her book well she said i shall be in the attic if anyone interesting comes you might send up to me  she stood luxuriously stretching and turning slowly round in a streak of sunlight so as to bathe her body in it then with a long soft yawn she flung up her chin till the sun streamed on her face her eyelashes rested on cheeks already faintly browned her lips were parted little shivers of delight ran down her her chestnut hair glowed burnished by the kisses of the sun  ah cecilia thought if that other girl were like this now i could understand well enough  oh lord said thyme there they are she flew towards the door  my dear murmured cecilia if you must go do please tell father  a minute later mrs tallents smallpeace came in followed by a young man with an interesting pale face and a crop of dusky hair  let us consider for a minute the not infrequent case of a youth cursed with an italian mother and a father of the name of potts who had baptised him william had he emanated from the lower classes he might with impunity have ground an organ under the name of bill but springing from the bourgeoisie and playing chopin at the age of four his friends had been confronted with a problem of no mean difficulty heaven on the threshold of his career had intervened to solve it hovering as it were with one leg raised before the gladiatorial arena of musical london where all were waiting to turn their thumbs down on the figure of the native potts he had received a letter from his mothers birthplace it was inscribed egregio signor pozzi he was saved by the simple inversion of the first two words the substitution of zs for ts without so fortunately making any difference in the sound and the retention of that i all london knew him now to be the rising pianist  he was a quiet wellmannered youth invaluable just then to mrs tallents smallpeace a woman never happy unless slightly leading a genius in strings  cecilia while engaging them to right and left in her halfsympathetic faintly mocking wayas if doubting whether they really wanted to see her or she themheard a word of fear  mr purcey  oh heaven she thought  mr purcey whose ai damyer could be heard outside advanced in his direct and simple way  i thought id give my car a run he said hows your sister and seeing mrs tallents smallpeace he added how do you do we met the other day  we did said mrs tallents smallpeace whose little eyes were sparkling we talked about the poor do you remember  mr purcey a sensitive man if you could get through his skin gave her a shrewd look i dont quite cotton to this woman he seemed saying theres a laugh about her i dont like  ah yesyou were tellin me about them  oh mr purcey but you had heard of them you remember  mr purcey made a movement of his face which caused it to seem all jaw it was a sort of unconscious declaration of a somewhat formidable character so one may see bulldogs those amiable animals suddenly disclose their tenacity  its rather a blue subject he said bluntly  something in cecilia fluttered at those words it was like the saying of a healthy man looking at a box of pills which he did not mean to open why could not she and stephen keep that lid on too and at this moment to her deep astonishment stephen entered she had sent for him it is true but had never expected he would come  his entrance indeed requires explanation  feeling as he said a little off colour stephen had not gone to richmond to play golf he had spent the day instead in the company of his pipe and those ancient coins of which he had the best collection of any man he had ever met his thoughts had wandered from them more than he thought proper to hilary and that girl he had felt from the beginning that he was so much more the man to deal with an affair like this than poor old hilary when therefore thyme put her head into his study and said father mrs tallents smallpeace he had first thought that busybody and then i wonderperhaps id better go and see if i can get anything out of her  in considering stephens attitude towards a woman so firmly embedded in the various social movements of the day it must be remembered that he represented that large class of men who unhappily too cultivated to put aside like mr purcey all blue subjects or deny the need for movements to make them less blue still could not move for fear of being out of order he was also temperamentally distrustful of anything too feminine and mrs tallents smallpeace was undoubtedly extremely feminine her merit in his eyes consisted of her attachment to societies so long as mankind worked through societies stephen who knew the power of rules and minute books did not despair of too little progress being made he sat down beside her and turned the conversation on her chief workthe maids in peril  searching his face with those eyes so like little black bees sipping honey from all the flowers that grew mrs tallents smallpeace said  why dont you get your wife to take an interest in our work  to stephen this question was naturally both unexpected and annoying ones wife being the last person he wished to interest in other peoples movements he kept his head  ah well he said we havent all got a talent for that sort of thing  the voice of mr purcey travelled suddenly across the room  do tell me how do you go to work to worm things out of them  mrs tallents smallpeace prone to laughter bubbled  oh that is such a delicious expression mr purcey i almost think we ought to use it in our report thank you  mr purcey bowed not at all he said  mrs tallents smallpeace turned again to stephen  we have our trained inquirers that is the advantage of societies such as ours so that we dont personally have the unpleasantness some cases do baffle everybody its such very delicate work  you sometimes find you let in a rotter said mr purcey or i should say a rotter lets you in ha ha  mrs tallents smallpeaces eyes flew deliciously down his figure  not often she said and turning rather markedly once more to stephen have you any special case that you are interested in mr dallison  stephen consulted cecilia with one of those masculine halfglances so discreet that mrs tallents smallpeace intercepted it without looking up she found it rather harder to catch cecilias reply but she caught it before stephen did it was youd better wait perhaps conveyed by a tiny raising of the left eyebrow and a slight movement to the right of the lower lip putting two and two together she felt within her bones that they were thinking of the little model and she remembered the interesting moment in the omnibus when that attractivelooking man had got out so hastily  there was no danger whatever from mrs tallents smallpeace feeling anything the circle in which she moved did not now talk scandal or indeed allude to matters of that sort without deep sympathy and in the second place she was really far too good a fellow with far too dear a love of life to interfere with anybody elses love of it at the same time it was interesting  that little model now she said what about her  is that the girl i saw broke in mr purcey with his accustomed shrewdness  stephen gave him the look with which he was accustomed to curdle the blood of persons who gave evidence before commissions  this fellow is impossible he thought  the little black bees flying below mrs tallents smallpeaces dark hair done in the early italian fashion tranquilly sucked honey from stephens face  she seemed to me she answered such a very likely type  ah murmured stephen there would be i suppose a danger and he looked angrily at cecilia  without ceasing to converse with mr purcey and signor egregio pozzi she moved her left eye upwards mrs tallents smallpeace understood this to mean be frank and guarded stephen however interpreted it otherwise to him it signified what the deuce do you look at me for and he felt justly hurt he therefore said abruptly  what would you do in a case like that  mrs tallents smallpeace sliding her face sideways with a really charming little smile asked softly  in a case like what  and her little eyes fled to thyme who had slipped into the room and was whispering to her mother  cecilia rose  you know my daughter she said will you excuse me just a minute im so very sorry she glided towards the door and threw a flying look back it was one of those social moments precious to those who are escaping them  mrs tallents smallpeace was smiling stephen frowning at his boots mr purcey stared admiringly at thyme and thyme sitting very upright was calmly regarding the unfortunate egregio pozzi who apparently could not bring himself to speak  when cecilia found herself outside she stood still a moment to compose her nerves thyme had told her that hilary was in the diningroom and wanted specially to see her  as in most women of her class and bringingup cecilias qualities of reticence and subtlety the delicate treading of her spirit were seen to advantage in a situation such as this unlike stephen who had shown at once that he had something on his mind she received hilary with that exact shade of friendly intimate yet cool affection long established by her as the proper manner towards her husbands brother it was not quite sisterly but it was very nearly so it seemed to say we understand each other as far as it is right and fitting that we should we even sympathise with the difficulties we have each of us experienced in marrying the others sister or brother as the case may be we know the worst and we like to see each other too because there are bars between us which make it almost piquant  giving him her soft little hand she began at once to talk of things farthest from her heart she saw that she was deceiving hilary and this feather in the cap of her subtlety gave her pleasure but her nerves fluttered at once when he said i want to speak to you cis you know that stephen and i had a talk yesterday i suppose  cecilia nodded  i have spoken to b  oh cecilia murmured she longed to ask what bianca had said but did not dare for hilary had his armour on the retired ironical look he always wore when any subject was broached for which he was too sensitive  she waited  the whole thing is distasteful to me he said but i must do something for this child i cant leave her completely in the lurch  cecilia had an inspiration  hilary she said softly mrs tallents smallpeace is in the drawingroom she was just speaking of the girl to stephen wont you come in and arrange with her quietly  hilary looked at his sisterinlaw for a moment without speaking then said  i draw the line there no thank you ill see this through myself  cecilia fluttered out  oh but hilary what do you mean  i am going to put an end to it  it needed all cecilias subtlety to hide her consternation end to what did he mean that he and b were going to separate  i wont have all this vulgar gossip about the poor girl i shall go and find another room for her  cecilia sighed with relief  would youwould you like me to come too hilary  its very good of you said hilary dryly my actions appear to rouse suspicions  cecilia blushed  oh thats absurd still no one could think anything if i come with you hilary have you thought that if she continues coming to father  i shall tell her that she mustnt  cecilias heart gave two thumps the first with pleasure the second with sympathy  it will be horrid for you she said you hate doing anything of that sort  hilary nodded  but im afraid its the only way went on cecilia rather hastily and of course it will be no good saying anything to father one must simply let him suppose that she has got tired of it  again hilary nodded  he will think it very funny murmured cecilia pensively oh and have you thought that taking her away from where she is will only make those people talk the more  hilary shrugged his shoulders  it may make that man furious cecilia added  it will  oh but then of course if you dont see her afterwards they will have nono excuse at all  i shall not see her afterwards said hilary if i can avoid it  cecilia looked at him  its very sweet of you hilary  what is sweet asked hilary stonily  why to take all this trouble is it really necessary for you to do anything but looking in his face she went on hastily yes yes its best lets go at once oh those people in the drawingroom do wait ten minutes  a little later running up to put her hat on she wondered why it was that hilary always made her want to comfort him stephen never affected her like this  having little or no notion where to go they walked in the direction of bayswater to place the park between hound street and the little model was the first essential on arriving at the other side of the broad walk they made instinctively away from every sight of green in a long grey street of dismally respectable appearance they found what they were looking for a bedsitting room furnished advertised on a card in the window the door was opened by the landlady a tall woman of narrow build with a westcountry accent and a rather hungry sweetness running through her hardness they stood talking with her in a passage whose oilcloth of variegated pattern emitted a faint odour the staircase could be seen climbing steeply up past walls covered with a shining paper cut by narrow red lines into small yellow squares an almanack of so floral a design that nobody would surely want to steal it hung on the wall below it was an umbrella stand without umbrellas the dim little passage led past two grimly closed doors painted rusty red to two halfopen doors with dull glass in their panels outside in the street from which they had mounted by stone steps a shower of sleet had begun to fall hilary shut the door but the cold spirit of that shower had already slipped into the bleak narrow house  this is the apartment mm said the landlady opening the first of the rustycoloured doors the room which had a paper of blue roses on a yellow ground was separated from another room by double doors  i let the rooms together sometimes but just now that rooms takena young gentleman in the city thats why im able to let this cheap  cecilia looked at hilary i hardly think  the landlady quickly turned the handles of the doors showing that they would not open  i keep the key she said theres a bolt on both sides  reassured cecilia walked round the room as far as this was possible for it was practically all furniture there was the same little wrinkle across her nose as across thymes nose when she spoke of hound street suddenly she caught sight of hilary he was standing with his back against the door on his face was a strange and bitter look such as a man might have on seeing the face of ugliness herself feeling that she was not only without him but withina universal spirit the look of a man who had thought that he was chivalrous and found that he was not of a leader about to give an order that he would not himself have executed  seeing that look cecilia said with some haste  its all very nice and clean it will do very well i think seven shillings a week i believe you said we will take it for a fortnight at all events  the first glimmer of a smile appeared on the landladys grim face with its hungry eyes sweetened by patience  when would she be coming in she asked  when do you think hilary  i dont know muttered hilary the sooner the betterif it must be tomorrow or the day after  and with one look at the bed covered by a piece of cheap redandyellow tasselled tapestry he went out into the street the shower was over but the house faced north and no sun was shining on it     chapter xxii  hilary puts an end to it  like flies caught among the impalpable and smoky threads of cobwebs so men struggle in the webs of their own natures giving here a start there a pitiful small jerking long sustained and failing into stillness enmeshed they were born enmeshed they die fighting according to their strength to the end to fight in the hope of freedom their joy to die not knowing they are beaten their reward nothing too is more to be remarked than the manner in which life devises for each man the particular dilemmas most suited to his nature that which to the man of gross decided or fanatic turn of mind appears a simple sum to the man of delicate and speculative temper seems to have no answer  so it was with hilary in that special web wherein his spirit struggled sunrise unto sunset and by moonlight afterward inclination and the circumstances of a life which had never forced him to grips with either men or women had detached him from the necessity for giving or taking orders he had almost lost the faculty life had been a picture with blurred outlines melting into a softly shaded whole not for years had anything seemed to him quite a case for yes or no it had been his creed his delight his business too to try and put himself in everybodys place so that now there were but few places where he did not speculatively speaking feel at home  putting himself into the little models place gave him but small delight making due allowance for the sentiment men naturally import into their appreciation of the lives of women his conception of her place was doubtless not so very wrong  here was a child barely twenty years of age country bred neither a lady nor quite a workinggirl without a home or relatives according to her own accountat all events without those who were disposed to help herwithout apparently any sort of friend helpless by nature and whose profession required a more than common warinessthis girl he was proposing to set quite adrift again by cutting through the single slender rope which tethered her it was like digging up a little rosetree planted with ones own hands in some poor shelter just when it had taken root and setting it where the full winds would beat against it to do so brusque and as it seemed to hilary so inhumane a thing was foreign to his nature there was also the little matter of that touch of feverthe distant music he had been hearing since the waggons came in to covent garden  with a feeling that was almost misery therefore he waited for her on monday afternoon walking to and fro in his study where all the walls were white and all the woodwork coloured like the leaf of a cigar where the books were that colour too in hilarys special deerskin binding where there were no flowers nor any sunlight coming through the windows but plenty of sheets of papera room which youth seemed to have left for ever the room of middle age  he called her in with the intention of at once saying what he had to say and getting it over in the fewest words but he had not reckoned fully either with his own nature or with womans instinct nor had he allowedbeing for all his learning perhaps because of it singularly unable to gauge the effects of simple actionsfor the proprietary relations he had established in the girls mind by giving her those clothes  as a dog whose master has it in his mind to go away from him stands gazing up with tragic inquiry in his eyes scenting to his soul that coming crueltyas a dog thus soon to be bereaved so stood the little model  by the pose of every limb and a fixed gaze bright as if tears were behind it and by a sort of trembling she seemed to say i know why you have sent for me  when hilary saw her stand like that he felt as a man might when told to flog his fellowcreature to gain time he asked her what she did with herself all day the little model evidently tried to tell herself that her foreboding had been needless  now that the mornings were niceshe said with some animationshe got up much earlier and did her needlework first thing she then did out the room there were mouseholes in her room and she had bought a trap she had caught a mouse last night she hadnt liked to kill it she had put it in a tin box and let it go when she went out quick to see that hilary was interested in this as well he might be she told him that she could not bear to see cats hungry or lost dogs especially lost dogs and she described to him one that she had seen she had not liked to tell a policeman they stared so hard those words were of strange omen and hilary turned his head away the little model perceiving that she had made an effect of some sort tried to deepen it she had heard they did all sorts of things to peoplebut seeing at once from hilarys face that she was not improving her effect she broke off suddenly and hastily began to tell him of her breakfast of how comfortable she was now she had got her clothes how she liked her room how old mr creed was very funny never taking any notice of her when he met her in the morning then followed a minute account of where she had been trying to get work of an engagement promised mr lennard too still wanted her to pose to him at this she gashed a look at hilary then cast down her eyes she could get plenty of work if she began that way but she hadnt because he had told her not and of course she didnt want to she liked coming to mr stone so much and she got on very well and she liked london and she liked the shops she mentioned neither hughs nor mrs hughs in all this rigmarole told with such obvious purpose stolidity was strangely mingled with almost cunning quickness to see the effect made but the doglike devotion was never quite out of her eyes when they were fixed on hilary  this look got through the weakest places in what little armour nature had bestowed on him it touched one of the least conceited and most amiable of men profoundly he felt it an honour that anything so young as this should regard him in that way he had always tried to keep out of his mind that which might have given him the key to her special feeling for himselfthose words of the painter of still life shes got a story of some sort but it flashed across him suddenly like an inspiration if her story were the simplest of all storiesthe direct rather brutal love affair of a village boy and girlwould not she naturally given to surrender be forced this time to the very antithesis of that young animal amour which had brought on her such sharp consequences  but wherever her devotion came from it seemed to hilary the grossest violation of the feelings of a gentleman to treat it ungratefully yet it was as if for the purpose of saying you are a nuisance to me or worse that he had asked her to his study her presence had hitherto chiefly roused in him the halfamused halftender feelings of one who strokes a foal or calf watching its soft uncouthness now about to say goodbye to her there was the question of whether that was the only feeling  miranda stealing out between her master and his visitor growled  the little model who was stroking a china ashtray with her ungloved inky fingers muttered with a smile half pathetic half cynical she doesnt like me she knows i dont belong here she hates me to come shes jealous  hilary said abruptly  tell me have you made any friends since youve been in london  the girl flashed a look at him that said  could i make you jealous  then as though guilty of afar too daring thought drooped her head and answered  no  not one  the little model repeated almost passionately no i dont want any friends i only want to be let alone  hilary began speaking rapidly  but these hughs have not left you alone i told you i thought you ought to move ive taken another room for you quite away from them leave your furniture with a weeks rent and take your trunk quietly away tomorrow in a cab without saying a word to anyone this is the new address and heres the money for your expenses theyre dangerous for you those people  the little model muttered desperately but i dont care what they do  hilary went on listen you mustnt come here again or the man will trace you we will take care you have whats necessary till you can get other work  the little model looked up at him without a word now that the thin link which bound her to some sort of household gods had snapped all the patience and submission bred in her by village life by the hard facts of her story and by these last months in london served her well enough she made no fuss hilary saw a tear roll down her cheek  he turned his head away and said dont cry my child  quite obediently the little model swallowed the tear a thought seemed to strike her  but i could see you mr dallison couldnt i sometimes  seeing from his face that this was not in the programme she stood silent again looking up at him  it was a little difficult for hilary to say i cant see you because my wife is jealous it was cruel to tell her i dont want to see you besides it was not true  youll soon be making friends he said at last and you can always write to me and with a queer smile he added youre only just beginning life you mustnt take these things to heart youll find plenty of people better able to advise and help you than ever i shall be  the little model answered this by seizing his hand with both of hers she dropped it again at once as if guilty of presumption and stood with her head bent hilary looking down on the little hat which by his special wish contained no feathers felt a lump rise in his throat  its funny he said i dont know your christian name  ivy muttered the little model  ivy well ill write to you but you must promise me to do exactly as i said  the girl looked up her face was almost uglylike a childs in whom a storm of feeling is repressed  promise repeated hilary  with a bitter droop of her lower lip she nodded and suddenly put her hand to her heart that action of which she was clearly unconscious so naively so almost automatically was it done nearly put an end to hilarys determination  now you must go he said  the little model choked grew very red and then quite white  arent i even to say goodbye to mr stone  hilary shook his head  hell miss me she said desperately he will i know he will  so shall i said hilary we cant help that  the little model drew herself up to her full height her breast heaved beneath the clothes which had made her hilarys she was very like the shadow at that moment as though whatever hilary might do there she would bea little ghost the spirit of the helpless submerged world for ever haunting with its dumb appeal the minds of men  give me your hand said hilary  the little model put out her not too white small hand it was soft clinging and as hot as fire  goodbye my dear and bless you  the little model gave him a look with whoknowswhat of reproach in it and faithful to her training went submissively away  hilary did not look after her but standing by the lofty mantelpiece above the ashes of the fire rested his forehead on his arm not even a flys buzzing broke the stillness there was sound for all thatnot of distant music but of blood beating in his ears and temples     chapter xxiii  the book of universal brotherhood  it is fitting that a few words should be said about the writer of the book of universal brotherhood  sylvanus stone having graduated very highly at the london university had been appointed at an early age lecturer to more than one public institution he had soon received the professorial robes due to a man of his profound learning in the natural sciences and from that time till he was seventy his life had flowed on in one continual round of lectures addresses disquisitions and arguments on the subjects in which he was a specialist at the age of seventy long after his wifes death and the marriages of his three children he had for some time been living by himself when a very serious illnessthe result of liberties taken with an iron constitution by a single mindprostrated him  during the long convalescence following this illness the power of contemplation which the professor had up to then given to natural science began to fix itself on life at large but the mind which had made of natural science an idea a passion was not content with vague reflections on life slowly subtly with irresistible centrifugal forcewith a force which perhaps it would not have acquired but for that illnessthe idea the passion of universal brotherhood had sucked into itself all his errant wonderings on the riddle of existence the single mind of this old man divorced by illness from his previous existence pensioned and permanently shelved began to worship a new star that with every week and month and year grew brighter till all other stars had lost their glimmer and died out  at the age of seventyfour he had begun his book under the spell of his subject and of advancing age his extreme inattention to passing matters became rapidly accentuated his figure had become almost too publicly conspicuous before bianca finding him one day seated on the roof of his lonely little topstory flat the better to contemplate his darling universe had inveigled him home with her and installed him in a room in her own house after the first day or two he had not noticed any change to speak of  his habits in his new home were soon formed and once formed they varied not at all for he admitted into his life nothing which took him from the writing of his book  on the afternoon following hilarys dismissal of the little model being disappointed of his amanuensis mr stone had waited for an hour reading his pages over and over to himself he had then done his exercises at the usual time for tea he had sat down and with his cup and brown breadandbutter alternately at his lips had looked long and fixedly at the place where the girl was wont to sit having finished he left the room and went about the house he found no one but miranda who seated in the passage leading to the studio was trying to keep one eye on the absence of her master and the other on the absence of her mistress she joined mr stone maintaining a respectcompelling interval behind him when he went before and before him when he went behind when they had finished hunting mr stone went down to the garden gate here bianca found him presently motionless without a hat in the full sun craning his white head in the direction from which he knew the little model habitually came the mistress of the house was herself returning from her annual visit to the royal academy where she still went as dogs from some perverted sense will go and sniff round other dogs to whom they have long taken a dislike a loosehanging veil depended from her mushroomshaped and coloured hat her eyes were brightened by her visit mr stone soon seemed to take in who she was and stood regarding her a minute without speaking his attitude towards his daughters was rather like that of an old drake towards two swans whom he has inadvertently begottenthere was inquiry in it disapproval admiration and faint surprise  why has she not come he said  bianca winced behind her veil have you asked hilary  i cannot find him answered mr stone something about his patient stooping figure and white head on which the sunlight was falling made bianca slip her hand through his arm  come in dad ill do your copying  mr stone looked at her intently and shook his head  it would be against my principles i cannot take an unpaid service but if you would come my dear i should like to read to you it is stimulating  at that request biancas eyes grew dim pressing mr stones shaggy arm against her breast she moved with him towards the house  i think i may have written something that will interest you mr stone said as they went along  i am sure you have bianca murmured  it is universal said mr stone it concerns birth sit at the table i will begin as usual where i left off yesterday  bianca took the little models seat resting her chin on her hand as motionless as any of the statues she had just been viewing it almost seemed as if mr stone were feeling nervous he twice arranged his papers cleared his throat then lifting a sheet suddenly took three steps turned his back on her and began to read  in that slow incessant change of form to form called life men made spasmodic by perpetual action had seized on a certain moment no more intrinsically notable than any other moment and had called it birth this habit of honouring one single instant of the universal process to the disadvantage of all the other instants had done more perhaps than anything to obfuscate the crystal clearness of the fundamental flux as well might such as watch the process of the green unfolding earth emerging from the brumous arms of winter isolate a single day and call it spring in the tides of rhythm by which the change of form to form was governedmr stones voice which had till then been but a thin husky murmur gradually grew louder and louder as though he were addressing a great concoursethe golden universal haze in which men should have flown like bright wingbeats round the sun gave place to the parasitic halo which every man derived from the glorifying of his own nativity to this primary mistake could be traced his intensely personal philosophy slowly but surely there had dried up in his heart the wish to be his brother  he stopped reading suddenly  i see him coming in he said  the next minute the door opened and hilary entered  she has not come said mr stone and bianca murmured  we miss her  her eyes said mr stone have a peculiar look they help me to see into the future i have noticed the same look in the eyes of female dogs  with a little laugh bianca murmured again  that is good  there is one virtue in dogs said hilary which human beings lackthey are incapable of mockery  but biancas lips parted indrawn seemed saying you ask too much i no longer attract you am i to sympathise in the attraction this common little girl has for you  mr stones gaze was fixed intently on the wall  the dog he said has lost much of its primordial character  and moving to his desk he took up his quill pen  hilary and bianca made no sound nor did they look at one another and in this silence so much more full of meaning than any talk the scratching of the quill went on mr stone put it down at last and seeing two persons in the room read  looking back at those days when the doctrine of evolution had reached its pinnacle one sees how the human mind by its habit of continual crystallisations had destroyed all the meaning of the process witness for example that sterile phenomenon the pagoda of caste like this chinese building so was society then formed men were living there in layers as divided from each other class from class he took up the quill and again began to write  you understand i suppose said hilary in a low voice that she has been told not to come  bianca moved her shoulders  with a most unwonted look of anger he added  is it within the scope of your generosity to credit me with the desire to meet your wishes  biancas answer was a laugh so strangely hard so cruelly bitter that hilary involuntarily turned as though to retrieve the sound before it reached the old mans ears  mr stone had laid down his pen i shall write no more today he said i have lost my feelingi am not myself he spoke in a voice unlike his own  very tired and worn his old figure looked as some lean horse whose sun has set stands with drooped head the hollows in his neck showing under his straggling mane and suddenly evidently quite oblivious that he had any audience he spoke  o great universe i am an old man of a faint spirit with no singleness of purpose help me to write onhelp me to write a book such as the world has never seen  a dead silence followed that strange prayer then bianca with tears rolling down her face got up and rushed out of the room  mr stone came to himself his mute white face had suddenly grown scared and pink he looked at hilary  i fear that i forgot myself have i said anything peculiar  not feeling certain of his voice hilary shook his head and he too moved towards the door     chapter xxiv  shadowland  each of us has a shadow in those placesin those streets  that saying of mr stones whichlike so many of his sayingshad travelled forth to beat the air might have seemed even in those days not altogether without meaning to anyone who looked into the room of mr joshua creed in hound street  this aged butler lay in bed waiting for the inevitable striking of a small alarum clock placed in the very centre of his mantelpiece flanking that round and ruthless arbiter which drove him day by day to stand up on feet whose time had come to rest were the effigies of his past triumphs on the one hand in a papiermache frame slightly tinged with smuts stood a portrait of the honorable bateson in the uniform of his yeomanry creeds former masters face wore that daredevil look with which he had been wont to say dn it creed lend me a pound ive got no money on the other hand in a green frame which had once been plush and covered by a glass with a crack in the lefthand corner was a portrait of the dowager countess of glengower as this former mistress of his appeared conceived by the local photographer laying the foundationstone of the local almshouse during the wreck of creeds career which following on a lengthy illness had preceded his salvation by the westminster gazette these two household gods had lain at the bottom of an old tin trunk in the possession of the keeper of a lodginghouse waiting to be bailed out the honorable bateson was now dead nor had he paid as yet the pounds he had borrowed lady glengower too was in heaven remembering that she had forgotten all her servants in her will he who had served them was still alive and his first thought when he had secured his post on the westminister was to save enough to rescue them from a dishonourable confinement it had taken him six months he had found them keeping company with three pairs of woollen drawers an old but respectable black tailcoat a plaid cravat a bible four socks two of which had toes and two of which had heels some darningcotton and a needle a pair of elasticsided boots a comb and a sprig of white heather wrapped up with a little piece of shavingsoap and two pipecleaners in a bit of the globe newspaper also two collars whose lofty points separated by gaps of quite two inches had been wont to reach their masters gills the small alarum clock aforesaid and a tiepin formed in the likeness of queen victoria at the date of her first jubilee how many times had he not gone in thought over those stores of treasure while he was parted from them how many times since they had come back to him had he not pondered with a slow but deathless anger on the absence of a certain shirt which he could have sworn had been amongst them  but now he lay in bed waiting to hear the clock go off with his old bristly chin beneath the bedclothes and his old discoloured nose above he was thinking the thoughts which usually came into his mind about this hourthat mrs hughs ought not to scrape the butter off his bread for breakfast in the way she did that she ought to take that sixpence off his rent that the man who brought his late editions in the cart ought to be earlier letting that man get his pell mells off before him when he himself would be having the one chance of his day that sooner than pay the ninepence which the bootmaker had proposed to charge for resoling him he would wait until the summer came low class o feller as he was hed be glad enough to sole him then for sixpence  and the highsouled critic finding these reflections sordid would have thought otherwise perhaps had he been standing on those feet now twitching all by themselves beneath the bedclothes up to eleven oclock the night before because there were still twelve numbers of the late edition that nobody would buy no one knew more surely than joshua creed himself that if he suffered himself to entertain any large and lofty views of life he would infallibly find himself in that building to keep out of which he was in the habit of addressing to god his only prayer to speak of fortunately from a boy up together with a lengthy oblong squarejawed face he had been given by nature a singleminded view of life in fact the mysterious stout tenacity of a soul born in the neighbourhood of newmarket could not have been done justice to had he constitutionally seenany more than mr stone himselftwo things at a time the one thing he had seen for the five years that he had now stood outside messrs rose and thorns was the workhouse and as he was not going there so long as he was living he attended carefully to all little matters of expense in this somewhat sordid way  while attending thus he heard a scream having by temperament considerable caution but little fear he waited till he heard another and then got out of bed taking the poker in his hand and putting on his spectacles he hurried to the door many a time and oft in old days had he risen in this fashion to defend the plate of the honorable bateson and the dowager countess of glengower from the periodical attacks of his imagination he stood with his ancient nightgown flapping round his still more ancient legs slightly shivering then pulling the door open he looked forth on the stairs just above him mrs hughs clasping her baby with one arm was holding the other out at full length between herself and hughs he heard the latter say youve drove me to it ill do a swing for you mrs hughs thin body brushed past into his room blood was dripping from her wrist creed saw that hughs had his bayonet in his hand with all his might he called out ye ought to be ashamed of yourself raising the poker to a position of defence at this momentmore really dangerous than any he had ever knownit was remarkable that he instinctively opposed to it his most ordinary turns of speech it was as though the extravagance of this unenglish violence had roused in him the full measure of a native moderation the sight of the naked steel deeply disgusted him he uttered a long sentence what did hughs call thisdisgracin of the house at this time in the mornin where was he brought up call imself a soldier attackin of old men and women in this way he ought to be ashamed  while these words were issuing between the yellow stumps of teeth in that withered mouth hughs stood silent the back of his arm covering his eyes voices and a heavy tread were heard distinguishing in that tread the advancing footsteps of the law creed said you attack me if you dare  hughs dropped his arm his short dark face had a desperate look as of a caged rat his eyes were everywhere at once  all right daddy he said i wont hurt you shes drove my head all wrong again catch hold o this i cant trust myself he held out the bayonet  westminister took it gingerly in his shaking hand  to use a thing like that he said an call yourself an englishman ill ketch me death standin here i will  hughs made no answer leaning against the wall the old butler regarded him severely he did not take a wide or philosophic view of him as a tortured human being driven by the whips of passion in his dark blood a creature whose moral nature was the warped stunted tree his life had made it a poor devil half destroyed by drink and by his wound the old butler took a more singleminded and oldfashioned line ketch old of im he thought with these low fellers theres nothin else to be done ketch old of im until he squeals  nodding his ancient head he said  heres an orficer i shant speak for yer you deserves all youll get and more  later dressed in an old newmarket coat given him by some client and walking towards the policestation alongside mrs hughs he was particularly silent presenting a front of some austerity as became a man mixed up in a low class of incident like this and the seamstress very thin and scared with her wounded wrist slung in a muffler of her husbands and carrying the baby on her other arm because the mornings incident had upset the little thing slipped along beside him glancing now and then into his face  only once did he speak and to himself  i dont know what theyll say to me down at the orffice when i go againmissin my day like this oh dear what a misfortune what put it into him to go on like that  at this which was far from being intended as encouragement the waters of speech broke up and flowed from mrs hughs she had only told hughs how that young girl had gone and left a weeks rent with a bit of writing to say she wasnt coming back it wasnt her fault that she was gonethat ought never to have come there at all a creature that knew no better than to come between husband and wife she couldnt tell no more than he could where that young girl had gone  the tears stealing forth chased each other down the seamstresss thin cheeks her face had now but little likeness to the face with which she had stood confronting hughs when she informed him of the little models flight none of the triumph which had leaped out of her bruised heart none of the strident malice with which her voice whether she would or no strove to avenge her wounded sense of property none of that unconscious abnegation so very near to heroism with which she had rushed and caught up her baby from beneath the bayonet when goaded by her malice and triumph hughs had rushed to seize that weapon none of all that but instead a pitiable terror of the ordeal before hera pitiful mute quivering distress that this man against whom two hours before she had felt such a store of bitter rancour whose almost murderous assault she had so narrowly escaped should now be in this plight  the sight of her emotion penetrated through his spectacles to something lying deep in the old butler  dont you take on he said ill stand by yer he shant treat yer with impuniness  to his uncomplicated nature the affair was still one of tit for tat mrs hughs became mute again her torn heart yearned to cancel the penalty that would fall on all of them to deliver hughs from the common enemythe law but a queer feeling of pride and bewilderment and a knowledge that to demand an eye for an eye was expected of all selfrespecting persons kept her silent  thus then they reached the great consoler the grey resolver of all human tangles haven of men and angels the police court it was situated in a back street like trails of ooze when the tide neither ebb nor flow is leaving and making for some estuary trails of human beings were moving to and from it the faces of these shuffling shadows wore a look as though masked with some hard but threadbare stuffthe look of those whom life has squeezed into a last resort within the porches lay a stagnant marsh of suppliants through whose centre trickled to and fro that stream of ooze an old policeman too like some grey lighthouse marked the entrance to the port of refuge close to that lighthouse the old butler edged his way the love of regularity and of an established order of affairs born in him and fostered by a life passed in the service of the honorable bateson and the other gentry made him cling instinctively to the only person in this crowd whom he could tell for certain to be on the side of law and order something in his oblong face and lank scanty hair parted precisely in the middle something in that high collar supporting his lean gills not subservient exactly but as it were suggesting that he was in league against all this lowclass of fellow made the policeman say to him  whats your business daddy  oh the old butler answered this poor woman im a witness to her battery  the policeman cast his not unkindly look over the figure of the seamstress you stand here he said ill pass you in directly  and soon by his offices the two were passed into the port of refuge  they sat down side by side on the edge of a long hard wooden bench creed fixing his eyes whose colour had run into a brownish rim round their centres on the magistrate as in old days sunworshippers would sit blinking devoutly at the sun and mrs hughs fixing her eyes on her lap while tears of agony trickled down her face on her unwounded arm the baby slept in front of them and unregarded filed one by one those shadows who had drunk the day before too deeply of the waters of forgetfulness today instead they were to drink the water of remembrance poured out for them with no uncertain hand and somewhere very far away it may have been that justice sat with her ironic smile watching men judge their shadows she had watched them so long about that business with her elementary idea that hares and tortoises should not be made to start from the same mark she had a little given up expecting to be asked to come and lend a hand they had gone so far beyond her perhaps she knew too that men no longer punished but now only reformed their erring brothers and this made her heart as light as the hearts of those who had been in the prisons where they were no longer punished  the old butler however was not thinking of her he had thoughts of a simpler order in his mind he was reflecting that he had once valeted the nephew of the late lord justice hawthorn and in the midst of this lowclass business the reminiscence brought him refreshment over and over to himself he conned these words i interpylated in between them and i says you ought to be ashamed of yourself call yourself an englishman i says attackin of old men and women with cold steel i says and suddenly he saw that hughs was in the dock  the dark man stood with his hands pressed to his sides as though at attention on parade a pale profile broken by a line of black moustache was all westminister could see of that impassive face whose eyes fixed on the magistrate alone betrayed the fires within the violent trembling of the seamstress roused in joshua creed a certain irritation and seeing the baby open his black eyes he nudged her whispering yeve woke the baby  responding to words which alone perhaps could have moved her at such a moment mrs hughs rocked this dumb spectator of the drama again the old butler nudged her  they want yer in the box he said  mrs hughs rose and took her place  he who wished to read the hearts of this husband and wife who stood at right angles to have their wounds healed by law would have needed to have watched the hundred thousand hours of their wedded life known and heard the million thoughts and words which had passed in the dim spaces of their world to have been cognisant of the million reasons why they neither of them felt that they could have done other than they had done reading their hearts by the light of knowledge such as this he would not have been surprised that brought into this place of remedy they seemed to enter into a sudden league a look passed between them it was not friendly it had no appeal but it sufficed there seemed to be expressed in it the knowledge bred by immemorial experience and immemorial time this law before which we stand was not made by us as dogs when they hear the crack of a far whip will shrink and in their whole bearing show wary quietude so hughs and mrs hughs confronted by the questionings of law made only such answers as could be dragged from them in a voice hardly above a whisper mrs hughs told her tale they had fallen out what about she did not know had he attacked her he had had it in his hand what then she had slipped and hurt her wrist against the point at this statement hughs turned his eyes on her and seemed to say you drove me to it ive got to suffer for all your trying to get me out of what ive done i gave you one and i dont want your help but im glad you stick to me against this law then lowering his eyes he stood motionless during her breathless little outburst he was her husband she had borne him five he had been wounded in the war she had never wanted him brought here  no mention of the little model  the old butler dwelt on this reticence of mrs hughs when two hours afterwards in pursuance of his instinctive reliance on the gentry he called on hilary  the latter surrounded by books and papersfor since his dismissal of the girl he had worked with great activitywas partaking of lunch served to him in his study on a tray  theres an old gentleman to see you sir he says you know him his name is creed  show him in said hilary  appearing suddenly from behind the servant in the doorway the old butler came in at a stealthy amble he looked round and seeing a chair placed his hat beneath it then advanced with nose and spectacles upturned to hilary catching sight of the tray he stopped checked in an evident desire to communicate his soul  oh dear he said im intrudin on your luncheon i can wait ill go and sit in the passage  hilary however shook his hand faded now to skin and bone and motioned him to a chair  he sat down on the edge of it and again said  im intrudin on yer  not at all is there anything i can do  creed took off his spectacles wiped them to help himself to see more clearly what he had to say and put them on again  its aconcerning of these domestic matters he said i come up to tell yer knowing as youre interested in this family  well said hilary what has happened  its along of the young girls having left them as you may know  ah  its brought things to a crisax explained creed  indeed hows that  the old butler related the facts of the assault i took is bayonet away from him he ended he didnt frighten me  is he out of his mind asked hilary  ive no conscience of it replied creed his wife shes gone the wrong way to work with him in my opinion but thats particular to women shes agoaded of him respecting a certain party i dont say but what that young girls no better than what she ought to be look at her profession and her a country girl too she must be what she oughtnt to but he aint the sort o man you can treat like that you cant get thorns from figs you cant expect it from the lower orders they only give him a month considerin of him bein wounded in the war itd been more if theyd aknown he was ahankerin after that young girla married man like him dont ye think so sir  hilarys face had assumed its retired expression i cannot go into that with you it seemed to say  quick to see the change creed rose but im intrudin on your dinner he saidyour luncheon i should say the woman goes on irritatin of him but he must expect of that she bein his wife but what a misfortune hell be back again in no time and whatll happen then it wont improve him shut up in one of them low prisons then raising his old face to hilary oh dear its like awalkin on a black night when ye cant see your and before yer  hilary was unable to find a suitable answer to this simile  the impression made on him by the old butlers recital was queerly twofold his more fastidious side felt distinct relief that he had severed connection with an episode capable of developments so sordid and conspicuous but all the side of himand hilary was a complicated productwhich felt compassion for the helpless his suppressed chivalry in fact had also received its fillip the old butlers references to the girl showed clearly how the hands of all men and women were against her she was that pariah a young girl without property or friends spiritually soft physically alluring  to recompense westminister for the loss of his days work to make a dubious statement that nights were never so black as they appeared to be was all that he could venture to do creed hesitated in the doorway  oh dear he said theres aone thing that the woman was asaying that ive forgot to tell you its aconcernin of what this ere man was boastin in his rage let them he says as is responsive for the movin of her look out he says i aint done with them thats conspiracy i should think  smiling away this diagnosis of hughs words hilary shook the old mans withered hand and closed the door sitting down again at his writingtable he buried himself almost angrily in his work but the queer halfpleasurable fevered feeling which had been his since the night he walked down piccadilly and met the image of the little model was unfavourable to the austere process of his thoughts     chapter xxv  mr stone in waiting  that same afternoon while mr stone was writing he heard a voice saying  dad stop writing just a minute and talk to me  recognition came into his eyes it was his younger daughter  my dear he said are you unwell  keeping his hand fragile and veined and chill under her own warm grasp bianca answered lonely  mr stone looked straight before him  loneliness he said is mans chief fault and seeing his pen lying on the desk he tried to lift his hand bianca held it down at that hot clasp something seemed to stir in mr stone his cheeks grew pink  kiss me dad  mr stone hesitated then his lips resolutely touched her eye it is wet he said he seemed for a moment struggling to grasp the meaning of moisture in connection with the human eye soon his face again became serene the heart he said is a dark well its depth unknown i have lived eighty years i am still drawing water  draw a little for me dad  this time mr stone looked at his daughter anxiously and suddenly spoke as if afraid that if he waited he might forget  you are unhappy  bianca put her face down to his tweed sleeve how nice your coat smells she murmured  you are unhappy repeated mr stone  bianca dropped his hand and moved away  mr stone followed her why he said then grasping his brow he added if it would do you any good my dear to hear a page or two i could read to you  bianca shook her head  no talk to me  mr stone answered simply i have forgotten  you talk to that little girl murmured bianca  mr stone seemed to lose himself in reverie  if that is true he said following out his thoughts it must be due to the sex instinct not yet quite extinct it is stated that the blackcock will dance before his females to a great age though i have never seen it  if you dance before her said bianca with her face averted cant you even talk to me  i do not dance my dear said mr stone i will do my best to talk to you  there was a silence and he began to pace the room bianca by the empty fireplace watched a shower of rain driving past the open window  this is the time of year said mr stone suddenly when lambs leap off the ground with all four legs at a time he paused as though for an answer then out of the silence his voice rose againit sounded different there is nothing in nature more symptomatic of that principle which should underlie all life live in the future regret nothing leap a lamb which has left earth with all four legs at once is the symbol of true life that she must come down again is but an inevitable accident in those days men were living on their pasts they leaped with one or at the most two legs at a time they never left the ground or in leaving they wished to know the reason why it was this paralysismr stone did not pause but finding himself close beside his desk took up his penit was this paralysis of the leaping nerve which undermined their progress instead of millions of leaping lambs ignorant of why they leaped they were a flock of sheep lifting up one leg and asking whether it was or was not worth their while to lift another  the words were followed by a silence broken only by the scratching of the quill with which mr stone was writing  having finished he again began to pace the room and coming suddenly on his daughter stopped short touching her shoulder timidly he said i was talking to you i think my dear where were we  bianca rubbed her cheek against his hand  in the air i think  yes yes said mr stone i remember you must not let me wander from the point again  no dear  lambs said mr stone remind me at times of that young girl who comes to copy for me i make her skip to promote her circulation before tea i myself do this exercise leaning against the wall with his feet twelve inches from it he rose slowly on his toes do you know that exercise it is excellent for the calves of the legs and for the lumbar regions so saying mr stone left the wall and began again to pace the room the whitewash had also left the wall and clung in a large square patch on his shaggy coat i have seen sheep in spring he said actually imitate their lambs in rising from the ground with all four legs at once he stood still a thought had evidently struck him  if life is not all spring it is of no value whatsoever better to die and to begin again life is a tree putting on a new green gown it is a young moon risingno that is not so we do not see the young moon risingit is a young moon setting never younger than when we are about to die  bianca cried out sharply dont father dont talk like that its so untrue life is all autumn it seems to me  mr stones eyes grew very blue  that is a foul heresy he stammered i cannot listen to it life is the cuckoos song it is a hillside bursting into leaf it is the wind i feel it in me every day  he was trembling like a leaf in the wind he spoke of and bianca moved hastily towards him holding out her arms suddenly his lips began to move she heard him mutter i have lost force i will boil some milk i must be ready when she comes and at those words her heart felt like a lump of ice  always that girl and without again attracting his attention she went away as she passed out through the garden she saw him at the window holding a cup of milk from which the steam was rising     chapter xxvi  third pilgrimage to hound street  like water human character will find its level and nature with her way of fitting men to their environment had made young martin stone what stephen called a sanitist there had been nothing else for her to do with him  this young man had come into the social scheme at a moment when the conception of existence as a present life corrected by a life to come was tottering and the conception of the world as an upperclass preserve somewhat seriously disturbed  losing his father and mother at an early age and brought up till he was fourteen by mr stone he had formed the habit of thinking for himself this had rendered him unpopular and added force to the essential singleheartedness transmitted to him through his grandfather a particular aversion to the sights and scenes of suffering which had caused him as a child to object to killing flies and to watching rabbits caught in traps had been regulated by his training as a doctor his fleshly horror of pain and ugliness was now disciplined his spiritual dislike of them forced into a philosophy the peculiar chaos surrounding all young men who live in large towns and think at all had made him gradually reject all abstract speculation but a certain fire of aspiration coming we may suppose through mr stone had nevertheless impelled him to embrace something with all his might he had therefore embraced health and living as he did in the euston road to be in touch with things he had every need of the health which he embraced  late in the afternoon of the day when hughs had committed his assault having three hours of respite from his hospital martin dipped his face and head into cold water rubbed them with a corrugated towel put on a hard bowler hat took a thick stick in his hand and went by underground to kensington  with his usual cool highhanded air he entered his aunts house and asked for thyme faithful to his definite if somewhat crude theory that stephen and cecilia and all their sort were amateurs he never inquired for them though not unfrequently he would while waiting stroll into cecilias drawingroom and let his sarcastic glance sweep over the pretty things she had collected or lounging in some luxurious chair cross his long legs and fix his eyes on the ceiling  thyme soon came down she wore a blouse of some blue stuff bought by cecilia for the relief of people in the balkan states a skirt of purplish tweed woven by irish gentlewomen in distress and held in her hand an open envelope addressed in cecilias writing to mrs tallents smallpeace  hallo she said  martin answered by a look that took her in from head to foot  get on a hat i havent got much time that blue things new  its pure flax mother bought it  its rather decent hurry up  thyme raised her chin that lazy movement showed her round creamy neck in all its beauty  i feel rather slack she said besides i must get back to dinner martin  dinner  thyme turned quickly to the door oh well ill come and ran upstairs  when they had purchased a postal order for ten shillings placed it in the envelope addressed to mrs tallents smallpeace and passed the hundred doors of messrs rose and thorn martin said im going to see what that precious amateur has done about the baby if he hasnt moved the girl i expect to find things in a pretty mess  thymes face changed at once  just remember she said that i dont want to go there i dont see the good when theres such a tremendous lot waiting to be done  every other case except the one in hand  its not my case youre so disgustingly unfair martin i dont like those people  oh you amateur  thyme flushed crimson look here she said speaking with dignity i dont care what you call me but i wont have you call uncle hilary an amateur  what is he then  i like him  thats conclusive  yes it is  martin did not reply looking sideways at thyme with his queer protective smile they were passing through a street superior to hound street in its pretensions to be called a slum  look here he said suddenly a man like hilarys interest in all this sort of thing is simply sentimental its on his nerves he takes philanthropy just as hed take sulphonal for sleeplessness  thyme looked shrewdly up at him  well she said its just as much on your nerves you see it from the point of view of health he sees it from the point of view of sentiment thats all  oh you think so  you just treat all these people as if they were in hospital  the young mans nostrils quivered well and how should they be treated  how would you like to be looked at as a case muttered thyme  martin moved his hand in a slow halfcircle  these houses and these people he said are in the wayin the way of you and me and everyone  thymes eyes followed that slow sweeping movement of her cousins hand it seemed to fascinate her  yes of course i know she murmured something must be done  and she reared her head up looking from side to side as if to show him that she too could sweep away things very straight and solid fair and fresh she looked just then  thus in the hypnotic silence of high thoughts the two young sanitists arrived in hound street  in the doorway of no 1 the son of the lame woman mrs budgenthe thin white youth as tall as martin but not so broadstood smoking a dubiouslooking cigarette he turned his lacklustre jeering gaze on the visitors  who dyou want he said if its the girl shes gone away and left no address  i want mrs hughs said martin  the young man coughed righto youll find her but for him apply wormwood scrubs  prison what for  stickin her through the wrist with his bayonet and the young man let a long luxurious fume of smoke trickle through his nose  how horrible said thyme  martin regarded the young man unmoved that stuff youre smokings rank he said have some of mine ill show you how to make them itll save you one and three per pound of baccy and wont rot your lungs  taking out his pouch he rolled a cigarette the white young man bent his dull wink on thyme who wrinkling her nose was pretending to be far away  mounting the narrow stairs that smelt of walls and washing and red herrings thyme spoke now you see it wasnt so simple as you thought i dont want to go up i dont want to see her i shall wait for you here she took her stand in the open doorway of the little models empty room martin ascended to the second floor  there in the front room mrs hughs was seen standing with the baby in her arms beside the bed she had a frightened and uncertain air after examining her wrist and pronouncing it a scratch martin looked long at the baby the little creatures toes were stiffened against its mothers waist its eyes closed its tiny fingers crisped against her breast while mrs hughs poured forth her tale martin stood with his eyes still fixed on the baby it could not be gathered from his face what he was thinking but now and then he moved his jaw as though he were suffering from toothache in truth by the look of mrs hughs and her baby his recipe did not seem to have achieved conspicuous success he turned away at last from the trembling nerveless figure of the seamstress and went to the window two pale hyacinth plants stood on the inner edge their perfume penetrated through the other savours of the roomand very strange they looked those twin starved children of the light and air  these are new he said  yes sir murmured mrs hughs i brought them upstairs i didnt like to see the poor things left to die  from the bitter accent of these words martin understood that they had been the little models  put them outside he said theyll never live in here they want watering too where are your saucers  mrs hughs laid the baby down and going to the cupboard where all the household gods were kept brought out two old dirty saucers martin raised the plants and as he held them from one close yellow petal there rose up a tiny caterpillar it reared a green transparent body feeling its way to a new restingplace the little writhing shape seemed like the wonder and the mystery of life to mock the young doctor who watched it with eyebrows raised having no hand at liberty to remove it from the plant  she came from the country theres plenty of men there for her  martin put the plants down and turned round to the seamstress  look here he said its no good crying over spilt milk what youve got to do is to set to and get some work  yes sir  dont say it in that sort of way said martin you must rise to the occasion  yes sir  you want a tonic take this halfcrown and get in a dozen pints of stout and drink one every day  and again mrs hughs said yes sir  and about that baby  motionless where it had been placed against the footrail of the bed the baby sat with its black eyes closed the small grey face was curled down on the bundle of its garments  its a silent gentleman martin muttered  it never was a one to cry said mrs hughs  thats lucky anyway when did you feed it last  mrs hughs did not reply at first about halfpast six last evening sir  what  it slept all night but today of course ive been all torn to pieces my milks gone ive tried it with the bottle but it wouldnt take it  martin bent down to the babys face and put his finger on its chin bending lower yet he raised the eyelid of the tiny eye  its dead he said  at the word dead mrs hughs stooping behind him snatched the baby to her throat with its drooping head close to her she she clutched and rocked it without sound full five minutes this desperate mute struggle with eternal silence lastedthe feeling and warming and breathing on the little limbs then sitting down bent almost double over her baby she moaned that single sound was followed by utter silence the tread of footsteps on the creaking stairs broke it martin rising from his crouching posture by the bed went towards the door  his grandfather was standing there with thyme behind him  she has left her room said mr stone where has she gone  martin understanding that he meant the little model put his finger to his lips and pointing to mrs hughs whispered  this womans baby has just died  mr stones face underwent the queer discoloration which marked the sudden summoning of his far thoughts he stepped past martin and went up to mrs hughs  he stood there a long time gazing at the baby and at the dark head bending over it with such despair at last he spoke  poor woman he is at peace  mrs hughs looked up and seeing that old face with its hollows and thin silver hair she spoke  hes dead sir  mr stone put out his veined and fragile hand and touched the babys toes he is flying he is everywhere he is close to the sunlittle brother and turning on his heel he went out  thyme followed him as he walked on tiptoe down stairs which seemed to creak the louder for his caution tears were rolling down her cheeks  martin sat on with the mother and her baby in the close still room where like strange visiting spirits came stealing whiffs of the perfume of hyacinths     chapter xxvii  stephens private life  mr stone and thyme going out again passed the tall white young man he had thrown away the handmade cigarette finding that it had not enough saltpetre to make it draw and was smoking one more suited to the action of his lungs he directed towards them the same lacklustre jeering stare  unconscious seemingly of where he went mr stone walked with his eyes fixed on space his head jerked now and then as a dried flower will shiver in a draught  scared at these movements thyme took his arm the touch of that soft young arm squeezing his own brought speech back to mr stone  in those places he said in those streets i shall not see the flowering of the aloei shall not see the living peace as with dogs each couched over his proper bone so men were living then thyme watching him askance pressed still closer to his side as though to try and warm him back to every day  oh went her guttered thoughts i do wish grandfather would say something one could understand i wish he would lose that dreadful stare  mr stone spoke in answer to his granddaughters thoughts  i have seen a vision of fraternity a barren hillside in the sun and on it a man of stone talking to the wind i have heard an owl hooting in the daytime a cuckoo singing in the night  grandfather grandfather  to that appeal mr stone responded yes what is it  but thyme thus challenged knew not what to say having spoken out of terror  if the poor baby had lived she stammered out it would have grown up its all for the best isnt it  everything is for the best said mr stone in those days men possessed by thoughts of individual life made moan at death careless of the great truth that the world was one unending song  thyme thought i have never seen him as bad as this she drew him on more quickly with deep relief she saw her father latchkey in hand turning into the old square  stephen who was still walking with his springy step though he had come on foot the whole way from the temple hailed them with his hat it was tall and black and very shiny neither quite oval nor positively round and had a little curly brim in this and his black coat cut so as to show the front of him and cover the behind he looked his best the costume suited his long rather narrow face corrugated by two short parallel lines slanting downwards from his eyes and nostrils on either cheek suited his neat thin figure and the closelipped corners of his mouth his permanent appointment in the world of law had ousted from his life together with all uncertainty of income the need for putting on a wig and taking his moustache off but he still preferred to go cleanshaved  where have you two sprung from he inquired admitting them into the hall  mr stone gave him no answer but passed into the drawingroom and sat down on the verge of the first chair he came across leaning forward with his hands between his knees  stephen after one dry glance at him turned to his daughter  my child he said softly what have you brought the old boy here for if there happens to be anything of the high mammalian order for dinner your mother will have a fit  thyme answered dont chaff father  stephen who was very fond of her saw that for some reason she was not herself he examined her with unwonted gravity thyme turned away from him he heard to his alarm a little gulping sound  my dear he said  conscious of her sentimental weakness thyme made a violent effort  ive seen a baby dead she cried in a quick hard voice and without another word she ran upstairs  in stephen there was a horror of emotion amounting almost to disease it would have been difficult to say when he had last shown emotion perhaps not since thyme was born and even then not to anyone except himself having first locked the door and then walked up and down with his teeth almost meeting in the mouthpiece of his favourite pipe he was unaccustomed too to witness this weakness on the part of other people his looks and speech unconsciously discouraged it so that if cecilia had been at all that way inclined she must long ago have been healed fortunately she never had been having too much distrust of her own feelings to give way to them completely and thyme that healthy product of them both at once younger for her age and older than they had ever been with her incapacity for nonsense her love for open air and factsthat fresh rising plant so elastic and so saneshe had never given them a single moment of uneasiness  stephen close to his hatrack felt soreness in his heart such blows as fortune had dealt and meant to deal him he had borne and he could bear so long as there was nothing in his own manner or in that of others to show him they were blows  hurriedly depositing his hat he ran to cecilia he still preserved the habit of knocking on her door before he entered though she had never so far answered dont come in because she knew his knock the custom gave in fact the measure of his idealism what he feared or what he thought he feared after nineteen years of unchecked entrance could never have been ascertained but there it was that flower of something formal and precise of something reticent within his soul  this time for once he did not knock and found cecilia hooking up her teagown and looking very sweet she glanced at him with mild surprise  whats this cis he said about a baby dead thymes quite upset about it and your dads in the drawingroom  with the quick instinct that was woven into all her gentle treading cecilias thoughts flewshe could not have told whyfirst to the little model then to mrs hughs  dead she said oh poor woman  what woman stephen asked  it must be mrs hughs  the thought passed darkly through stephens mind those people again what now he did not express it being neither brutal nor lacking in good taste  a short silence followed then cecilia said suddenly did you say that father was in the drawingroom theres fillet of beef stephen  stephen turned away go and see thyme he said  outside thymes door cecilia paused and hearing no sound tapped gently her knock not being answered she slipped in on the bed of that white room with her face pressed into the pillow her little daughter lay cecilia stood aghast thymes whole body was quivering with suppressed sobs  my darling said cecilia what is it  thymes answer was inarticulate  cecilia sat down on the bed and waited drawing her fingers through the girls hair which had fallen loose and while she sat there she experienced all that sore strange feelingas of being skinnedwhich comes to one who watches the emotion of someone near and dear without knowing the exact cause  this is dreadful she thought what am i to do  to see ones child cry was bad enough but to see her cry when that childs whole creed of honour and conduct for years past had precluded this relief as unfeminine was worse than disconcerting  thyme raised herself on her elbow turning her face carefully away  i dont know whats the matter with me she said choking itsits purely physical  yes darling murmured cecilia i know  oh mother said thyme suddenly it looked so tiny  yes yes my sweet  thyme faced round there was a sort of passion in her darkened eyes rimmed pink with grief and in all her gushed wet face  why should it have been choked out like that itsits so brutal  cecilia slid an arm round her  im so distressed you saw it dear she said  and grandfather was so a long sobbing quiver choked her utterance  yes yes said cecilia im sure he was  clasping her hands together in her lap thyme muttered he called him little brother  a tear trickled down cecilias cheek and dropped on her daughters wrist feeling that it was not her own tear thyme started up  its weak and ridiculous she said i wont  oh go away mother please im only making you feel bad too youd better go and see to grandfather  cecilia saw that she would cry no more and since it was the sight of tears which had so disturbed her she gave the girl a little hesitating stroke and went away outside she thought how dreadfully unlucky and pathetic and theres father in the drawingroom then she hurried down to mr stone  he was sitting where he had first placed himself motionless it struck her suddenly how frail and white he looked in the shadowy light of her drawingroom he was almost like a spirit sitting there in his grey tweedsilvery from head to foot her conscience smote her it is written of the very old that they shall pass by virtue of their long travel out of the country of the understanding of the young till the natural affections are blurred by creeping mists such as steal across the moors when the sun is going down  cecilias heart ached with a little ache for all the times she had thought if father were only not quite so for all the times she had shunned asking him to come to them because he was so for all the silences she and stephen had maintained after he had spoken for all the little smiles she had smiled she longed to go and kiss his brow and make him feel that she was aching but she did not dare he seemed so far away it would be ridiculous  coming down the room and putting her slim foot on the fender with a noise so that if possible he might both see and hear her she turned her anxious face towards him and said father  mr stone looked up and seeing somebody who seemed to be his elder daughter answered yes my dear  are you sure youre feeling quite the thing thyme said she thought seeing that poor baby had upset you  mr stone felt his body with his hand  i am not conscious of any pain he said  then youll stay to dinner dear wont you  mr stones brow contracted as though he were trying to recall his past  i have had no tea he said then with a sudden anxious look at his daughter the little girl has not come to me i miss her where is she  the ache within cecilia became more poignant  it is now two days said mr stone and she has left her room in that housein that street  cecilia at her wits end answered do you really miss her father  yes said mr stone she is like his eyes wandered round the room as though seeking something which would help him to express himself they fixed themselves on the far wall cecilia following their gaze saw a little solitary patch of sunlight dancing and trembling there it had escaped the screen of trees and houses and creeping through some chink had quivered in she is like that said mr stone pointing with his finger it is gone his finger dropped he uttered a deep sigh  how dreadful this is cecilia thought i never expected him to feel it and yet i can do nothing hastily she asked would it do if you had thyme to copy for you im sure shed love to come  she is my granddaughter mr stone said simply it would not be the same  cecilia could think of nothing now to say but would you like to wash your hands dear  yes said mr stone  then will you go up to stephens dressingroom for hot water or will you wash them in the lavatory  in the lavatory said mr stone i shall be freer there  when he had gone cecilia thought oh dear how shall i get through the evening poor darling he is so singleminded  at the sounding of the dinnergong they all assembledthyme from her bedroom with cheeks and eyes still pink stephen with veiled inquiry in his glance mr stone from freedom in the lavatoryand sat down screened but so very little from each other by sprays of white lilac looking round her table cecilia felt rather like one watching a dewbelled cobweb most delicate of all things in the world menaced by the tongue of a browsing cow  both soup and fish had been achieved however before a word was spoken it was stephen who after taking a mouthful of dry sherry broke the silence  how are you getting on with your book sir  cecilia heard that question with something like dismay it was so bald for however inconvenient mr stones absorption in his manuscript might be her delicacy told her how precious beyond life itself that book was to him to her relief however her father was eating spinach  you must be getting near the end i should think proceeded stephen  cecilia spoke hastily isnt this white lilac lovely dad  mr stone looked up  it is not white it is really pink the test is simple he paused with his eyes fixed on the lilac  ah thought cecilia now if i can only keep him on natural science he used to be so interesting  all flowers are one said mr stone his voice had changed  oh thought cecilia he is gone  they have but a single soul in those days men divided and subdivided them oblivious of the one pale spirit which underlay those seemingly separate forms  cecilias glance passed swiftly from the manservant to stephen  she saw one of her husbands eyes rise visibly stephen did so hate one thing to be confounded with another  oh come sir she heard him say you dont surely tell us that dandelions and roses have the same pale spirit  mr stone looked at him wistfully  did i say that he said i had no wish to be dogmatic  not at all sir not at all murmured stephen  thyme leaning over to her mother whispered oh mother dont let grandfather be queer i cant bear it tonight  cecilia at her wits end said hurriedly  dad will you tell us what sort of character you think that little girl who comes to you has  mr stone paused in the act of drinking water his attention had evidently been riveted he did not however speak and cecilia seeing that the butler out of the perversity which she found so conspicuous in her servants was about to hand him beef made a desperate movement with her lips no charles not there not there  the butler tightening his lips passed on mr stone spoke  i had not considered that she is rather of a celtic than an anglosaxon type the cheekbones are prominent the jaw is not massive the head is broadif i can remember i will measure it the eyes are of a peculiar blue resembling chicory flowers the mouth mr stone paused  cecilia thought what a lucky find now perhaps he will go on all right  i do not know mr stone resumed speaking in a faroff voice whether she would be virtuous  cecilia heard stephen drinking sherry thyme too was drinking something she herself drank nothing but pink and quiet for she was a wellbred woman said  you have no new potatoes dear charles give mr stone some new potatoes  by the almost vindictive expression on stephens face she saw however that her failure had decided him to resume command of the situation talking of brotherhood sir he said dryly would you go so far as to say that a new potato is the brother of a bean  mr stone on whose plate these two vegetables reposed looked almost painfully confused  i do not perceive he stammered any difference between them  its true said stephen the same pale spirit can be extracted from them both  mr stone looked up at him  you laugh at me he said i cannot help it but you must not laugh at lifethat is blasphemy  before the piercing wistfulness of that sudden gaze stephen was abashed cecilia saw him bite his lower lip  were talking too much he said we really must let your father eat and the rest of the dinner was achieved in silence  when mr stone refusing to be accompanied had taken his departure and thyme had gone to bed stephen withdrew to his study this room which had a different air from any other portion of the house was sacred to his private life here in specially designed compartments he kept his golf clubs pipes and papers nothing was touched by anyone except himself and twice a week by one particular housemaid here was no bust of socrates no books in deerskin bindings but a bookcase filled with treatises on law blue books reviews and the novels of sir walter scott two black oak cabinets stood side by side against the wall filled with small drawers when these cabinets were opened and the drawers drawn forward there emerged a scent of metal polish if the greenbaize covers of the drawers were lifted there were seen coins carefully arranged with labelsas one may see plants growing in rows each with its little name tied on to these tidy rows of shining metal discs stephen turned in moments when his spirit was fatigued to add to them touch them read their names gave him the sweet secret feeling which comes to a man who rubs one hand against the other like a dramdrinker stephen drankin little dosesof the feeling these coins gave him they were his creative work his history of the world to them he gave that side of him which refused to find its full expression in summarising law playing golf or reading the reviews that side of a man which aches he knows not wherefore to construct something ere he die from rameses to george iv the coins lay within those drawerslinks of the long unbroken chain of authority  putting on an old black velvet jacket laid out for him across a chair and lighting the pipe that he could never bring himself to smoke in his formal dinner clothes he went to the righthand cabinet and opened it he stood with a smile taking up coins one by one in this particular drawer they were of the best byzantine dynasty very rare he did not see that cecilia had stolen in and was silently regarding him her eyes seemed doubting at that moment whether or no she loved him who stood there touching that other mistress of his thoughtsthat other mistress with whom he spent so many evening hours the little greenbaize cover fell cecilia said suddenly  stephen i feel as if i must tell father where that girl is  stephen turned  my dear child he answered in his special voice which like champagne seemed to have been dried by artifice you dont want to reopen the whole thing  but i can see he really is upset about it hes looking so awfully white and thin  he ought to give up that bathing in the serpentine at his age its monstrous and surely any other girl will do just as well  he seems to set store by reading to her specially  stephen shrugged his shoulders it had happened to him on one occasion to be present when mr stone was declaiming some pages of his manuscript he had never forgotten the discomfort of the experience that crazy stuff as he had called it to cecilia afterwards had remained on his mind heavy and damp like a cold linseed poultice his wifes father was a crank and perhaps even a little more than a crank a wee bit touchedthat she couldnt help poor girl but any allusion to his cranky produce gave stephen pain nor had he forgotten his experience at dinner  he seems to have grown fond of her murmured cecilia  but its absurd at his time of life  perhaps that makes him feel it more people do miss things when they are old  stephen slid the drawer back into its socket there was dry decision in that gesture  look here lets exercise a little common sense its been sacrificed to sentiment all through this wretched business one wants to be kind of course but ones got to draw the line  ah said cecilia where  the thing went on stephen has been a mistake from first to last its all very well up to a certain point but after that it becomes destructive of all comfort it doesnt do to let these people come into personal contact with you there are the proper channels for that sort of thing  cecilias eyes were lowered as though she did not dare to let him see her thoughts  it seems so horrid she said and father is not like other people  he is not said stephen dryly we had a pretty good instance of that this evening but hilary and your sister are theres something most distasteful to me too about thymes going about slumming you see what shes been let in for this afternoon the notion of that baby being killed through the mans treatment of his wife and that no doubt arising from the girls leaving them is most repulsive  to these words cecilia answered with a sound almost like a gasp i hadnt thought of that then were responsible it was we who advised hilary to make her change her lodging  stephen stared he regretted sincerely that his legal habit of mind had made him put the case so clearly  i cant imagine he said almost violently what possesses everybody weresponsible good gracious because we gave hilary some sound advice what next  cecilia turned to the empty hearth  thyme has been telling me about that poor little thing it seems so dreadful and i cant get rid of the feeling that werewere all mixed up with it  mixed up with what  i dont know its just a feeling likelike being haunted  stephen took her quietly by the arm  my dear old girl he said id no idea that you were run down like this tomorrows thursday and i can get away at three well motor down to richmond and have a round or two  cecilia quivered for a moment it seemed that she was about to burst out crying stephen stroked her shoulder steadily cecilia must have felt his dread she struggled loyally with her emotion  that will be very jolly she said at last  stephen drew a deep breath  and dont you worry dear he said about your dad hell have forgotten the whole thing in a day or two hes far too wrapped up in his book now trot along to bed ill be up directly  before going out cecilia looked back at him how wonderful was that look which stephen did notperhaps intentionallysee mocking almost hating and yet thanking him for having refused to let her be emotional and yield herself up for once to what she felt showing him too how clearly she saw through his own masculine refusal to be made to feel and how she halfadmired itall this was in that look and more then she went out  stephen glanced quickly at the door and pursing up his lips frowned he threw the window open and inhaled the night air  if i dont look out he thought i shall be having her mixed up with this i was an ass ever to have spoken to old hilary i ought to have ignored the matter altogether its a lesson not to meddle with people in those places i hope to god shell be herself tomorrow  outside under the soft black foliage of the square beneath the slim sickle of the moon two cats were hunting after happiness their savage cries of passion rang in the blossomscented air like a cry of dark humanity in the jungle of dim streets stephen with a shiver of disgust for his nerves were on edge shut the window with a slam     chapter xxviii  hilary hears the cuckoo sing  it was not left to cecilia alone to remark how very white mr stone looked in these days  the wild force which every year visits the world driving with its soft violence snowy clouds and their dark shadows breaking through all crusts and sheaths covering the earth in a fierce embrace the wild force which turns form to form and with its million leapings swift as the flight of swallows and the arrowdarts of the rain hurries everything on to sweet minglingthis great wild force of universal life socalled the spring had come to mr stone like new wine to some old bottle and hilary to whom it had come too watching him every morning setting forth with a rough towel across his arm wondered whether the old man would not this time leave his spirit swimming in the chill waters of the serpentineso near that spirit seemed to breaking through its fragile shell  four days had gone by since the interview at which he had sent away the little model and life in his householdthat quiet backwater choked with liliesseemed to have resumed the tranquillity enjoyed before this intrusion of rude life the paper whiteness of mr stone was the only patent evidence that anything disturbing had occurredthat and certain feelings about which the strictest silence was preserved  on the morning of the fifth day seeing the old man stumble on the level flagstones of the garden hilary finished dressing hastily and followed he overtook him walking forward feebly beneath the candelabra of flowering chestnuttrees with a hailshower striking white on his high shoulders and placing himself alongside without greetingfor forms were all one to mr stonehe said  surely you dont mean to bathe during a hail storm sir make an exception this once youre not looking quite yourself  mr stone shook his head then evidently following out a thought which hilary had interrupted he remarked  the sentiment that men call honour is of doubtful value i have not as yet succeeded in relating it to universal brotherhood  how is that sir  in so far said mr stone as it consists in fidelity to principle one might assume it worthy of conjunction the difficulty arises when we consider the nature of the principle  there is a family of young thrushes in the garden if one of them finds a worm i notice that his devotion to that principle of selfpreservation which prevails in all low forms of life forbids his sharing it with any of the other little thrushes  mr stone had fixed his eyes on distance  so it is i fear he said with honour in those days men looked on women as thrushes look on worms  he paused evidently searching for a word and hilary with a faint smile said  and how did women look on men sir  mr stone observed him with surprise i did not perceive that it was you he said i have to avoid brain action before bathing  they had crossed the road dividing the gardens from the park and seeing that mr stone had already seen the water where he was about to bathe and would now see nothing else hilary stopped beside a little lonely birchtree this wild small graceful visitor who had long bathed in winter was already draping her bare limbs in a scarf of green hilary leaned against her cool pearly body below were the chilly waters now grey now starchblue and the pale forms of fifteen or twenty bathers while he stood shivering in the frozen wind the sun bursting through the hailcloud burned his cheeks and hands and suddenly he heard clear but far off the sound which of all others stirs the hearts of men cuckoo cuckoo  four times over came the unexpected call whence had that illadvised indelicate grey bird flown into this great haunt of men and shadows why had it come with its arrowy flight and mocking cry to pierce the heart and set it aching there were trees enough outside the town cloudswept hollows tangled brakes of furze just coming into bloom where it could preside over the process of spring what solemn freak was this which made it come and sing to one who had no longer any business with the spring  with a real spasm in his heart hilary turned away from that distant bird and went down to the waters edge mr stone was swimming slower than man had ever swum before his silver head and lean arms alone were visible parting the water feebly suddenly he disappeared he was but a dozen yards from the shore and hilary alarmed at not seeing him reappear ran in the water was not deep mr stone seated at the bottom was doing all he could to rise hilary took him by his bathingdress raised him to the surface and supported him towards the land by the time they reached the shore he could just stand on his legs with the assistance of a policeman hilary enveloped him in garments and got him to a cab he had regained some of his vitality but did not seem aware of what had happened  i was not in as long as usual he mused as they passed out into the high road  oh i think so sir  mr stone looked troubled  it is odd he said i do not recollect leaving the water  he did not speak again till he was being assisted from the cab  i wish to recompense the man i have half a crown indoors  i will get it sir said hilary  mr stone who shivered violently now that he was on his feet turned his face up to the cabman  nothing is nobler than the horse he said take care of him  the cabman removed his hat i will sir he answered  walking by himself but closely watched by hilary mr stone reached his room he groped about him as though not distinguishing objects too well through the crystal clearness of the fundamental flux  if i might advise you said hilary i would get back into bed for a few minutes you seem a little chilly  mr stone who was indeed shaking so that he could hardly stand allowed hilary to assist him into bed and tuck the blankets round him  i must be at work by ten oclock he said  hilary who was also shivering hastened to biancas room she was just coming down and exclaimed at seeing him all wet when he had told her of the episode she touched his shoulder  what about you  a hot bath and drink will set me right youd better go to him  he turned towards the bathroom where miranda stood lifting a white foot compressing her lips bianca ran downstairs startled by his tale she would have taken his wet body in her arms if the ghosts of innumerable moments had not stood between so this moment passed too and itself became a ghost  mr stone greatly to his disgust had not succeeded in resuming work at ten oclock failing simply because he could not stand on his legs he had announced his intention of waiting until halfpast three when he should get up in preparation for the coming of the little girl having refused to see a doctor or have his temperature taken it was impossible to tell precisely what degree of fever he was in in his cheeks just visible over the blankets there was more colour than there should have been and his eyes fixed on the ceiling shone with suspicious brilliancy to the dismay of biancawho sat as far out of sight as possible lest he should see her and fancy that she was doing him a servicehe pursued his thoughts aloud  wordswordsthey have taken away brotherhood bianca shuddered listening to that uncanny sound in those days of words they called it deathpale deathmors pallida they saw that word like a gigantic granite block suspended over them and slowly coming down some turning up their faces at the sight trembled painfully awaiting their obliteration others unable while they still lived to face the thought of nothingness inflated by some spiritual wind and thinking always of their individual forms called out unceasingly that those selves of theirs would and must survive this wordthat in some fashion which no man could understand each selfconscious entity reaccumulated after distribution drunk with this thought these too passed away some waited for it with grim dry eyes remarking that the process was molecular and thus they also met their socalled death  his voice ceased and in place of it rose the sound of his tongue moistening his palate bianca from behind placed a glass of barleywater to his lips he drank it with a slow clucking noise then seeing that a hand held the glass said is that you are you ready for me follow in those days no one leaped up to meet pale riding death no one saw in her face that she was brotherhood incarnate no one with a heart as light as gossamer kissed her feet and smiling passed into the universe his voice died away and when next he spoke it was in a quick husky whisper i musti musti must there was silence then he added give me my trousers  bianca placed them by his bed the sight seemed to reassure him he was once more silent  for more than an hour after this he was so absolutely still that bianca rose continually to look at him each time his eyes wide open were fixed on a little dark mark across the ceiling his face had a look of the most singular determination as though his spirit were slowly relentlessly regaining mastery over his fevered body he spoke suddenly  who is there  bianca  help me out of bed  the flush had left his face the brilliance had faded from his eyes he looked just like a ghost with a sort of terror bianca helped him out of bed this weird display of mute white willpower was unearthly  when he was dressed in his woollen gown and seated before the fire she gave him a cup of strong beeftea with brandy he swallowed it with great avidity  i should like some more of that he said and fell asleep  while he was asleep cecilia came and the two sisters watched his slumber and watching it felt nearer to each other than they had for many years before she went away cecilia whispered  b if he seems to want that little girl while hes like this dont you think she ought to come  bianca answered i dont know where she is  i do  ah said bianca of course and she turned her head away  disconcerted by that sarcastic little speech cecilia was silent then summoning all her courage she said  heres the address b ive written it down for you and with puckers of anxiety in her face she left the room  bianca sat on in the old golden chair watching the deep hollows beneath the sleepers temples the puffs of breath stirring the silver round his mouth her ears burned crimson carried out of herself by the sight of that old form dearer to her than she had thought fighting its great battle for the sake of its idea her spirit grew all tremulous and soft within her with eagerness she embraced the thought of selfeffacement it did not seem to matter whether she were first with hilary her spirit should so manifest its capacity for sacrifice that she would be first with him through sheer nobility at this moment she could almost have taken that common little girl into her arms and kissed her so would all disquiet end some harmonious messenger had fluttered to her for a secondthe goldwinged bird of peace in this sensuous exaltation her nerves vibrated like the strings of a violin  when mr stone woke it was past three oclock and bianca at once handed him another cup of strong beeftea  he swallowed it and said what is this  beeftea  mr stone looked at the empty cup  i must not drink it the cow and the sheep are on the same plane as man  but how do you feel dear  i feel said mr stone able to dictate what i have already writtennot more has she come  not yet but i will go and find her if you like  mr stone looked at his daughter wistfully  that will be taking up your time he said  bianca answered my time is of no consequence  mr stone stretched his hands out to the fire  i will not consent he said evidently to himself to be a drag on anyone if that has come then i must go  bianca placing herself beside him on her knees pressed her hot cheek against his temple  but it has not come dad  i hope not said mr stone i wish to end my book first  the sudden grim coherence of his last two sayings terrified bianca more than all his feverish utterances  i rely on your sitting quite still she said while i go and find her and with a feeling in her heart as though two hands had seized and were pulling it asunder she went out  some halfhour later hilary slipped quietly in and stood watching at the door mr stone seated on the very verge of his armchair with his hands on its arms was slowly rising to his feet and slowly falling back again not once but many times practising a standing posture as hilary came into his line of sight he said  i have succeeded twice  i am very glad said hilary wont you rest now sir  it is my knees said mr stone she has gone to find her  hilary heard those words with bewilderment and sitting down on the other chair waited  i have fancied said mr stone looking at him wistfully that when we pass away from life we may become the wind is that your opinion  it is a new thought to me said hilary  it is not tenable said mr stone but it is restful the wind is everywhere and nowhere and nothing can be hidden from it when i have missed that little girl i have tried in a sense to become the wind but i have found it difficult  his eyes left hilarys face whose mournful smile he had not noticed and fixed themselves on the bright fire in those days he said mens relation to the eternal airs was the relation of a billion little separate draughts blowing against the southwest wind they did not wish to merge themselves in that soft moonuttered sigh but blew in its face through crevices and cracks and keyholes and were borne away on the pellucid journey whistling out their protests  he again tried to stand evidently wishing to get to his desk to record this thought but failing looked painfully at hilary he seemed about to ask for something but checked himself  if i practise hard he murmured i shall master it  hilary rose and brought him paper and a pencil in bending he saw that mr stones eyes were dim with moisture this sight affected him so that he was glad to turn away and fetch a book to form a writingpad  when mr stone had finished he sat back in his chair with closed eyes a supreme silence reigned in the bare room above those two men of different generations and of such strange dissimilarity of character hilary broke that silence  i heard the cuckoo sing today he said almost in a whisper lest mr stone should be asleep  the cuckoo replied mr stone has no sense of brotherhood  i forgive himfor his song murmured hilary  his song said mr stone is alluring it excites the sexual instinct  then to himself he added  she has not come as yet  even as he spoke there was heard by hilary a faint tapping on the door he rose and opened it the little model stood outside     chapter xxix  return of the little model  that same afternoon in high street kensington westminister with his coatcollar raised against the inclement wind his old hat spotted with rain was drawing at a clay pipe and fixing his ironrimmed gaze on those who passed him by it had been a day when singularly few as yet had bought from him his faintly greentinged journal and the low class of fellow who sold the other evening prints had especially exasperated him his single mind always torn to some extent between an ingrained loyalty to his employers and those politics of his which differed from his papers had vented itself twice since coming on his stand once in these words to the seller of pell mells i stupulated with you not to come beyond the lamppost dont you never speak to me againacrowdin of me off my stand and once to the younger vendors of the less expensive journals thus oh you boys ill make you regret of itasnappin up my customers under my very nose wait until yere old to which the boys had answered all right daddy dont you have a fit youll be a deader soon enough without that yknow  it was now his time for tea but pell mell having gone to partake of this refreshment he waited on hoping against hope to get a customer or two of that low fellows and while in black insulation he stood there a timid voice said at his elbow  mr creed  the aged butler turned and saw the little model  oh he said dryly its you is it his mind with its incessant love of rank knowing that she earned her living as a handmaid to that disorderly establishment the house of art had from the first classed her as lower than a ladysmaid recent events had made him think of her unkindly her new clothes which he had not been privileged to see before while giving him a sense of sunday deepened his moral doubts  and where are you living now he said in tones incorporating these feelings  im not to tell you  oh very well keep yourself to yourself  the little models lower lip drooped more than ever there were dark marks beneath her eyes her face was altogether rather pinched and pitiful  wont you tell me any news she said in her matteroffact voice  the old butler gave a strange grunt  ho he said the babys dead and buried tomorrer  dead repeated the little model  im agoin to the funeralbrompton cemetery halfpast nine i leave the door and thats abeginnin at the end the mans in prison and the womans gone a shadder of herself  the little model rubbed her hands against her skirt  what did he go to prison for  for assaultin of her i was witness to his battery  why did he assault her  creed looked at her and wagging his head answered  thats best known to them as caused of it  the little models face went the colour of carnations  i cant help what he does she said what should i want him fora man like that it wouldnt be him id want the genuine contempt in that sharp burst of anger impressed the aged butler  im not asayin anything he said its all aone to me i never mixes up with no other peoples business but its very illconvenient i dont get my proper breakfast that poor womanshes half off her head when the babys buried ill have to go and look out for another room before he gets acomin out  i hope theyll keep him there muttered the little model suddenly  they give him a month said creed  only a month  the old butler looked at her theres more stuff in you he seemed to say than ever i had thought  because of his servin of his country he remarked aloud  im sorry about the poor little baby said the little model in her stolid voice  westminister shook his head i never suspected him of goin to live he said  the girl biting the fingertip of her white cotton glove was staring out at the traffic like a pale ray of light entering the now dim cavern of the old mans mind the thought came to creed that he did not quite understand her he had in his time had occasion to class many young persons and the feeling that he did not quite know her class of person was like the sensation a bat might have surprised by daylight  suddenly without saying goodbye to him she walked away  well he thought looking after her your manners aint improved by where youre living nor your appearance neither for all your new clothes and for some time he stood thinking of the stare in her eyes and that abrupt departure  through the crystal clearness of the fundamental flux the mind could see at that same moment bianca leaving her front gate  her sensuous exaltation her tremulous longing after harmony had passed away in her heart strangely mingled were these two thoughts if only she were a lady and i am glad she is not a lady  of all the dark and tortuous places of this life the human heart is the most dark and tortuous and of all human hearts none are less clear more intricate than the hearts of all that class of people among whom bianca had her being pride was a simple quality when joined with a simple view of life based on the plain philosophy of property pride was no simple quality when the hundred paralysing doubts and aspirations of a social conscience also hedged it round in thus going forth with the full intention of restoring the little model to her position in the household her pride fought against her pride and her womans sense of ownership in the man whom she had married wrestled with the acquired sentiments of freedom liberality equality good taste with her spirit thus confused and her mind so at variance with itself she was really acting on the simple instinct of compassion  she had run upstairs from mr stones room and now walked fast lest that instinct the most physical perhaps of allawakened by sights and sounds and requiring constant nourishmentshould lose its force  rapidly then she made her way to the grey street in bayswater where cecilia had told her that the girl now lived  the tall gaunt landlady admitted her  have you a miss barton lodging here bianca asked  yes said the landlady but i think shes out  she looked into the little models room  yes she said shes out but if youd like to leave a note you could write in here if youre looking for a model she wants work i believe  that modern faculty of pressing on an aching nerve was assuredly not lacking to bianca to enter the girls room was jabbing at the nerve indeed  she looked round her the mental vacuity of that little room there was not one single thingwith the exception of a torn copy of titbitswhich suggested that a mind of any sort lived there for all that perhaps because of that it was neat enough  yes said the landlady she keeps her room tidy of course shes a country girlcomes from down my way she said this with a dry twist of her grim but not unkindly features if it werent for that she went on i dont think i should care to let to one of her profession  her hungry eyes gazing at bianca had in them the aspirations of all nonconformity  bianca pencilled on her card  if you can come to my father today or tomorrow please do  will you give her this please it will be quite enough  ill give it her the landlady said shell be glad of it i daresay i see her sitting here girls like that if theyve got nothing to dosee shes been moping on her bed  the impress of a form was indeed clearly visible on the red and yellow tasselled tapestry of the bed  bianca cast a look at it  thank you she said good day  with the jabbed nerve aching badly she came slowly homewards  before the garden gate the little model herself was gazing at the house as if she had been there some time approaching from across the road bianca had an admirable view of that young figure now very trim and neat yet with something in its linesmore supple perhaps but less refinedwhich proclaimed her not a lady a something fundamentally undisciplined or disciplined by the material facts of life alone rather than by a secret creed of voluntary rules it showed here and there in ways women alone could understand above all in the way her eyes looked out on that house which she was clearly longing to enter not shall i go in was in that look but dare i go in  suddenly she saw bianca the meeting of these two was very like the ordinary meeting of a mistress and her maid biancas face had no expression except the faint distant curiosity which seems to say you are a sealed book to me i have always found you so what you really think and do i shall never know  the little models face wore a halfcaughtout halfstolid look  please go in bianca said my father will be glad to see you  she held the garden gate open for the girl to pass through her feeling at that moment was one of slight amusement at the futility of her journey not even this small piece of generosity was permitted her it seemed  how are you getting on  the little model made an impulsive movement at such an unexpected question checking it at once she answered  very well thank you that is not very  you will find my father tired today he has caught a chill dont let him read too much please  the little model seemed to try and nerve herself to make some statement but failing passed into the house  bianca did not follow but stole back into the garden where the sun was still falling on a bed of wallflowers at the far end she bent down over these flowers till her veil touched them two wild bees were busy there buzzing with smoky wings clutching with their black tiny legs at the orange petals plunging their black tiny tongues far down into the honeyed centres the flowers quivered beneath the weight of their small dark bodies biancas face quivered too bending close to them nor making the slightest difference to their hunt  hilary who it has been seen lived in thoughts about events rather than in events themselves and to whom crude acts and words had little meaning save in relation to what philosophy could make of them greeted with a startled movement the girls appearance in the corridor outside mr stones apartment but the little model who mentally lived very much from hand to mouth and had only the philosophy of wants acted differently she knew that for the last five days like a spaniel dog shut away from where it feels it ought to be she had wanted to be where she was now standing she knew that in her new room with its rustred doors she had bitten her lips and fingers till blood came and as newly caged birds will flutter had beaten her wings against those walls with blue roses on a yellow ground she remembered how she had lain brooding on that piece of red and yellow tapestry twisting its tassels staring through halfclosed eyes at nothing  there was something different in her look at hilary it had lost some of its childish devotion it was bolder as if she had lived and felt and brushed a good deal more down off her wings during those few days  mrs dallison told me to come she said i thought i might mr creed told me about him being in prison  hilary made way for her and following her into mr stones presence shut the door  the truant has returned he said  hearing herself called so unjustly by that name the little model gushed deeply and tried to speak she stopped at the smile on hilarys face and gazed from him to mr stone and back again the victim of mingled feelings  mr stone was seen to have risen to his feet and to be very slowly moving towards his desk he leaned both arms on his papers for support and seeming to gather strength began sorting out his manuscript  through the open window the distant music of a barrelorgan came drifting in faint and much too slow was the sound of the waltz it played but there was invitation allurement in that tune the little model turned towards it and hilary looked hard at her the girl and that sound togetherthere quite plain was the music he had heard for many days like a man lying with the touch of fever on him  are you ready said mr stone  the little model dipped her pen in ink her eyes crept towards the door where hilary was still standing with the same expression on his face he avoided her eyes and went up to mr stone  must you read today sir  mr stone looked at him with anger  why not he said  you are hardly strong enough  mr stone raised his manuscript  we are three days behind and very slowly he began dictating barbarous habits in those days such as the custom known as war his voice died away it was apparent that his elbows leaning on the desk alone prevented his collapse  hilary moved the chair and taking him beneath the arms lowered him gently into it  noticing that he was seated mr stone raised his manuscript and read on were pursued regardless of fraternity it was as though a herd of horned cattle driven through green pastures to that gate where they must meet with certain dissolution had set about to prematurely gore and disembowel each other out of a passionate devotion to those individual shapes which they were so soon to lose so mentribe against tribe and country against countryglared across the valleys with their ensanguined eyes they could not see the moonlit wings or feel the embalming airs of brotherhood  slower and slower came his sentences and as the last word died away he was heard to be asleep breathing through a tiny hole left beneath the eave of his moustache hilary who had waited for that moment gently put the manuscript on the desk and beckoned to the girl he did not ask her to his study but spoke to her in the hall  while mr stone is like this he misses you you will come then at present please so long as hughs is in prison how do you like your room  the little model answered simply not very much  why not  its lonely there i shant mind now im coming here again  only for the present was all hilary could find to say  the little models eyes were lowered  mrs hughs babys to be buried tomorrow she said suddenly  where  in brompton cemetery mr creeds going  what time is the funeral  the girl looked up stealthily  mr creeds going to start at halfpast nine  i should like to go myself said hilary  a gleam of pleasure passing across her face was instantly obscured behind the cloud of her stolidity then as she saw hilary move nearer to the door her lip began to droop  well goodbye he said  the little model flushed and quivered you dont even look at me she seemed to say you havent spoken kindly to me once and suddenly she said in a hard voice  now i shant go to mr lennards any more  oh then you have been to him  triumph at attracting his attention fear of what she had admitted supplication and a halfdefiant shameall this was in her face  yes she said  hilary did not speak  i didnt care any more when you told me i wasnt to come here  still hilary did not speak  i havent done anything wrong she said with tears in her voice  no no said hilary of course not  the little model choked  its my profession  yes yes said hilary its all right  i dont care what he thinks i wont go again so long as i can come here  hilary touched her shoulder  well well he said and opened the front door  the little model tremulous like a flower kissed by the sun after rain went out with a light in her eyes  the master of the house returned to mr stone long he sat looking at the old mans slumber a thinker meditating upon action so might hilarys figure with its thin face resting on its hand a furrow between the brows and that painful smile have been entitled in any catalogue of statues     chapter xxx  funeral of a baby  following out the instinct planted so deeply in human nature for treating with the utmost care and at great expense when dead those who when alive have been served with careless parsimony there started from the door of no 1 in hound street a funeral procession of three fourwheeled cabs the first bore the little coffin on which lay a great white wreath gift of cecilia and thyme the second bore mrs hughs her son stanley and joshua creed the third bore martin stone in the first cab silence was presiding with the scent of lilies over him who in his short life had made so little noise the small grey shadow which had crept so quietly into being and taking his chance when he was not noticed had crept so quietly out again never had he felt so restful so much at home as in that little common coffin washed as he was to an unnatural whiteness and wrapped in his mothers only spare sheet away from all the strife of men he was journeying to a greater peace his little aloeplant had flowered and between the open windows of the only carriage he had ever been inside the windwhich who knows he had perhaps becomestirred the fronds of fern and the flowers of his funeral wreath thus he was going from that world where all men were his brothers  from the second cab the same wind was rigidly excluded and there was silence broken by the aged butlers breathing dressed in his newmarket coat he was recalling with a certain sense of luxury past journeys in fourwheeled cabsoccasions when seated beside a box corded and secured with sealingwax he had taken his masters plate for safety to the bank occasions when under a roof piled up with guns and boxes he had sat holding the honorable batesons dog occasions when with some young person by his side he had driven at the tail of a baptismal nuptial or funeral cortege these memories of past grandeur came back to him with curious poignancy and for some reason the words kept rising in his mind for richer or poorer for better or worser in health and in sick places till death do us part but in the midst of the exaltation of these recollections the old heart beneath his old red flannel chestprotectorthat companion of his exiletwittering faintly at short intervals made him look at the woman by his side he longed to convey to her some little of the satisfaction he felt in the fact that this was by no means the low class of funeral it might have been he doubted whether with her womans mind she was getting all the comfort she could out of three fourwheeled cabs and a wreath of lilies the seamstresss thin face with its pinched passive look was indeed thinner quieter than ever what she was thinking of he could not tell there were so many things she might be thinking of she too no doubt had seen her grandeur if but in the solitary drive away from the church where eight years ago she and hughs had listened to the words now haunting creed was she thinking of that of her lost youth and comeliness and her mans dead love of the long descent to shadowland of the other children she had buried of hughs in prison of the girl that had put a spell on him or only of the last precious tugs the tiny lips at rest in the first fourwheeled cab had given at her breast or was she with a nicer feeling for proportion reflecting that had not people been so kind she might have had to walk behind a funeral provided by the parish  the old butler could not tell but hewhose one desire now coupled with the wish to die outside a workhouse was to save enough to bury his own body without the interference of other peoplewas inclined to think she must be dwelling on the brighter side of things and designing to encourage her he said wonderful improvement in these ere fourwheel cabs oh dear yes i remember of them when they were the shadders of what they are at the present time of speakin  the seamstress answered in her quiet voice very comfortable this is sit still stanley her little son whose feet did not reach the floor was drumming his heels against the seat he stopped and looked at her and the old butler addressed him  youll aremember of this occasion he said when you gets older  the little boy turned his black eyes from his mother to him who had spoken last  its a beautiful wreath continued creed i could smell of it all the way up the stairs theres been no expense spared theres white laylock in itthats a class of flower thats very extravagant  a train of thought having been roused too strong for his discretion he added i saw that young girl yesterday she came interrogatin of me in the street  on mrs hughs face where till now expression had been buried came such a look as one may see on the face of an owlhard watchful cruel harder more cruel for the softness of the big dark eyes  shed show a better feeling she said to keep a quiet tongue sit still stanley  once more the little boy stopped drumming his heels and shifted his stare from the old butler back to her who spoke the cab which had seemed to hesitate and start as though jibbing at something in the road resumed its ambling pace creed looked through the wellclosed window there before him so long that it seemed to have no end like a building in a nightmare stretched that place where he did not mean to end his days he faced towards the horse again the colour had deepened in his nose he spoke  if theyd agive me my last edition earlier stead of sending of it down after that lowclass fellers taken all my customers thatd make a difference to me o two shillins at the utmost in the week and all clear savins to these words dark with hidden meaning he received no answer save the drumming of the small boys heels and reverting to the subject he had been distracted from he murmured she was awearin of new clothes  he was startled by the fierce tone of a voice he hardly knew i dont want to hear about her shes not for decent folk to talk of  the old butler looked round askance the seamstress was trembling violently her fierceness at such a moment shocked him dust to dust he thought  dont you be considerate of it he said at last summoning all his knowledge of the world shell come to her own place and at the sight of a slow tear trickling over her burning cheek he added hurriedly think of your babyill see yer through sit still little boysit still yere disturbin of your mother  once more the little boy stayed the drumming of his heels to look at him who spoke and the closed cab rolled on with its slow jingling sound  in the third fourwheeled cab where the windows again were wide open martin stone with his hands thrust deep into the pockets of his coat and his long legs crossed sat staring at the roof with a sort of twisted scorn on his pale face  just inside the gate through which had passed in their time so many dead and living shadows hilary stood waiting he could probably not have explained why he had come to see this tiny shade committed to the earthin memory perhaps of those two minutes when the babys eyes had held parley with his own or in the wish to pay a mute respect to her on whom life had weighed so hard of late for whatever reason he had come he was keeping quietly to one side and unobserved he too had his watcherthe little model sheltering behind a tall grave  two men in rusty black bore the little coffin then came the whiterobed chaplain then mrs hughs and her little son close behind his head thrust forward with trembling movements from side to side old creed and last of all young martin stone hilary joined the young doctor so the five mourners walked  before a small dark hole in a corner of the cemetery they stopped on this forest of unflowered graves the sun was falling the east wind with its faint reek touched the old butlers plastered hair and brought moisture to the corners of his eyes fixed with absorption on the chaplain words and thoughts hunted in his mind  hes gettin christian burial who gives this woman away i do ashes to ashes i never suspected him of livin the conning of the burial service shortened to fit the passing of that tiny shade gave him pleasurable sensation films came down on his eyes he listened like some old parrot on its perch his head a little to one side  them as dies young he thought goes straight to heaven we trusts in godall mortal men his godfathers and his godmothers in his baptism well so it is im not afeared o death  seeing the little coffin tremble above the hole he craned his head still further forward it sank a smothered sobbing rose the old butler touched the arm in front of him with shaking fingers  dont e he whispered hes agone to glory  but hearing the dry rattle of the earth he took out his own handkerchief and put it to his nose  yes hes agone he thought another little baby old men an maidens young men an little children its agoin on all the time where e is now therell be no marryin no nor givin out in marriage till death do us part  the wind sweeping across the filledin hole carried the rustle of his husky breathing the dry smothered sobbing of the seamstress out across the shadows graves to those places to those streets  from the babys funeral hilary and martin walked away together and far behind them across the road the little model followed for some time neither spoke then hilary stretching out his hand towards a squalid alley said  they haunt us and drag us down a long dark passage is there a light at the far end martin  yes said martin gruffly  i dont see it  martin looked at him  hamlet  hilary did not reply  the young man watched him sideways its a disease to smile like that  hilary ceased to smile cure me then he said with sudden anger you man of health  the young sanitists sallow cheeks flushed atrophy of the nerve of action he muttered theres no cure for that  ah said hilary all kinds of us want social progress in our different ways you your grandfather my brother myself there are four types for you will you tell me any one of us is the right man for the job for instance actions not natural to me  any act answered martin is better than no act  and myopia is natural to you martin your prescription in this case has not been too successful has it  i cant help it if people will be dd fools  there you hit it but answer me this question isnt a social conscience broadly speaking the result of comfort and security  martin shrugged his shoulders  and doesnt comfort also destroy the power of action  again martin shrugged  then if those who have the social conscience and can see what is wrong have lost their power of action how can you say there is any light at the end of this dark passage  martin took his pipe out filled it and pressed the filling with his thumb  there is light he said at last in spite of all invertebrates goodbye ive wasted enough time and he abruptly strode away  and in spite of myopia muttered hilary  a few minutes later coming out from messrs rose and thorns where he had gone to buy tobacco he came suddenly on the little model evidently waiting  i was at the funeral she said and her face added plainly ive followed you uninvited she walked on at his side  this is not the same girl he thought that i sent away five days ago she has lost something gained something i dont know her  there seemed such a stubborn purpose in her face and manner it was like the look in a dogs eyes that says master you thought to shut me up away from you i know now what that is like do what you will i mean in future to be near you  this look by its simplicity frightened one to whom the primitive was strange desiring to free himself of his companion yet not knowing how hilary sat down in kensington gardens on the first bench they came to the little model sat down beside him the quiet siege laid to him by this girl was quite uncanny it was as though someone were binding him with toy threads swelling slowly into rope before his eyes in this fear of hilarys there was at first much irritation his fastidiousness and sense of the ridiculous were roused what did this little creature with whom he had no thoughts and no ideas in common whose spirit and his could never hope to meet think that she could get from him was she trying to weave a spell over him too with her mute stubborn adoration was she trying to change his protective weakness for her to another sort of weakness he turned and looked she dropped her eyes at once and sat still as a stone figure  as in her spirit so in her body she was different her limbs looked freer rounder her breath seemed stirring her more deeply like a flower of early june she was opening before his very eyes this though it gave him pleasure also added to his fear the strange silence in its utter naturalnessfor what could he talk about with herbrought home to him more vividly than anything before the barriers of class all he thought of was how not to be ridiculous she was inviting him in some strange unconscious subtle way to treat her as a woman as though in spirit she had linked her round young arms about his neck and through her halfclosed lips were whispering the eternal call of sex to sex and he a middleaged and cultivated man conscious of everything could not even speak for fear of breaking through his shell of delicacy he hardly breathed disturbed to his very depths by the young figure sitting by his side and by the dread of showing that disturbance  beside the cultivated plant the selfsown poppy rears itself round the stem of a smooth tree the honeysuckle twines to a trim wall the ivy clings  in her newfound form and purpose this girl had gained a strange still power she no longer felt it mattered whether he spoke or looked at her her instinct piercing through his shell was certain of the throbbing of his pulses the sweet poison in his blood  the perception of this still power more than all else brought fear to hilary he need not speak she would not care he need not even look at her she had but to sit there silent motionless with the breath of youth coming through her parted lips and the light of youth stealing through her halfclosed eyes  and abruptly he got up and walked away     chapter xxxi  swan song  the new wine if it does not break the old bottle after fierce effervescence seethes and bubbles quietly  it was so in mr stones old bottle hour by hour and day by day throughout the month a pinker robuster look came back to his cheeks his blue eyes fixed on distance had in them more light his knees regained their powers he bathed and all unknown to him for he only saw the waters he cleaved with his ineffably slow stroke hilary and martin on alternate weeks and keeping at a proper distance for fear he should see them doing him a service attended at that function in case mr stone should again remain too long seated at the bottom of the serpentine each morning after his cocoa and porridge he could be heard sweeping out his room with extraordinary vigour and as ten oclock came near anyone who listened would remark a sound of air escaping as he moved up and down on his toes in preparation for the labours of the day no letters of course nor any newspapers disturbed the supreme and perfect selfcontainment of this life devoted to fraternityno letters partly because he lacked a known address partly because for years he had not answered them and with regard to newspapers once a month he went to a public library and could be seen with the last four numbers of two weekly reviews before him making himself acquainted with the habits of those days and moving his lips as though in prayer at ten each morning anyone in the corridor outside his room was startled by the whirr of an alarum clock perfect silence followed then rose a sound of shuffling whistling rustling broken by sharply muttered words soon from this turbid lake of sound the articulate thin fluting of an old mans voice streamed forth this alternating with the squeak of a quill pen went on till the alarum clock once more went off then he who stood outside could smell that mr stone would shortly eat if stimulated by that scent he entered he might see the author of the book of universal brotherhood with a baked potato in one hand and a cup of hot milk in the other on the table too the ruined forms of eggs tomatoes oranges bananas figs prunes cheese and honeycomb which had passed into other forms already together with a loaf of wholemeal bread mr stone would presently emerge in his cottagewoven tweeds and old hat of greenblack felt or if wet in a long coat of yellow gaberdine and souwester cap of the same material but always with a little osier fruitbag in his hand thus equipped he walked down to rose and thorns entered and to the first man he saw handed the osier fruitbag some coins and a little book containing seven leaves headed food monday tuesday wednesday and so forth he then stood looking through the pickles in some jar or other at things beyond with one hand held out fingers upwards awaiting the return of his little osier fruitbag feeling presently that it had been restored to him he would turn and walk out of the shop behind his back on the face of the department the same protecting smile always rose long habit had perfected it all now felt that though so very different from themselves this aged customer was dependent on them by not one single farthing or one pale slip of cheese would they have defrauded him for all the treasures of the moon and any new salesman who laughed at that old client was promptly told to shut his head  mr stones frail form bent somewhat to one side by the increased gravamen of the osier bag was now seen moving homewards he arrived perhaps ten minutes before the three oclock alarum and soon passing through preliminary chaos the articulate thin fluting of his voice streamed forth again broken by the squeaking and spluttering of his quill  but towards four oclock signs of cerebral excitement became visible his lips would cease to utter sounds his pen to squeak his face with a flushed forehead would appear at the open window as soon as the little model came in sighther eyes fixed not on his window but on hilaryshe turned his back evidently waiting for her to enter by the door his first words were uttered in a tranquil voice i have several pages i have placed your chair are you ready follow  except for that strange tranquillity of voice and the disappearance of the flush on his brow there was no sign of the rejuvenescence that she brought of such refreshment as steals on the traveller who sits down beneath a limetree toward the end of along days journey no sign of the mysterious comfort distilled into his veins by the sight of her moody young face her young soft limbs so from some stimulant men very near their end will draw energy watching as it were a shape beckoning them forward till suddenly it disappears in darkness  in the quarter of an hour sacred to their tea and conversation he never noticed that she was always listening for sounds beyond it was enough that in her presence he felt singleness of purpose strong within him  when she had gone moving languidly moodily away her eyes darting about for signs of hilary mr stone would sit down rather suddenly and fall asleep to dream perhaps of youthyouth with its scent of sap its close beckonings youth with its hopes and fears youth that hovers round us so long after it is dead his spirit would smile behind its coveringthat thin china of his face and as dogs hunting in their sleep work their feet so he worked the fingers resting on his woollen knees  the seven oclock alarum woke him to the preparation of the evening meal this eaten he began once more to pace up and down to pour words out into the silence and to drive his squeaking quill  so was being written a book such as the world had never seen  but the girl who came so moodily to bring him refreshment and went so moodily away never in these days caught a glimpse of that which she was seeking  since the morning when he had left her abruptly hilary had made a point of being out in the afternoons and not returning till past six oclock by this device he put off facing her and himself for he could no longer refuse to see that he had himself to face in the few minutes of utter silence when the girl sat beside him magnetic quivering with awakening force he had found that the male in him was far from dead it was no longer vague sensuous feeling it was warm definite desire the more she was in his thoughts the less spiritual his feeling for this girl of the people had become  in those days he seemed much changed to such as knew him well instead of the delicate detached slightly humorous suavity which he had accustomed people to expect from him the dry kindliness which seemed at once to check confidence and yet to say if you choose to tell me anything i should never think of passing judgment on you whatever you have doneinstead of that rather abstracted faintly quizzical air his manner had become absorbed and gloomy he seemed to jib away from his friends his manner at the pen and ink was wholly unsatisfying to men who liked to talk he was known to be writing a new book they suspected him of having got into a hatthis victorian expression found by mr balladyce in some chronicle of postthackerayan manners and revived by him in his incomparable way as who should say what delicious expressions those good bourgeois had now flourished in second childhood  in truth hilarys difficulty with his new book was merely the one of not being able to work at it at all even the housemaid who did his study noticed that day after day she was confronted by chapter xxiv in spite of her employers staying in as usual every morning  the change in his manner and face which had grown strained and harassed had been noticed by bianca though she would have died sooner than admit she had noticed anything about him it was one of those periods in the lives of households like an hour of a late summers daybrooding electric as yet quiescent but charged with the currents of coming storms  twice only in those weeks while hughs was in prison did hilary see the girl once he met her when he was driving home she blushed crimson and her eyes lighted up and one morning too he passed her on the bench where they had sat together she was staring straight before her the corners of her mouth drooping discontentedly she did not see him  to a man like hilaryfor whom running after women had been about the last occupation in the world who had in fact always fought shy of them and imagined that they would always fight shy of himthere was an unusual enticement and dismay in the feeling that a young girl really was pursuing him it was at once too good too unlikely and too embarrassing to be true his sudden feeling for her was the painful sensation of one who sees a ripe nectarine hanging within reach he dreamed continually of stretching out his hand and so he did not dare or thought he did not dare to pass that way all this did not favour the tenor of a studious introspective life it also brought a sense of unreality which made him avoid his best friends this partly was why stephen came to see him one sunday his other reason for the visit being the calculation that hughs would be released on the following wednesday  this girl he thought is going to the house still and hilary will let things drift till he cant stop them and therell be a real mess  the fact of the mans having been in prison gave a sinister turn to an affair regarded hitherto as merely sordid by stephens orderly and careful mind  crossing the garden he heard mr stones voice issuing through the open window  cant the old crank stop even on sundays he thought  he found hilary in his study reading a book on the civilisation of the maccabees in preparation for a review he gave stephen but a dubious welcome  stephen broke ground gently  we havent seen you for an age i hear our old friend at it is he working double tides to finish his magnum opus i thought he observed the day of rest  he does as a rule said hilary  well hes got the girl there now dictating  hilary winced stephen continued with greater circumspection you couldnt get the old boy to finish by wednesday i suppose he must be quite near the end by now  the notion of mr stones finishing his book by wednesday procured a pale smile from hilary  could you get your law courts he said to settle up the affairs of mankind for good and all by wednesday  by jove is it as bad as that i thought at any rate he must be meaning to finish some day  when men are brothers said hilary he will finish  stephen whistled  look here dear boy he said that ruffian comes out on wednesday the whole thing will begin over again  hilary rose and paced the room i refuse he said to consider hughs a ruffian what do we know about him or any of them  precisely what do we know of this girl  i am not going to discuss that hilary said shortly  for a moment the faces of the two brothers wore a hard hostile look as though the deep difference between their characters had at last got the better of their loyalty they both seemed to recognise this for they turned their heads away  i just wanted to remind you stephen said though you know your own business best of course and at hilarys nod he thought  thats just exactly what he doesnt  he soon left conscious of an unwonted awkwardness in his brothers presence hilary watched him out through the wicket gate then sat down on the solitary garden bench  stephens visit had merely awakened perverse desires in him strong sunlight was falling on that little london garden disclosing its native shadowiness streaks and smudges such as life smears over the faces of those who live too consciously hilary beneath the acaciatree not yet in bloom marked an early butterfly flitting over the geraniums blossoming round an old sundial blackbirds were holding evensong the late perfume of the lilac came stealing forth into air faintly smeeched with chimney smoke there was brightness but no glory in that little garden scent but no strong air blown across golden lakes of buttercups from seas of springing clover or the windsilver of young wheat music but no full choir of sound no hum like the face and figure of its master so was this little garden whose sundial the sun seldom reachedrefined selfconscious introspective obviously a creature of the town at that moment however hilary was not looking quite himself his face was flushed his eyes angry almost as if he had been a man of action  the voice of mr stone was still audible fitfully quavering out into the air and the old man himself could now and then be seen holding up his manuscript his profile clearcut against the darkness of the room a sentence travelled out across the garden  amidst the turbulent discoveries of those days which like crosscurrented and multibillowed seas lapped and hollowed every rock   a motorcar dashing past drowned the rest and when the voice rose again it was evidently dictating another paragraph  in those places in those streets the shadows swarmed whispering and droning like a hive of dying bees who their honey eaten wander through the winter day seeking flowers that are frozen and dead  a great bee which had been busy with the lilac began to circle booming round his hair suddenly hilary saw mr stone raise both his arms  in huge congeries crowded devoid of light and air they were assembled these bloodless imprints from forms of higher caste they lay like the reflection of leaves which fluttering free in the sweet winds let fall to the earth wan resemblances imponderous dark ghosts wandering ones chained to the ground they had no hope of any lovely city nor knew whence they had come men cast them on the pavements and marched on they did not in universal brotherhood clasp their shadows to sleep within their heartsfor the sun was not then at noon when no man has a shadow  as those words of swan song died away he swayed and trembled and suddenly disappeared below the sightline as if he had sat down the little model took his place in the open window she started at seeing hilary then motionless stood gazing at him out of the gloom of the opening her eyes were all pupil two spots of the surrounding darkness imprisoned in a face as pale as any flower rigid as the girl herself hilary looked up at her  a voice behind him said how are you i thought id give my car a run mr purcey was coming from the gate his eyes fixed on the window where the girl stood how is your wife he added  the bathos of this visit roused an acid fury in hilary he surveyed mr purceys figure from his clothtopped boots to his tall hat and said shall we go in and find her  as they went along mr purcey said thats the youngtheermodel i met in your wifes studio isnt it pretty girl  hilary compressed his lips  now what sort of living do those girls make pursued mr purcey i suppose theyve most of them other resources eh what  they make the living god will let them i suppose as other people do  mr purcey gave him a sharp look it was almost as if dallison had meant to snub him  oh exactly i should think this girl would have no difficulty and suddenly he saw a curious change come over that writing fellow as he always afterwards described hilary instead of a mild pleasantlooking chap enough he had become a regular cold devil  my wife appears to be out hilary said i also have an engagement  in his surprise and anger mr purcey said with great simplicity sorry im de trop and soon his car could be heard bearing him away with some unnecessary noise     chapter xxxii  behind biancas veil  but bianca was not out she had been a witness of hilarys long look at the little model coming from her studio through the glass passage to the house she could not of course see what he was gazing at but she knew as well as if the girl had stood before her in the dark opening of the window hating herself for having seen she went to her room and lay on her bed with her hands pressed to her eyes she was used to lonelinessthat necessary lot of natures such as hers but the bitter isolation of this hour was such as to drive even her lonely nature to despair  she rose at last and repaired the ravages made in her face and dress lest anyone should see that she was suffering then first making sure that hilary had left the garden she stole out  she wandered towards hyde park it was whitsuntide a time of fear to the cultivated londoner the town seemed all arid jollity and paper bags whirled on a dusty wind people swarmed everywhere in clothes which did not suit them desultory deadtired creatures who in these few green hours of leisure out of the sandy eternity of their toil were not suffered to rest but were whipped on by starved instincts to hunt pleasures which they longed for too dreadfully to overtake  bianca passed an old tramp asleep beneath a tree his clothes had clung to him so long and lovingly that they were falling off but his face was calm as though masked with the finest wax forgotten were his sores and sorrows he was in the blessed fields of sleep  bianca hastened away from the sight of such utter peace she wandered into a grove of trees which had almost eluded the notice of the crowd they were limes guarding still within them their honey bloom their branches of light broad leaves near heartshaped were spread out like wide skirts the tallest of these trees a beautiful gay creature stood tremulous like a mistress waiting for her tardy lover what joy she seemed to promise what delicate enticement with every veined quivering leaf and suddenly the sun caught hold of her raised her up to him kissed her all over she gave forth a sigh of happiness as though her very spirit had travelled through her lips up to her lovers heart  a woman in a lilac frock came stealing through the trees towards bianca and sitting down not far off kept looking quickly round under her sunshade  presently bianca saw what she was looking for a young man in black coat and shining hat came swiftly up and touched her shoulder half hidden by the foliage they sat leaning forward prodding gently at the ground with stick and parasol the stealthy murmur of their talk so soft and intimate that no word was audible stole across the grass and secretly he touched her hand and arm they were not of the holiday crowd and had evidently chosen out this vulgar afternoon for a stolen meeting  bianca rose and hurried on amongst the trees she left the park in the streets many couples not so careful to conceal their intimacy were parading arminarm the sight of them did not sting her like the sight of those lovers in the park they were not of her own order but presently she saw a little boy and girl asleep on the doorstep of a mansion with their cheeks pressed close together and their arms round each other and again she hurried on in the course of that long wandering she passed the building which westminister was so anxious to avoid in its gateway an old couple were just about to separate one to the mens the other to the womens quarters their toothless mouths were close together well goodnight mother goodnight father goodnighttake care o yourself  once more bianca hurried on  it was past nine when she turned into the old square and rang the bell of her sisters house with the sheer physical desire to restsomewhere that was not her home  at one end of the long low drawingroom stephen in evening dress was reading aloud from a review cecilia was looking dubiously at his sock where she seemed to see a tiny speck of white that might be stephen in the window at the far end thyme and martin were exchanging speeches at short intervals they made no move at biancas entrance and their faces said we have no use for that handshaking nonsense  receiving cecilias little warm doubting kiss and stephens polite dry handshake bianca motioned to him not to stop reading he resumed cecilia too resumed her scrutiny of stephens sock  oh dear she thought i know bs come here because shes unhappy poor thing poor hilary its that wretched business again i suppose  skilled in every tone of stephens voice she knew that biancas entry had provoked the same train of thought in him to her he seemed reading out these words i disapprovei disapprove shes ciss sister but if it wasnt for old hilary i wouldnt have the subject in the house  bianca whose subtlety recorded every shade of feeling could see that she was not welcome leaning back with veil raised she seemed listening to stephens reading but in fact she was quivering at the sight of those two couples  couples couplesfor all but her what crime had she committed why was the china of her cup flawed so that no one could drink from it why had she been made so that nobody could love her this the most bitter of all thoughts the most tragic of all questionings haunted her  the article which stephen readexplaining exactly how to deal with people so that from one sort of human being they might become another and going on to prove that if after this conversion they showed signs of a reversion it would then be necessary to know the reason whyfell dryly on ears listening to that eternal question why is it with me as it is it is not fairlistening to the constant murmuring of her pride i am not wanted here or anywhere better to efface myself  from their end of the room thyme and martin scarcely looked at her to them she was aunt b an amateur the mockery of whose eyes sometimes penetrated their youthful armour they were besides too interested in their conversation to perceive that she was suffering the skirmish of that conversation had lasted now for many daysever since the death of the hughs baby  well martin was saying what are you going to do its no good to base it on the baby you must know your own mind all round you cant go rushing into real work on mere sentiment  you went to the funeral martin its bosh to say you didnt feel it too  martin deigned no answer to this insinuation  weve gone past the need for sentiment he said its exploded so is justice administered by an upper class with a patch over one eye and a squint in the other when you see a dying donkey in a field you dont want to refer the case to a society as your dad would you dont want an essay of hilarys full of sympathy with everybody on walking in a field with reflections on the end of donkeysyou want to put a bullet in the donkey  youre always down on uncle hilary said thyme  i dont mind hilary himself i object to his type  well he objects to yours said thyme  im not so sure of that said martin slowly he hasnt got character enough  thyme raised her chin and looking at him through halfclosed eyes said well i do think of all the conceited persons i ever met youre the worst  martins nostril curled  are you prepared he said to put a bullet in the donkey or are you not  i only see one donkey and not a dying one  martin stretched out his hand and gripped her arm below the elbow retaining it luxuriously he said dont wander  thyme tried to free her arm let go  martin was looking straight into her eyes a flush had risen in his cheeks  thyme too went the colour of the oldrose curtain behind which she sat  let go  i wont ill make you know your mind what do you mean to do are you coming in a fit of sentiment or do you mean business  suddenly halfhypnotised the young girl ceased to struggle her face had the strangest expression of submission and defiancea sort of pain a sort of delight so they sat full half a minute staring at each others eyes hearing a rustling sound they looked and saw bianca moving to the door cecilia too had risen  what is it b  bianca opening the door went out cecilia followed swiftly too late to catch even a glimpse of her sisters face behind the veil  in mr stones room the green lamp burned dimly and he who worked by it was sitting on the edge of his campbed attired in his old brown woollen gown and slippers  and suddenly it seemed to him that he was not alone  i have finished for tonight he said i am waiting for the moon to rise she is nearly full i shall see her face from here  a form sat down by him on the bed and a voice said softly  like a womans  mr stone saw his younger daughter you have your hat on are you going out my dear  i saw your light as i came in  the moon said mr stone is an arid desert love is unknown there  how can you bear to look at her then bianca whispered  mr stone raised his finger she has risen  the wan moon had slipped out into the darkness her light stole across the garden and through the open window to the bed where they were sitting  where there is no love dad bianca said there can be no life can there  mr stones eyes seemed to drink the moonlight  that he said is the great truth the bed is shaking  with her arms pressed tight across her breast bianca was struggling with violent noiseless sobbing that desperate struggle seemed to be tearing her to death before his eyes and mr stone sat silent trembling he knew not what to do from his frosted heart years of universal brotherhood had taken all knowledge of how to help his daughter he could only sit touching her tremulously with thin fingers  the form beside him whose warmth he felt against his arm grew stiller as though in spite of its own loneliness his helplessness had made it feel that he too was lonely it pressed a little closer to him the moonlight gaining pale mastery over the flickering lamp filled the whole room  mr stone said i want her mother  the form beside him ceased to struggle  finding out an old forgotten way mr stones arm slid round that quivering body  i do not know what to say to her he muttered and slowly he began to rock himself  motion he said is soothing  the moon passed on the form beside him sat so still that mr stone ceased moving his daughter was no longer sobbing suddenly her lips seared his forehead  trembling from that desperate caress he raised his fingers to the spot and looked round  she was gone     chapter xxxiii  hilary deals with the situation  to understand the conduct of hilary and bianca at what westminister would have called this crisax not only their feelings as sentient human beings but their matrimonial philosophy must be taken into account by education and environment they belonged to a section of society which had in those days abandoned the more oldfashioned views of marriage such as composed this section finding themselves in opposition not only to the orthodox proprietary creed but even to their own legal rights had been driven to an attitude of almost blatant freedom like all folk in opposition they were bound as a simple matter of principle to disagree with those in power to view with a contemptuous resentment that majority which said i believe the thing is mine and mine it shall remaina majority which by force of numbers made this creed the law unable legally to be other than the proprietors of wife or husband as the case might be they were obliged even in the most happy unions to be very careful not to become disgusted with their own position their legal status was as it were a goad spurring them on to show their horror of it they were like children sent to school with trousers that barely reached their knees aware that they could neither reduce their stature to the proportions of their breeches nor make their breeches grow they were furnishing an instance of that immemorial change of form to form to which mr stone had given the name of life in a past age thinkers and dreamers and artistic pigs rejecting the forms they found had given unconscious shape to this marriage law which after they had become the wind had formed itself out of their exiled pictures and thoughts and dreams and now this particular law in turn was the dried rind devoid of pips or speculation and the thinkers and dreamers and artistic pigs were again rejecting it and again themselves in exile  this exiled faith this honour amongst thieves animated a little conversation between hilary and bianca on the tuesday following the night when mr stone sat on his bed to watch the rising moon  quietly bianca said i think i shall be going away for a time  wouldnt you rather that i went instead you are wanted i am not  that icecold iceclear remark contained the pith of the whole matter and hilary said  you are not going at once  at the end of the week i think  noting his eyes fixed on her she added  yes were neither of us looking quite our best  i am sorry  i know you are  this had been all it had been sufficient to bring hilary once more face to face with the situation  its constituent elements remained the same relative values had much changed the temptations of st anthony were becoming more poignant every hour he had no principles to pit against them he had merely the inveterate distaste for hurting anybody and a feeling that if he yielded to his inclination he would be faced ultimately with a worse situation than ever it was not possible for him to look at the position as mr purcey might have done if his wife had withdrawn from him and a girl had put herself in his way neither hesitation because of the defenceless position of the girl nor hesitation because of his own future with her would have troubled mr purcey hegood manin his straightforward way would have only thought about the presentnot indeed intending to have a future with a young person of that class consideration for a wife who had withdrawn from the society of mr purcey would also naturally have been absent from the equation that hilary worried over all these questions was the mark of his fin de sieclism and in the meantime the facts demanded a decision  he had not spoken to this girl since the day of the babys funeral but in that long look from the garden he had in effect said you are drawing me to the only sort of union possible to us and she in effect had answered do what you like with me  there were other facts too to be reckoned with hughs would be released tomorrow the little model would not stop her visits unless forced to mr stone could not well do without her bianca had in effect declared that she was being driven out of her own house it was this situation which hilary seated beneath the bust of socrates turned over and over in his mind long and painful reflection brought him back continually to the thought that he himself and not bianca had better go away he was extremely bitter and contemptuous towards himself that he had not done so long ago he made use of the names martin had given him hamlet amateur invertebrate they gave him unfortunately little comfort  in the afternoon he received a visit mr stone came in with his osier fruitbag in his hand he remained standing and spoke at once  is my daughter happy  at this unexpected question hilary walked over to the fireplace  no he said at last i am afraid she is not  why  hilary was silent then facing the old man he said  i think she will be glad for certain reasons if i go away for a time  when are you going asked mr stone  as soon as i can  mr stones eyes wistfully bright seemed trying to see through heavy fog  she came to me i think he said i seem to recollect her crying you are good to her  i have tried to be said hilary  mr stones face was discoloured by a flush you have no children he said painfully do you live together  hilary shook his head  you are estranged said mr stone  hilary bowed there was a long silence mr stones eyes had travelled to the window  without love there cannot be life he said at last and fixing his wistful gaze on hilary asked does she love another  again hilary shook his head  when mr stone next spoke it was clearly to himself  i do not know why i am glad do you love another  at this question hilarys eyebrows settled in a frown what do you mean by love he said  mr stone did not reply it was evident that he was reflecting deeply his lips began to move by love i mean the forgetfulness of self unions are frequent in which only the sexual instincts or the remembrance of self are roused  that is true muttered hilary  mr stone looked up painful traces of confusion showed in his face  we were discussing something  i was telling you said hilary that it would be better for your daughterif i go away for a time  yes said mr stone you are estranged  hilary went back to his stand before the empty fireplace  there is one thing sir he said on my conscience to say before i go and i must leave it to you to decide the little girl who comes to you no longer lives where she used to live  in that street said mr stone  hilary went on quickly she was obliged to leave because the husband of the woman with whom she used to lodge became infatuated with her he has been in prison and comes out tomorrow if she continues to come here he will of course be able to find her im afraid he will pursue her again have i made it clear to you  no said mr stone  the man resumed hilary patiently is a poor violent creature who has been wounded in the head he is not quite responsible he may do the girl an injury  what injury  he has stabbed his wife already  i will speak to him said mr stone  hilary smiled i am afraid that words will hardly meet the case she ought to disappear  there was silence  my book said mr stone  it smote hilary to see how white his face had become its better he thought to bring his willpower into play she will never come here anyway after im gone  but unable to bear the tragedy in the old mans eyes he touched him on the arm  perhaps she will take the risk sir if you ask her  mr stone did not answer and not knowing what more to say hilary went back to the window miranda was slumbering lightly out there in the speckled shade where it was not too warm and not too cold her cheek resting on her paw and white teeth showing  mr stones voice rose again you are right i cannot ask her to run a risk like that  she is just coming up the garden hilary said huskily shall i tell her to come in  yes said mr stone  hilary beckoned  the girl came in carrying a tiny bunch of lilies of the valley her face fell at sight of mr stone she stood still raising the lilies to her breast nothing could have been more striking than the change from her look of guttered expectancy to a sort of hard dismay a spot of red came into both her cheeks she gazed from mr stone to hilary and back again both were staring at her no one spoke the little models bosom began heaving as though she had been running she said faintly look i brought you this mr stone and held out to him the bunch of lilies but mr stone made no sign dont you like them  mr stones eyes remained fastened on her face  to hilary this suspense was evidently most distressing come will you tell her sir he said or shall i  mr stone spoke  i shall try and write my book without you you must not run this risk i cannot allow it  the little model turned her eyes from side to side but i like to copy out your book she said  the man will injure you said mr stone  the little model looked at hilary  i dont care if he does im not afraid of him i can look after myself im used to it  i am going away said hilary quietly  after a desperate look that seemed to ask am i going too the little model stood as though frozen  wishing to end the painful scene hilary went up to mr stone  do you want to dictate to her this afternoon sir  no said mr stone  nor tomorrow  will you come a little walk with me  mr stone bowed  hilary turned to the little model it is goodbye then he said  she did not take his hand her eyes turned sideways glinted her teeth were fastened on her lower lip she dropped the lilies suddenly looked up at him gulped and slunk away in passing she had smeared the lilies with her foot  hilary picked up the fragments of the flowers and dropped them into the grate the fragrance of the bruised blossoms remained clinging to the air  shall we get ready for our walk he said  mr stone moved feebly to the door and very soon they were walking silently towards the gardens     chapter xxxiv  thymes adventure  this same afternoon thyme wheeling a bicycle and carrying a light valise was slipping into a back street out of the old square putting her burden down at the pavements edge she blew a whistle a hansomcab appeared and a man in ragged clothes who seemed to spring out of the pavement took hold of her valise his lean unshaven face was full of wolfish misery  get off with you the cabman said  let him do it murmured thyme  the cabrunner hoisted up the trunk then waited motionless beside the cab  thyme handed him two coppers he looked at them in silence and went away  poor man she thought thats one of the things weve got to do away with  the cab now proceeded in the direction of the park thyme following on her bicycle and trying to stare about her calmly  this she thought is the end of the old life i wont be romantic and imagine im doing anything special i must take it all as a matter of course she thought of mr purceys facethat personif he could have seen her at this moment turning her back on comfort the moment i get there she mused i shall let mother know she can come out tomorrow and see for herself i cant have hysterics about my disappearance and all that they must get used to the idea that i mean to be in touch with things i cant be stopped by what anybody thinks  an approaching motorcar brought a startled frown across her brow was it that person but though it was not mr purcey and his ai damyer it was somebody so like him as made no difference thyme uttered a little laugh  in the park a cool light danced and glittered on the trees and water and the same cool dancing glitter seemed lighting the girls eyes  the cabman unseen took an admiring look at her nice little bit this it said  grandfather bathes here thought thyme poor darling i pity everyone thats old  the cab passed on under the shade of trees out into the road  i wonder if we have only one self in us thought thyme i sometimes feel that i have twouncle hilary would understand what i mean the pavements are beginning to smell horrid already and its only june tomorrow will mother feel my going very much how glorious if one didnt feel  the cab turned into a narrow street of little shops  it must be dreadful to have to serve in a small shop what millions of people there are in the world can anything be of any use martin says what matters is to do ones job but what is ones job  the cab emerged into a broad quiet square  but im not going to think of anything thought thyme thats fatal suppose father stops my allowance i should have to earn my living as a typist or something of that sort but he wont when he sees i mean it besides mother wouldnt let him  the cab entered the euston road and again the cabmans broad face was turned towards thyme with an inquiring stare  what a hateful road thyme thought what dull ugly commonlooking faces all the people seem to have in london as if they didnt care for anything but just to get through their day somehow ive only seen two really pretty faces  the cab stopped before a small tobacconists on the south side of the road  have i got to live here thought thyme  through the open door a narrow passage led to a narrow staircase covered with oilcloth she raised her bicycle and wheeled it in a jewishlooking youth emerging from the shop accosted her  your gentleman friend says you are to stay in your rooms please until he comes  his warm redbrown eyes dwelt on her lovingly shall i take your luggage up miss  thank you i can manage  its the first floor said the young man  the little rooms which thyme entered were stuffy clean and neat putting her trunk down in her bedroom which looked out on a bare yard she went into the sittingroom and threw the window up down below the cabman and tobacconist were engaged in conversation thyme caught the expression on their facesa sort of leering curiosity  how disgusting and horrible men are she thought moodily staring at the traffic all seemed so grim so inextricable and vast out there in the grey heat and hurry as though some monstrous devil were sporting with a monstrous antheap the reek of petrol and of dung rose to her nostrils it was so terribly big and hopeless it was so ugly i shall never do anything thought thymenevernever why doesnt martin come  she went into her bedroom and opened her valise with the scent of lavender that came from it there sprang up a vision of her white bedroom at home and the trees of the green garden and the blackbirds on the grass  the sound of footsteps on the stairs brought her back into the sittingroom martin was standing in the doorway  thyme ran towards him but stopped abruptly ive come you see what made you choose this place  im next door but two and theres a girl hereone of us shell show you the ropes  is she a lady  martin raised his shoulders she is what is called a lady he said but shes the right sort all the same nothing will stop her  at this proclamation of supreme virtue the look on thymes face was very queer you dont trust me it seemed to say and you trust that girl you put me here for her to watch over me  i want to send this telegram she said  martin read the telegram you oughtnt to have funked telling your mother what you meant to do  thyme crimsoned im not coldblooded like you  this is a big matter said martin i told you that you had no business to come at all if you couldnt look it squarely in the face  if you want me to stay you had better be more decent to me martin  it must be your own affair said martin  thyme stood at the window biting her lips to keep the tears back from her eyes a very pleasant voice behind her said i do think its so splendid of you to come  a girl in grey was standing therethin delicate rather plain with a nose ever so little to one side lips faintly smiling and large shining greenish eyes  i am mary daunt i live above you have you had some tea  in the gentle question of this girl with the faintly smiling lips and shining eyes thyme fancied that she detected mockery  yes thanks i want to be shown what my works to be at once please  the grey girl looked at martin  oh wont tomorrow do for all that sort of thing im sure you must be tired mr stone do make her rest  martins glance seemed to say please leave your femininities  if you mean business your work will be the same as hers he said youre not qualified all you can do will be visiting noting the state of the houses and the condition of the children  the girl in grey said gently you see we only deal with sanitation and the children it seems hard on the grown people and the old to leave them out but theres sure to be so much less money than we want so that it must all go towards the future  there was a silence the girl with the shining eyes added softly 1950  1950 repeated martin it seemed to be some formula of faith  i must send this telegram muttered thyme  martin took it from her and went out  left alone in the little room the two girls did not at first speak the girl in grey was watching thyme half timidly as if she could not tell what to make of this young creature who looked so charming and kept shooting such distrustful glances  i think its so awfully sweet of you to come she said at last i know what a good time you have at home your cousins often told me dont you think hes splendid  to that question thyme made no answer  isnt this work horrid she saidprying into peoples houses  the grey girl smiled it is rather awful sometimes ive been at it six months now you get used to it ive had all the worst things said to me by now i should think  thyme shuddered  you see said the grey girls faintly smiling lips you soon get the feeling of having to go through with it we all realise its got to be done of course your cousins one of the best of us nothing seems to put him out he has such a nice sort of scornful kindness id rather work with him than anyone  she looked past her new associate into that world outside where the sky seemed all wires and yellow heatdust she did not notice thyme appraising her from head to foot with a stare hostile and jealous but pathetic too as though confessing that this girl was her superior  im sure i cant do that work she said suddenly  the grey girl smiled oh i thought that at first then with an admiring look but i do think its rather a shame for you youre so pretty perhaps theyd put you on to tabulation work though thats awfully dull well ask your cousin  no ill do the whole or nothing  well said the grey girl ive got one house left today would you like to come and see the sort of thing  she took a small notebook from a side pocket in her skirt  i cant get on without a pocket you must have something that you cant leave behind i left four little bags and two dozen handkerchiefs in five weeks before i came back to pockets its rather a horrid house im afraid  i shall be all right said thyme shortly  in the shop doorway the young tobacconist was taking the evening air he greeted them with his polite but constitutionally leering smile  goodevening mith he said nithe evening  hes rather an awful little man the grey girl said when they had achieved the crossing of the street but hes got quite a nice sense of humour  ah said thyme  they had turned into a bystreet and stopped before a house which had obviously seen better days its windows were cracked its doors unpainted and down in the basement could be seen a pile of rags an evillooking man seated by it and a blazing fire thyme felt a little gulping sensation there was a putrid scent as of burning refuse she looked at her companion the grey girl was consulting her notebook with a faint smile on her lips and in thymes heart rose a feeling almost of hatred for this girl who was so businesslike in the presence of such sights and scents  the door was opened by a young redfaced woman who looked as if she had been asleep  the grey girl screwed up her shining eyes oh do you mind if we come in a minute she said it would be so good of you were making a report  theres nothing to report here the young woman answered but the grey girl had slipped as gently past as though she had been the very spirit of adventure  of course i see that but just as a matter of form you know  ive parted with most of my things the young woman said defensively since my husband died its a hard life  yes yes but not worse than minealways poking my nose into other peoples houses  the young woman was silent evidently surprised  the landlord ought to keep you in better repair said the grey girl he owns next door too doesnt he  the young woman nodded hes a bad landlord all down the street ere its the same cant get nothing done  the grey girl had gone over to a dirty bassinette where a halfnaked child sprawled an ugly little girl with fat red cheeks was sitting on a stool beside it close to an open locker wherein could be seen a number of old meat bones  your chickabiddies said the grey girl arent they sweet  the young womans face became illumined by a smile  theyre healthy she said  thats more than can be said for all the children in the house i expect murmured the grey girl  the young woman replied emphatically as though voicing an old grievance the three on the first floors not so bad but i dont let em ave anything to do with that lot at the top  thyme saw her new friends hand hover over the childs head like some pale dove in answer to that gesture the mother nodded just that youve got to clean em every time they go near them children at the top  the grey girl looked at thyme thats where weve got to go evidently she seemed to say  a dirty lot muttered the young woman  its very hard on you  it is im workin at the laundry all day when i can get it i cant look after the childrenthey get everywhere  very hard murmured the grey girl ill make a note of that  together with the little book in which she was writing furiously she had pulled out her handkerchief and the sight of this handkerchief reposing on the floor gave thyme a queer satisfaction such as comes when one remarks in superior people the absence of a virtue existing in oneself  well we mustnt keep you mrsmrs  cleary  cleary how olds this little one four and the other two they are ducks goodbye  in the corridor outside the grey girl whispered i do like the way we all pride ourselves on being better than someone else i think its so hopeful and jolly shall we go up and see the abyss at the top     chapter xxxv  a young girls mind  a young girls mind is like a wood in springnow a rising mist of bluebells and flakes of dappled sunlight now a world of still wan tender saplings weeping they know not why through the curling twigs of boughs just green its wings fly towards the stars but the next moment they have drooped to mope beneath the damp bushes it is ever yearning for and trembling at the future in its secret places all the countless shapes of things that are to be are taking stealthy counsel of how to grow up without letting their gown of mystery fall they rustle whisper shriek suddenly and as suddenly fall into a delicious silence from the first hazelbush to the last maytree it is an unending meetingplace of young solemn things eager to find out what they are eager to rush forth to greet the kisses of the wind and sun and for ever trembling back and hiding their faces the spirit of that wood seems to lie with her ear close to the ground a pale petal of a hand curved like a shell behind it listening for the whisper of her own life there she lies white and supple with dewy wistful eyes sighing what is my meaning ah i am everything is there in all the world a thing so wonderful as i oh i am nothingmy wings are heavy i faint i die  when thyme attended by the grey girl emerged from the abyss at the top her cheeks were flushed and her hands clenched she said nothing the grey girl too was silent with a look such as a spirit divested of its body by long bathing in the river of reality might bend on one who has just come to dip her head thymes quick eyes saw that look and her colour deepened she saw too the glance of the jewish youth when martin joined them in the doorway  two girls now he seemed to say he goes it this young man  supper was laid in her new friends roompressed beef potato salad stewed prunes and ginger ale martin and the grey girl talked thyme ate in silence but though her eyes seemed fastened on her plate she saw every glance that passed between them heard every word they said those glances were not remarkable nor were those words particularly important but they were spoken in tones that seemed important to thyme he never talks to me like that she thought  when supper was over they went out into the streets to walk but at the door the grey girl gave thymes arm a squeeze her cheek a swift kiss and turned back up the stairs  arent you coming shouted martin  her voice was heard answering from above no not tonight  with the back of her hand thyme rubbed off the kiss the two cousins walked out amongst the traffic  the evening was very warm and close no breeze fanned the reeking town speaking little they wandered among endless darkening streets whence to return to the light and traffic of the euston road seemed like coming back to heaven at last close again to her new home thyme said why should one bother its all a horrible great machine trying to blot us out people are like insects when you put your thumb on them and smear them on a book i hatei loathe it  they might as well be healthy insects while they last answered martin  thyme faced round at him i shant sleep tonight martin get out my bicycle for me  martin scrutinised her by the light of the street lamp all right he said ill come too  there are say moralists roads that lead to hell but it was on a road that leads to hampstead that the two young cyclists set forth towards eleven oclock the difference between the character of the two destinations was soon apparent for whereas man taken in bulk had perhaps made hell hampstead had obviously been made by the upper classes there were trees and gardens and instead of dark canals of sky banked by the roofs of houses and hazed with the yellow scum of london lights the heavens spread out in a wide trembling pool from that rampart of the town the spaniards road two plains lay exposed to left and right the scent of maytree blossom had stolen up the hill the rising moon clung to a firtree bough over the country the far stars presided and sleeps dark wings were spread above the fieldssilent scarce breathing lay the body of the land but to the south where the town that restless head was lying the stars seemed to have fallen and were sown in the thousand furrows of its great grey marsh and from the dark miasma of those streets there travelled up a rustle a whisper the far allurement of some deathless dancer dragging men to watch the swirl of her black spangled drapery the gleam of her writhing limbs like the song of the sea in a shell was the murmur of that witch of motion clasping to her the souls of men drawing them down into a soul whom none had ever known to rest  above the two young cousins scudding along that ridge between the country and the town three thin white clouds trailed slowly towards the westlike tired seabirds drifting exhausted far out from land on a sea blue to blackness with unfathomable depth  for an hour those two rode silently into the country  have we come far enough martin said at last  thyme shook her head a long steep hill beyond a little sleeping village had brought them to a standstill across the shadowy fields a pale sheet of water gleamed out in moonlight thyme turned down towards it  im hot she said i want to bathe my face stay here dont come with me  she left her bicycle and passing through a gate vanished among the trees  martin stayed leaning against the gate the village clock struck one the distant call of a hunting owl quwheek quwheek sounded through the grave stillness of this last night of may the moon at her curves summit floated at peace on the blue surface of the sky a great closed waterlily and martin saw through the trees scimitarshaped reeds clustering black along the pools shore all about him the mayflowers were alight it was such a night as makes dreams real and turns reality to dreams  all moonlit nonsense thought the young man for the night had disturbed his heart  but thyme did not come back he called to her and in the deathlike silence following his shouts he could hear his own heart beat he passed in through the gate she was nowhere to be seen why was she playing him this trick  he turned up from the water among the trees where the incense of the mayflowers hung heavy in the air  never look for a thing he thought and stopped to listen it was so breathless that the leaves of a low bough against his cheek did not stir while he stood there presently he heard faint sounds and stole towards them under a beechtree he almost stumbled over thyme lying with her face pressed to the ground the young doctors heart gave a sickening leap he quickly knelt down beside her the girls body pressed close to the dry beechmat was being shaken by long sobs from head to foot it quivered her hat had been torn off and the fragrance of her hair mingled with the fragrance of the night in martins heart something seemed to turn over and over as when a boy he had watched a rabbit caught in a snare he touched her she sat up and dashing her hand across her eyes cried go away oh go away  he put his arm round her and waited five minutes passed the air was trembling with a sort of pale vibration for the moonlight had found a hole in the dark foliage and flooded on to the ground beside them whitening the black beechhusks some tiny bird disturbed by these unwonted visitors began chirruping and fluttering but was soon still again to martin so strangely close to this young creature in the night there came a sense of utter disturbance  poor little thing he thought be careful of her comfort her hardness seemed so broken out of her and the night so wonderful and there came into the young mans heart a throb of the knowledgevery rare with him for he was not like hilary a philosophising personthat she was as real as himselfsuffering hoping feeling not his hopes and feelings but her own his fingers kept pressing her shoulder through her thin blouse and the touch of those fingers was worth more than any words as this night all moonlit dreams was worth more than a thousand nights of sane reality  thyme twisted herself away from him at last i cant she sobbed im not what you thought meim not made for it  a scornful little smile curled martins lip so that was it but the smile soon died away one did not hit what was already down  thymes voice wailed through the silence i thought i couldbut i want beautiful things i cant bear it all so grey and horrible im not like that girl imanamateur  if i kissed her martin thought  she sank down again burying her face in the dark beechmat the moonlight had passed on her voice came faint and stiffed as out of the tomb of faith im no good i never shall be im as bad as mother  but to martin there was only the scent of her hair  no murmured thymes voice im only fit for miserable art im only fit fornothing  they were so close together on the dark beech mat that their bodies touched and a longing to clasp her in his arms came over him  im a selfish beast moaned the smothered voice i dont really care for all these peoplei only care because theyre ugly for me to see  martin reached his hand out to her hair if she had shrunk away he would have seized her but as though by instinct she let it rest there and at her sudden stillness strange and touching martins quick passion left him he slipped his arm round her and raised her up as if she had been a child and for a long time sat listening with a queer twisted smile to the moanings of her lost illusions  the dawn found them still sitting there against the bole of the beechtree her lips were parted the tears had dried on her sleeping face pillowed against his shoulder while he still watched her sideways with the ghost of that twisted smile  and beyond the grey water like some tired wanton the moon in an orange hood was stealing down to her rest between the trees     chapter xxxvi  stephen signs cheques  cecilia received the mystic document containing these words am quite all right address 598 euston road three doors off martin letter follows explaining thyme she had not even realised her little daughters departure she went up to thymes room at once and opening all the drawers and cupboards stared into them one by one the many things she saw there allayed the first pangs of her disquiet  she has only taken one little trunk she thought and left all her evening frocks  this act of independence alarmed rather than surprised her such had been her sense of the unrest in the domestic atmosphere during the last month since the evening when she had found thyme in foods of tears because of the hughs baby her maternal eyes had not failed to notice something new in the childs demeanoura moodiness an air almost of conspiracy together with an emphatic increase of youthful sarcasm fearful of probing deep she had sought no confidence nor had she divulged her doubts to stephen  amongst the blouses a sheet of blue ruled paper which had evidently escaped from a notebook caught her eye sentences were scrawled on it in pencil cecilia read that poor little dead thing was so grey and pinched and i seemed to realise all of a sudden how awful it is for them i musti musti will do something  cecilia dropped the sheet of paper her hand was trembling there was no mystery in that departure now and stephens words came into her mind its all very well up to a certain point and nobody sympathises with them more than i do but after that it becomes destructive of all comfort and that does no good to anyone  the sound sense of those words had made her feel queer when they were spoken they were even more sensible than she had thought did her little daughter so young and pretty seriously mean to plunge into the rescue work of dismal slums to cut herself adrift from sweet sounds and scents and colours from music and art from dancing flowers and all that made life beautiful the secret forces of fastidiousness an inborn dread of the fanatical and all her real ignorance of what such a life was like rose in cecilia with a force which made her feel quite sick better that she herself should do this thing than that her own child should be deprived of air and light and all the just environment of her youth and beauty she must come backshe must listen to me she thought we will begin together we will start a nice little creche of our own orperhaps mrs tallents smallpeace could find us some regular work on one of her committees  then suddenly she conceived a thought which made her blood run positively cold what if it were a matter of heredity what if thyme had inherited her grandfathers singlemindedness martin was giving proof of it things she knew often skipped a generation and then set in again surely surely it could not have done that with longing yet with dread she waited for the sound of stephens latchkey it came at its appointed time  even in her agitation cecilia did not forget to spare him all she could she began by giving him a kiss and then said casually thyme has got a whim into her head  what whim  its rather what you might expect faltered cecilia from her going about so much with martin  stephens face assumed at once an air of dry derision there was no love lost between him and his young nephewinlaw  the sanitist he said ah well  she has gone off to do worksome place in the euston road ive had a telegram oh and i found this stephen  she held out to him halfheartedly the two bits of paper one pinkishbrown the other blue stephen saw that she was trembling he took them from her read them and looked at her again he had a real affection for his wife and the tradition of consideration for other peoples feelings was bred in him so that at this moment so vitally disturbing the first thing he did was to put his hand on her shoulder and give it a reassuring squeeze but there was also in stephen a certain primitive virility pickled it is true at cambridge and in the law courts dried but still preserving something of its possessive and assertive quality and the second thing he did was to say no im damned  in that little sentence lay the whole psychology of his attitude towards this situation and all the difference between two classes of the population mr purcey would undoubtedly have said well im damned stephen by saying no im damned betrayed that before he could be damned he had been obliged to wrestle and contend with something and cecilia who was always wrestling too knew this something to be that queer new thing a social conscience the dim bogey stalking pale about the houses of those who through the accidents of leisure or of culture had once left the door open to the suspicion is it possible that there is a class of people besides my own or am i dreaming happy the millions poor or rich not yet condemned to watch the wistful visiting or hear the husky mutter of that ghost happy in their homes blessed by a less disquieting god such were cecilias inner feelings  even now she did not quite plumb the depths of stephens she felt his struggle with the ghost she felt and admired his victory what she did not could not perhaps realise was the precise nature of the outrage inflicted on him by thymes action with herbeing a womanthe matter was more practical she did not grasp had never grasped the architectural nature of stephens mindhow really hurt he was by what did not seem to him in due and proper order  he spoke why on earth if she felt like that couldnt she have gone to work in the ordinary way she could have put herself in connection with some proper charitable societyi should never have objected to that its all that young sanitary idiot  i believe cecilia faltered that martins is a society its a kind of medical socialism or something of that sort he has tremendous faith in it  stephens lip curled  he may have as much faith as he likes he said with the restraint that was one of his best qualities so long as he doesnt infect my daughter with it  cecilia said suddenly oh what are we to do stephen shall i go over there tonight  as one may see a shadow pass down on a cornfield so came the cloud on stephens face it was as though he had not realised till then the full extent of what this meant for a minute he was silent better wait for her letter he said at last hes her cousin after all and mrs grundys deadin the euston road at all events  so trying to spare each other all they could of anxiety and careful to abstain from any hint of trouble before the servants they dined and went to bed  at that hour between the night and morning when mans vitality is lowest and the tremors of his spirit like birds of ill omen fly round and round him beating their long plumes against his cheeks stephen woke  it was very still a bar of pearlygrey dawn showed between the filmy curtains which stirred with a regular faint movement like the puffing of a sleepers lips the tide of the wind woven in mr stones fancy of the souls of men was at low ebb feebly it fanned the houses and hovels where the myriad forms of men lay sleeping unconscious of its breath so faint lifes pulse that men and shadows seemed for that brief moment mingled in the towns sleep over the million varied roofs over the hundred million little different shapes of men and things the winds quiet visiting wand had stilled all into the wonder state of nothingness when life is passing into death death into new life and self is at its feeblest  and stephens self feeling the magnetic currents of that ebbtide drawing it down into murmurous slumber out beyond the sandbars of individuality and class threw up its little hands and began to cry for help the purple sea of selfforgetfulness under the dim impersonal sky seemed to him so cold and terrible it had no limit that he could see no rules but such as hung too far away written in the hieroglyphics of paling stars he could feel no order in the lift and lap of the wan waters round his limbs where would those waters carry him to what depth of still green silence was his own little daughter to go down into this sea that knew no creed but that of selfforgetfulness that respected neither class nor personthis sea where a few wandering streaks seemed all the evidence of the precious differences between mankind god forbid it  and turning on his elbow he looked at her who had given him this daughter in the mystery of his wifes sleeping facethe face of her most near and dear to himhe tried hard not to see a likeness to mr stone he fell back somewhat comforted with the thought that old chap has his one ideahis universal brotherhood hes absolutely absorbed in it i dont see it in ciss face a bit quite the contrary  but suddenly a flash of clear hard cynicism amounting to inspiration utterly disturbed him the old chap indeed was so wrapped up in himself and his precious book as to be quite unconscious that anyone else was alive could one be everybodys brother if one were blind to their existence but this freak of thymes was an actual try to be everybodys sister for that he supposed one must forget oneself why it was really even a worse case than that of mr stone and to stephen there was something awful in this thought  the first small bird of morning close to the open window uttered a feeble chirrup into stephens mind there leaped without reason recollection of the morning after his first term at school when awakened by the birds he had started up and fished out from under his pillow his catapult and the box of shot he had brought home and taken to sleep with him he seemed to see again those leaden shot with their bluish sheen and to feel them round and soft and heavy rolling about his palm he seemed to hear hilarys surprised voice saying hallo stevie you awake  no one had ever had a better brother than old hilary his only fault was that he had always been too kind it was his kindness that had done for him and made his married life a failure he had never asserted himself enough with that woman his wife stephen turned over on his other side all this confounded business he thought comes from oversympathising thats whats the matter with thyme too long he lay thus while the light grew stronger listening to cecilias gentle breathing disturbed to his very marrow by these thoughts  the first post brought no letter from thyme and the announcement soon after that mr hilary had come to breakfast was received by both stephen and cecilia with a welcome such as the anxious give to anything which shows promise of distracting them  stephen made haste down hilary with a very grave and harassed face was in the diningroom it was he however who after one look at stephen said  whats the matter stevie  stephen took up the standard in spite of his selfcontrol his hand shook a little  its a ridiculous business he said that precious young sanitist has so worked his confounded theories into thyme that she has gone off to the euston road to put them into practice of all things  at the halfconcerned amusement on hilarys face his quick and rather narrow eyes glinted  its not exactly for you to laugh hilary he said its all of a piece with your cursed sentimentality about those hughs and that girl i knew it would end in a mess  hilary answered this unjust and unexpected outburst by a look and stephen with the strange feeling of inferiority which would come to him in hilarys presence against his better judgment lowered his own glance  my dear boy said hilary if any bit of my character has crept into thyme im truly sorry  stephen took his brothers hand and gave it a good grip and cecilia coming in they all sat down  cecilia at once noted what stephen in his preoccupation had notthat hilary had come to tell them something but she did not like to ask him what it was though she knew that in the presence of their trouble hilary was too delicate to obtrude his own she did not like either to talk of her trouble in the presence of his they all talked therefore of indifferent thingswhat music they had heard what plays they had seeneating but little and drinking tea in the middle of a remark about the opera stephen looking up saw martin himself standing in the doorway the young sanitist looked pale dusty and dishevelled he advanced towards cecilia and said with his usual cool determination  ive brought her back aunt cis  at that moment fraught with such relief such pure joy such desire to say a thousand things cecilia could only murmur oh martin  stephen who had jumped up asked where is she  gone to her room  then perhaps said stephen regaining at once his dry composure you will give us some explanation of this folly  shes no use to us at present  indeed  none  then said stephen kindly understand that we have no use for you in future or any of your sort  martin looked round the table resting his eyes on each in turn  youre right he said goodbye  hilary and cecilia had risen too there was silence stephen crossed to the door  you seem to me he said suddenly in his driest voice with your new manners and ideas quite a pernicious youth  cecilia stretched her hands out towards martin and there was a faint tinkling as of chains  you must know dear she said how anxious weve all been of course your uncle doesnt mean that  the same scornful tenderness with which he was wont to look at thyme passed into martins face  all right aunt cis he said if stephen doesnt mean it he ought to to mean things is what matters he stooped and kissed her forehead give that to thyme for me he said i shant see her for a bit  youll never see her sir said stephen dryly if i can help it the liquor of your sanitism is too bright and effervescent  martins smile broadened for old bottles he said and with another slow look round went out  stephens mouth assumed its driest twist bumptious young devil he said if that is the new young man defend us  over the cool diningroom with its faint scent of pinks of melon and of ham came silence suddenly cecilia glided from the room her light footsteps were heard hurrying now that she was not visible up to thyme  hilary too had moved towards the door in spite of his preoccupation stephen could not help noticing how very worn his brother looked  you look quite seedy old boy he said will you have some brandy  hilary shook his head  now that youve got thyme back he said id better let you know my news im going abroad tomorrow i dont know whether i shall come back again to live with b  stephen gave a low whistle then pressing hilarys arm he said anything you decide old man ill always back you in but  im going alone  in his relief stephen violated the laws of reticence  thank heaven for that i was afraid you were beginning to lose your head about that girl  im not quite fool enough said hilary to imagine that such a liaison would be anything but misery in the longrun if i took the child i should have to stick to her but im not proud of leaving her in the lurch stevie  the tone of his voice was so bitter that stephen seized his hand  my dear old man youre too kind why shes no hold on younot the smallest in the world  except the hold of this devotion ive roused in her god knows how and her destitution  you let these people haunt you said stephen its quite a mistakeit really is  i had forgotten to mention that i am not an iceberg muttered hilary  stephen looked into his face without speaking then with the utmost earnestness he said  however much you may be attracted its simply unthinkable for a man like you to go outside his class  class yes muttered hilary goodbye  and with a long grip of his brothers hand he went away  stephen turned to the window for all the care and contrivance bestowed on the view far away to the left the back courts of an alley could be seen and as though some gadfly had planted in him its small poisonous sting he moved back from the sight at once confusion he thought are we never to get rid of these infernal people  his eyes lighted on the melon a single slice lay by itself on a bluegreen dish leaning over a plate with a desperation quite unlike himself he took an enormous bite again and again he bit the slice then almost threw it from him and dipped his fingers in a bowl  thank god he thought thats over what an escape  whether he meant hilarys escape or thymes was doubtful but there came on him a longing to rush up to his little daughters room and hug her he suppressed it and sat down at the bureau he was suddenly experiencing a sensation such as he had sometimes felt on a perfect day or after physical danger of too much benefit of something that he would like to return thanks for yet knew not how his hand stole to the inner pocket of his black coat it stole out again there was a chequebook in it before his minds eye starting up one after the other he saw the names of the societies he supported or meant sometime if he could afford it to support he reached his hand out for a pen the still small noise of the nib travelling across the cheques mingled with the buzzing of a single fly  these sounds cecilia heard when from the open door she saw the thin back of her husbands neck with its softly graduated hair bent forward above the bureau she stole over to him and pressed herself against his arm  stephen staying the progress of his pen looked up at her their eyes met and bending down cecilia put her cheek to his     chapter xxxvii  the flowering of the aloe  this same day returning through kensington gardens from his preparations for departure hilary came suddenly on bianca standing by the shores of the round pond  to the eyes of the frequenters of these elysian fields where so many men and shadows daily steal recreation to the eyes of all drinking in those green gardens their honeyed draught of peace this husband and wife appeared merely a distinguishedlooking couple animated by a leisured harmony for the time was not yet when men were one and could tell by instinct what was passing in each others hearts  in truth there were not too many people in london who in their situation would have behaved with such seemlinessnot too many so civilised as they  estranged and soon to part they retained the manner of accord up to the last not for them the matrimonial brawl the solemn accusation and recrimination the pathetic protestations of proprietary rights for them no sacred view that at all costs they must make each other miserablenot even the belief that they had the right to do so no there was no relief for their sore hearts they walked side by side treating each others feelings with respect as if there had been no terrible heartturnings throughout the eighteen years in which they had first loved then through mysterious disharmony drifted apart as if there were now between them no question of this girl  presently hilary said  ive been into town and made my preparations im starting tomorrow for the mountains there will be no necessity for you to leave your father  are you taking her  it was beautifully uttered without a trace of bias or curiosity with an unforced accent neither indifferent nor too interestedno one could have told whether it was meant for generosity or malice hilary took it for the former  thank you he said but that comedy is finished  close to the edge of the round pond a swanlike cutter was putting out to sea in the wake of this fair creature a tiny scoopedout bit of wood with three feathers for masts bobbed and trembled and the two small ragged boys who owned that little galley were stretching bits of branch out towards her over the bright waters  bianca looked without seeing at this proof of mans pride in his own property a thin gold chain hung round her neck suddenly she thrust it into the bosom of her dress it had broken into two between her fingers  they reached home without another word  at the door of hilarys study sat miranda the little person answered his caress by a shiver of her sleek skin then curled herself down again on the spot she had already warmed  arent you coming in with me he said  miranda did not move  the reason for her refusal was apparent when hilary had entered close to the long bookcase behind the bust of socrates stood the little model very still as if fearing to betray itself by sound or movement was her figure in its bluegreen frock and a brimless toque of brown straw with two purplish roses squashed together into a band of darker velvet beside those roses a tiny peacocks feather had been slipped inunholy little visitor slanting backward trying as it were to draw all eyes yet to escape notice and wedged between the grim white bust and the dark bookcase the girl herself was like some unlawful spirit which had slid in there and stood trembling and vibrating ready to be shuttered out  before this apparition hilary recoiled towards the door hesitated and returned  you should not have come here he muttered after what we said to you yesterday  the little model answered quickly but ive seen hughs mr dallison hes found out where i live oh he does look dreadful he frightens me i cant ever stay there now  she had come a little out of her hidingplace and stood fidgeting her hands and looking down  shes not speaking the truth thought hilary  the little model gave him a furtive glance i did see him she said i must go right away now it wouldnt be safe would it again she gave him that swift look  hilary thought suddenly she is using my own weapon against me if she has seen the man he didnt frighten her it serves me right with a dry laugh he turned his back  there was a rustling round the little model had moved out of her retreat and stood between him and the door at this stealthy action hilary felt once more the tremor which had come over him when he sat beside her in the broad walk after the babys funeral outside in the garden a pigeon was pouring forth a continuous love song hilary heard nothing of it conscious only of the figure of the girl behind himthat young figure which had twined itself about his senses  well what is it you want he said at last  the little model answered by another question  are you really going away mr dallison  i am  she raised her hands to the level of her breast as though she meant to clasp them together without doing so however she dropped them to her sides they were cased in very worn suede gloves and in this dire moment of embarrassment hilarys eyes fastened themselves on those slim hands moving against her skirt  the little model tried at once to slip them away behind her suddenly she said in her matteroffact voice i only wanted to askcant i come too  at this question whose simplicity might have made an angel smile hilary experienced a sensation as if his bones had been turned to water it was strangedeliciousas though he had been suddenly offered all that he wanted of her without all those things that he did not want he stood regarding her silently her cheeks and neck were red there was a red tinge too in her eyelids deepening the chicoryflower colour of her eyes she began to speak repeating a lesson evidently learned by heart  i wouldnt be in your way i wouldnt cost much i could do everything you wanted i could learn typewriting i neednt live too near or that if you didnt want me because of people talking im used to being alone oh mr dallison i could do everything for you i wouldnt mind anything and im not like some girls i do know what im talking about  do you  the little model put her hands up and covering her face said  if youd try and see  hilarys sensuous feeling almost vanished a lump rose in his throat instead  my child he said you are too generous  the little model seemed to know instinctively that by touching his spirit she had lost ground uncovering her face she spoke breathlessly growing very pale  oh no im not i want to be let come i dont want to stay here i know ill get into mischief if you dont take meoh i know i will  if i were to let you come with me said hilary what then what sort of companion should i be to you or you to me you know very well only one sort its no use pretending child that weve any interests in common  the little model came closer  i know what i am she said and i dont want to be anything else i can do what you tell me to and i shant ever complain im not worth any more  youre worth more muttered hilary than i can ever give you and im worth more than you can ever give me  the little model tried to answer but her words would not pass her throat she threw her head back trying to free them and stood swaying seeing her like this before him white as a sheet with her eyes closed and her lips parted as though about to faint hilary seized her by the shoulders at the touch of those soft shoulders his face became suffused with blood his lips trembled suddenly her eyes opened ever so little between their lids and looked at him and the perception that she was not really going to faint that it was a little desperate wile of this child delilah made him wrench away his hands the moment she felt that grasp relax she sank down and clasped his knees pressing them to her bosom so that he could not stir closer and closer she pressed them to her till it seemed as though she must be bruising her flesh her breath came in sobs her eyes were closed her lips quivered upwards in the clutch of her clinging body there seemed suddenly the whole of womans power of selfabandonment it was just that which at this moment so horribly painful to him prevented hilary from seizing her in his arms just that queer seeming selfeffacement as though she were lost to knowledge of what she did it seemed too brutal too like taking advantage of a child  from calm is born the wind the ripple from the still pool self out of nothingnessso all passes imperceptibly no man knows how the little models moment of selfoblivion passed and into her wet eyes her plain twisting spirit suddenly writhed up again for all the world as if she had said i wont let you go ill keep youill keep you  hilary broke away from her and she fell forward on her face  get up child he saidget up for gods sake dont lie there  she rose obediently choking down her sobs mopping her face with a small dirty handkerchief suddenly taking a step towards him she clenched both her hands and struck them downwards  ill go to the bad she saidi willif you dont take me and her breast heaving her hair all loose she stared straight into his face with her redrimmed eyes hilary turned suddenly took a book up from the writingtable and opened it his face was again suffused with blood his hands and lips trembled his eyes had a queer fixed stare  not now not now he muttered go away now ill come to you tomorrow  the little model gave him the look a dog gives you when it asks if you are deceiving him she made a sign on her breast as a catholic might make the sign of his religion drawing her fingers together and clutching at herself with them then passed her little dirty handkerchief once more over her eyes and turning round went out  hilary remained standing where he was reading the open book without apprehending what it was  there was a wistful sound as of breath escaping hurriedly mr stone was standing in the open doorway  she has been here he said i saw her go away  hilary dropped the book his nerves were utterly unstrung then pointing to a chair he said wont you sit down sir  mr stone came close up to his soninlaw  is she in trouble  yes murmured hilary  she is too young to be in trouble did you tell her that  hilary shook his head  has the man hurt her  again hilary shook his head  what is her trouble then said mr stone the closeness of this catechism the intent stare of the old mans eyes were more than hilary could bear he turned away  you ask me something that i cannot answer  why  it is a private matter  with the blood still beating in his temples his lips still quivering and the feeling of the girls clasp round his knees he almost hated this old man who stood there putting such blind questions  then suddenly in mr stones eyes he saw a startling change as in the face of a man who regains consciousness after days of vacancy his whole countenance had become alive with a sort of jealous understanding the warmth which the little model brought to his old spirit had licked up the fog of his idea and made him see what was going on before his eyes  at that look hilary braced himself against the wall  a flush spread slowly over mr stones face he spoke with rare hesitation in this sudden coming back to the world of men and things he seemed astray  i am not going he stammered to ask you any more i could not pry into a private matter that would not be his voice failed he looked down  hilary bowed touched to the quick by the return to life of this old man so long lost to facts and by the delicacy in that old face  i will not intrude further on your trouble said mr stone whatever it may be i am sorry that you are unhappy too  very slowly and without again looking up at his soninlaw he went out  hilary remained standing where he had been left against the wall     chapter xxxviii  the homecoming of hughs  hilary had evidently been right in thinking the little model was not speaking the truth when she said she had seen hughs for it was not until early on the following morning that three persons traversed the long winding road leading from wormwood scrubs to kensington they preserved silence not because there was nothing in their hearts to be expressed but because there was too much and they walked in the giraffelike formation peculiar to the lower classeshughs in front mrs hughs to the left a foot or two behind and a yard behind her to the left again her son stanley they made no sign of noticing anyone in the road besides themselves and no one in the road gave sign of noticing that they were there but in their three minds so differently fashioned a verb was dumbly and with varying emotion being conjugated  ive been in prison youve been in prison hes been in prison  beneath the seeming acquiescence of a man subject to domination from his birth up those four words covered in hughs such a whirlpool of surging sensation such ferocity of bitterness and madness and defiance that no outpouring could have appreciably relieved its course the same four words summed up in mrs hughs so strange a mingling of fear commiseration loyalty shame and trembling curiosity at the new factor which had come into the life of all this little family walking giraffelike back to kensington that to have gone beyond them would have been like plunging into a wintry river to their son the four words were as a legend of romance conjuring up no definite image lighting merely the glow of wonder  dont lag stanley keep up with your father  the little boy took three steps at an increased pace then fell behind again his black eyes seemed to answer you say that because you dont know what else to say and without alteration in their giraffelike formation but again in silence the three proceeded  in the heart of the seamstress doubt and fear were being slowly knit into dread of the first sound to pass her husbands lips what would he ask how should she answer would he talk wild or would he talk sensible would he have forgotten that young girl or had he nursed and nourished his wicked fancy in the house of grief and silence would he ask where the baby was would he speak a kind word to her but alongside her dread there was guttering within her the undying resolution not to let him go from her if it were ever so to that young girl  dont lag stanley  at the reiteration of those words hughs spoke  let the boy alone youll be nagging at the baby next  hoarse and grating like sounds issuing from a damp vault was this first speech  the seamstresss eyes brimmed over  i wont get the chance she stammered out hes gone  hughs teeth gleamed like those of a dog at bay  whos taken him you let me know the name  tears rolled down the seamstresss cheeks she could not answer her little sons thin voice rose instead  babys dead we buried him in the ground i saw it mr creed came in the cab with me  white flecks appeared suddenly at the corners of hughs lips he wiped the back of his hand across his mouth and once more giraffelike the little family marched on  westminister in his threadbare summer jacketfor the day was warmhad been standing for some little time in mrs budgens doorway on the ground floor at hound street knowing that hughs was to be released that morning early he had with the circumspection and foresight of his character reasoned thus i shant lie easy in my bed i shant hev no peace until i know that low fellers not agoin to misdemean himself with me its no good to go aputtin of it off i dont want him comin to my room attackin of old men ill be previous with him in the passage the lame woman ll let me i shant trouble her shell be palliable between me and him in case he goes for to attack me i aint afraid of him  but as the minutes of waiting went by his old tongue like that of a dog expecting chastisement appeared ever more frequently to moisten his twisted discoloured lips this comes of mixin up with soldiers he thought and a lowclass o man like that i ought to ha changed my lodgins hell be askin me where that young girl is i shouldnt wonder an him lost his character and his job and everything and all because o women  he watched the broadfaced woman mrs budgen in whose grey eyes the fighting light so fortunately never died painfully doing out her rooms and propping herself against the chest of drawers whereon clustered china cups and dogs as thick as toadstools on a bank  ive told my charlie she said to keep clear of hughs a bit they comes out as prickly as hedgehogs pick a quarrel as soon as look at you they will  oh dear thought creed shes full o cold comfort but careful of his dignity he answered im awaitin here to engage the situation you dont think hell attack of me with definition at this time in the mornin  the lame woman shrugged her shoulders hell have had a drop of something she said before he comes home they gets a cold feelin in the stomach in them places poor creatures  the old butlers heart quavered up into his mouth he lifted his shaking hand and put it to his lips as though to readjust himself  oh yes he said i ought to ha given notice and took my things away but there poor woman it seemed ahittin of her when she was down and i dont want to make no move i aint got no one else thats interested in me this womans very good about mendin of my clothes oh dear yes she dont grudge a little thing like that  the lame woman hobbled from her post of rest and began to make the bed with the frown that always accompanied a task which strained the contracted muscles of her leg if you dont help your neighbour your neighbour dont help you she said sententiously  creed fixed his ironrimmed gaze on her in silence he was considering perhaps how he stood with regard to hughs in the light of that remark  i attended of his babys funeral he said oh dear hes here aready  the family of hughs indeed stood in the doorway the spiritual process by which westminister had gone through life was displayed completely in the next few seconds its so important for me to keep alive and well his eyes seemed saying i know the class of man you are but now youre here its not a bit o use my bein frightened im bound to get upsides with you ho yes keep yourself to yourself and dont you let me hev any o your nonsense cause i wont stand it oh dear no  beads of perspiration stood thick on his patchily coloured forehead with lips stiffening and intently staring eyes he waited for what the released prisoner would say  hughs whose face had blanched in the prison to a sallow greywhite hue and whose black eyes seemed to have sunk back into his head slowly looked the old man up and down at last he took his cap off showing his cropped hair  you got me that daddy he said but i dont bear you malice come up and have a cup o tea with us  and turning on his heel he began to mount the stairs followed by his wife and child breathing hard the old butler mounted too  in the room on the second floor where the baby no longer lived a haddock on the table was endeavouring to be fresh round it were slices of bread on plates a piece of butter in a piedish a teapot brown sugar in a basin and side by side a little jug of cold blue milk and a halfempty bottle of red vinegar close to one plate a bunch of stocks and gilly flowers reposed on the dirty tablecloth as though dropped and forgotten by the god of love their faint perfume stole through the other odours the old butler fixed his eyes on it  the poor woman bought that he thought hopin for to remind him of old days she had them flowers on her weddinday i shouldnt wonder this poetical conception surprising him he turned towards the little boy and said this ll be a memorial to you as you gets older and without another word all sat down they ate in silence and the old butler thought that addick aint what it was but a beautiful cup o tea he dont eat nothing hes more ameniable to reason than i expected theres no one wont be too pleased to see him now  his eyes travelling to the spot from which the bayonet had been removed rested on the print of the nativity suffer little children to come unto me he thought and forbid them not hell be glad to hear there was two carriages followed him home  and taking his time he cleared his throat in preparation for speech but before the singular muteness of this family sounds would not come finishing his tea he tremblingly arose things that he might have said jostled in his mind very pleased to a seen you hope youre in good health at the present time of speaking dont let me intrude on you weve all agot to die some time or other they remained unuttered making a vague movement of his skinny hand he walked feebly but quickly to the door when he stood but halfway within the room he made his final effort  im not agoin to say nothing he said thatd be superlative i wish you a goodmorning  outside he waited a second then grasped the banister  for all he sets so quiet theyve done him no good in that place he thought them eyes of his and slowly he descended full of a sort of very deep surprise i misjudged of him he was thinking he never was nothing but a armless human being we all has our predijuicesi misjudged of him theyve broke his eart between emthat they have  the silence in the room continued after his departure but when the little boy had gone to school hughs rose and lay down on the bed he rested there unmoving with his face towards the wall his arms clasped round his head to comfort it the seamstress stealing about her avocations paused now and then to look at him if he had raged at her if he had raged at everything it would not have been so terrifying as this utter silence which passed her comprehensionthis silence as of a man flung by the sea against a rock and pinned there with the life crushed out of him all her inarticulate longing now that her baby was gone to be close to something in her grey life to pass the unfranchisable barrier dividing her from the world seemed to well up to flow against this wall of silence and to recoil  twice or three times she addressed him timidly by name or made some trivial remark he did not answer as though in very truth he had been the shadow of a man lying there and the injustice of this silence seemed to her so terrible was she not his wife had she not borne him five and toiled to keep him from that girl was it her fault if she had made his life a hell with her jealousy as he had cried out that morning before he went for her and was put away he was her man it had been her rightnay more her duty  and still he lay there silent from the narrow street where no traffic passed the cries of a coster and distant whistlings mounted through the unwholesome air some sparrows in the eave were chirruping incessantly the little sandy housecat had stolen in and crouched against the doorpost was fastening her eyes on the plate which held the remnants of the fish the seamstress bowed her forehead to the flowers on the table unable any longer to bear the mystery of this silence she wept but the dark figure on the bed only pressed his arms closer round his head as though there were within him a living death passing the speech of men  the little sandy cat creeping across the floor fixed its claws in the backbone of the fish and drew it beneath the bed     chapter xxxix  the duel  bianca did not see her husband after their return together from the round pond she dined out that evening and in the morning avoided any interview when hilarys luggage was brought down and the cab summoned she slipped up to take shelter in her room presently the sound of his footsteps coming along the passage stopped outside her door he tapped she did not answer  goodbye would be a mockery let him go with the words unsaid and as though the thought had found its way through the closed door she heard his footsteps recede again she saw him presently go out to the cab with his head bent down saw him stoop and pat miranda hot tears sprang into her eyes she heard the cabwheels roll away  the heart is like the face of an eastern womanwarm and glowing behind swathe on swathe of fabric at each fresh touch from the fingers of life some new corner some hidden curve or angle comes into view to be seen last of all perhaps never to be seen by the one who owns them  when the cab had driven away there came into biancas heart a sense of the irreparable and mysteriously entwined with that arid ache a sort of bitter pity what would happen to this wretched girl now that he was gone would she go completely to the badtill she became one of those poor creatures like the figure in the shadow who stood beneath lampposts in the streets out of this speculation which was bitter as the taste of aloes there came to her a craving for some palliative some sweetness some expression of that instinct of fellowfeeling deep in each human breast however disharmonic but even with that craving was mingled the itch to justify herself and prove that she could rise above jealousy  she made her way to the little models lodging  a child admitted her into the bleak passage that served for hall the strange medley of emotions passing through biancas breast while she stood outside the girls door did not show in her face which wore its customary restrained halfmocking look  the little models voice faintly said come in  the room was in disorder as though soon to be deserted a closed and corded trunk stood in the centre of the floor the bed stripped of clothing lay disclosed in all the barrenness of discoloured ticking the china utensils of the washstand were turned head downwards beside that washstand the little model with her hat onthe hat with the purplishpink roses and the little peacocks featherstood in the struck shrinking attitude of one who coming forward in the expectation of a kiss has received a blow  you are leaving here then bianca said quietly  yes the girl murmured  dont you like this part is it too far from your work  again the little model whispered yes  biancas eyes travelled slowly over the blue beflowered walls and rustred doors through the dusty closeness of this dismantled room a rank scent of musk and violets rose as though a cheap essence had been scattered as libation a small empty scentbottle stood on the shabby lookingglass  have you found new lodgings  the little model edged closer to the window a stealthy watchfulness was creeping into her shrinking dazed face  she shook her head  i dont know where im going  obeying a sudden impulse to see more clearly bianca lifted her veil i came to tell you she said that i shall always be ready to help you  the girl did not answer but suddenly through her black lashes she stole a look upward at her visitor can you it seemed to say youhelp me oh no i think not and as though she had been stung by that glance bianca said with deadly slowness  it is my business of course entirely now that mr dallison has gone abroad  the little model received this saying with a quivering jerk it might have been an arrow transfixing her white throat for a moment she seemed almost about to fall but gripping the windowsill held herself erect her eyes like an animals in pain darted here there everywhere then rested on her visitors breast quite motionless this stare which seemed to see nothing but to be doing as it were some fateful calculation was uncanny colour came gradually back into her lips and eyes and cheeks she seemed to have succeeded in her calculation to be reviving from that stab  and suddenly bianca understood this was the meaning of the packed trunk the dismantled room he was going to take her after all  in the turmoil of this discovery two words alone escaped her  i see  they were enough the girls face at once lost all trace of its look of desperate calculation brightened became guilty and from guilty sullen  the antagonism of all the long past months was now declared between these twobiancas pride could no longer conceal the girls submissiveness no longer obscure it they stood like duellists one on each side of the trunkthat common brownjapanned tin trunk corded with rope bianca looked at it  you she said and he ha ha ha ha ha ha ha  against that cruel laughtermore poignant than a hundred homilies on caste a thousand scornful wordsthe little model literally could not stand she sat down in the low chair where she had evidently been sitting to watch the street but as a taste of blood will infuriate a hound so her own laughter seemed to bereave bianca of all restraint  what do you imagine hes taking you for girl only out of pity its not exactly the emotion to live on in exile in exilebut that you do not understand  the little model staggered to her feet again her face had grown painfully red  he wants me she said  wants you as he wants his dinner and when hes eaten itwhat then no of course hell never abandon you his conscience is too tender but youll be round his necklike this bianca raised her arms looped and dragged them slowly down as a mermaids arms drag at a drowning sailor  the little model stammered ill do what he tells me ill do what he tells me  bianca stood silent looking at the girl whose heaving breast and little peacocks feather whose small round hands twisting in front of her and scent about her clothes all seemed an offence  and do you suppose that hell tell you what he wants do you imagine hell have the necessary brutality to get rid of you hell think himself bound to keep you till you leave him as i suppose you will some day  the girl dropped her hands ill never leave himnever she cried out passionately  then heaven help him said bianca  the little models eyes seemed to lose all pupil like two chicory flowers that have no dark centres through them all that she was feeling struggled to find an outlet but too deep for words those feelings would not pass her lips utterly unused to express emotion she could only stammer  im notim noti will and press her hands again to her breast  biancas lip curled  i see you imagine yourself capable of sacrifice well you have your chance take it she pointed to the corded trunk nows your time you have only to disappear  the little model shrank back against the windowsill he wants me she muttered i know he wants me  bianca bit her lips till the blood came  your idea of sacrifice she said is perfect if you went now in a months time hed never think of you again  the girl gulped there was something so pitiful in the movements of her hands that bianca turned away she stood for several seconds staring at the door then turning round again said  well  but the girls whole face had changed all tearstained indeed she had already masked it with a sort of immovable stolidity  bianca went swiftly up to the trunk  you shall she said take that thing and go  the little model did not move  so you wont  the girl trembled violently all over she moistened her lips tried to speak failed again moistened them and this time murmured ill onlyill onlyif he tells me  so you still imagine he will tell you  the little model merely repeated i wontwont do anything without he tells me  bianca laughed why its like a dog she said  but the girl had turned abruptly to the window her lips were parted she was shrinking fluttering trembling at what she saw she was indeed like a spaniel dog who sees her master coming bianca had no need of being told that hilary was outside she went into the passage and opened the front door  he was coming up the steps his face worn like that of a man in fever and at the sight of his wife he stood quite still looking into her face  without the quiver of an eyelid without the faintest trace of emotion or the slightest sign that she knew him to be there bianca passed and slowly walked away     chapter xl  finish of the comedy  those who may have seen hilary driving towards the little models lodgings saw one who by a fixed red spot on either cheek and the overcompression of his quivering lips betrayed the presence of that animality which underlies even the most cultivated men  after eighteen hours of the purgatory of indecision he had not so much decided to pay that promised visit on which hung the future of two lives as allowed himself to be borne towards the girl  there was no one in the passage to see him after he had passed bianca in the doorway but it was with a face darkened by the peculiar stabbing look of wounded egoism that he entered the little models room  the sight of it coming so closely on the struggle she had just been through was too much for the girls selfcontrol  instead of going up to him she sat down on the corded trunk and began to sob it was the sobbing of a child whose schooltreat has been cancelled of a girl whose balldress has not come home in time it only irritated hilary whose nerves had already borne all they could bear he stood literally trembling as though each one of these common little sobs were a blow falling on the drumskin of his spirit and through every fibre he took in the features of the dusty scentbesprinkled roomthe brown tin trunk the dismantled bed the rustred doors  and he realised that she had burned her boats to make it impossible for a man of sensibility to disappoint her  the little model raised her face and looked at him what she saw must have been less reassuring even than the first sight had been for it stopped her sobbing she rose and turned to the window evidently trying with handkerchief and powderpuff to repair the ravages caused by her tears and when she had finished she still stood there with her back to him her deep breathing made her young form quiver from her waist up to the little peacocks feather in her hat and with each supple movement it seemed offering itself to hilary  in the street a barrelorgan had begun to play the very waltz it had played the afternoon when mr stone had been so ill those two were neither of them conscious of that tune too absorbed in their emotions and yet quietly it was bringing something to the girls figure like the dowering of scent that the sun brings to a flower it was bringing the compression back to hilarys lips the flush to his ears and cheeks as a draught of wind will blow to redness a fire that has been choked without knowing it without sound inch by inch he moved nearer to her and as though for all there was no sign of his advance she knew of it she stayed utterly unmoving except for the deep breathing that so stirred the warm youth in her in that stealthy progress was the history of life and the mystery of sex inch by inch he neared her and she swayed mesmerising his arms to fold round her thus poised as if she must fall backward mesmerising him to forget that there was anything there anything in all the world but just her young form waiting for himnothing but that  the barrelorgan stopped the spell had broken she turned round to him as a wind obscures with grey wrinkles the still green waters of enchantment into which some mortal has been gazing so hilarys reason suddenly swept across the situation and showed it once more as it was quick to mark every shade that passed across his face the girl made as though she would again burst into tears then since tears had been so useless she pressed her hand over her eyes  hilary looked at that round not too cleanly hand he could see her watching him between her fingers it was uncanny almost horrible like the sight of a cat watching a bird and he stood appalled at the terrible reality of his position at the sight of his own future with this girl with her traditions customs life the thousand and one things that he did not know about her that he would have to live with if he once took her a minute passed which seemed eternity for into it was condensed every force of her long pursuit her instinctive clutching at something that she felt to be security her reaching upwards her twining round him  conscious of all this held back by that vision of his future yet whipped towards her by his senses hilary swayed like a drunken man and suddenly she sprang at him wreathed her arms round his neck and fastened her mouth to his the touch of her lips was moist and hot the scent of stale violet powder came from her warmed by her humanity it penetrated to hilarys heart he started back in sheer physical revolt  thus repulsed the girl stood rigid her breast heaving her eyes unnaturally dilated her mouth still loosened by the kiss snatching from his pocket a roll of notes hilary flung them on the bed  i cant take you he almost groaned its madness its impossible and he went out into the passage he ran down the steps and got into his cab an immense time seemed to pass before it began to move it started at last and hilary sat back in it his hands clenched still as a dead man  his mortified face was recognised by the landlady returning from her mornings visit to the shops the gentleman looked she thought as if he had received bad news she not unnaturally connected his appearance with her lodger tapping on the girls door and receiving no answer she went in  the little model was lying on the dismantled bed pressing her face into the blue and white ticking of the bolster her shoulders shook and a sound of smothered sobbing came from her the landlady stood staring silently  coming of cornish chapelgoing stock she had never liked this girl her instinct telling her that she was one for whom life had already been too much those for whom life had so early been too much she knew were always ones for pleasure her experience of village life had enabled her to construct the little models storythat very simple very frequent little story sometimes indeed trouble of that sort was soon over and forgotten but sometimes if the young man didnt do the right thing by her and the girls folk took it hardly well then so had run the reasoning of this good woman being of the same class she had looked at her lodger from the first without obliquity of vision  but seeing her now apparently so overwhelmed and having something soft and warm down beneath her granitic face and hungry eyes she touched her on the back  come now she said you mustnt take on what is it  the little model shook off the hand as a passionate child shakes itself free of consolation let me alone she muttered  the landlady drew back has anyone done you a harm she said  the little model shook her head  baffled by this dumb grief the landlady was silent then with the stolidity of those whose lives are one long wrestling with fortune she muttered  i dont like to see anyone cry like that  and finding that the girl remained obstinately withdrawn from sight or sympathy she moved towards the door  well she said with ironical compassion if you want me ill be in the kitchen  the little model remained lying on her bed every now and then she gulped like a child flung down on the grass apart from its comrades trying to swallow down its rage trying to bury in the earth its little black moment of despair slowly those gulps grew fewer feebler and at last died away she sat up sweeping hilarys bundle of notes on which she had been lying to the floor  at sight of that bundle she broke out afresh flinging herself down sideways with her cheek on the wet bolster and for some time after her sobs had ceased again still lay there at last she rose and dragged herself over to the lookingglass scrutinising her streaked discoloured face the stains in the cheeks the swollen eyelids the marks beneath her eyes and listlessly she tidied herself then sitting down on the brown tin trunk she picked the bundle of notes off the floor they gave forth a dry peculiar crackle fifteen tenpound notesall hilarys travelling money her eyes opened wider and wider as she counted and tears quite suddenly rolled down on to those thin slips of paper  then slowly she undid her dress and forced them down till they rested with nothing but her vest between them and the quivering warm flesh which hid her heart     chapter xli  the house of harmony  at halfpast ten that evening stephen walked up the stoneflagged pathway of his brothers house  can i see mrs hilary  mr hilary went abroad this morning sir and mrs hilary has not yet come in  will you give her this letter no ill wait i suppose i can wait for her in the garden  oh yes sit  very well  ill leave the door open sir in case you want to come in  stephen walked across to the rustic bench and sat down he stared gloomily through the dusk at his patentleather boots and every now and then he flicked his evening trousers with the letter across the dark garden where the boughs hung soft unmoved by wind the light from mr stones open window flowed out in a pale river moths born of the sudden heat were fluttering up this river to its source  stephen looked irritably at the figure of mr stone which could be seen bowed and utterly still beside his desk so by lifting the spyhole thatch one may see a convict in his cell stand gazing at his work without movement numb with solitude  hes getting awfully broken up thought stephen poor old chap his ideas are killing him theyre not human nature never will be again he flicked his trousers with the letter as though that document emphasised the fact i cant help being sorry for the sublime old idiot  he rose the better to see his fatherinlaws unconscious figure it looked as lifeless and as cold as though mr stone had followed some thought below the ground and left his body standing there to await his return its appearance oppressed stephen  you might set the house on fire he thought hed never notice  mr stones figure moved the sound of along sigh came out to stephen in the windless garden he turned his eyes away with the sudden feeling that it was not the thing to watch the old chap like this then getting up he went indoors in his brothers study he stood turning over the knickknacks on the writingtable  i warned hilary that he was burning his fingers he thought  at the sound of the latchkey he went back to the hall  however much he had secretly disapproved of her from the beginning because she had always seemed to him such an uncomfortable and tantalising person stephen was impressed that night by the haunting unhappiness of biancas face as if it had been suddenly disclosed to him that she could not help herself this was disconcerting being in a sense a disorderly way of seeing things  you look tired b he said im sorry but i thought it better to bring this round tonight  bianca glanced at the letter  it is to you she said i dont wish to read it thank you  stephen compressed his lips  but i wish you to hear it please he said ill read it out if youll allow me   charing cross station  dear stevie  i told you yesterday morning that i was going abroad alone afterwards i changed my mindi meant to take her i went to her lodgings for the purpose i have lived too long amongst sentiments for such a piece of reality as that class has saved me it has triumphed over my most primitive instincts  i am going aloneback to my sentiments no slight has been placed on biancabut my married life having become a mockery i shall not return to it the following address will find me and i shall ask you presently to send on my household gods  please let bianca know the substance of this letter  ever your affectionate brother  hilary dallison   with a frown stephen folded up the letter and restored it to his breast pocket  its more bitter than i thought he reflected and yet hes done the only possible thing  bianca was leaning her elbow on the mantelpiece with her face turned to the wall her silence irritated stephen whose loyalty to his brother longed to fend a vent  im very much relieved of course he said at last it would have been fatal  she did not move and stephen became increasingly aware that this was a most awkward matter to touch on  of course he began again but b i do think youratheri mean and again he stopped before her utter silence her utter immobility then unable to go away without having in some sort expressed his loyalty to hilary he tried once more hilary is the kindest man i know its not his fault if hes out of touch with lifeif hes not fit to deal with things hes negative  and having thus in a single word somewhat to his own astonishment described his brother he held out his hand  the hand which bianca placed in it was feverishly hot stephen felt suddenly compunctious  im awfully sorry he stammered about the whole thing im awfully sorry for you  bianca drew back her hand  with a little shrug stephen turned away  what are you to do with women like that was his thought and saying dryly goodnight b he went  for some time bianca sat in hilarys chair then by the faint glimmer coming through the halfopen door she began to wander round the room touching the walls the books the prints all the familiar things among which he had lived so many years  in that dim continual journey she was like a disharmonic spirit traversing the air above where its body lies  the door creaked behind her a voice said sharply  what are you doing in this house  mr stone was standing beside the bust of socrates bianca went up to him  father  mr stone stared it is you i thought it was a thief where is hilary  gone away  alone  bianca bowed her head it is very late dad she whispered  mr stones hand moved as though he would have stroked her  the human heart he murmured is the tomb of many feelings  bianca put her arm round him  you must go to bed dad she said trying to get him to the door for in her heart something seemed giving way  mr stone stumbled the door swung to the room was plunged in darkness a hand cold as ice brushed her cheek with all her force she stiffed a scream  i am here mr stone said  his hand wandering downwards touched her shoulder and she seized it with her own burning hand thus linked they groped their way out into the passage towards his room  goodnight dear bianca murmured  by the light of his now open door mr stone seemed to try and see her face but she would not show it him closing the door gently she stole upstairs  sitting down in her bedroom by the open window it seemed to her that the room was full of peopleher nerves were so unstrung it was as if walls had not the power this night to exclude human presences moving or motionless now distinct then covered suddenly by the thick veil of some material object they circled round her quiet figure lying back in the chair with shut eyes these disharmonic shadows flitting in the room made a stir like the rubbing of dry straw or the hum of bees among clover stalks when she sat up they vanished and the sounds became the distant din of homing traffic but the moment she closed her eyes her visitors again began to steal round her with that dry mysterious hum  she fell asleep presently and woke with a start there in a glimmer of pale light stood the little model as in the fatal picture bianca had painted of her her face was powder white with shadows beneath the eyes breath seemed coming through her parted lips just touched with colour in her hat lay the tiny peacocks feather beside the two purplishpink roses a scent came from her toobut faint as ever was the scent of chicory flower how long had she been standing there bianca started to her feet and as she rose the vision vanished  she went towards the spot there was nothing in that corner but moonlight the scent she had perceived was merely that of the trees drifting in  but so vivid had that vision been that she stood at the window panting for air passing her hand again and again across her eyes  outside over the dark gardens the moon hung full and almost golden its honeypale light filtered down on every little shape of tree and leaf and sleeping flower that soft vibrating radiance seemed to have woven all into one mysterious whole stilling disharmony so that each little separate shape had no meaning to itself  bianca looked long at the rain of moonlight falling on the earths carpet like a covering shower of blossom which bees have sucked and spilled then below her out through candescent space she saw a shadow dart forth along the grass and to her fright a voice rose tremulous and clear seeming to seek enfranchisement beyond the barrier of the dark trees my brain is clouded great universe i cannot write i can no longer discover to my brothers that they are one i am not worthy to stay here let me pass into you and die  bianca saw her fathers fragile arms stretch out into the night through the sleeves of his white garment as though expecting to be received at once into the universal brotherhood of the thin air  there ensued a moment when by magic every little dissonance in all the town seemed blended into a harmony of silence as it might be the very death of self upon the earth  then breaking that trance mr stones voice rose again trembling out into the night as though blown through a reed  brothers he said  behind the screen of lilac bushes at the gate bianca saw the dark helmet of a policeman he stood there staring steadily in the direction of that voice raising his lantern he flashed it into every corner of the garden searching for those who had been addressed satisfied apparently that no one was there he moved it to right and left lowered it to the level of his breast and walked slowly on
