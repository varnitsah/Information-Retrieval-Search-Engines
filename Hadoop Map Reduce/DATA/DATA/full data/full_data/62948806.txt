the gray champion  there was once a time when new england groaned under the actual pressure of heavier wrongs than those threatened ones which brought on the revolution james ii the bigoted successor of charles the voluptuous had annulled the charters of all the colonies and sent a harsh and unprincipled soldier to take away our liberties and endanger our religion the administration of sir edmund andros lacked scarcely a single characteristic of tyranny a governor and council holding office from the king and wholly independent of the country laws made and taxes levied without concurrence of the people immediate or by their representatives the rights of private citizens violated and the titles of all landed property declared void the voice of complaint stifled by restrictions on the press and finally disaffection overawed by the first band of mercenary troops that ever marched on our free soil for two years our ancestors were kept in sullen submission by that filial love which had invariably secured their allegiance to the mother country whether its head chanced to be a parliament protector or popish monarch till these evil times however such allegiance had been merely nominal and the colonists had ruled themselves enjoying far more freedom than is even yet the privilege of the native subjects of great britain  at length a rumor reached our shores that the prince of orange had ventured on an enterprise the success of which would be the triumph of civil and religious rights and the salvation of new england it was but a doubtful whisper it might be false or the attempt might fail and in either case the man that stirred against king james would lose his head still the intelligence produced a marked effect the people smiled mysteriously in the streets and threw bold glances at their oppressors while far and wide there was a subdued and silent agitation as if the slightest signal would rouse the whole land from its sluggish despondency aware of their danger the rulers resolved to avert it by an imposing display of strength and perhaps to confirm their despotism by yet harsher measures one afternoon in april 1689 sir edmund andros and his favorite councillors being warm with wine assembled the redcoats of the governors guard and made their appearance in the streets of boston the sun was near setting when the march commenced  the roll of the drum at that unquiet crisis seemed to go through the streets less as the martial music of the soldiers than as a mustercall to the inhabitants themselves a multitude by various avenues assembled in king street which was destined to be the scene nearly a century afterwards of another encounter between the troops of britain and a people struggling against her tyranny though more than sixty years had elapsed since the pilgrims came this crowd of their descendants still showed the strong and sombre features of their character perhaps more strikingly in such a stern emergency than on happier occasions there were the sober garb the general severity of mien the gloomy but undismayed expression the scriptural forms of speech and the confidence in heavens blessing on a righteous cause which would have marked a band of the original puritans when threatened by some peril of the wilderness indeed it was not yet time for the old spirit to be extinct since there were men in the street that day who had worshipped there beneath the trees before a house was reared to the god for whom they had become exiles old soldiers of the parliament were here too smiling grimly at the thought that their aged arms might strike another blow against the house of stuart here also were the veterans of king philips war who had burned villages and slaughtered young and old with pious fierceness while the godly souls throughout the land were helping them with prayer several ministers were scattered among the crowd which unlike all other mobs regarded them with such reverence as if there were sanctity in their very garments these holy men exerted their influence to quiet the people but not to disperse them meantime the purpose of the governor in disturbing the peace of the town at a period when the slightest commotion might throw the country into a ferment was almost the universal subject of inquiry and variously explained  satan will strike his masterstroke presently cried some because he knoweth that his time is short all our godly pastors are to be dragged to prison we shall see them at a smithfield fire in king street  hereupon the people of each parish gathered closer round their minister who looked calmly upwards and assumed a more apostolic dignity as well befitted a candidate for the highest honor of his profession the crown of martyrdom it was actually fancied at that period that new england might have a john rogers of her own to take the place of that worthy in the primer  the pope of rome has given orders for a new st bartholomew cried others we are to be massacred man and male child  neither was this rumor wholly discredited although the wiser class believed the governors object somewhat less atrocious his predecessor under the old charter bradstreet a venerable companion of the first settlers was known to be in town there were grounds for conjecturing that sir edmund andros intended at once to strike terror by a parade of military force and to confound the opposite faction by possessing himself of their chief  stand firm for the old charter governor shouted the crowd seizing upon the idea the good old governor bradstreet  while this cry was at the loudest the people were surprised by the wellknown figure of governor bradstreet himself a patriarch of nearly ninety who appeared on the elevated steps of a door and with characteristic mildness besought them to submit to the constituted authorities  my children concluded this venerable person do nothing rashly cry not aloud but pray for the welfare of new england and expect patiently what the lord will do in this matter  the event was soon to be decided all this time the roll of the drum had been approaching through cornhill louder and deeper till with reverberations from house to house and the regular tramp of martial footsteps it burst into the street a double rank of soldiers made their appearance occupying the whole breadth of the passage with shouldered matchlocks and matches burning so as to present a row of fires in the dusk their steady march was like the progress of a machine that would roll irresistibly over everything in its way next moving slowly with a confused clatter of hoofs on the pavement rode a party of mounted gentlemen the central figure being sir edmund andros elderly but erect and soldierlike those around him were his favorite councillors and the bitterest foes of new england at his right hand rode edward randolph our archenemy that blasted wretch as cotton mather calls him who achieved the downfall of our ancient government and was followed with a sensible curse through life and to his grave on the other side was bullivant scattering jests and mockery as he rode along dudley came behind with a downcast look dreading as well he might to meet the indignant gaze of the people who beheld him their only countryman by birth among the oppressors of his native land the captain of a frigate in the harbor and two or three civil officers under the crown were also there but the figure which most attracted the public eye and stirred up the deepest feeling was the episcopal clergyman of kings chapel riding haughtily among the magistrates in his priestly vestments the fitting representatives of prelacy and persecution the union of church and state and all those abominations which had driven the puritans to the wilderness another guard of soldiers in double rank brought up the rear  the whole scene was a picture of the condition of new england and its moral the deformity of any government that does not grow out of the nature of things and the character of the people on one side the religious multitude with their sad visages and dark attire and on the other the group of despotic rulers with the high churchman in the midst and here and there a crucifix at their bosoms all magnificently clad flushed with wine proud of unjust authority and scoffing at the universal groan and the mercenary soldiers waiting but the word to deluge the street with blood showed the only means by which obedience could be secured  o lord of hosts cried a voice among the crowd provide a champion for thy people  this ejaculation was loudly uttered and served as a heralds cry to introduce a remarkable personage the crowd had rolled back and were now huddled together nearly at the extremity of the street while the soldiers had advanced no more than a third of its length the intervening space was emptya paved solitude between lofty edifices which threw almost a twilight shadow over it suddenly there was seen the figure of an ancient man who seemed to have emerged from among the people and was walking by himself along the centre of the street to confront the armed band he wore the old puritan dress a dark cloak and a steeplecrowned hat in the fashion of at least fifty years before with a heavy sword upon his thigh but a staff in his hand to assist the tremulous gait of age  when at some distance from the multitude the old man turned slowly round displaying a face of antique majesty rendered doubly venerable by the hoary beard that descended on his breast he made a gesture at once of encouragement and warning then turned again and resumed his way  who is this gray patriarch asked the young men of their sires  who is this venerable brother asked the old men among themselves  but none could make reply the fathers of the people those of fourscore years and upwards were disturbed deeming it strange that they should forget one of such evident authority whom they must have known in their early days the associate of winthrop and all the old councillors giving laws and making prayers and leading them against the savage the elderly men ought to have remembered him too with locks as gray in their youth as their own were now and the young how could he have passed so utterly from their memoriesthat hoary sire the relic of longdeparted times whose awful benediction had surely been bestowed on their uncovered heads in childhood  whence did he come what is his purpose who can this old man be whispered the wondering crowd  meanwhile the venerable stranger staff in hand was pursuing his solitary walk along the centre of the street as he drew near the advancing soldiers and as the roll of their drum came full upon his ears the old man raised himself to a loftier mien while the decrepitude of age seemed to fall from his shoulders leaving him in gray but unbroken dignity now he marched onward with a warriors step keeping time to the military music thus the aged form advanced on one side and the whole parade of soldiers and magistrates on the other till when scarcely twenty yards remained between the old man grasped his staff by the middle and held it before him like a leaders truncheon  stand cried he  the eye the face and attitude of command the solemn yet warlike peal of that voice fit either to rule a host in the battlefield or be raised to god in prayer were irresistible at the old mans word and outstretched arm the roll of the drum was hushed at once and the advancing line stood still a tremulous enthusiasm seized upon the multitude that stately form combining the leader and the saint so gray so dimly seen in such an ancient garb could only belong to some old champion of the righteous cause whom the oppressors drum had summoned from his grave they raised a shout of awe and exultation and looked for the deliverance of new england  the governor and the gentlemen of his party perceiving themselves brought to an unexpected stand rode hastily forward as if they would have pressed their snorting and affrighted horses right against the hoary apparition he however blenched not a step but glancing his severe eye round the group which half encompassed him at last bent it sternly on sir edmund andros one would have thought that the dark old man was chief ruler there and that the governor and council with soldiers at their back representing the whole power and authority of the crown had no alternative but obedience  what does this old fellow here cried edward randolph fiercely on sir edmund bid the soldiers forward and give the dotard the same choice that you give all his countrymento stand aside or be trampled on  nay nay let us show respect to the good grandsire said bullivant laughing see you not he is some old roundheaded dignitary who hath lain asleep these thirty years and knows nothing o the change of times doubtless he thinks to put us down with a proclamation in old nolls name  are you mad old man demanded sir edmund andros in loud and harsh tones how dare you stay the march of king jamess governor  i have stayed the march of a king himself ere now replied the gray figure with stern composure i am here sir governor because the cry of an oppressed people hath disturbed me in my secret place and beseeching this favor earnestly of the lord it was vouchsafed me to appear once again on earth in the good old cause of his saints and what speak ye of james there is no longer a popish tyrant on the throne of england and by tomorrow noon his name shall be a byword in this very street where ye would make it a word of terror back thou wast a governor back with this night thy power is endedtomorrow the prisonback lest i foretell the scaffold  the people had been drawing nearer and nearer and drinking in the words of their champion who spoke in accents long disused like one unaccustomed to converse except with the dead of many years ago but his voice stirred their souls they confronted the soldiers not wholly without arms and ready to convert the very stones of the street into deadly weapons sir edmund andros looked at the old man then he cast his hard and cruel eye over the multitude and beheld them burning with that lurid wrath so difficult to kindle or to quench and again he fixed his gaze on the aged form which stood obscurely in an open space where neither friend nor foe had thrust himself what were his thoughts he uttered no word which might discover but whether the oppressor were overawed by the gray champions look or perceived his peril in the threatening attitude of the people it is certain that he gave back and ordered his soldiers to commence a slow and guarded retreat before another sunset the governor and all that rode so proudly with him were prisoners and long ere it was known that james had abdicated king william was proclaimed throughout new england  but where was the gray champion some reported that when the troops had gone from king street and the people were thronging tumultuously in their rear bradstreet the aged governor was seen to embrace a form more aged than his own others soberly affirmed that while they marvelled at the venerable grandeur of his aspect the old man had faded from their eyes melting slowly into the hues of twilight till where he stood there was an empty space but all agreed that the hoary shape was gone the men of that generation watched for his reappearance in sunshine and in twilight but never saw him more nor knew when his funeral passed nor where his gravestone was  and who was the gray champion perhaps his name might be found in the records of that stern court of justice which passed a sentence too mighty for the age but glorious in all aftertimes for its humbling lesson to the monarch and its high example to the subject i have heard that whenever the descendants of the puritans are to show the spirit of their sires the old man appears again when eighty years had passed he walked once more in king street five years later in the twilight of an april morning he stood on the green beside the meetinghouse at lexington where now the obelisk of granite with a slab of slate inlaid commemorates the first fallen of the revolutions and when our fathers were toiling at the breastwork on bunkers hill all through that night the old warrior walked his rounds long long may it be ere he comes again his hour is one of darkness and adversity and peril but should domestic tyranny oppress us or the invaders step pollute our soil still may the gray champion come for he is the type of new englands hereditary spirit and his shadowy march on the eve of danger must ever be the pledge that new englands sons will vindicate their ancestry   the wedding knell  there is a certain church in the city of new york which i have always regarded with peculiar interest on account of a marriage there solemnized under very singular circumstances in my grandmothers girlhood that venerable lady chanced to be a spectator of the scene and ever after made it her favorite narrative whether the edifice now standing on the same site be the identical one to which she referred i am not antiquarian enough to know nor would it be worth while to correct myself perhaps of an agreeable error by reading the date of its erection on the tablet over the door it is a stately church surrounded by an inclosure of the loveliest green within which appear urns pillars obelisks and other forms of monumental marble the tributes of private affection or more splendid memorials of historic dust with such a place though the tumult of the city rolls beneath its tower one would be willing to connect some legendary interest  the marriage might be considered as the result of an early engagement though there had been two intermediate weddings on the ladys part and forty years of celibacy on that of the gentleman at sixtyfive mr ellenwood was a shy but not quite a secluded man selfish like all men who brood over their own hearts yet manifesting on rare occasions a vein of generous sentiment a scholar throughout life though always an indolent one because his studies had no definite object either of public advantage or personal ambition a gentleman high bred and fastidiously delicate yet sometimes requiring a considerable relaxation in his behalf of the common rules of society in truth there were so many anomalies in his character and though shrinking with diseased sensibility from public notice it had been his fatality so often to become the topic of the day by some wild eccentricity of conduct that people searched his lineage for an hereditary taint of insanity but there was no need of this his caprices had their origin in a mind that lacked the support of an engrossing purpose and in feelings that preyed upon themselves for want of other food if he were mad it was the consequence and not the cause of an aimless and abortive life  the widow was as complete a contrast to her third bridegroom in everything but age as can well be conceived compelled to relinquish her first engagement she had been united to a man of twice her own years to whom she became an exemplary wife and by whose death she was left in possession of a splendid fortune a southern gentleman considerably younger than herself succeeded to her hand and carried her to charleston where after many uncomfortable years she found herself again a widow it would have been singular if any uncommon delicacy of feeling had survived through such a life as mrs dabneys it could not but be crushed and killed by her early disappointment the cold duty of her first marriage the dislocation of the hearts principles consequent on a second union and the unkindness of her southern husband which had inevitably driven her to connect the idea of his death with that of her comfort to be brief she was that wisest but unloveliest variety of woman a philosopher bearing troubles of the heart with equanimity dispensing with all that should have been her happiness and making the best of what remained sage in most matters the widow was perhaps the more amiable for the one frailty that made her ridiculous being childless she could not remain beautiful by proxy in the person of a daughter she therefore refused to grow old and ugly on any consideration she struggled with time and held fast her roses in spite of him till the venerable thief appeared to have relinquished the spoil as not worth the trouble of acquiring it  the approaching marriage of this woman of the world with such an unworldly man as mr ellenwood was announced soon after mrs dabneys return to her native city superficial observers and deeper ones seemed to concur in supposing that the lady must have borne no inactive part in arranging the affair there were considerations of expediency which she would be far more likely to appreciate than mr ellenwood and there was just the specious phantom of sentiment and romance in this late union of two early lovers which sometimes makes a fool of a woman who has lost her true feelings among the accidents of life all the wonder was how the gentleman with his lack of worldly wisdom and agonizing consciousness of ridicule could have been induced to take a measure at once so prudent and so laughable but while people talked the weddingday arrived the ceremony was to be solemnized according to the episcopalian forms and in open church with a degree of publicity that attracted many spectators who occupied the front seats of the galleries and the pews near the altar and along the broad aisle it had been arranged or possibly it was the custom of the day that the parties should proceed separately to church by some accident the bridegroom was a little less punctual than the widow and her bridal attendants with whose arrival after this tedious but necessary preface the action of our tale may be said to commence  the clumsy wheels of several oldfashioned coaches were heard and the gentlemen and ladies composing the bridal party came through the church door with the sudden and gladsome effect of a burst of sunshine the whole group except the principal figure was made up of youth and gayety as they streamed up the broad aisle while the pews and pillars seemed to brighten on either side their steps were as buoyant as if they mistook the church for a ballroom and were ready to dance hand in hand to the altar so brilliant was the spectacle that few took notice of a singular phenomenon that had marked its entrance at the moment when the brides foot touched the threshold the bell swung heavily in the tower above her and sent forth its deepest knell the vibrations died away and returned with prolonged solemnity as she entered the body of the church  good heavens what an omen whispered a young lady to her lover  on my honor replied the gentleman i believe the bell has the good taste to toll of its own accord what has she to do with weddings if you dearest julia were approaching the altar the bell would ring out its merriest peal it has only a funeral knell for her  the bride and most of her company had been too much occupied with the bustle of entrance to hear the first boding stroke of the bell or at least to reflect on the singularity of such a welcome to the altar they therefore continued to advance with undiminished gayety the gorgeous dresses of the time the crimson velvet coats the goldlaced hats the hoop petticoats the silk satin brocade and embroidery the buckles canes and swords all displayed to the best advantage on persons suited to such finery made the group appear more like a brightcolored picture than anything real but by what perversity of taste had the artist represented his principal figure as so wrinkled and decayed while yet he had decked her out in the brightest splendor of attire as if the loveliest maiden had suddenly withered into age and become a moral to the beautiful around her on they went however and had glittered along about a third of the aisle when another stroke of the bell seemed to fill the church with a visible gloom dimming and obscuring the bright pageant till it shone forth again as from a mist  this time the party wavered stopped and huddled closer together while a slight scream was heard from some of the ladies and a confused whispering among the gentlemen thus tossing to and fro they might have been fancifully compared to a splendid bunch of flowers suddenly shaken by a puff of wind which threatened to scatter the leaves of an old brown withered rose on the same stalk with two dewy budssuch being the emblem of the widow between her fair young bridemaids but her heroism was admirable she had started with an irrepressible shudder as if the stroke of the bell had fallen directly on her heart then recovering herself while her attendants were yet in dismay she took the lead and paced calmly up the aisle the bell continued to swing strike and vibrate with the same doleful regularity as when a corpse is on its way to the tomb  my young friends here have their nerves a little shaken said the widow with a smile to the clergyman at the altar but so many weddings have been ushered in with the merriest peal of the bells and yet turned out unhappily that i shall hope for better fortune under such different auspices  madam answered the rector in great perplexity this strange occurrence brings to my mind a marriage sermon of the famous bishop taylor wherein he mingles so many thoughts of mortality and future woe that to speak somewhat after his own rich style he seems to hang the bridal chamber in black and cut the wedding garment out of a coffin pall and it has been the custom of divers nations to infuse something of sadness into their marriage ceremonies so to keep death in mind while contracting that engagement which is lifes chiefest business thus we may draw a sad but profitable moral from this funeral knell  but though the clergyman might have given his moral even a keener point he did not fail to dispatch an attendant to inquire into the mystery and stop those sounds so dismally appropriate to such a marriage a brief space elapsed during which the silence was broken only by whispers and a few suppressed titterings among the wedding party and the spectators who after the first shock were disposed to draw an illnatured merriment from the affair the young have less charity for aged follies than the old for those of youth the widows glance was observed to wander for an instant towards a window of the church as if searching for the timeworn marble that she had dedicated to her first husband then her eyelids dropped over their faded orbs and her thoughts were drawn irresistibly to another grave two buried men with a voice at her ear and a cry afar off were calling her to lie down beside them perhaps with momentary truth of feeling she thought how much happier had been her fate if after years of bliss the bell were now tolling for her funeral and she were followed to the grave by the old affection of her earliest lover long her husband but why had she returned to him when their cold hearts shrank from each others embrace  still the deathbell tolled so mournfully that the sunshine seemed to fade in the air a whisper communicated from those who stood nearest the windows now spread through the church a hearse with a train of several coaches was creeping along the street conveying some dead man to the churchyard while the bride awaited a living one at the altar immediately after the footsteps of the bridegroom and his friends were heard at the door the widow looked down the aisle and clinched the arm of one of her bridemaids in her bony hand with such unconscious violence that the fair girl trembled  you frighten me my dear madam cried she for heavens sake what is the matter  nothing my dear nothing said the widow then whispering close to her ear there is a foolish fancy that i cannot get rid of i am expecting my bridegroom to come into the church with my first two husbands for groomsmen  look look screamed the bridemaid what is here the funeral  as she spoke a dark procession paced into the church first came an old man and women like chief mourners at a funeral attired from head to foot in the deepest black all but their pale features and hoary hair he leaning on a staff and supporting her decrepit form with his nerveless arm behind appeared another and another pair as aged as black and mournful as the first as they drew near the widow recognized in every face some trait of former friends long forgotten but now returning as if from their old graves to warn her to prepare a shroud or with purpose almost as unwelcome to exhibit their wrinkles and infirmity and claim her as their companion by the tokens of her own decay many a merry night had she danced with them in youth and now in joyless age she felt that some withered partner should request her hand and all unite in a dance of death to the music of the funeral bell  while these aged mourners were passing up the aisle it was observed that from pew to pew the spectators shuddered with irrepressible awe as some object hitherto concealed by the intervening figures came full in sight many turned away their faces others kept a fixed and rigid stare and a young girl giggled hysterically and fainted with the laughter on her lips when the spectral procession approached the altar each couple separated and slowly diverged till in the centre appeared a form that had been worthily ushered in with all this gloomy pomp the death knell and the funeral it was the bridegroom in his shroud  no garb but that of the grave could have befitted such a deathlike aspect the eyes indeed had the wild gleam of a sepulchral lamp all else was fixed in the stern calmness which old men wear in the coffin the corpse stood motionless but addressed the widow in accents that seemed to melt into the clang of the bell which fell heavily on the air while he spoke  come my bride said those pale lips the hearse is ready the sexton stands waiting for us at the door of the tomb let us be married and then to our coffins  how shall the widows horror be represented it gave her the ghastliness of a dead mans bride her youthful friends stood apart shuddering at the mourners the shrouded bridegroom and herself the whole scene expressed by the strongest imagery the vain struggle of the gilded vanities of this world when opposed to age infirmity sorrow and death the awestruck silence was first broken by the clergyman  mr ellenwood said he soothingly yet with somewhat of authority you are not well your mind has been agitated by the unusual circumstances in which you are placed the ceremony must be deferred as an old friend let me entreat you to return home  home yes but not without my bride answered he in the same hollow accents you deem this mockery perhaps madness had i bedizened my aged and broken frame with scarlet and embroideryhad i forced my withered lips to smile at my dead heartthat might have been mockery or madness but now let young and old declare which of us has come hither without a wedding garment the bridegroom or the bride  he stepped forward at a ghostly pace and stood beside the widow contrasting the awful simplicity of his shroud with the glare and glitter in which she had arrayed herself for this unhappy scene none that beheld them could deny the terrible strength of the moral which his disordered intellect had contrived to draw  cruel cruel groaned the heartstricken bride  cruel repeated he then losing his deathlike composure in a wild bitterness heaven judge which of us has been cruel to the other in youth you deprived me of my happiness my hopes my aims you took away all the substance of my life and made it a dream without reality enough even to grieve atwith only a pervading gloom through which i walked wearily and cared not whither but after forty years when i have built my tomb and would not give up the thought of resting therenor not for such a life as we once picturedyou call me to the altar at your summons i am here but other husbands have enjoyed your youth your beauty your warmth of heart and all that could be termed your life what is there for me but your decay and death and therefore i have bidden these funeral friends and bespoken the sextons deepest knell and am come in my shroud to wed you as with a burial service that we may join our hands at the door of the sepulchre and enter it together  it was not frenzy it was not merely the drunkenness of strong emotion in a heart unused to it that now wrought upon the bride the stern lesson of the day had done its work her worldliness was gone she seized the bridegrooms hand  yes cried she let us wed even at the door of the sepulchre my life is gone in vanity and emptiness but at its close there is one true feeling it has made me what i was in youth it makes me worthy of you time is no more for both of us let us wed for eternity  with a long and deep regard the bridegroom looked into her eyes while a tear was gathering in his own how strange that gush of human feeling from the frozen bosom of a corpse he wiped away the tears even with his shroud  beloved of my youth said he i have been wild the despair of my whole lifetime had returned at once and maddened me forgive and be forgiven yes it is evening with us now and we have realized none of our morning dreams of happiness but let us join our hands before the altar as lovers whom adverse circumstances have separated through life yet who meet again as they are leaving it and find their earthly affection changed into something holy as religion and what is time to the married of eternity  amid the tears of many and a swell of exalted sentiment in those who felt aright was solemnized the union of two immortal souls the train of withered mourners the hoary bridegroom in his shroud the pale features of the aged bride and the deathbell tolling through the whole till its deep voice overpowered the marriage words all marked the funeral of earthly hopes but as the ceremony proceeded the organ as if stirred by the sympathies of this impressive scene poured forth an anthem first mingling with the dismal knell then rising to a loftier strain till the soul looked down upon its woe and when the awful rite was finished and with cold hand in cold hand the married of eternity withdrew the organs peal of solemn triumph drowned the wedding knell     the ministers black veil a parable1  1 another clergyman in new england mr joseph moody of york maine who died about eighty years since made himself remarkable by the same eccentricity that is here related of the reverend mr hooper in his case however the symbol had a different import in early life he had accidentally killed a beloved friend and from that day till the hour of his own death he hid his face from men   the sexton stood in the porch of milford meetinghouse pulling busily at the bellrope the old people of the village came stooping along the street children with bright faces tripped merrily beside their parents or mimicked a graver gait in the conscious dignity of their sunday clothes spruce bachelors looked sidelong at the pretty maidens and fancied that the sabbath sunshine made them prettier than on week days when the throng had mostly streamed into the porch the sexton began to toll the bell keeping his eye on the reverend mr hoopers door the first glimpse of the clergymans figure was the signal for the bell to cease its summons  but what has good parson hooper got upon his face cried the sexton in astonishment  all within hearing immediately turned about and beheld the semblance of mr hooper pacing slowly his meditative way towards the meetinghouse with one accord they started expressing more wonder than if some strange minister were coming to dust the cushions of mr hoopers pulpit  are you sure it is our parson inquired goodman gray of the sexton  of a certainty it is good mr hooper replied the sexton he was to have exchanged pulpits with parson shute of westbury but parson shute sent to excuse himself yesterday being to preach a funeral sermon  the cause of so much amazement may appear sufficiently slight mr hooper a gentlemanly person of about thirty though still a bachelor was dressed with due clerical neatness as if a careful wife had starched his band and brushed the weekly dust from his sundays garb there was but one thing remarkable in his appearance swathed about his forehead and hanging down over his face so low as to be shaken by his breath mr hooper had on a black veil on a nearer view it seemed to consist of two folds of crape which entirely concealed his features except the mouth and chin but probably did not intercept his sight further than to give a darkened aspect to all living and inanimate things with this gloomy shade before him good mr hooper walked onward at a slow and quiet pace stooping somewhat and looking on the ground as is customary with abstracted men yet nodding kindly to those of his parishioners who still waited on the meetinghouse steps but so wonderstruck were they that his greeting hardly met with a return  i cant really feel as if good mr hoopers face was behind that piece of crape said the sexton  i dont like it muttered an old woman as she hobbled into the meetinghouse he has changed himself into something awful only by hiding his face  our parson has gone mad cried goodman gray following him across the threshold  a rumor of some unaccountable phenomenon had preceded mr hooper into the meetinghouse and set all the congregation astir few could refrain from twisting their heads towards the door many stood upright and turned directly about while several little boys clambered upon the seats and came down again with a terrible racket there was a general bustle a rustling of the womens gowns and shuffling of the mens feet greatly at variance with that hushed repose which should attend the entrance of the minister but mr hooper appeared not to notice the perturbation of his people he entered with an almost noiseless step bent his head mildly to the pews on each side and bowed as he passed his oldest parishioner a whitehaired great grandsire who occupied an armchair in the centre of the aisle it was strange to observe how slowly this venerable man became conscious of something singular in the appearance of his pastor he seemed not fully to partake of the prevailing wonder till mr hooper had ascended the stairs and showed himself in the pulpit face to face with his congregation except for the black veil that mysterious emblem was never once withdrawn it shook with his measured breath as he gave out the psalm it threw its obscurity between him and the holy page as he read the scriptures and while he prayed the veil lay heavily on his uplifted countenance did he seek to hide it from the dread being whom he was addressing  such was the effect of this simple piece of crape that more than one woman of delicate nerves was forced to leave the meetinghouse yet perhaps the palefaced congregation was almost as fearful a sight to the minister as his black veil to them  mr hooper had the reputation of a good preacher but not an energetic one he strove to win his people heavenward by mild persuasive influences rather than to drive them thither by the thunders of the word the sermon which he now delivered was marked by the same characteristics of style and manner as the general series of his pulpit oratory but there was something either in the sentiment of the discourse itself or in the imagination of the auditors which made it greatly the most powerful effort that they had ever heard from their pastors lips it was tinged rather more darkly than usual with the gentle gloom of mr hoopers temperament the subject had reference to secret sin and those sad mysteries which we hide from our nearest and dearest and would fain conceal from our own consciousness even forgetting that the omniscient can detect them a subtle power was breathed into his words each member of the congregation the most innocent girl and the man of hardened breast felt as if the preacher had crept upon them behind his awful veil and discovered their hoarded iniquity of deed or thought many spread their clasped hands on their bosoms there was nothing terrible in what mr hooper said at least no violence and yet with every tremor of his melancholy voice the hearers quaked an unsought pathos came hand in hand with awe so sensible were the audience of some unwonted attribute in their minister that they longed for a breath of wind to blow aside the veil almost believing that a strangers visage would be discovered though the form gesture and voice were those of mr hooper  at the close of the services the people hurried out with indecorous confusion eager to communicate their pentup amazement and conscious of lighter spirits the moment they lost sight of the black veil some gathered in little circles huddled closely together with their mouths all whispering in the centre some went homeward alone wrapt in silent meditation some talked loudly and profaned the sabbath day with ostentatious laughter a few shook their sagacious heads intimating that they could penetrate the mystery while one or two affirmed that there was no mystery at all but only that mr hoopers eyes were so weakened by the midnight lamp as to require a shade after a brief interval forth came good mr hooper also in the rear of his flock turning his veiled face from one group to another he paid due reverence to the hoary heads saluted the middle aged with kind dignity as their friend and spiritual guide greeted the young with mingled authority and love and laid his hands on the little childrens heads to bless them such was always his custom on the sabbath day strange and bewildered looks repaid him for his courtesy none as on former occasions aspired to the honor of walking by their pastors side old squire saunders doubtless by an accidental lapse of memory neglected to invite mr hooper to his table where the good clergyman had been wont to bless the food almost every sunday since his settlement he returned therefore to the parsonage and at the moment of closing the door was observed to look back upon the people all of whom had their eyes fixed upon the minister a sad smile gleamed faintly from beneath the black veil and flickered about his mouth glimmering as he disappeared  how strange said a lady that a simple black veil such as any woman might wear on her bonnet should become such a terrible thing on mr hoopers face  something must surely be amiss with mr hoopers intellects observed her husband the physician of the village but the strangest part of the affair is the effect of this vagary even on a soberminded man like myself the black veil though it covers only our pastors face throws its influence over his whole person and makes him ghostlike from head to foot do you not feel it so  truly do i replied the lady and i would not be alone with him for the world i wonder he is not afraid to be alone with himself  men sometimes are so said her husband  the afternoon service was attended with similar circumstances at its conclusion the bell tolled for the funeral of a young lady the relatives and friends were assembled in the house and the more distant acquaintances stood about the door speaking of the good qualities of the deceased when their talk was interrupted by the appearance of mr hooper still covered with his black veil it was now an appropriate emblem the clergyman stepped into the room where the corpse was laid and bent over the coffin to take a last farewell of his deceased parishioner as he stooped the veil hung straight down from his forehead so that if her eyelids had not been closed forever the dead maiden might have seen his face could mr hooper be fearful of her glance that he so hastily caught back the black veil a person who watched the interview between the dead and living scrupled not to affirm that at the instant when the clergymans features were disclosed the corpse had slightly shuddered rustling the shroud and muslin cap though the countenance retained the composure of death a superstitious old woman was the only witness of this prodigy from the coffin mr hooper passed into the chamber of the mourners and thence to the head of the staircase to make the funeral prayer it was a tender and heartdissolving prayer full of sorrow yet so imbued with celestial hopes that the music of a heavenly harp swept by the fingers of the dead seemed faintly to be heard among the saddest accents of the minister the people trembled though they but darkly understood him when he prayed that they and himself and all of mortal race might be ready as he trusted this young maiden had been for the dreadful hour that should snatch the veil from their faces the bearers went heavily forth and the mourners followed saddening all the street with the dead before them and mr hooper in his black veil behind  why do you look back said one in the procession to his partner  i had a fancy replied she that the minister and the maidens spirit were walking hand in hand  and so had i at the same moment said the other  that night the handsomest couple in milford village were to be joined in wedlock though reckoned a melancholy man mr hooper had a placid cheerfulness for such occasions which often excited a sympathetic smile where livelier merriment would have been thrown away there was no quality of his disposition which made him more beloved than this the company at the wedding awaited his arrival with impatience trusting that the strange awe which had gathered over him throughout the day would now be dispelled but such was not the result when mr hooper came the first thing that their eyes rested on was the same horrible black veil which had added deeper gloom to the funeral and could portend nothing but evil to the wedding such was its immediate effect on the guests that a cloud seemed to have rolled duskily from beneath the black crape and dimmed the light of the candles the bridal pair stood up before the minister but the brides cold fingers quivered in the tremulous hand of the bridegroom and her deathlike paleness caused a whisper that the maiden who had been buried a few hours before was come from her grave to be married if ever another wedding were so dismal it was that famous one where they tolled the wedding knell after performing the ceremony mr hooper raised a glass of wine to his lips wishing happiness to the newmarried couple in a strain of mild pleasantry that ought to have brightened the features of the guests like a cheerful gleam from the hearth at that instant catching a glimpse of his figure in the lookingglass the black veil involved his own spirit in the horror with which it overwhelmed all others his frame shuddered his lips grew white he spilt the untasted wine upon the carpet and rushed forth into the darkness for the earth too had on her black veil  the next day the whole village of milford talked of little else than parson hoopers black veil that and the mystery concealed behind it supplied a topic for discussion between acquaintances meeting in the street and good women gossiping at their open windows it was the first item of news that the tavernkeeper told to his guests the children babbled of it on their way to school one imitative little imp covered his face with an old black handkerchief thereby so affrighting his playmates that the panic seized himself and he wellnigh lost his wits by his own waggery  it was remarkable that all of the busybodies and impertinent people in the parish not one ventured to put the plain question to mr hooper wherefore he did this thing hitherto whenever there appeared the slightest call for such interference he had never lacked advisers nor shown himself averse to be guided by their judgment if he erred at all it was by so painful a degree of selfdistrust that even the mildest censure would lead him to consider an indifferent action as a crime yet though so well acquainted with this amiable weakness no individual among his parishioners chose to make the black veil a subject of friendly remonstrance there was a feeling of dread neither plainly confessed nor carefully concealed which caused each to shift the responsibility upon another till at length it was found expedient to send a deputation of the church in order to deal with mr hooper about the mystery before it should grow into a scandal never did an embassy so ill discharge its duties the minister received then with friendly courtesy but became silent after they were seated leaving to his visitors the whole burden of introducing their important business the topic it might be supposed was obvious enough there was the black veil swathed round mr hoopers forehead and concealing every feature above his placid mouth on which at times they could perceive the glimmering of a melancholy smile but that piece of crape to their imagination seemed to hang down before his heart the symbol of a fearful secret between him and them were the veil but cast aside they might speak freely of it but not till then thus they sat a considerable time speechless confused and shrinking uneasily from mr hoopers eye which they felt to be fixed upon them with an invisible glance finally the deputies returned abashed to their constituents pronouncing the matter too weighty to be handled except by a council of the churches if indeed it might not require a general synod  but there was one person in the village unappalled by the awe with which the black veil had impressed all beside herself when the deputies returned without an explanation or even venturing to demand one she with the calm energy of her character determined to chase away the strange cloud that appeared to be settling round mr hooper every moment more darkly than before as his plighted wife it should be her privilege to know what the black veil concealed at the ministers first visit therefore she entered upon the subject with a direct simplicity which made the task easier both for him and her after he had seated himself she fixed her eyes steadfastly upon the veil but could discern nothing of the dreadful gloom that had so overawed the multitude it was but a double fold of crape hanging down from his forehead to his mouth and slightly stirring with his breath  no said she aloud and smiling there is nothing terrible in this piece of crape except that it hides a face which i am always glad to look upon come good sir let the sun shine from behind the cloud first lay aside your black veil then tell me why you put it on  mr hoopers smile glimmered faintly  there is an hour to come said he when all of us shall cast aside our veils take it not amiss beloved friend if i wear this piece of crape till then  your words are a mystery too returned the young lady take away the veil from them at least  elizabeth i will said he so far as my vow may suffer me know then this veil is a type and a symbol and i am bound to wear it ever both in light and darkness in solitude and before the gaze of multitudes and as with strangers so with my familiar friends no mortal eye will see it withdrawn this dismal shade must separate me from the world even you elizabeth can never come behind it  what grievous affliction hath befallen you she earnestly inquired that you should thus darken your eyes forever  if it be a sign of mourning replied mr hooper i perhaps like most other mortals have sorrows dark enough to be typified by a black veil  but what if the world will not believe that it is the type of an innocent sorrow urged elizabeth beloved and respected as you are there may be whispers that you hide your face under the consciousness of secret sin for the sake of your holy office do away this scandal  the color rose into her cheeks as she intimated the nature of the rumors that were already abroad in the village but mr hoopers mildness did not forsake him he even smiled againthat same sad smile which always appeared like a faint glimmering of light proceeding from the obscurity beneath the veil  if i hide my face for sorrow there is cause enough he merely replied and if i cover it for secret sin what mortal might not do the same  and with this gentle but unconquerable obstinacy did he resist all her entreaties at length elizabeth sat silent for a few moments she appeared lost in thought considering probably what new methods might be tried to withdraw her lover from so dark a fantasy which if it had no other meaning was perhaps a symptom of mental disease though of a firmer character than his own the tears rolled down her cheeks but in an instant as it were a new feeling took the place of sorrow her eyes were fixed insensibly on the black veil when like a sudden twilight in the air its terrors fell around her she arose and stood trembling before him  and do you feel it then at last said he mournfully  she made no reply but covered her eyes with her hand and turned to leave the room he rushed forward and caught her arm  have patience with me elizabeth cried he passionately do not desert me though this veil must be between us here on earth be mine and hereafter there shall be no veil over my face no darkness between our souls it is but a mortal veilit is not for eternity  o you know not how lonely i am and how frightened to be alone behind my black veil do not leave me in this miserable obscurity forever  lift the veil but once and look me in the face said she  never it cannot be replied mr hooper  then farewell said elizabeth  she withdrew her arm from his grasp and slowly departed pausing at the door to give one long shuddering gaze that seemed almost to penetrate the mystery of the black veil but even amid his grief mr hooper smiled to think that only a material emblem had separated him from happiness though the horrors which it shadowed forth must be drawn darkly between the fondest of lovers  from that time no attempts were made to remove mr hoopers black veil or by a direct appeal to discover the secret which it was supposed to hide by persons who claimed a superiority to popular prejudice it was reckoned merely an eccentric whim such as often mingles with the sober actions of men otherwise rational and tinges them all with its own semblance of insanity but with the multitude good mr hooper was irreparbly a bugbear he could not walk the street with any peace of mind so conscious was he that the gentle and timid would turn aside to avoid him and that others would make it a point of hardihood to throw themselves in his way the impertinence of the latter class compelled him to give up his customary walk at sunset to the burial ground for when he leaned pensively over the gate there would always be faces behind the gravestones peeping at his black veil a fable went the rounds that the stare of the dead people drove him thence it grieved him to the very depth of his kind heart to observe how the children fled from his approach breaking up their merriest sports while his melancholy figure was yet afar off their instinctive dread caused him to feel more strongly than aught else that a preternatural horror was interwoven with the threads of the black crape in truth his own antipathy to the veil was known to be so great that he never willingly passed before a mirror nor stooped to drink at a still fountain lest in its peaceful bosom he should be affrighted by himself this was what gave plausibility to the whispers that mr hoopers conscience tortured him for some great crime too horrible to be entirely concealed or otherwise than so obscurely intimated thus from beneath the black veil there rolled a cloud into the sunshine an ambiguity of sin or sorrow which enveloped the poor minister so that love or sympathy could never reach him it was said that ghost and fiend consorted with him there with selfshudderings and outward terrors he walked continually in its shadow groping darkly within his own soul or gazing through a medium that saddened the whole world even the lawless wind it was believed respected his dreadful secret and never blew aside the veil but still good mr hooper sadly smiled at the pale visages of the worldly throng as he passed by  among all its bad influences the black veil had the one desirable effect of making its wearer a very efficient clergyman by the aid of his mysterious emblemfor there was no other apparent causehe became a man of awful power over souls that were in agony for sin his converts always regarded him with a dread peculiar to themselves affirming though but figuratively that before he brought them to celestial light they had been with him behind the black veil its gloom indeed enabled him to sympathize with all dark affections dying sinners cried aloud for mr hooper and would not yield their breath till he appeared though ever as he stooped to whisper consolation they shuddered at the veiled face so near their own such were the terrors of the black veil even when death had bared his visage strangers came long distances to attend service at his church with the mere idle purpose of gazing at his figure because it was forbidden them to behold his face but many were made to quake ere they departed once during governor belchers administration mr hooper was appointed to preach the election sermon covered with his black veil he stood before the chief magistrate the council and the representatives and wrought so deep an impression that the legislative measures of that year were characterized by all the gloom and piety of our earliest ancestral sway  in this manner mr hooper spent a long life irreproachable in outward act yet shrouded in dismal suspicions kind and loving though unloved and dimly feared a man apart from men shunned in their health and joy but ever summoned to their aid in mortal anguish as years wore on shedding their snows above his sable veil he acquired a name throughout the new england churches and they called him father hooper nearly all his parishioners who were of mature age when he was settled had been borne away by many a funeral he had one congregation in the church and a more crowded one in the churchyard and having wrought so late into the evening and done his work so well it was now good father hoopers turn to rest  several persons were visible by the shaded candlelight in the death chamber of the old clergyman natural connections he had none but there was the decorously grave though unmoved physician seeking only to mitigate the last pangs of the patient whom he could not save there were the deacons and other eminently pious members of his church there also was the reverend mr clark of westbury a young and zealous divine who had ridden in haste to pray by the bedside of the expiring minister there was the nurse no hired handmaiden of death but one whose calm affection had endured thus long in secrecy in solitude amid the chill of age and would not perish even at the dying hour who but elizabeth and there lay the hoary head of good father hooper upon the death pillow with the black veil still swathed about his brow and reaching down over his face so that each more difficult gasp of his faint breath caused it to stir all through life that piece of crape had hung between him and the world it had separated him from cheerful brotherhood and womans love and kept him in that saddest of all prisons his own heart and still it lay upon his face as if to deepen the gloom of his darksome chamber and shade him from the sunshine of eternity  for some time previous his mind had been confused wavering doubtfully between the past and the present and hovering forward as it were at intervals into the indistinctness of the world to come there had been feverish turns which tossed him from side to side and wore away what little strength he had but in his most convulsive struggles and in the wildest vagaries of his intellect when no other thought retained its sober influence he still showed an awful solicitude lest the black veil should slip aside even if his bewildered soul could have forgotten there was a faithful woman at this pillow who with averted eyes would have covered that aged face which she had last beheld in the comeliness of manhood at length the deathstricken old man lay quietly in the torpor of mental and bodily exhaustion with an imperceptible pulse and breath that grew fainter and fainter except when a long deep and irregular inspiration seemed to prelude the flight of his spirit  the minister of westbury approached the bedside  venerable father hooper said he the moment of your release is at hand are you ready for the lifting of the veil that shuts in time from eternity  father hooper at first replied merely by a feeble motion of his head then apprehensive perhaps that his meaning might be doubted he exerted himself to speak  yea said he in faint accents my soul hath a patient weariness until that veil be lifted  and is it fitting resumed the reverend mr clark that a man so given to prayer of such a blameless example holy in deed and thought so far as mortal judgment may pronounce is it fitting that a father in the church should leave a shadow on his memory that may seem to blacken a life so pure i pray you my venerable brother let not this thing be suffer us to be gladdened by your triumphant aspect as you go to your reward before the veil of eternity be lifted let me cast aside this black veil from your face  and thus speaking the reverend mr clark bent forward to reveal the mystery of so many years but exerting a sudden energy that made all the beholders stand aghast father hooper snatched both his hands from beneath the bedclothes and pressed them strongly on the black veil resolute to struggle if the minister of westbury would contend with a dying man  never cried the veiled clergyman on earth never  dark old man exclaimed the affrighted minister with what horrible crime upon your soul are you now passing to the judgment  father hoopers breath heaved it rattled in his throat but with a mighty effort grasping forward with his hands he caught hold of life and held it back till he should speak he even raised himself in bed and there he sat shivering with the arms of death around him while the black veil hung down awful at that last moment in the gathered terrors of a lifetime and yet the faint sad smile so often there now seemed to glimmer from its obscurity and linger on father hoopers lips  why do you tremble at me alone cried he turning his veiled face round the circle of pale spectators tremble also at each other have men avoided me and women shown no pity and children screamed and fled only for my black veil what but the mystery which it obscurely typifies has made this piece of crape so awful when the friend shows his inmost heart to his friend the lover to his best beloved when man does not vainly shrink from the eye of his creator loathsomely treasuring up the secret of his sin then deem me a monster for the symbol beneath which i have lived and die i look around me and lo on every visage a black veil  while his auditors shrank from one another in mutual affright father hooper fell back upon his pillow a veiled corpse with a faint smile lingering on the lips still veiled they laid him in his coffin and a veiled corpse they bore him to the grave the grass of many years has sprung up and withered on that grave the burial stone is mossgrown and good mr hoopers face is dust but awful is still the thought that it mouldered beneath the black veil     the maypole of merry mount   there is an admirable foundation for a philosophic romance in the curious history of the early settlement of mount wollaston or merry mount in the slight sketch here attempted the facts recorded on the grave pages of our new england annalists have wrought themselves almost spontaneously into a sort of allegory the masques mummeries and festive customs described in the text are in accordance with the manners of the age authority on these points may be found in strutts book of english sports and pastimes   bright were the days at merry mount when the maypole was the banner staff of that gay colony they who reared it should their banner be triumphant were to pour sunshine over new englands rugged hills and scatter flower seeds throughout the soil jollity and gloom were contending for an empire midsummer eve had come bringing deep verdure to the forest and roses in her lap of a more vivid hue than the tender buds of spring but may or her mirthful spirit dwelt all the year round at merry mount sporting with the summer months and revelling with autumn and basking in the glow of winters fireside through a world of toil and care she flitted with a dreamlike smile and came hither to find a home among the lightsome hearts of merry mount  never had the maypole been so gayly decked as at sunset on midsummer eve this venerated emblem was a pinetree which had preserved the slender grace of youth while it equalled the loftiest height of the old wood monarchs from its top streamed a silken banner colored like the rainbow down nearly to the ground the pole was dressed with birchen boughs and others of the liveliest green and some with silvery leaves fastened by ribbons that fluttered in fantastic knots of twenty different colors but no sad ones garden flowers and blossoms of the wilderness laughed gladly forth amid the verdure so fresh and dewy that they must have grown by magic on that happy pinetree where this green and flowery splendor terminated the shaft of the maypole was stained with the seven brilliant hues of the banner at its top on the lowest green bough hung an abundant wreath of roses some that had been gathered in the sunniest spots of the forest and others of still richer blush which the colonists had reared from english seed o people of the golden age the chief of your husbandry was to raise flowers  but what was the wild throng that stood hand in hand about the maypole it could not be that the fauns and nymphs when driven from their classic groves and homes of ancient fable had sought refuge as all the persecuted did in the fresh woods of the west these were gothic monsters though perhaps of grecian ancestry on the shoulders of a comely youth uprose the head and branching antlers of a stag a second human in all other points had the grim visage of a wolf a third still with the trunk and limbs of a mortal man showed the beard and horns of a venerable hegoat there was the likeness of a bear erect brute in all but his hind legs which were adorned with pink silk stockings and here again almost as wondrous stood a real bear of the dark forest lending each of his fore paws to the grasp of a human hand and as ready for the dance as any in that circle his inferior nature rose half way to meet his companions as they stooped other faces wore the similitude of man or woman but distorted or extravagant with red noses pendulous before their mouths which seemed of awful depth and stretched from ear to ear in an eternal fit of laughter here might be seen the savage man well known in heraldry hairy as a baboon and girdled with green leaves by his side a noble figure but still a counterfeit appeared an indian hunter with feathery crest and wampum belt many of this strange company wore foolscaps and had little bells appended to their garments tinkling with a silvery sound responsive to the inaudible music of their gleesome spirits some youths and maidens were of soberer garb yet well maintained their places in the irregular throng by the expression of wild revelry upon their features such were the colonists of merry mount as they stood in the broad smile of sunset round their venerated maypole  had a wanderer bewildered in the melancholy forest heard their mirth and stolen a halfaffrighted glance he might have fancied them the crew of comus some already transformed to brutes some midway between man and beast and the others rioting in the flow of tipsy jollity that foreran the change but a band of puritans who watched the scene invisible themselves compared the masques to those devils and ruined souls with whom their superstition peopled the black wilderness  within the ring of monsters appeared the two airiest forms that had ever trodden on any more solid footing than a purple and golden cloud one was a youth in glistening apparel with a scarf of the rainbow pattern crosswise on his breast his right hand held a gilded staff the ensign of high dignity among the revellers and his left grasped the slender fingers of a fair maiden not less gayly decorated than himself bright roses glowed in contrast with the dark and glossy curls of each and were scattered round their feet or had sprung up spontaneously there behind this lightsome couple so close to the maypole that its boughs shaded his jovial face stood the figure of an english priest canonically dressed yet decked with flowers in heathen fashion and wearing a chaplet of the native vine leaves by the riot of his rolling eye and the pagan decorations of his holy garb he seemed the wildest monster there and the very comus of the crew  votaries of the maypole cried the flowerdecked priest merrily all day long have the woods echoed to your mirth but be this your merriest hour my hearts lo here stand the lord and lady of the may whom i a clerk of oxford and high priest of merry mount am presently to join in holy matrimony up with your nimble spirits ye morrisdancers green men and glee maidens bears and wolves and horned gentlemen come a chorus now rich with the old mirth of merry england and the wilder glee of this fresh forest and then a dance to show the youthful pair what life is made of and how airily they should go through it all ye that love the maypole lend your voices to the nuptial song of the lord and lady of the may  this wedlock was more serious than most affairs of merry mount where jest and delusion trick and fantasy kept up a continual carnival the lord and lady of the may though their titles must be laid down at sunset were really and truly to be partners for the dance of life beginning the measure that same bright eve the wreath of roses that hung from the lowest green bough of the maypole had been twined for them and would be thrown over both their heads in symbol of their flowery union when the priest had spoken therefore a riotous uproar burst from the rout of monstrous figures  begin you the stave reverend sir cried they all and never did the woods ring to such a merry peal as we of the maypole shall send up  immediately a prelude of pipe cithern and viol touched with practised minstrelsy began to play from a neighboring thicket in such a mirthful cadence that the boughs of the maypole quivered to the sound but the may lord he of the gilded staff chancing to look into his ladys eyes was wonder struck at the almost pensive glance that met his own  edith sweet lady of the may whispered he reproachfully is yon wreath of roses a garland to hang above our graves that you look so sad o edith this is our golden time tarnish it not by any pensive shadow of the mind for it may be that nothing of futurity will be brighter than the mere remembrance of what is now passing  that was the very thought that saddened me how came it in your mind too said edith in a still lower tone than he for it was high treason to be sad at merry mount therefore do i sigh amid this festive music and besides dear edgar i struggle as with a dream and fancy that these shapes of our jovial friends are visionary and their mirth unreal and that we are no true lord and lady of the may what is the mystery in my heart  just then as if a spell had loosened them down came a little shower of withering rose leaves from the maypole alas for the young lovers no sooner had their hearts glowed with real passion than they were sensible of something vague and unsubstantial in their former pleasures and felt a dreary presentiment of inevitable change from the moment that they truly loved they had subjected themselves to earths doom of care and sorrow and troubled joy and had no more a home at merry mount that was ediths mystery now leave we the priest to marry them and the masquers to sport round the maypole till the last sunbeam be withdrawn from its summit and the shadows of the forest mingle gloomily in the dance meanwhile we may discover who these gay people were  two hundred years ago and more the old world and its inhabitants became mutually weary of each other men voyaged by thousands to the west some to barter glass beads and such like jewels for the furs of the indian hunter some to conquer virgin empires and one stern band to pray but none of these motives had much weight with the colonists of merry mount their leaders were men who had sported so long with life that when thought and wisdom came even these unwelcome guests were led astray by the crowd of vanities which they should have put to flight erring thought and perverted wisdom were made to put on masques and play the fool the men of whom we speak after losing the hearts fresh gayety imagined a wild philosophy of pleasure and came hither to act out their latest daydream they gathered followers from all that giddy tribe whose whole life is like the festal days of soberer men in their train were minstrels not unknown in london streets wandering players whose theatres had been the halls of noblemen mummers ropedancers and mountebanks who would long be missed at wakes church ales and fairs in a word mirth makers of every sort such as abounded in that age but now began to be discountenanced by the rapid growth of puritanism light had their footsteps been on land and as lightly they came across the sea many had been maddened by their previous troubles into a gay despair others were as madly gay in the flush of youth like the may lord and his lady but whatever might be the quality of their mirth old and young were gay at merry mount the young deemed themselves happy the elder spirits if they knew that mirth was but the counterfeit of happiness yet followed the false shadow wilfully because at least her garments glittered brightest sworn triflers of a lifetime they would not venture among the sober truths of life not even to be truly blest  all the hereditary pastimes of old england were transplanted hither the king of christmas was duly crowned and the lord of misrule bore potent sway on the eve of st john they felled whole acres of the forest to make bonfires and danced by the blaze all night crowned with garlands and throwing flowers into the flame at harvest time though their crop was of the smallest they made an image with the sheaves of indian corn and wreathed it with autumnal garlands and bore it home triumphantly but what chiefly characterized the colonists of merry mount was their veneration for the maypole it has made their true history a poets tale spring decked the hallowed emblem with young blossoms and fresh green boughs summer brought roses of the deepest blush and the perfected foliage of the forest autumn enriched it with that red and yellow gorgeousness which converts each wildwood leaf into a painted flower and winter silvered it with sleet and hung it round with icicles till it flashed in the cold sunshine itself a frozen sunbeam thus each alternate season did homage to the maypole and paid it a tribute of its own richest splendor its votaries danced round it once at least in every month sometimes they called it their religion or their altar but always it was the banner staff of merry mount  unfortunately there were men in the new world of a sterner faith than those maypole worshippers not far from merry mount was a settlement of puritans most dismal wretches who said their prayers before daylight and then wrought in the forest or the cornfield till evening made it prayer time again their weapons were always at hand to shoot down the straggling savage when they met in conclave it was never to keep up the old english mirth but to hear sermons three hours long or to proclaim bounties on the heads of wolves and the scalps of indians their festivals were fast days and their chief pastime the singing of psalms woe to the youth or maiden who did but dream of a dance the selectman nodded to the constable and there sat the lightheeled reprobate in the stocks or if he danced it was round the whippingpost which might be termed the puritan maypole  a party of these grim puritans toiling through the difficult woods each with a horseload of iron armor to burden his footsteps would sometimes draw near the sunny precincts of merry mount there were the silken colonists sporting round their maypole perhaps teaching a bear to dance or striving to communicate their mirth to the grave indian or masquerading in the skins of deer and wolves which they had hunted for that especial purpose often the whole colony were playing at blindmans buff magistrates and all with their eyes bandaged except a single scapegoat whom the blinded sinners pursued by the tinkling of the bells at his garments once it is said they were seen following a flowerdecked corpse with merriment and festive music to his grave but did the dead man laugh in their quietest times they sang ballads and told tales for the edification of their pious visitors or perplexed them with juggling tricks or grinned at them through horse collars and when sport itself grew wearisome they made game of their own stupidity and began a yawning match at the very least of these enormities the men of iron shook their heads and frowned so darkly that the revellers looked up imagining that a momentary cloud had overcast the sunshine which was to be perpetual there on the other hand the puritans affirmed that when a psalm was pealing from their place of worship the echo which the forest sent them back seemed often like the chorus of a jolly catch closing with a roar of laughter who but the fiend and his bond slaves the crew of merry mount had thus disturbed them in due time a feud arose stern and bitter on one side and as serious on the other as anything could be among such light spirits as had sworn allegiance to the maypole the future complexion of new england was involved in this important quarrel should the grizzly saints establish their jurisdiction over the gay sinners then would their spirits darken all the clime and make it a land of clouded visages of hard toil of sermon and psalm forever but should the banner staff of merry mount be fortunate sunshine would break upon the hills and flowers would beautify the forest and late posterity do homage to the maypole  after these authentic passages from history we return to the nuptials of the lord and lady of the may alas we have delayed too long and must darken our tale too suddenly as we glance again at the maypole a solitary sunbeam is fading from the summit and leaves only a faint golden tinge blended with the hues of the rainbow banner even that dim light is now withdrawn relinquishing the whole domain of merry mount to the evening gloom which has rushed so instantaneously from the black surrounding woods but some of these black shadows have rushed forth in human shape  yes with the setting sun the last day of mirth had passed from merry mount the ring of gay masquers was disordered and broken the stag lowered his antlers in dismay the wolf grew weaker than a lamb the bells of the morrisdancers tinkled with tremulous affright the puritans had played a characteristic part in the maypole mummeries their darksome figures were intermixed with the wild shapes of their foes and made the scene a picture of the moment when waking thoughts start up amid the scattered fantasies of a dream the leader of the hostile party stood in the centre of the circle while the route of monsters cowered around him like evil spirits in the presence of a dread magician no fantastic foolery could look him in the face so stern was the energy of his aspect that the whole man visage frame and soul seemed wrought of iron gifted with life and thought yet all of one substance with his headpiece and breastplate it was the puritan of puritans it was endicott himself  stand off priest of baal said he with a grim frown and laying no reverent hand upon the surplice i know thee blackstone1 thou art the man who couldst not abide the rule even of thine own corrupted church and hast come hither to preach iniquity and to give example of it in thy life but now shall it be seen that the lord hath sanctified this wilderness for his peculiar people woe unto them that would defile it and first for this flowerdecked abomination the altar of thy worship   1 did governor endicott speak less positively we should suspect a mistake here the rev mr blackstone though an eccentric is not known to have been an immoral man we rather doubt his identity with the priest of merry mount   and with his keen sword endicott assaulted the hallowed maypole nor long did it resist his arm it groaned with a dismal sound it showered leaves and rosebuds upon the remorseless enthusiast and finally with all its green boughs and ribbons and flowers symbolic of departed pleasures down fell the banner staff of merry mount as it sank tradition says the evening sky grew darker and the woods threw forth a more sombre shadow  there cried endicott looking triumphantly on his work there lies the only maypole in new england the thought is strong within me that by its fall is shadowed forth the fate of light and idle mirth makers amongst us and our posterity amen saith john endicott  amen echoed his followers  but the votaries of the maypole gave one groan for their idol at the sound the puritan leader glanced at the crew of comus each a figure of broad mirth yet at this moment strangely expressive of sorrow and dismay  valiant captain quoth peter palfrey the ancient of the band what order shall be taken with the prisoners  i thought not to repent me of cutting down a maypole replied endicott yet now i could find in my heart to plant it again and give each of these bestial pagans one other dance round their idol it would have served rarely for a whippingpost  but there are pinetrees enow suggested the lieutenant  true good ancient said the leader wherefore bind the heathen crew and bestow on them a small matter of stripes apiece as earnest of our future justice set some of the rogues in the stocks to rest themselves so soon as providence shall bring us to one of our own wellordered settlements where such accommodations may be found further penalties such as branding and cropping of ears shall be thought of hereafter  how many stripes for the priest inquired ancient palfrey  none as yet answered endicott bending his iron frown upon the culprit it must be for the great and general court to determine whether stripes and long imprisonment and other grievous penalty may atone for his transgressions let him look to himself for such as violate our civil order it may be permitted us to show mercy but woe to the wretch that troubleth our religion  and this dancing bear resumed the officer must he share the stripes of his fellows  shoot him through the head said the energetic puritan i suspect witchcraft in the beast  here be a couple of shining ones continued peter palfrey pointing his weapon at the lord and lady of the may they seem to be of high station among these misdoers methinks their dignity will not be fitted with less than a double share of stripes  endicott rested on his sword and closely surveyed the dress and aspect of the hapless pair there they stood pale downcast and apprehensive yet there was an air of mutual support and of pure affection seeking aid and giving it that showed them to be man and wife with the sanction of a priest upon their love the youth in the peril of the moment had dropped his gilded staff and thrown his arm about the lady of the may who leaned against his breast too lightly to burden him but with weight enough to express that their destinies were linked together for good or evil they looked first at each other and then into the grim captains face there they stood in the first hour of wedlock while the idle pleasures of which their companions were the emblems had given place to the sternest cares of life personified by the dark puritans but never had their youthful beauty seemed so pure and high as when its glow was chastened by adversity  youth said endicott ye stand in an evil case thou and thy maiden wife make ready presently for i am minded that ye shall both have a token to remember your wedding day  stern man cried the may lord how can i move thee were the means at hand i would resist to the death being powerless i entreat do with me as thou wilt but let edith go untouched  not so replied the immitigable zealot we are not wont to show an idle courtesy to that sex which requireth the stricter discipline what sayest thou maid shall thy silken bridegroom suffer thy share of the penalty besides his own  be it death said edith and lay it all on me  truly as endicott had said the poor lovers stood in a woful case their foes were triumphant their friends captive and abased their home desolate the benighted wilderness around them and a rigorous destiny in the shape of the puritan leader their only guide yet the deepening twilight could not altogether conceal that the iron man was softened he smiled at the fair spectacle of early love he almost sighed for the inevitable blight of early hopes  the troubles of life have come hastily on this young couple observed endicott we will see how they comport themselves under their present trials ere we burden them with greater if among the spoil there be any garments of a more decent fashion let them be put upon this may lord and his lady instead of their glistening vanities look to it some of you  and shall not the youths hair be cut asked peter palfrey looking with abhorrence at the lovelock and long glossy curls of the young man  crop it forthwith and that in the true pumpkinshell fashion answered the captain then bring them along with us but more gently than their fellows there be qualities in the youth which may make him valiant to fight and sober to toil and pious to pray and in the maiden that may fit her to become a mother in our israel bringing up babes in better nurture than her own hath been nor think ye young ones that they are the happiest even in our lifetime of a moment who misspend it in dancing round a maypole  and endicott the severest puritan of all who laid the rock foundation of new england lifted the wreath of roses from the ruin of the maypole and threw it with his own gauntleted hand over the heads of the lord and lady of the may it was a deed of prophecy as the moral gloom of the world overpowers all systematic gayety even so was their home of wild mirth made desolate amid the sad forest they returned to it no more but as their flowery garland was wreathed of the brightest roses that had grown there so in the tie that united them were intertwined all the purest and best of their early joys they went heavenward supporting each other along the difficult path which it was their lot to tread and never wasted one regretful thought on the vanities of merry mount     the gentle boy  in the course of the year 1656 several of the people called quakers led as they professed by the inward movement of the spirit made their appearance in new england their reputation as holders of mystic and pernicious principles having spread before them the puritans early endeavored to banish and to prevent the further intrusion of the rising sect but the measures by which it was intended to purge the land of heresy though more than sufficiently vigorous were entirely unsuccessful the quakers esteeming persecution as a divine call to the post of danger laid claim to a holy courage unknown to the puritans themselves who had shunned the cross by providing for the peaceable exercise of their religion in a distant wilderness though it was the singular fact that every nation of the earth rejected the wandering enthusiasts who practised peace towards all men the place of greatest uneasiness and peril and therefore in their eyes the most eligible was the province of massachusetts bay  the fines imprisonments and stripes liberally distributed by our pious forefathers the popular antipathy so strong that it endured nearly a hundred years after actual persecution had ceased were attractions as powerful for the quakers as peace honor and reward would have been for the worldly minded every european vessel brought new cargoes of the sect eager to testify against the oppression which they hoped to share and when shipmasters were restrained by heavy fines from affording them passage they made long and circuitous journeys through the indian country and appeared in the province as if conveyed by a supernatural power their enthusiasm heightened almost to madness by the treatment which they received produced actions contrary to the rules of decency as well as of rational religion and presented a singular contrast to the calm and staid deportment of their sectarian successors of the present day the command of the spirit inaudible except to the soul and not to be controverted on grounds of human wisdom was made a plea for most indecorous exhibitions which abstractedly considered well deserved the moderate chastisement of the rod these extravagances and the persecution which was at once their cause and consequence continued to increase till in the year 1659 the government of massachusetts bay indulged two members of the quaker sect with a crown of martyrdom  an indelible stain of blood is upon the hands of all who consented to this act but a large share of the awful responsibility must rest upon the person then at the head of the government he was a man of narrow mind and imperfect education and his uncompromising bigotry was made hot and mischievous by violent and hasty passions he exerted his influence indecorously and unjustifiably to compass the death of the enthusiasts and his whole conduct in respect to them was marked by brutal cruelty the quakers whose revengeful feelings were not less deep because they were inactive remembered this man and his associates in after times the historian of the sect affirms that by the wrath of heaven a blight fell upon the land in the vicinity of the bloody town of boston so that no wheat would grow there and he takes his stand as it were among the graves of the ancient persecutors and triumphantly recounts the judgments that overtook them in old age or at the parting hour he tells us that they died suddenly and violently and in madness but nothing can exceed the bitter mockery with which he records the loathsome disease and death by rottenness of the fierce and cruel governor                          on the evening of the autumn day that had witnessed the martyrdom of two men of the quaker persuasion a puritan settler was returning from the metropolis to the neighboring country town in which he resided the air was cool the sky clear and the lingering twilight was made brighter by the rays of a young moon which had now nearly reached the verge of the horizon the traveller a man of middle age wrapped in a gray frieze cloak quickened his pace when he had reached the outskirts of the town for a gloomy extent of nearly four miles lay between him and his home the low strawthatched houses were scattered at considerable intervals along the road and the country having been settled but about thirty years the tracts of original forest still bore no small proportion to the cultivated ground the autumn wind wandered among the branches whirling away the leaves from all except the pinetrees and moaning as if it lamented the desolation of which it was the instrument the road had penetrated the mass of woods that lay nearest to the town and was just emerging into an open space when the travellers ears were saluted by a sound more mournful than even that of the wind it was like the wailing of someone in distress and it seemed to proceed from beneath a tall and lonely firtree in the centre of a cleared but uninclosed and uncultivated field the puritan could not but remember that this was the very spot which had been made accursed a few hours before by the execution of the quakers whose bodies had been thrown together into one hasty grave beneath the tree on which they suffered he struggled however against the superstitious fears which belonged to the age and compelled himself to pause and listen  the voice is most likely mortal nor have i cause to tremble if it be otherwise thought he straining his eyes through the dim moonlight methinks it is like the wailing of a child some infant it may be which has strayed from its mother and chanced upon this place of death for the ease of mine own conscience i must search this matter out  he therefore left the path and walked somewhat fearfully across the field though now so desolate its soil was pressed down and trampled by the thousand footsteps of those who had witnessed the spectacle of that day all of whom had now retired leaving the dead to their loneliness the traveller at length reached the firtree which from the middle upward was covered with living branches although a scaffold had been erected beneath and other preparations made for the work of death under this unhappy tree which in after times was believed to drop poison with its dew sat the one solitary mourner for innocent blood it was a slender and light clad little boy who leaned his face upon a hillock of freshturned and halffrozen earth and wailed bitterly yet in a suppressed tone as if his grief might receive the punishment of crime the puritan whose approach had been unperceived laid his hand upon the childs shoulder and addressed him compassionately  you have chosen a dreary lodging my poor boy and no wonder that you weep said he but dry your eyes and tell me where your mother dwells i promise you if the journey be not too far i will leave you in her arms tonight  the boy had hushed his wailing at once and turned his face upward to the stranger it was a pale brighteyed countenance certainly not more than six years old but sorrow fear and want had destroyed much of its infantile expression the puritan seeing the boys frightened gaze and feeling that he trembled under his hand endeavored to reassure him  nay if i intended to do you harm little lad the readiest way were to leave you here what you do not fear to sit beneath the gallows on a newmade grave and yet you tremble at a friends touch take heart child and tell me what is your name and where is your home  friend replied the little boy in a sweet though faltering voice they call me ilbrahim and my home is here  the pale spiritual face the eyes that seemed to mingle with the moonlight the sweet airy voice and the outlandish name almost made the puritan believe that the boy was in truth a being which had sprung up out of the grave on which he sat but perceiving that the apparition stood the test of a short mental prayer and remembering that the arm which he had touched was lifelike he adopted a more rational supposition the poor child is stricken in his intellect thought he but verily his words are fearful in a place like this he then spoke soothingly intending to humor the boys fantasy  your home will scarce be comfortable ilbrahim this cold autumn night and i fear you are illprovided with food i am hastening to a warm supper and bed and if you will go with me you shall share them  i thank thee friend but though i be hungry and shivering with cold thou wilt not give me food nor lodging replied the boy in the quiet tone which despair had taught him even so young my father was of the people whom all men hate they have laid him under this heap of earth and here is my home  the puritan who had laid hold of little ilbrahims hand relinquished it as if he were touching a loathsome reptile but he possessed a compassionate heart which not even religious prejudice could harden into stone  god forbid that i should leave this child to perish though he comes of the accursed sect said he to himself do we not all spring from an evil root are we not all in darkness till the light doth shine upon us he shall not perish neither in body nor if prayer and instruction may avail for him in soul he then spoke aloud and kindly to ilbrahim who had again hid his face in the cold earth of the grave was every door in the land shut against you my child that you have wandered to this unhallowed spot  they drove me forth from the prison when they took my father thence said the boy and i stood afar off watching the crowd of people and when they were gone i came hither and found only his grave i knew that my father was sleeping here and i said this shall be my home  no child no not while i have a roof over my head or a morsel to share with you exclaimed the puritan whose sympathies were now fully excited rise up and come with me and fear not any harm  the boy wept afresh and clung to the heap of earth as if the cold heart beneath it were warmer to him than any in a living breast the traveller however continued to entreat him tenderly and seeming to acquire some degree of confidence he at length arose but his slender limbs tottered with weakness his little head grew dizzy and he leaned against the tree of death for support  my poor boy are you so feeble said the puritan when did you taste food last  i ate of bread and water with my father in the prison replied ilbrahim but they brought him none neither yesterday nor today saying that he had eaten enough to bear him to his journeys end trouble not thyself for my hunger kind friend for i have lacked food many times ere now  the traveller took the child in his arms and wrapped his cloak about him while his heart stirred with shame and anger against the gratuitous cruelty of the instruments in this persecution in the awakened warmth of his feelings he resolved that at whatever risk he would not forsake the poor little defenceless being whom heaven had confided to his care with this determination he left the accursed field and resumed the homeward path from which the wailing of the boy had called him the light and motionless burden scarcely impeded his progress and he soon beheld the fire rays from the windows of the cottage which he a native of a distant clime had built in the western wilderness it was surrounded by a considerable extent of cultivated ground and the dwelling was situated in the nook of a woodcovered hill whither it seemed to have crept for protection  look up child said the puritan to ilbrahim whose faint head had sunk upon his shoulder there is our home  at the word home a thrill passed through the childs frame but he continued silent a few moments brought them to a cottage door at which the owner knocked for at that early period when savages were wandering everywhere among the settlers bolt and bar were indispensable to the security of a dwelling the summons was answered by a bondservant a coarseclad and dullfeatured piece of humanity who after ascertaining that his master was the applicant undid the door and held a flaring pineknot torch to light him in farther back in the passageway the red blaze discovered a matronly woman but no little crowd of children came bounding forth to greet their fathers return as the puritan entered he thrust aside his cloak and displayed ilbrahims face to the female  dorothy here is a little outcast whom providence hath put into our hands observed he be kind to him even as if he were of those dear ones who have departed from us  what pale and brighteyed little boy is this tobias she inquired is he one whom the wilderness folk have ravished from some christian mother  no dorothy this poor child is no captive from the wilderness he replied the heathen savage would have given him to eat of his scanty morsel and to drink of his birchen cup but christian men alas had cast him out to die  then he told her how he had found him beneath the gallows upon his fathers grave and how his heart had prompted him like the speaking of an inward voice to take the little outcast home and be kind unto him he acknowledged his resolution to feed and clothe him as if he were his own child and to afford him the instruction which should counteract the pernicious errors hitherto instilled into his infant mind dorothy was gifted with even a quicker tenderness than her husband and she approved of all his doings and intentions  have you a mother dear child she inquired  the tears burst forth from his full heart as he attempted to reply but dorothy at length understood that he had a mother who like the rest of her sect was a persecuted wanderer she had been taken from the prison a short time before carried into the uninhabited wilderness and left to perish there by hunger or wild beasts this was no uncommon method of disposing of the quakers and they were accustomed to boast that the inhabitants of the desert were more hospitable to them than civilized man  fear not little boy you shall not need a mother and a kind one said dorothy when she had gathered this information dry your tears ilbrahim and be my child as i will be your mother  the good woman prepared the little bed from which her own children had successively been borne to another restingplace before ilbrahim would consent to occupy it he knelt down and as dorothy listened to his simple and affecting prayer she marvelled how the parents that had taught it to him could have been judged worthy of death when the boy had fallen asleep she bent over his pale and spiritual countenance pressed a kiss upon his white brow drew the bedclothes up about his neck and went away with a pensive gladness in her heart  tobias pearson was not among the earliest emigrants from the old country he had remained in england during the first years of the civil war in which he had borne some share as a cornet of dragoons under cromwell but when the ambitious designs of his leader began to develop themselves he quitted the army of the parliament and sought a refuge from the strife which was no longer holy among the people of his persuasion in the colony of massachusetts a more worldly consideration had perhaps an influence in drawing him thither for new england offered advantages to men of unprosperous fortunes as well as to dissatisfied religionists and pearson had hitherto found it difficult to provide for a wife and increasing family to this supposed impurity of motive the more bigoted puritans were inclined to impute the removal by death of all the children for whose earthly good the father had been overthoughtful they had left their native country blooming like roses and like roses they had perished in a foreign soil those expounders of the ways of providence who had thus judged their brother and attributed his domestic sorrows to his sin were not more charitable when they saw him and dorothy endeavoring to fill up the void in their hearts by the adoption of an infant of the accursed sect nor did they fail to communicate their disapprobation to tobias but the latter in reply merely pointed at the little quiet lovely boy whose appearance and deportment were indeed as powerful arguments as could possibly have been adduced in his own favor even his beauty however and his winning manners sometimes produced an effect ultimately unfavorable for the bigots when the outer surfaces of their iron hearts had been softened and again grew hard affirmed that no merely natural cause could have so worked upon them  their antipathy to the poor infant was also increased by the ill success of divers theological discussions in which it was attempted to convince him of the errors of his sect ilbrahim it is true was not a skilful controversialist but the feeling of his religion was strong as instinct in him and he could neither be enticed nor driven from the faith which his father had died for the odium of this stubbornness was shared in a great measure by the childs protectors insomuch that tobias and dorothy very shortly began to experience a most bitter species of persecution in the cold regards of many a friend whom they had valued the common people manifested their opinions more openly pearson was a man of some consideration being a representative to the general court and an approved lieutenant in the trainbands yet within a week after his adoption of ilbrahim he had been both hissed and hooted once also when walking through a solitary piece of woods he heard a loud voice from some invisible speaker and it cried what shall be done to the backslider lo the scourge is knotted for him even the whip of nine cords and every cord three knots these insults irritated pearsons temper for the moment they entered also into his heart and became imperceptible but powerful workers towards an end which his most secret thought had not yet whispered                          on the second sabbath after ilbrahim became a member of their family pearson and his wife deemed it proper that he should appear with them at public worship they had anticipated some opposition to this measure from the boy but he prepared himself in silence and at the appointed hour was clad in the new mourning suit which dorothy had wrought for him as the parish was then and during many subsequent years unprovided with a bell the signal for the commencement of religious exercises was the beat of a drum at the first sound of that martial call to the place of holy and quiet thoughts tobias and dorothy set forth each holding a hand of little ilbrahim like two parents linked together by the infant of their love on their path through the leafless woods they were overtaken by many persons of their acquaintance all of whom avoided them and passed by on the other side but a severer trial awaited their constancy when they had descended the hill and drew near the pinebuilt and undecorated house of prayer around the door from which the drummer still sent forth his thundering summons was drawn up a formidable phalanx including several of the oldest members of the congregation many of the middle aged and nearly all the younger males pearson found it difficult to sustain their united and disapproving gaze but dorothy whose mind was differently circumstanced merely drew the boy closer to her and faltered not in her approach as they entered the door they overheard the muttered sentiments of the assemblage and when the reviling voices of the little children smote ilbrahims ear he wept  the interior aspect of the meetinghouse was rude the low ceiling the unplastered walls the naked wood work and the undraperied pulpit offered nothing to excite the devotion which without such external aids often remains latent in the heart the floor of the building was occupied by rows of long cushionless benches supplying the place of pews and the broad aisle formed a sexual division impassable except by children beneath a certain age  pearson and dorothy separated at the door of the meetinghouse and ilbrahim being within the years of infancy was retained under the care of the latter the wrinkled beldams involved themselves in their rusty cloaks as he passed by even the mildfeatured maidens seemed to dread contamination and many a stern old man arose and turned his repulsive and unheavenly countenance upon the gentle boy as if the sanctuary were polluted by his presence he was a sweet infant of the skies that had strayed away from his home and all the inhabitants of this miserable world closed up their impure hearts against him drew back their earthsoiled garments from his touch and said we are holier than thou  ilbrahim seated by the side of his adopted mother and retaining fast hold of her hand assumed a grave and decorous demeanor such as might befit a person of matured taste and understanding who should find him self in a temple dedicated to some worship which he did not recognize but felt himself bound to respect the exercises had not yet commenced however when the boys attention was arrested by an event apparently of trifling interest a woman having her face muffled in a hood and a cloak drawn completely about her form advanced slowly up the broad aisle and took a place upon the foremost bench ilbrahims faint color varied his nerves fluttered he was unable to turn his eyes from the muffled female  when the preliminary prayer and hymn were over the minister arose and having turned the hourglass which stood by the great bible commenced his discourse he was now well stricken in years a man of pale thin countenance and his gray hairs were closely covered by a black velvet skullcap in his younger days he had practically learned the meaning of persecution from archbishop laud and he was not now disposed to forget the lesson against which he had murmured then introducing the often discussed subject of the quakers he gave a history of that sect and a description of their tenets in which error predominated and prejudice distorted the aspect of what was true he adverted to the recent measures in the province and cautioned his hearers of weaker parts against calling in question the just severity which godfearing magistrates had at length been compelled to exercise he spoke of the danger of pity in some cases a commendable and christian virtue but inapplicable to this pernicious sect he observed that such was their devilish obstinacy in error that even the little children the sucking babes were hardened and desperate heretics he affirmed that no man without heavens especial warrants should attempt their conversion lest while he lent his hand to draw them from the slough he should himself be precipitated into its lowest depths  the sands of the second hour were principally in the lower half of the glass when the sermon concluded an approving murmur followed and the clergyman having given out a hymn took his seat with much selfcongratulation and endeavored to read the effect of his eloquence in the visages of the people but while voices from all parts of the house were tuning themselves to sing a scene occurred which though not very unusual at that period in the province happened to be without precedent in this parish  the muffled female who had hitherto sat motionless in the front rank of the audience now arose and with slow stately and unwavering step ascended the pulpit stairs the quiverings of incipient harmony were hushed and the divine sat in speechless and almost terrified astonishment while she undid the door and stood up in the sacred desk from which his maledictions had just been thundered she then divested herself of the cloak and hood and appeared in a most singular array a shapeless robe of sackcloth was girded about her waist with a knotted cord her raven hair fell down upon her shoulders and its blackness was defiled by pale streaks of ashes which she had strown upon her head her eyebrows dark and strongly defined added to the deathly whiteness of a countenance which emaciated with want and wild with enthusiasm and strange sorrows retained no trace of earlier beauty this figure stood gazing earnestly on the audience and there was no sound nor any movement except a faint shuddering which every man observed in his neighbor but was scarcely conscious of in himself at length when her fit of inspiration came she spoke for the first few moments in a low voice and not invariably distinct utterance her discourse gave evidence of an imagination hopelessly entangled with her reason it was a vague and incomprehensible rhapsody which however seemed to spread its own atmosphere round the hearers soul and to move his feelings by some influence unconnected with the words as she proceeded beautiful but shadowy images would sometimes be seen like bright things moving in a turbid river or a strong and singularlyshaped idea leaped forth and seized at once on the understanding or the heart but the course of her unearthly eloquence soon led her to the persecutions of her sect and from thence the step was short to her own peculiar sorrows she was naturally a woman of mighty passions and hatred and revenge now wrapped themselves in the garb of piety the character of her speech was changed her images became distinct though wild and her denunciations had an almost hellish bitterness  the governor and his mighty men she said have gathered together taking counsel among themselves and saying what shall we do unto this people even unto the people that have come into this land to put our iniquity to the blush and lo the devil entereth into the council chamber like a lame man of low stature and gravely apparelled with a dark and twisted countenance and a bright downcast eye and he standeth up among the rulers yea he goeth to and fro whispering to each and every man lends his ear for his word is slay slay but i say unto ye woe to them that slay woe to them that shed the blood of saints woe to them that have slain the husband and cast forth the child the tender infant to wander homeless and hungry and cold till he die and have saved the mother alive in the cruelty of their tender mercies woe to them in their lifetime cursed are they in the delight and pleasure of their hearts woe to them in their death hour whether it come swiftly with blood and violence or after long and lingering pain woe in the dark house in the rottenness of the grave when the childrens children shall revile the ashes of the fathers woe woe woe at the judgment when all the persecuted and all the slain in this bloody land and the father the mother and the child shall await them in a day that they cannot escape seed of the faith seed of the faith ye whose hearts are moving with a power that ye know not arise wash your hands of this innocent blood lift your voices chosen ones cry aloud and call down a woe and a judgment with me  having thus given vent to the flood of malignity which she mistook for inspiration the speaker was silent her voice was succeeded by the hysteric shrieks of several women but the feelings of the audience generally had not been drawn onward in the current with her own they remained stupefied stranded as it were in the midst of a torrent which deafened them by its roaring but might not move them by its violence the clergyman who could not hitherto have ejected the usurper of his pulpit otherwise than by bodily force now addressed her in the tone of just indignation and legitimate authority  get you down woman from the holy place which you profane he said is it to the lords house that you come to pour forth the foulness of your heart and the inspiration of the devil get you down and remember that the sentence of death is on you yea and shall be executed were it but for this days work  i go friend i go for the voice hath had its utterance replied she in a depressed and even mild tone i have done my mission unto thee and to thy people reward me with stripes imprisonment or death as ye shall be permitted  the weakness of exhausted passion caused her steps to totter as she descended the pulpit stairs the people in the mean while were stirring to and fro on the floor of the house whispering among themselves and glancing towards the intruder many of them now recognized her as the woman who had assaulted the governor with frightful language as he passed by the window of her prison they knew also that she was adjudged to suffer death and had been preserved only by an involuntary banishment into the wilderness the new outrage by which she had provoked her fate seemed to render further lenity impossible and a gentleman in military dress with a stout man of inferior rank drew towards the door of the meetinghouse and awaited her approach  scarcely did her feet press the floor however when an unexpected scene occurred in that moment of her peril when every eye frowned with death a little timid boy pressed forth and threw his arms round his mother  i am here mother it is i and i will go with thee to prison he exclaimed  she gazed at him with a doubtful and almost frightened expression for she knew that the boy had been cast out to perish and she had not hoped to see his face again she feared perhaps that it was but one of the happy visions with which her excited fancy had often deceived her in the solitude of the desert or in prison but when she felt his hand warm within her own and heard his little eloquence of childish love she began to know that she was yet a mother  blessed art thou my son she sobbed my heart was withered yea dead with thee and with thy father and now it leaps as in the first moment when i pressed thee to my bosom  she knelt down and embraced him again and again while the joy that could find no words expressed itself in broken accents like the bubbles gushing up to vanish at the surface of a deep fountain the sorrows of past years and the darker peril that was nigh cast not a shadow on the brightness of that fleeting moment soon however the spectators saw a change upon her face as the consciousness of her sad estate returned and grief supplied the fount of tears which joy had opened by the words she uttered it would seem that the indulgence of natural love had given her mind a momentary sense of its errors and made her know how far she had strayed from duty in following the dictates of a wild fanaticism  in a doleful hour art thou returned to me poor boy she said for thy mothers path has gone darkening onward till now the end is death son son i have borne thee in my arms when my limbs were tottering and i have fed thee with the food that i was fainting for yet i have ill performed a mothers part by thee in life and now i leave thee no inheritance but woe and shame thou wilt go seeking through the world and find all hearts closed against thee and their sweet affections turned to bitterness for my sake my child my child how many a pang awaits thy gentle spirit and i the cause of all  she hid her face on ilbrahims head and her long raven hair discolored with the ashes of her mourning fell down about him like a veil a low and interrupted moan was the voice of her hearts anguish and it did not fail to move the sympathies of many who mistook their involuntary virtue for a sin sobs were audible in the female section of the house and every man who was a father drew his hand across his eyes tobias pearson was agitated and uneasy but a certain feeling like the consciousness of guilt oppressed him so that he could not go forth and offer himself as the protector of the child dorothy however had watched her husbands eye her mind was free from the influence that had begun to work on his and she drew near the quaker woman and addressed her in the hearing of all the congregation  stranger trust this boy to me and i will be his mother she said taking ilbrahims hand providence has signally marked out my husband to protect him and he has fed at our table and lodged under our roof now many days till our hearts have grown very strongly unto him leave the tender child with us and be at ease concerning his welfare  the quaker rose from the ground but drew the boy closer to her while she gazed earnestly in dorothys face her mild but saddened features and neat matronly attire harmonized together and were like a verse of fireside poetry her very aspect proved that she was blameless so far as mortal could be so in respect to god and man while the enthusiast in her robe of sackcloth and girdle of knotted cord had as evidently violated the duties of the present life and the future by fixing her attention wholly on the latter the two females as they held each a hand of ilbrahim formed a practical allegory it was rational piety and unbridled fanaticism contending for the empire of a young heart  thou art not of our people said the quaker mournfully  no we are not of your people replied dorothy with mildness but we are christians looking upward to the same heaven with you doubt not that your boy shall meet you there if there be a blessing on our tender and prayerful guidance of him thither i trust my own children have gone before me for i also have been a mother i am no longer so she added in a faltering tone and your son will have all my care  but will ye lead him in the path which his parents have trodden demanded the quaker can ye teach him the enlightened faith which his father has died for and for which i even i am soon to become an unworthy martyr the boy has been baptized in blood will ye keep the mark fresh and ruddy upon his forehead  i will not deceive you answered dorothy if your child become our child we must breed him up in the instruction which heaven has imparted to us we must pray for him the prayers of our own faith we must do towards him according to the dictates of our own consciences and not of yours were we to act otherwise we should abuse your trust even in complying with your wishes  the mother looked down upon her boy with a troubled countenance and then turned her eyes upward to heaven she seemed to pray internally and the contention of her soul was evident  friend she said at length to dorothy i doubt not that my son shall receive all earthly tenderness at thy hands nay i will believe that even thy imperfect lights may guide him to a better world for surely thou art on the path thither but thou hast spoken of a husband doth he stand here among this multitude of people let him come forth for i must know to whom i commit this most precious trust  she turned her face upon the male auditors and after a momentary delay tobias pearson came forth from among them the quaker saw the dress which marked his military rank and shook her head but then she noted the hesitating air the eyes that struggled with her own and were vanquished the color that went and came and could find no resting place as she gazed an unmirthful smile spread over her features like sunshine that grows melancholy in some desolate spot her lips moved inaudibly but at length she spake  i hear it i hear it the voice speaketh within me and saith leave thy child catharine for his place is here and go hence for i have other work for thee break the bonds of natural affection martyr thy love and know that in all these things eternal wisdom hath its ends i go friends i go take ye my boy my precious jewel i go hence trusting that all shall be well and that even for his infant hands there is a labor in the vineyard  she knelt down and whispered to ilbrahim who at first struggled and clung to his mother with sobs and tears but remained passive when she had kissed his cheek and arisen from the ground having held her hands over his head in mental prayer she was ready to depart  farewell friends in mine extremity she said to pearson and his wife the good deed ye have done me is a treasure laid up in heaven to be returned a thousandfold hereafter and farewell ye mine enemies to whom it is not permitted to harm so much as a hair of my head nor to stay my footsteps even for a moment the day is coming when ye shall call upon me to witness for ye to this one sin uncommitted and i will rise up and answer  she turned her steps towards the door and the men who had stationed themselves to guard it withdrew and suffered her to pass a general sentiment of pity overcame the virulence of religious hatred sanctified by her love and her affliction she went forth and all the people gazed after her till she had journeyed up the hill and was lost behind its brow she went the apostle of her own unquiet heart to renew the wanderings of past years for her voice had been already heard in many lands of christendom and she had pined in the cells of a catholic inquisition before she felt the lash and lay in the dungeons of the puritans her mission had extended also to the followers of the prophet and from them she had received the courtesy and kindness which all the contending sects of our purer religion united to deny her her husband and herself had resided many months in turkey where even the sultans countenance was gracious to them in that pagan land too was ilbrahims birthplace and his oriental name was a mark of gratitude for the good deeds of an unbeliever                          when pearson and his wife had thus acquired all the rights over ilbrahim that could be delegated their affection for him became like the memory of their native land or their mild sorrow for the dead a piece of the immovable furniture of their hearts the boy also after a week or two of mental disquiet began to gratify his protectors by many inadvertent proofs that he considered them as parents and their house as home before the winter snows were melted the persecuted infant the little wanderer from a remote and heathen country seemed native in the new england cottage and inseparable from the warmth and security of its hearth under the influence of kind treatment and in the consciousness that he was loved ilbrahims demeanor lost a premature manliness which had resulted from his earlier situation he became more childlike and his natural character displayed itself with freedom it was in many respects a beautiful one yet the disordered imaginations of both his father and mother had perhaps propagated a certain unhealthiness in the mind of the boy in his general state ilbrahim would derive enjoyment from the most trifling events and from every object about him he seemed to discover rich treasures of happiness by a faculty analogous to that of the witch hazel which points to hidden gold where all is barren to the eye his airy gayety coming to him from a thousand sources communicated itself to the family and ilbrahim was like a domesticated sunbeam brightening moody countenances and chasing away the gloom from the dark corners of the cottage  on the other hand as the susceptibility of pleasure is also that of pain the exuberant cheerfulness of the boys prevailing temper sometimes yielded to moments of deep depression his sorrows could not always be followed up to their original source but most frequently they appeared to flow though ilbrahim was young to be sad for such a cause from wounded love the flightiness of his mirth rendered him often guilty of offences against the decorum of a puritan household and on these occasions he did not invariably escape rebuke but the slightest word of real bitterness which he was infallible in distinguishing from pretended anger seemed to sink into his heart and poison all his enjoyments till he became sensible that he was entirely forgiven of the malice which generally accompanies a superfluity of sensitiveness ilbrahim was altogether destitute when trodden upon he would not turn when wounded he could but die his mind was wanting in the stamina for selfsupport it was a plant that would twine beautifully round something stronger than itself but if repulsed or torn away it had no choice but to wither on the ground dorothys acuteness taught her that severity would crush the spirit of the child and she nurtured him with the gentle care of one who handles a butterfly her husband manifested an equal affection although it grew daily less productive of familiar caresses  the feelings of the neighboring people in regard to the quaker infant and his protectors had not undergone a favorable change in spite of the momentary triumph which the desolate mother had obtained over their sympathies the scorn and bitterness of which he was the object were very grievous to ilbrahim especially when any circumstance made him sensible that the children his equals in age partook of the enmity of their parents his tender and social nature had already overflowed in attachments to everything about him and still there was a residue of unappropriated love which he yearned to bestow upon the little ones who were taught to hate him as the warm days of spring came on ilbrahim was accustomed to remain for hours silent and inactive within hearing of the childrens voices at their play yet with his usual delicacy of feeling he avoided their notice and would flee and hide himself from the smallest individual among them chance however at length seemed to open a medium of communication between his heart and theirs it was by means of a boy about two years older than ilbrahim who was injured by a fall from a tree in the vicinity of pearsons habitation as the sufferers own home was at some distance dorothy willingly received him under her roof and became his tender and careful nurse  ilbrahim was the unconscious possessor of much skill in physiognomy and it would have deterred him in other circumstances from attempting to make a friend of this boy the countenance of the latter immediately impressed a beholder disagreeably but it required some examination to discover that the cause was a very slight distortion of the mouth and the irregular broken line and near approach of the eyebrows analogous perhaps to these trifling deformities was an almost imperceptible twist of every joint and the uneven prominence of the breast forming a body regular in its general outline but faulty in almost all its details the disposition of the boy was sullen and reserved and the village schoolmaster stigmatized him as obtuse in intellect although at a later period of life he evinced ambition and very peculiar talents but whatever might be his personal or moral irregularities ilbrahims heart seized upon and clung to him from the moment that he was brought wounded into the cottage the child of persecution seemed to compare his own fate with that of the sufferer and to feel that even different modes of misfortune had created a sort of relationship between them food rest and the fresh air for which he languished were neglected he nestled continually by the bedside of the little stranger and with a fond jealousy endeavored to be the medium of all the cares that were bestowed upon him as the boy became convalescent ilbrahim contrived games suitable to his situation or amused him by a faculty which he had perhaps breathed in with the air of his barbaric birthplace it was that of reciting imaginary adventures on the spur of the moment and apparently in inexhaustible succession his tales were of course monstrous disjointed and without aim but they were curious on account of a vein of human tenderness which ran through them all and was like a sweet familiar face encountered in the midst of wild and unearthly scenery the auditor paid much attention to these romances and sometimes interrupted them by brief remarks upon the incidents displaying shrewdness above his years mingled with a moral obliquity which grated very harshly against ilbrahims instinctive rectitude nothing however could arrest the progress of the latters affection and there were many proofs that it met with a response from the dark and stubborn nature on which it was lavished the boys parents at length removed him to complete his cure under their own roof  ilbrahim did not visit his new friend after his departure but he made anxious and continual inquiries respecting him and informed himself of the day when he was to reappear among his playmates on a pleasant summer afternoon the children of the neighborhood had assembled in the little forestcrowned amphitheatre behind the meetinghouse and the recovering invalid was there leaning on a staff the glee of a score of untainted bosoms was heard in light and airy voices which danced among the trees like sunshine become audible the grown men of this weary world as they journeyed by the spot marvelled why life beginning in such brightness should proceed in gloom and their hearts or their imaginations answered them and said that the bliss of childhood gushes from its innocence but it happened that an unexpected addition was made to the heavenly little band it was ilbrahim who came towards the children with a look of sweet confidence on his fair and spiritual face as if having manifested his love to one of them he had no longer to fear a repulse from their society a hush came over their mirth the moment they beheld him and they stood whispering to each other while he drew nigh but all at once the devil of their fathers entered into the unbreeched fanatics and sending up a fierce shrill cry they rushed upon the poor quaker child in an instant he was the centre of a brood of babyfiends who lifted sticks against him pelted him with stones and displayed an instinct of destruction far more loathsome than the bloodthirstiness of manhood  the invalid in the meanwhile stood apart from the tumult crying out with a loud voice fear not ilbrahim come hither and take my hand and his unhappy friend endeavored to obey him after watching the victims struggling approach with a calm smile and unabashed eye the foulhearted little villain lifted his staff and struck ilbrahim on the mouth so forcibly that the blood issued in a stream the poor childs arms had been raised to guard his head from the storm of blows but now he dropped them at once his persecutors beat him down trampled upon him dragged him by his long fair locks and ilbrahim was on the point of becoming as veritable a martyr as ever entered bleeding into heaven the uproar however attracted the notice of a few neighbors who put themselves to the trouble of rescuing the little heretic and of conveying him to pearsons door  ilbrahims bodily harm was severe but long and careful nursing accomplished his recovery the injury done to his sensitive spirit was more serious though not so visible its signs were principally of a negative character and to be discovered only by those who had previously known him his gait was thenceforth slow even and unvaried by the sudden bursts of sprightlier motion which had once corresponded to his overflowing gladness his countenance was heavier and its former play of expression the dance of sunshine reflected from moving water was destroyed by the cloud over his existence his notice was attracted in a far less degree by passing events and he appeared to find greater difficulty in comprehending what was new to him than at a happier period a stranger founding his judgment upon these circumstances would have said that the dulness of the childs intellect widely contradicted the promise of his features but the secret was in the direction of ilbrahims thoughts which were brooding within him when they should naturally have been wandering abroad an attempt of dorothy to revive his former sportiveness was the single occasion on which his quiet demeanor yielded to a violent display of grief he burst into passionate weeping and ran and hid himself for his heart had become so miserably sore that even the hand of kindness tortured it like fire sometimes at night and probably in his dreams he was heard to cry mother mother as if her place which a stranger had supplied while ilbrahim was happy admitted of no substitute in his extreme affliction perhaps among the many lifeweary wretches then upon the earth there was not one who combined innocence and misery like this poor brokenhearted infant so soon the victim of his own heavenly nature  while this melancholy change had taken place in ilbrahim one of an earlier origin and of different character had come to its perfection in his adopted father the incident with which this tale commences found pearson in a state of religious dulness yet mentally disquieted and longing for a more fervid faith than he possessed the first effect of his kindness to ilbrahim was to produce a softened feeling and incipient love for the childs whole sect but joined to this and resulting perhaps from selfsuspicion was a proud and ostentatious contempt of all their tenets and practical extravagances in the course of much thought however for the subject struggled irresistibly into his mind the foolishness of the doctrine began to be less evident and the points which had particularly offended his reason assumed another aspect or vanished entirely away the work within him appeared to go on even while he slept and that which had been a doubt when he lay down to rest would often hold the place of a truth confirmed by some forgotten demonstration when he recalled his thoughts in the morning but while he was thus becoming assimilated to the enthusiasts his contempt in nowise decreasing towards them grew very fierce against himself he imagined also that every face of his acquaintance wore a sneer and that every word addressed to him was a gibe such was his state of mind at the period of ilbrahims misfortune and the emotions consequent upon that event completed the change of which the child had been the original instrument  in the mean time neither the fierceness of the persecutors nor the infatuation of their victims had decreased the dungeons were never empty the streets of almost every village echoed daily with the lash the life of a woman whose mild and christian spirit no cruelty could embitter had been sacrificed and more innocent blood was yet to pollute the hands that were so often raised in prayer early after the restoration the english quakers represented to charles ii that a vein of blood was open in his dominions but though the displeasure of the voluptuous king was roused his interference was not prompt and now the tale must stride forward over many months leaving pearson to encounter ignominy and misfortune his wife to a firm endurance of a thousand sorrows poor ilbrahim to pine and droop like a cankered rosebud his mother to wander on a mistaken errand neglectful of the holiest trust which can be committed to a woman                          a winter evening a night of storm had darkened over pearsons habitation and there were no cheerful faces to drive the gloom from his broad hearth the fire it is true sent forth a glowing heat and a ruddy light and large logs dripping with halfmelted snow lay ready to be cast upon the embers but the apartment was saddened in its aspect by the absence of much of the homely wealth which had once adorned it for the exaction of repeated fines and his own neglect of temporal affairs had greatly impoverished the owner and with the furniture of peace the implements of war had likewise disappeared the sword was broken the helm and cuirass were cast away forever the soldier had done with battles and might not lift so much as his naked hand to guard his head but the holy book remained and the table on which it rested was drawn before the fire while two of the persecuted sect sought comfort from its pages  he who listened while the other read was the master of the house now emaciated in form and altered as to the expression and healthiness of his countenance for his mind had dwelt too long among visionary thoughts and his body had been worn by imprisonment and stripes the hale and weatherbeaten old man who sat beside him had sustained less injury from a far longer course of the same mode of life in person he was tall and dignified and which alone would have made him hateful to the puritans his gray locks fell from beneath the broadbrimmed hat and rested on his shoulders as the old man read the sacred page the snow drifted against the windows or eddied in at the crevices of the door while a blast kept laughing in the chimney and the blaze leaped fiercely up to seek it and sometimes when the wind struck the hill at a certain angle and swept down by the cottage across the wintry plain its voice was the most doleful that can be conceived it came as if the past were speaking as if the dead had contributed each a whisper as if the desolation of ages were breathed in that one lamenting sound  the quaker at length closed the book retaining however his hand between the pages which he had been reading while he looked steadfastly at pearson the attitude and features of the latter might have indicated the endurance of bodily pain he leaned his forehead on his hands his teeth were firmly closed and his frame was tremulous at intervals with a nervous agitation  friend tobias inquired the old man compassionately hast thou found no comfort in these many blessed passages of scripture  thy voice has fallen on my ear like a sound afar off and indistinct replied pearson without lifting his eyes yea and when i have hearkened carefully the words seemed cold and lifeless and intended for another and a lesser grief than mine remove the book he added in a tone of sullen bitterness i have no part in its consolations and they do but fret my sorrow the more  nay feeble brother be not as one who hath never known the light said the elder quaker earnestly but with mildness art thou he that wouldst be content to give all and endure all for conscience sake desiring even peculiar trials that thy faith might be purified and thy heart weaned from worldly desires and wilt thou sink beneath an affliction which happens alike to them that have their portion here below and to them that lay up treasure in heaven faint not for thy burden is yet light  it is heavy it is heavier than i can bear exclaimed pearson with the impatience of a variable spirit from my youth upward i have been a man marked out for wrath and year by year yea day after day i have endured sorrows such as others know not in their lifetime and now i speak not of the love that has been turned to hatred the honor to ignominy the ease and plentifulness of all things to danger want and nakedness all this i could have borne and counted myself blessed but when my heart was desolate with many losses i fixed it upon the child of a stranger and he became dearer to me than all my buried ones and now he too must die as if my love were poison verily i am an accursed man and i will lay me down in the dust and lift up my head no more  thou sinnest brother but it is not for me to rebuke thee for i also have had my hours of darkness wherein i have murmured against the cross said the old quaker he continued perhaps in the hope of distracting his companions thoughts from his own sorrows even of late was the light obscured within me when the men of blood had banished me on pain of death and the constables led me onward from village to village towards the wilderness a strong and cruel hand was wielding the knotted cords they sunk deep into the flesh and thou mightst have tracked every reel and totter of my footsteps by the blood that followed as we went on  have i not borne all this and have i murmured interrupted pearson impatiently  nay friend but hear me continued the other as we journeyed on night darkened on our path so that no man could see the rage of the persecutors or the constancy of my endurance though heaven forbid that i should glory therein the lights began to glimmer in the cottage windows and i could discern the inmates as they gathered in comfort and security every man with his wife and children by their own evening hearth at length we came to a tract of fertile land in the dim light the forest was not visible around it and behold there was a strawthatched dwelling which bore the very aspect of my home far over the wild ocean far in our own england then came bitter thoughts upon me yea remembrances that were like death to my soul the happiness of my early days was painted to me the disquiet of my manhood the altered faith of my declining years i remembered how i had been moved to go forth a wanderer when my daughter the youngest the dearest of my flock lay on her dying bed and  couldst thou obey the command at such a moment exclaimed pearson shuddering  yea yea replied the old man hurriedly i was kneeling by her bedside when the voice spoke loud within me but immediately i rose and took my staff and gat me gone oh that it were permitted me to forget her woful look when i thus withdrew my arm and left her journeying through the dark valley alone for her soul was faint and she had leaned upon my prayers now in that night of horror i was assailed by the thought that i had been an erring christian and a cruel parent yea even my daughter with her pale dying features seemed to stand by me and whisper father you are deceived go home and shelter your gray head o thou to whom i have looked in my farthest wanderings continued the quaker raising his agitated eyes to heaven inflict not upon the bloodiest of our persecutors the unmitigated agony of my soul when i believed that all i had done and suffered for thee was at the instigation of a mocking fiend but i yielded not i knelt down and wrestled with the tempter while the scourge bit more fiercely into the flesh my prayer was heard and i went on in peace and joy towards the wilderness  the old man though his fanaticism had generally all the calmness of reason was deeply moved while reciting this tale and his unwonted emotion seemed to rebuke and keep down that of his companion they sat in silence with their faces to the fire imagining perhaps in its red embers new scenes of persecution yet to be encountered the snow still drifted hard against the windows and sometimes as the blaze of the logs had gradually sunk came down the spacious chimney and hissed upon the hearth a cautious footstep might now and then be heard in a neighboring apartment and the sound invariably drew the eyes of both quakers to the door which led thither when a fierce and riotous gust of wind had led his thoughts by a natural association to homeless travellers on such a night pearson resumed the conversation  i have wellnigh sunk under my own share of this trial observed he sighing heavily yet i would that it might be doubled to me if so the childs mother could be spared her wounds have been deep and many but this will be the sorest of all  fear not for catharine replied the old quaker for i know that valiant woman and have seen how she can bear the cross a mothers heart indeed is strong in her and may seem to contend mightily with her faith but soon she will stand up and give thanks that her son has been thus early an accepted sacrifice the boy hath done his work and she will feel that he is taken hence in kindness both to him and her blessed blessed are they that with so little suffering can enter into peace  the fitful rush of the wind was now disturbed by a portentous sound it was a quick and heavy knocking at the outer door pearsons wan countenance grew paler for many a visit of persecution had taught him what to dread the old man on the other hand stood up erect and his glance was firm as that of the tried soldier who awaits his enemy  the men of blood have come to seek me he observed with calmness they have heard how i was moved to return from banishment and now am i to be led to prison and thence to death it is an end i have long looked for i will open unto them lest they say lo he feareth   nay i will present myself before them said pearson with recovered fortitude it may be that they seek me alone and know not that thou abidest with me  let us go boldly both one and the other rejoined his companion it is not fitting that thou or i should shrink  they therefore proceeded through the entry to the door which they opened bidding the applicant come in in gods name a furious blast of wind drove the storm into their faces and extinguished the lamp they had barely time to discern a figure so white from head to foot with the drifted snow that it seemed like winters self come in human shape to seek refuge from its own desolation  enter friend and do thy errand be it what it may said pearson it must needs be pressing since thou comest on such a bitter night  peace be with this household said the stranger when they stood on the floor of the inner apartment  pearson started the elder quaker stirred the slumbering embers of the fire till they sent up a clear and lofty blaze it was a female voice that had spoken it was a female form that shone out cold and wintry in that comfortable light  catharine blessed woman exclaimed the old man art thou come to this darkened land again art thou come to bear a valiant testimony as in former years the scourge hath not prevailed against thee and from the dungeon hast thou come forth triumphant but strengthen strengthen now thy heart catharine for heaven will prove thee yet this once ere thou go to thy reward  rejoice friends she replied thou who hast long been of our people and thou whom a little child hath led to us rejoice lo i come the messenger of glad tidings for the day of persecution is overpast the heart of the king even charles hath been moved in gentleness towards us and he hath sent forth his letters to stay the hands of the men of blood a ships company of our friends hath arrived at yonder town and i also sailed joyfully among them  as catharine spoke her eyes were roaming about the room in search of him for whose sake security was dear to her pearson made a silent appeal to the old man nor did the latter shrink from the painful task assigned him  sister he began in a softened yet perfectly calm tone thou tellest us of his love manifested in temporal good and now must we speak to thee of that selfsame love displayed in chastenings hitherto catharine thou hast been as one journeying in a darksome and difficult path and leading an infant by the hand fain wouldst thou have looked heavenward continually but still the cares of that little child have drawn thine eyes and thy affections to the earth sister go on rejoicing for his tottering footsteps shall impede thine own no more  but the unhappy mother was not thus to be consoled she shook like a leaf she turned white as the very snow that hung drifted into her hair the firm old man extended his hand and held her up keeping his eye upon hers as if to repress any outbreak of passion  i am a woman i am but a woman will he try me above my strength said catharine very quickly and almost in a whisper i have been wounded sore i have suffered much many things in the body many in the mind crucified in myself and in them that were dearest to me surely added she with a long shudder he hath spared me in this one thing she broke forth with sudden and irrepressible violence tell me man of cold heart what has god done to me hath he cast me down never to rise again hath he crushed my very heart in his hand and thou to whom i committed my child how hast thou fulfilled thy trust give me back the boy well sound alive alive or earth and heaven shall avenge me  the agonized shriek of catharine was answered by the faint the very faint voice of a child  on this day it had become evident to pearson to his aged guest and to dorothy that ilbrahims brief and troubled pilgrimage drew near its close the two former would willingly have remained by him to make use of the prayers and pious discourses which they deemed appropriate to the time and which if they be impotent as to the departing travellers reception in the world whither he goes may at least sustain him in bidding adieu to earth but though ilbrahim uttered no complaint he was disturbed by the faces that looked upon him so that dorothys entreaties and their own conviction that the childs feet might tread heavens pavement and not soil it had induced the two quakers to remove ilbrahim then closed his eyes and grew calm and except for now and then a kind and low word to his nurse might have been thought to slumber as nightfall came on however and the storm began to rise something seemed to trouble the repose of the boys mind and to render his sense of hearing active and acute if a passing wind lingered to shake the casement he strove to turn his head towards it if the door jarred to and fro upon its hinges he looked long and anxiously thitherward if the heavy voice of the old man as he read the scriptures rose but a little higher the child almost held his dying breath to listen if a snowdrift swept by the cottage with a sound like the trailing of a garment ilbrahim seemed to watch that some visitant should enter  but after a little time he relinquished whatever secret hope had agitated him and with one low complaining whisper turned his cheek upon the pillow he then addressed dorothy with his usual sweetness and besought her to draw near him she did so and ilbrahim took her hand in both of his grasping it with a gentle pressure as if to assure himself that he retained it at intervals and without disturbing the repose of his countenance a very faint trembling passed over him from head to foot as if a mild but somewhat cool wind had breathed upon him and made him shiver as the boy thus led her by the hand in his quiet progress over the borders of eternity dorothy almost imagined that she could discern the near though dim delightfulness of the home he was about to reach she would not have enticed the little wanderer back though she bemoaned herself that she must leave him and return but just when ilbrahims feet were pressing on the soil of paradise he heard a voice behind him and it recalled him a few few paces of the weary path which he had travelled as dorothy looked upon his features she perceived that their placid expression was again disturbed her own thoughts had been so wrapped in him that all sounds of the storm and of human speech were lost to her but when catharines shriek pierced through the room the boy strove to raise himself  friend she is come open unto her cried he  in a moment his mother was kneeling by the bedside she drew ilbrahim to her bosom and he nestled there with no violence of joy but contentedly as if he were hushing himself to sleep he looked into her face and reading its agony said with feeble earnestness mourn not dearest mother i am happy now and with these words the gentle boy was dead                          the kings mandate to stay the new england persecutors was effectual in preventing further martyrdoms but the colonial authorities trusting in the remoteness of their situation and perhaps in the supposed instability of the royal government shortly renewed their severities in all other respects catharines fanaticism had become wilder by the sundering of all human ties and wherever a scourge was lifted there was she to receive the blow and whenever a dungeon was unbarred thither she came to cast herself upon the floor but in process of time a more christian spirit a spirit of forbearance though not of cordiality or approbationbegan to pervade the land in regard to the persecuted sect and then when the rigid old pilgrims eyed her rather in pity than in wrath when the matrons fed her with the fragments of their childrens food and offered her a lodging on a hard and lowly bed when no little crowd of schoolboys left their sports to cast stones after the roving enthusiast then did catharine return to pearsons dwelling and made that her home  as if ilbrahims sweetness yet lingered round his ashes as if his gentle spirit came down from heaven to teach his parent a true religion her fierce and vindictive nature was softened by the same griefs which had once irritated it when the course of years had made the features of the unobtrusive mourner familiar in the settlement she became a subject of not deep but general interest a being on whom the otherwise superfluous sympathies of all might be bestowed every one spoke of her with that degree of pity which it is pleasant to experience every one was ready to do her the little kindnesses which are not costly yet manifest good will and when at last she died a long train of her once bitter persecutors followed her with decent sadness and tears that were not painful to her place by ilbrahims green and sunken grave    mr higginbothams catastrophe  a young fellow a tobacco pedlar by trade was on his way from morristown where he had dealt largely with the deacon of the shaker settlement to the village of parkers falls on salmon river he had a neat little cart painted green with a box of cigars depicted on each side panel and an indian chief holding a pipe and a golden tobacco stalk on the rear the pedlar drove a smart little mare and was a young man of excellent character keen at a bargain but none the worse liked by the yankees who as i have heard them say would rather be shaved with a sharp razor than a dull one especially was he beloved by the pretty girls along the connecticut whose favor he used to court by presents of the best smoking tobacco in his stock knowing well that the country lasses of new england are generally great performers on pipes moreover as will be seen in the course of my story the pedlar was inquisitive and something of a tattler always itching to hear the news and anxious to tell it again  after an early breakfast at morristown the tobacco pedlar whose name was dominicus pike had travelled seven miles through a solitary piece of woods without speaking a word to anybody but himself and his little gray mare it being nearly seven oclock he was as eager to hold a morning gossip as a city shopkeeper to read the morning paper an opportunity seemed at hand when after lighting a cigar with a sunglass he looked up and perceived a man coming over the brow of the hill at the foot of which the pedlar had stopped his green cart dominicus watched him as he descended and noticed that he carried a bundle over his shoulder on the end of a stick and travelled with a weary yet determined pace he did not look as if he had started in the freshness of the morning but had footed it all night and meant to do the same all day  good morning mister said dominicus when within speaking distance you go a pretty good jog whats the latest news at parkers falls  the man pulled the broad brim of a gray hat over his eyes and answered rather sullenly that he did not come from parkers falls which as being the limit of his own days journey the pedlar had naturally mentioned in his inquiry  well then rejoined dominicus pike lets have the latest news where you did come from im not particular about parkers falls any place will answer  being thus importuned the travellerwho was as ill looking a fellow as one would desire to meet in a solitary piece of woodsappeared to hesitate a little as if he was either searching his memory for news or weighing the expediency of telling it at last mounting on the step of the cart he whispered in the ear of dominicus though he might have shouted aloud and no other mortal would have heard him  i do remember one little trifle of news said he old mr higginbotham of kimballton was murdered in his orchard at eight oclock last night by an irishman and a nigger they strung him up to the branch of a st michaels peartree where nobody would find him till the morning  as soon as this horrible intelligence was communicated the stranger betook himself to his journey again with more speed than ever not even turning his head when dominicus invited him to smoke a spanish cigar and relate all the particulars the pedlar whistled to his mare and went up the hill pondering on the doleful fate of mr higginbotham whom he had known in the way of trade having sold him many a bunch of long nines and a great deal of pigtail ladys twist and fig tobacco he was rather astonished at the rapidity with which the news had spread kimballton was nearly sixty miles distant in a straight line the murder had been perpetrated only at eight oclock the preceding night yet dominicus had heard of it at seven in the morning when in all probability poor mr higginbothams own family had but just discovered his corpse hanging on the st michaels peartree the stranger on foot must have worn sevenleague boots to travel at such a rate  ill news flies fast they say thought dominicus pike but this beats railroads the fellow ought to be hired to go express with the presidents message  the difficulty was solved by supposing that the narrator had made a mistake of one day in the date of the occurrence so that our friend did not hesitate to introduce the story at every tavern and country store along the road expending a whole bunch of spanish wrappers among at least twenty horrified audiences he found himself invariably the first bearer of the intelligence and was so pestered with questions that he could not avoid filling up the outline till it became quite a respectable narrative he met with one piece of corroborative evidence mr higginbotham was a trader and a former clerk of his to whom dominicus related the facts testified that the old gentleman was accustomed to return home through the orchard about nightfall with the money and valuable papers of the store in his pocket the clerk manifested but little grief at mr higginbothams catastrophe hinting what the pedlar had discovered in his own dealings with him that he was a crusty old fellow as close as a vice his property would descend to a pretty niece who was now keeping school in kimballton  what with telling the news for the public good and driving bargains for his own dominicus was so much delayed on the road that he chose to put up at a tavern about five miles short of parkers falls after supper lighting one of his prime cigars he seated himself in the barroom and went through the story of the murder which had grown so fast that it took him half an hour to tell there were as many as twenty people in the room nineteen of whom received it all for gospel but the twentieth was an elderly farmer who had arrived on horseback a short time before and was now seated in a corner smoking his pipe when the story was concluded he rose up very deliberately brought his chair right in front of dominicus and stared him full in the face puffing out the vilest tobacco smoke the pedlar had ever smelt  will you make affidavit demanded he in the tone of a country justice taking an examination that old squire higginbotham of kimballton was murdered in his orchard the night before last and found hanging on his great peartree yesterday morning  i tell the story as i heard it mister answered dominicus dropping his halfburnt cigar i dont say that i saw the thing done so i cant take my oath that he was murdered exactly in that way  but i can take mine said the farmer that if squire higginbotham was murdered night before last i drank a glass of bitters with his ghost this morning being a neighbor of mine he called me into his store as i was riding by and treated me and then asked me to do a little business for him on the road he didnt seem to know any more about his own murder than i did  why then it cant be a fact exclaimed dominicus pike  i guess hed have mentioned if it was said the old farmer and he removed his chair back to the corner leaving dominicus quite down in the mouth  here was a sad resurrection of old mr higginbotham the pedlar had no heart to mingle in the conversation any more but comforted himself with a glass of gin and water and went to bed where all night long he dreamed of hanging on the st michaels peartree to avoid the old farmer whom he so detested that his suspension would have pleased him better than mr higginbothams dominicus rose in the gray of the morning put the little mare into the green cart and trotted swiftly away towards parkers falls the fresh breeze the dewy road and the pleasant summer dawn revived his spirits and might have encouraged him to repeat the old story had there been anybody awake to hear it but he met neither ox team light wagon chaise horseman nor foot traveller till just as he crossed salmon river a man came trudging down to the bridge with a bundle over his shoulder on the end of a stick  good morning mister said the pedlar reining in his mare if you come from kimballton or that neighborhood may be you can tell me the real fact about this affair of old mr higginbotham was the old fellow actually murdered two or three nights ago by an irishman and a nigger  dominicus had spoken in too great a hurry to observe at first that the stranger himself had a deep tinge of negro blood on hearing this sudden question the ethiopian appeared to change his skin its yellow hue becoming a ghastly white while shaking and stammering he thus repliedno no there was no colored man it was an irishman that hanged him last night at eight oclock i came away at seven his folks cant have looked for him in the orchard yet  scarcely had the yellow man spoken when he interrupted himself and though he seemed weary enough before continued his journey at a pace which would have kept the pedlars mare on a smart trot dominicus stared after him in great perplexity if the murder had not been committed till tuesday night who was the prophet that had foretold it in all its circumstances on tuesday morning if mr higginbothams corpse were not yet discovered by his own family how came the mulatto at above thirty miles distance to know that he was hanging in the orchard especially as he had left kimballton before the unfortunate man was hanged at all these ambiguous circumstances with the strangers surprise and terror made dominicus think of raising a hue and cry after him as an accomplice in the murder since a murder it seemed had really been perpetrated  but let the poor devil go thought the pedlar i dont want his black blood on my head and hanging the nigger wouldnt unhang mr higginbotham unhang the old gentleman its a sin i know but i should hate to have him come to life a second time and give me the lie  with these meditations dominicus pike drove into the street of parkers falls which as everybody knows is as thriving a village as three cotton factories and a slitting mill can make it the machinery was not in motion and but a few of the shop doors unbarred when he alighted in the stable yard of the tavern and made it his first business to order the mare four quarts of oats his second duty of course was to impart mr higginbothams catastrophe to the hostler he deemed it advisable however not to be too positive as to the date of the direful fact and also to be uncertain whether it were perpetrated by an irishman and a mulatto or by the son of erin alone neither did he profess to relate it on his own authority or that of any one person but mentioned it as a report generally diffused  the story ran through the town like fire among girdled trees and became so much the universal talk that nobody could tell whence it had originated mr higginbotham was as well known at parkers falls as any citizen of the place being part owner of the slitting mill and a considerable stockholder in the cotton factories the inhabitants felt their own prosperity interested in his fate such was the excitement that the parkers falls gazette anticipated its regular day of publication and came out with half a form of blank paper and a column of double pica emphasized with capitals and headed horrid murder of mr higginbotham among other dreadful details the printed account described the mark of the cord round the dead mans neck and stated the number of thousand dollars of which he had been robbed there was much pathos also about the affliction of his niece who had gone from one fainting fit to another ever since her uncle was found hanging on the st michaels peartree with his pockets inside out the village poet likewise commemorated the young ladys grief in seventeen stanzas of a ballad the selectmen held a meeting and in consideration of mr higginbothams claims on the town determined to issue handbills offering a reward of five hundred dollars for the apprehension of his murderers and the recovery of the stolen property  meanwhile the whole population of parkers falls consisting of shopkeepers mistresses of boardinghouses factory girls millmen and schoolboys rushed into the street and kept up such a terrible loquacity as more than compensated for the silence of the cotton machines which refrained from their usual din out of respect to the deceased had mr higginbotham cared about posthumous renown his untimely ghost would have exulted in this tumult our friend dominicus in his vanity of heart forgot his intended precautions and mounting on the town pump announced himself as the bearer of the authentic intelligence which had caused so wonderful a sensation he immediately became the great man of the moment and had just begun a new edition of the narrative with a voice like a field preacher when the mail stage drove into the village street it had travelled all night and must have shifted horses at kimballton at three in the morning  now we shall hear all the particulars shouted the crowd  the coach rumbled up to the piazza of the tavern followed by a thousand people for if any man had been minding his own business till then he now left it at sixes and sevens to hear the news the pedlar foremost in the race discovered two passengers both of whom had been startled from a comfortable nap to find themselves in the centre of a mob every man assailing them with separate questions all propounded at once the couple were struck speechless though one was a lawyer and the other a young lady  mr higginbotham mr higginbotham tell us the particulars about old mr higginbotham bawled the mob what is the coroners verdict are the murderers apprehended is mr higginbothams niece come out of her fainting fits mr higginbotham mr higginbotham  the coachman said not a word except to swear awfully at the hostler for not bringing him a fresh team of horses the lawyer inside had generally his wits about him even when asleep the first thing he did after learning the cause of the excitement was to produce a large red pocketbook meantime dominicus pike being an extremely polite young man and also suspecting that a female tongue would tell the story as glibly as a lawyers had handed the lady out of the coach she was a fine smart girl now wide awake and bright as a button and had such a sweet pretty mouth that dominicus would almost as lief have heard a love tale from it as a tale of murder  gentlemen and ladies said the lawyer to the shopkeepers the millmen and the factory girls i can assure you that some unaccountable mistake or more probably a wilful falsehood maliciously contrived to injure mr higginbothams credit has excited this singular uproar we passed through kimballton at three oclock this morning and most certainly should have been informed of the murder had any been perpetrated but i have proof nearly as strong as mr higginbothams own oral testimony in the negative here is a note relating to a suit of his in the connecticut courts which was delivered me from that gentleman himself i find it dated at ten oclock last evening  so saying the lawyer exhibited the date and signature of the note which irrefragably proved either that this perverse mr higginbotham was alive when he wrote it oras some deemed the more probable case of two doubtful onesthat he was so absorbed in worldly business as to continue to transact it even after his death but unexpected evidence was forthcoming the young lady after listening to the pedlars explanation merely seized a moment to smooth her gown and put her curls in order and then appeared at the tavern door making a modest signal to be heard  good people said she i am mr higginbothams niece  a wondering murmur passed through the crowd on beholding her so rosy and bright that same unhappy niece whom they had supposed on the authority of the parkers falls gazette to be lying at deaths door in a fainting fit but some shrewd fellows had doubted all along whether a young lady would be quite so desperate at the hanging of a rich old uncle  you see continued miss higginbotham with a smile that this strange story is quite unfounded as to myself and i believe i may affirm it to be equally so in regard to my dear uncle higginbotham he has the kindness to give me a home in his house though i contribute to my own support by teaching a school i left kimballton this morning to spend the vacation of commencement week with a friend about five miles from parkers falls my generous uncle when he heard me on the stairs called me to his bedside and gave me two dollars and fifty cents to pay my stage fare and another dollar for my extra expenses he then laid his pocketbook under his pillow shook hands with me and advised me to take some biscuit in my bag instead of breakfasting on the road i feel confident therefore that i left my beloved relative alive and trust that i shall find him so on my return  the young lady courtesied at the close of her speech which was so sensible and well worded and delivered with such grace and propriety that everybody thought her fit to be preceptress of the best academy in the state but a stranger would have supposed that mr higginbotham was an object of abhorrence at parkers falls and that a thanksgiving had been proclaimed for his murder so excessive was the wrath of the inhabitants on learning their mistake the millmen resolved to bestow public honors on dominicus pike only hesitating whether to tar and feather him ride him on a rail or refresh him with an ablution at the town pump on the top of which he had declared himself the bearer of the news the selectmen by advice of the lawyer spoke of prosecuting him for a misdemeanor in circulating unfounded reports to the great disturbance of the peace of the commonwealth nothing saved dominicus either from mob law or a court of justice but an eloquent appeal made by the young lady in his behalf addressing a few words of heartfelt gratitude to his benefactress he mounted the green cart and rode out of town under a discharge of artillery from the schoolboys who found plenty of ammunition in the neighboring claypits and mud holes as he turned his head to exchange a farewell glance with mr higginbothams niece a ball of the consistence of hasty pudding hit him slap in the mouth giving him a most grim aspect his whole person was so bespattered with the like filthy missiles that he had almost a mind to ride back and supplicate for the threatened ablution at the town pump for though not meant in kindness it would now have been a deed of charity  however the sun shone bright on poor dominicus and the mud an emblem of all stains of undeserved opprobrium was easily brushed off when dry being a funny rogue his heart soon cheered up nor could he refrain from a hearty laugh at the uproar which his story had excited the handbills of the selectmen would cause the commitment of all the vagabonds in the state the paragraph in the parkers falls gazette would be reprinted from maine to florida and perhaps form an item in the london newspapers and many a miser would tremble for his money bags and life on learning the catastrophe of mr higginbotham the pedlar meditated with much fervor on the charms of the young schoolmistress and swore that daniel webster never spoke nor looked so like an angel as miss higginbotham while defending him from the wrathful populace at parkers falls  dominicus was now on the kimballton turnpike having all along determined to visit that place though business had drawn him out of the most direct road from morristown as he approached the scene of the supposed murder he continued to revolve the circumstances in his mind and was astonished at the aspect which the whole case assumed had nothing occurred to corroborate the story of the first traveller it might now have been considered as a hoax but the yellow man was evidently acquainted either with the report or the fact and there was a mystery in his dismayed and guilty look on being abruptly questioned when to this singular combination of incidents it was added that the rumor tallied exactly with mr higginbothams character and habits of life and that he had an orchard and a st michaels peartree near which he always passed at nightfall the circumstantial evidence appeared so strong that dominicus doubted whether the autograph produced by the lawyer or even the nieces direct testimony ought to be equivalent making cautious inquiries along the road the pedlar further learned that mr higginbotham had in his service an irishman of doubtful character whom he had hired without a recommendation on the score of economy  may i be hanged myself exclaimed dominicus pike aloud on reaching the top of a lonely hill if ill believe old higginbotham is unhanged till i see him with my own eyes and hear it from his own mouth and as hes a real shaver ill have the minister or some other responsible man for an indorser  it was growing dusk when he reached the tollhouse on kimballton turnpike about a quarter of a mile from the village of this name his little mare was fast bringing him up with a man on horseback who trotted through the gate a few rods in advance of him nodded to the tollgatherer and kept on towards the village dominicus was acquainted with the tollman and while making change the usual remarks on the weather passed between them  i suppose said the pedlar throwing back his whiplash to bring it down like a feather on the mares flank you have not seen anything of old mr higginbotham within a day or two  yes answered the tollgatherer he passed the gate just before you drove up and yonder he rides now if you can see him through the dusk hes been to woodfield this afternoon attending a sheriffs sale there the old man generally shakes hands and has a little chat with me but tonight he noddedas if to say charge my toll and jogged on for wherever he goes he must always be at home by eight oclock  so they tell me said dominicus  i never saw a man look so yellow and thin as the squire does continued the tollgatherer says i to myself tonight hes more like a ghost or an old mummy than good flesh and blood  the pedlar strained his eyes through the twilight and could just discern the horseman now far ahead on the village road he seemed to recognize the rear of mr higginbotham but through the evening shadows and amid the dust from the horses feet the figure appeared dim and unsubstantial as if the shape of the mysterious old man were faintly moulded of darkness and gray light dominicus shivered  mr higginbotham has come back from the other world by way of the kimballton turnpike thought he  he shook the reins and rode forward keeping about the same distance in the rear of the gray old shadow till the latter was concealed by a bend of the road on reaching this point the pedlar no longer saw the man on horseback but found himself at the head of the village street not far from a number of stores and two taverns clustered round the meetinghouse steeple on his left were a stone wall and a gate the boundary of a woodlot beyond which lay an orchard farther still a mowing field and last of all a house these were the premises of mr higginbotham whose dwelling stood beside the old highway but had been left in the background by the kimballton turnpike dominicus knew the place and the little mare stopped short by instinct for he was not conscious of tightening the reins  for the soul of me i cannot get by this gate said he trembling i never shall be my own man again till i see whether mr higginbotham is hanging on the st michaels peartree  he leaped from the cart gave the rein a turn round the gate post and ran along the green path of the woodlot as if old nick were chasing behind just then the village clock tolled eight and as each deep stroke fell dominicus gave a fresh bound and flew faster than before till dim in the solitary centre of the orchard he saw the fated peartree one great branch stretched from the old contorted trunk across the path and threw the darkest shadow on that one spot but something seemed to struggle beneath the branch  the pedlar had never pretended to more courage than befits a man of peaceful occupation nor could he account for his valor on this awful emergency certain it is however that he rushed forward prostrated a sturdy irishman with the butt end of his whip and foundnot indeed hanging on the st michaels peartree but trembling beneath it with a halter round his neckthe old identical mr higginbotham  mr higginbotham said dominicus tremulously youre an honest man and ill take your word for it have you been hanged or not  if the riddle be not already guessed a few words will explain the simple machinery by which this coming event was made to cast its shadow before three men had plotted the robbery and murder of mr higginbotham two of them successively lost courage and fled each delaying the crime one night by their disappearance the third was in the act of perpetration when a champion blindly obeying the call of fate like the heroes of old romance appeared in the person of dominicus pike  it only remains to say that mr higginbotham took the pedlar into high favor sanctioned his addresses to the pretty schoolmistress and settled his whole property on their children allowing themselves the interest in due time the old gentleman capped the climax of his favors by dying a christian death in bed since which melancholy event dominicus pike has removed from kimballton and established a large tobacco manufactory in my native village    wakefield  in some old magazine or newspaper i recollect a story told as truth of a manlet us call him wakefieldwho absented himself for a long time from his wife the fact thus abstractedly stated is not very uncommon norwithout a proper distinction of circumstancesto be condemned either as naughty or nonsensical howbeit this though far from the most aggravated is perhaps the strangest instance on record of marital delinquency and moreover as remarkable a freak as may be found in the whole list of human oddities the wedded couple lived in london the man under pretence of going a journey took lodgings in the next street to his own house and there unheard of by his wife or friends and without the shadow of a reason for such selfbanishment dwelt upwards of twenty years during that period he beheld his home every day and frequently the forlorn mrs wakefield and after so great a gap in his matrimonial felicitywhen his death was reckoned certain his estate settled his name dismissed from memory and his wife long long ago resigned to her autumnal widowhoodhe entered the door one evening quietly as from a days absence and became a loving spouse till death  this outline is all that i remember but the incident though of the purest originality unexampled and probably never to be repeated is one i think which appeals to the generous sympathies of mankind we know each for himself that none of us would perpetrate such a folly yet feel as if some other might to my own contemplations at least it has often recurred always exciting wonder but with a sense that the story must be true and a conception of its heros character whenever any subject so forcibly affects the mind time is well spent in thinking of it if the reader choose let him do his own meditation or if he prefer to ramble with me through the twenty years of wakefields vagary i bid him welcome trusting that there will be a pervading spirit and a moral even should we fail to find them done up neatly and condensed into the final sentence thought has always its efficacy and every striking incident its moral  what sort of a man was wakefield we are free to shape out our own idea and call it by his name he was now in the meridian of life his matrimonial affections never violent were sobered into a calm habitual sentiment of all husbands he was likely to be the most constant because a certain sluggishness would keep his heart at rest wherever it might be placed he was intellectual but not actively so his mind occupied itself in long and lazy musings that ended to no purpose or had not vigor to attain it his thoughts were seldom so energetic as to seize hold of words imagination in the proper meaning of the term made no part of wakefields gifts with a cold but not depraved nor wandering heart and a mind never feverish with riotous thoughts nor perplexed with originality who could have anticipated that our friend would entitle himself to a foremost place among the doers of eccentric deeds had his acquaintances been asked who was the man in london the surest to perform nothing today which should be remembered on the morrow they would have thought of wakefield only the wife of his bosom might have hesitated she without having analyzed his character was partly aware of a quiet selfishness that had rusted into his inactive mind of a peculiar sort of vanity the most uneasy attribute about him of a disposition to craft which had seldom produced more positive effects than the keeping of petty secrets hardly worth revealing and lastly of what she called a little strangeness sometimes in the good man this latter quality is indefinable and perhaps nonexistent  let us now imagine wakefield bidding adieu to his wife it is the dusk of an october evening his equipment is a drab greatcoat a hat covered with an oilcloth topboots an umbrella in one hand and a small portmanteau in the other he has informed mrs wakefield that he is to take the night coach into the country she would fain inquire the length of his journey its object and the probable time of his return but indulgent to his harmless love of mystery interrogates him only by a look he tells her not to expect him positively by the return coach nor to be alarmed should he tarry three or four days but at all events to look for him at supper on friday evening wakefield himself be it considered has no suspicion of what is before him he holds out his hand she gives her own and meets his parting kiss in the matterofcourse way of a ten years matrimony and forth goes the middleaged mr wakefield almost resolved to perplex his good lady by a whole weeks absence after the door has closed behind him she perceives it thrust partly open and a vision of her husbands face through the aperture smiling on her and gone in a moment for the time this little incident is dismissed without a thought but long afterwards when she has been more years a widow than a wife that smile recurs and flickers across all her reminiscences of wakefields visage in her many musings she surrounds the original smile with a multitude of fantasies which make it strange and awful as for instance if she imagines him in a coffin that parting look is frozen on his pale features or if she dreams of him in heaven still his blessed spirit wears a quiet and crafty smile yet for its sake when all others have given him up for dead she sometimes doubts whether she is a widow  but our business is with the husband we must hurry after him along the street ere he lose his individuality and melt into the great mass of london life it would be vain searching for him there let us follow close at his heels therefore until after several superfluous turns and doublings we find him comfortably established by the fireside of a small apartment previously bespoken he is in the next street to his own and at his journeys end he can scarcely trust his good fortune in having got thither unperceivedrecollecting that at one time he was delayed by the throng in the very focus of a lighted lantern and again there were footsteps that seemed to tread behind his own distinct from the multitudinous tramp around him and anon he heard a voice shouting afar and fancied that it called his name doubtless a dozen busybodies had been watching him and told his wife the whole affair poor wakefield little knowest thou thine own insignificance in this great world no mortal eye but mine has traced thee go quietly to thy bed foolish man and on the morrow if thou wilt be wise get thee home to good mrs wakefield and tell her the truth remove not thyself even for a little week from thy place in her chaste bosom were she for a single moment to deem thee dead or lost or lastingly divided from her thou wouldst be wofully conscious of a change in thy true wife forever after it is perilous to make a chasm in human affections not that they gape so long and widebut so quickly close again  almost repenting of his frolic or whatever it may be termed wakefield lies down betimes and starting from his first nap spreads forth his arms into the wide and solitary waste of the unaccustomed bed nothinks he gathering the bedclothes about himi will not sleep alone another night  in the morning he rises earlier than usual and sets himself to consider what he really means to do such are his loose and rambling modes of thought that he has taken this very singular step with the consciousness of a purpose indeed but without being able to define it sufficiently for his own contemplation the vagueness of the project and the convulsive effort with which he plunges into the execution of it are equally characteristic of a feebleminded man wakefield sifts his ideas however as minutely as he may and finds himself curious to know the progress of matters at homehow his exemplary wife will endure her widowhood of a week and briefly how the little sphere of creatures and circumstances in which he was a central object will be affected by his removal a morbid vanity therefore lies nearest the bottom of the affair but how is he to attain his ends not certainly by keeping close in this comfortable lodging where though he slept and awoke in the next street to his home he is as effectually abroad as if the stagecoach had been whirling him away all night yet should he reappear the whole project is knocked in the head his poor brains being hopelessly puzzled with this dilemma he at length ventures out partly resolving to cross the head of the street and send one hasty glance towards his forsaken domicile habitfor he is a man of habitstakes him by the hand and guides him wholly unaware to his own door where just at the critical moment he is aroused by the scraping of his foot upon the step wakefield whither are you going  at that instant his fate was turning on the pivot little dreaming of the doom to which his first backward step devotes him he hurries away breathless with agitation hitherto unfelt and hardly dares turn his head at the distant corner can it be that nobody caught sight of him will not the whole householdthe decent mrs wakefield the smart maid servant and the dirty little footboyraise a hue and cry through london streets in pursuit of their fugitive lord and master wonderful escape he gathers courage to pause and look homeward but is perplexed with a sense of change about the familiar edifice such as affects us all when after a separation of months or years we again see some hill or lake or work of art with which we were friends of old in ordinary cases this indescribable impression is caused by the comparison and contrast between our imperfect reminiscences and the reality in wakefield the magic of a single night has wrought a similar transformation because in that brief period a great moral change has been effected but this is a secret from himself before leaving the spot he catches a far and momentary glimpse of his wife passing athwart the front window with her face turned towards the head of the street the crafty nincompoop takes to his heels scared with the idea that among a thousand such atoms of mortality her eye must have detected him right glad is his heart though his brain be somewhat dizzy when he finds himself by the coal fire of his lodgings  so much for the commencement of this long whimwham after the initial conception and the stirring up of the mans sluggish temperament to put it in practice the whole matter evolves itself in a natural train we may suppose him as the result of deep deliberation buying a new wig of reddish hair and selecting sundry garments in a fashion unlike his customary suit of brown from a jews oldclothes bag it is accomplished wakefield is another man the new system being now established a retrograde movement to the old would be almost as difficult as the step that placed him in his unparalleled position furthermore he is rendered obstinate by a sulkiness occasionally incident to his temper and brought on at present by the inadequate sensation which he conceives to have been produced in the bosom of mrs wakefield he will not go back until she be frightened half to death well twice or thrice has she passed before his sight each time with a heavier step a paler cheek and more anxious brow and in the third week of his nonappearance he detects a portent of evil entering the house in the guise of an apothecary next day the knocker is muffled towards nightfall comes the chariot of a physician and deposits its bigwigged and solemn burden at wakefields door whence after a quarter of an hours visit he emerges perchance the herald of a funeral dear woman will she die by this time wakefield is excited to something like energy of feeling but still lingers away from his wifes bedside pleading with his conscience that she must not be disturbed at such a juncture if aught else restrains him he does not know it in the course of a few weeks she gradually recovers the crisis is over her heart is sad perhaps but quiet and let him return soon or late it will never be feverish for him again such ideas glimmer through the midst of wakefields mind and render him indistinctly conscious that an almost impassable gulf divides his hired apartment from his former home it is but in the next street he sometimes says fool it is in another world hitherto he has put off his return from one particular day to another henceforward he leaves the precise time undetermined not tomorrowprobably next weekpretty soon poor man the dead have nearly as much chance of revisiting their earthly homes as the selfbanished wakefield  would that i had a folio to write instead of an article of a dozen pages then might i exemplify how an influence beyond our control lays its strong hand on every deed which we do and weaves its consequences into an iron tissue of necessity wakefield is spellbound we must leave him for ten years or so to haunt around his house without once crossing the threshold and to be faithful to his wife with all the affection of which his heart is capable while he is slowly fading out of hers long since it must be remarked he had lost the perception of singularity in his conduct  now for a scene amind the throng of a london street we distinguish a man now waxing elderly with few characteristics to attract careless observers yet bearing in his whole aspect the handwriting of no common fate for such as have the skill to read it he is meagre his low and narrow forehead is deeply wrinkled his eyes small and lustreless sometimes wander apprehensively about him but oftener seem to look inward he bends his head and moves with an indescribable obliquity of gait as if unwilling to display his full front to the world watch him long enough to see what we have described and you will allow that circumstanceswhich often produce remarkable men from natures ordinary handiworkhave produced one such here next leaving him to sidle along the footwalk cast your eyes in the opposite direction where a portly female considerably in the wane of life with a prayerbook in her hand is proceeding to yonder church she has the placid mien of settled widowhood her regrets have either died away or have become so essential to her heart that they would be poorly exchanged for joy just as the lean man and wellconditioned woman are passing a slight obstruction occurs and brings these two figures directly in contact their hands touch the pressure of the crowd forces her bosom against his shoulder they stand face to face staring into each others eyes after a ten years separation thus wakefield meets his wife  the throng eddies away and carries them asunder the sober widow resuming her former pace proceeds to church but pauses in the portal and throws a perplexed glance along the street she passes in however opening her prayerbook as she goes and the man with so wild a face that busy and selfish london stands to gaze after him he hurries to his lodgings bolts the door and throws himself upon the bed the latent feelings of years break out his feeble mind acquires a brief energy from their strength all the miserable strangeness of his life is revealed to him at a glance and he cries out passionately wakefield  wakefield you are mad  perhaps he was so the singularity of his situation must have so moulded him to himself that considered in regard to his fellowcreatures and the business of life he could not be said to possess his right mind he had contrived or rather he had happened to dissever himself from the worldto vanishto give up his place and privileges with living men without being admitted among the dead the life of a hermit is nowise parallel to his he was in the bustle of the city as of old but the crowd swept by and saw him not he was we may figuratively say always beside his wife and at his hearth yet must never feel the warmth of the one nor the affection of the other it was wakefields unprecedented fate to retain his original share of human sympathies and to be still involved in human interests while he had lost his reciprocal influence on them it would be a most curious speculation to trace out the effect of such circumstances on his heart and intellect separately and in unison yet changed as he was he would seldom be conscious of it but deem himself the same man as ever glimpses of the truth indeed would come but only for the moment and still he would keep saying i shall soon go backnor reflect that he had been saying so for twenty years  i conceive also that these twenty years would appear in the retrospect scarcely longer than the week to which wakefield had at first limited his absence he would look on the affair as no more than an interlude in the main business of his life when after a little while more he should deem it time to reenter his parlor his wife would clap her hands for joy on beholding the middleaged mr wakefield alas what a mistake would time but await the close of our favorite follies we should be young men all of us and till doomsday  one evening in the twentieth year since he vanished wakefield is taking his customary walk towards the dwelling which he still calls his own it is a gusty night of autumn with frequent showers that patter down upon the pavement and are gone before a man can put up his umbrella pausing near the house wakefield discerns through the parlor windows of the second floor the red glow and the glimmer and fitful flash of a comfortable fire on the ceiling appears a grotesque shadow of good mrs wakefield the cap the nose and chin and the broad waist form an admirable caricature which dances moreover with the upflickering and downsinking blaze almost too merrily for the shade of an elderly widow at this instant a shower chances to fall and is driven by the unmannerly gust full into wakefields face and bosom he is quite penetrated with its autumnal chill shall he stand wet and shivering here when his own hearth has a good fire to warm him and his own wife will run to fetch the gray coat and smallclothes which doubtless she has kept carefully in the closet of their bed chamber no wakefield is no such fool he ascends the stepsheavilyfor twenty years have stiffened his legs since he came downbut he knows it not stay wakefield would you go to the sole home that is left you then step into your grave the door opens as he passes in we have a parting glimpse of his visage and recognize the crafty smile which was the precursor of the little joke that he has ever since been playing off at his wifes expense how unmercifully has he quizzed the poor woman well a good nights rest to wakefield  this happy eventsupposing it to be suchcould only have occurred at an unpremeditated moment we will not follow our friend across the threshold he has left us much food for thought a portion of which shall lend its wisdom to a moral and be shaped into a figure amid the seeming confusion of our mysterious world individuals are so nicely adjusted to a system and systems to one another and to a whole that by stepping aside for a moment a man exposes himself to a fearful risk of losing his place forever like wakefield he may become as it were the outcast of the universe     the great carbuncle1  a mystery of the white mountains   1 the indian tradition on which this somewhat extravagant tale is founded is both too wild and too beautiful to be adequately wrought up in prose sullivan in his history of maine written since the revolution remarks that even then the existence of the great carbuncle was not entirely discredited   at nightfall once in the olden time on the rugged side of one of the crystal hills a party of adventurers were refreshing themselves after a toilsome and fruitless quest for the great carbuncle they had come thither not as friends nor partners in the enterprise but each save one youthful pair impelled by his own selfish and solitary longing for this wondrous gem their feeling of brotherhood however was strong enough to induce them to contribute a mutual aid in building a rude hut of branches and kindling a great fire of shattered pines that had drifted down the headlong current of the amonoosuck on the lower bank of which they were to pass the night there was but one of their number perhaps who had become so estranged from natural sympathies by the absorbing spell of the pursuit as to acknowledge no satisfaction at the sight of human faces in the remote and solitary region whither they had ascended a vast extent of wilderness lay between them and the nearest settlement while a scant mile above their heads was that black verge where the hills throw off their shaggy mantle of forest trees and either robe themselves in clouds or tower naked into the sky the roar of the amonoosuck would have been too awful for endurance if only a solitary man had listened while the mountain stream talked with the wind  the adventurers therefore exchanged hospitable greetings and welcomed one another to the hut where each man was the host and all were the guests of the whole company they spread their individual supplies of food on the flat surface of a rock and partook of a general repast at the close of which a sentiment of good fellowship was perceptible among the party though repressed by the idea that the renewed search for the great carbuncle must make them strangers again in the morning seven men and one young woman they warmed themselves together at the fire which extended its bright wall along the whole front of their wigwam as they observed the various and contrasted figures that made up the assemblage each man looking like a caricature of himself in the unsteady light that flickered over him they came mutually to the conclusion that an odder society had never met in city or wilderness on mountain or plain  the eldest of the group a tall lean weatherbeaten man some sixty years of age was clad in the skins of wild animals whose fashion of dress he did well to imitate since the deer the wolf and the bear had long been his most intimate companions he was one of those illfated mortals such as the indians told of whom in their early youth the great carbuncle smote with a peculiar madness and became the passionate dream of their existence all who visited that region knew him as the seeker and by no other name as none could remember when he first took up the search there went a fable in the valley of the saco that for his inordinate lust after the great carbuncle he had been condemned to wander among the mountains till the end of time still with the same feverish hopes at sunrisethe same despair at eve near this miserable seeker sat a little elderly personage wearing a highcrowned hat shaped somewhat like a crucible he was from beyond the sea a doctor cacaphodel who had wilted and dried himself into a mummy by continually stooping over charcoal furnaces and inhaling unwholesome fumes during his researches in chemistry and alchemy it was told of him whether truly or not that at the commencement of his studies he had drained his body of all its richest blood and wasted it with other inestimable ingredients in an unsuccessful experimentand had never been a well man since another of the adventurers was master ichabod pigsnort a weighty merchant and selectman of boston and an elder of the famous mr nortons church his enemies had a ridiculous story that master pigsnort was accustomed to spend a whole hour after prayer time every morning and evening in wallowing naked among an immense quantity of pinetree shillings which were the earliest silver coinage of massachusetts the fourth whom we shall notice had no name that his companions knew of and was chiefly distinguished by a sneer that always contorted his thin visage and by a prodigious pair of spectacles which were supposed to deform and discolor the whole face of nature to this gentlemans perception the fifth adventurer likewise lacked a name which was the greater pity as he appeared to be a poet he was a brighteyed man but wofully pined away which was no more than natural if as some people affirmed his ordinary diet was fog morning mist and a slice of the densest cloud within his reach sauced with moonshine whenever he could get it certain it is that the poetry which flowed from him had a smack of all these dainties the sixth of the party was a young man of haughty mien and sat somewhat apart from the rest wearing his plumed hat loftily among his elders while the fire glittered on the rich embroidery of his dress and gleamed intensely on the jewelled pommel of his sword this was the lord de vere who when at home was said to spend much of his time in the burial vault of his dead progenitors rummaging their mouldy coffins in search of all the earthly pride and vainglory that was hidden among bones and dust so that besides his own share he had the collected haughtiness of his whole line of ancestry  lastly there was a handsome youth in rustic garb and by his side a blooming little person in whom a delicate shade of maiden reserve was just melting into the rich glow of a young wifes affection her name was hannah and her husbands matthew two homely names yet well enough adapted to the simple pair who seemed strangely out of place among the whimsical fraternity whose wits had been set agog by the great carbuncle  beneath the shelter of one hut in the bright blaze of the same fire sat this varied group of adventurers all so intent upon a single object that of whatever else they began to speak their closing words were sure to be illuminated with the great carbuncle several related the circumstances that brought them thither one had listened to a travellers tale of this marvellous stone in his own distant country and had immediately been seized with such a thirst for beholding it as could only be quenched in its intensest lustre another so long ago as when the famous captain smith visited these coasts had seen it blazing far at sea and had felt no rest in all the intervening years till now that he took up the search a third being encamped on a hunting expedition full forty miles south of the white mountains awoke at midnight and beheld the great carbuncle gleaming like a meteor so that the shadows of the trees fell backward from it they spoke of the innumerable attempts which had been made to reach the spot and of the singular fatality which had hitherto withheld success from all adventurers though it might seem so easy to follow to its source a light that overpowered the moon and almost matched the sun it was observable that each smiled scornfully at the madness of every other in anticipating better fortune than the past yet nourished a scarcely hidden conviction that he would himself be the favored one as if to allay their too sanguine hopes they recurred to the indian traditions that a spirit kept watch about the gem and bewildered those who sought it either by removing it from peak to peak of the higher hills or by calling up a mist from the enchanted lake over which it hung but these tales were deemed unworthy of credit all professing to believe that the search had been baffled by want of sagacity or perseverance in the adventurers or such other causes as might naturally obstruct the passage to any given point among the intricacies of forest valley and mountain  in a pause of the conversation the wearer of the prodigious spectacles looked round upon the party making each individual in turn the object of the sneer which invariably dwelt upon his countenance  so fellowpilgrims said he here we are seven wise men and one fair damselwho doubtless is as wise as any graybeard of the company here we are i say all bound on the same goodly enterprise methinks now it were not amiss that each of us declare what he proposes to do with the great carbuncle provided he have the good hap to clutch it what says our friend in the bear skin how mean you good sir to enjoy the prize which you have been seeking the lord knows how long among the crystal hills  how enjoy it exclaimed the aged seeker bitterly i hope for no enjoyment from it that folly has passed long ago i keep up the search for this accursed stone because the vain ambition of my youth has become a fate upon me in old age the pursuit alone is my strengththe energy of my soulthe warmth of my bloodand the pith and marrow of my bones were i to turn my back upon it i should fall down dead on the hither side of the notch which is the gateway of this mountain region yet not to have my wasted lifetime back again would i give up my hopes of the great carbuncle having found it i shall bear it to a certain cavern that i wot of and there grasping it in my arms lie down and die and keep it buried with me forever  o wretch regardless of the interests of science cried doctor cacaphodel with philosophic indignation thou art not worthy to behold even from afar off the lustre of this most precious gem that ever was concocted in the laboratory of nature mine is the sole purpose for which a wise man may desire the possession of the great carbuncle immediately on obtaining itfor i have a presentiment good people that the prize is reserved to crown my scientific reputationi shall return to europe and employ my remaining years in reducing it to its first elements a portion of the stone will i grind to impalpable powder other parts shall be dissolved in acids or whatever solvents will act upon so admirable a composition and the remainder i design to melt in the crucible or set on fire with the blowpipe by these various methods i shall gain an accurate analysis and finally bestow the result of my labors upon the world in a folio volume  excellent quoth the man with the spectacles nor need you hesitate learned sir on account of the necessary destruction of the gem since the perusal of your folio may teach every mothers son of us to concoct a great carbuncle of his own  but verily said master ichabod pigsnort for mine own part i object to the making of these counterfeits as being calculated to reduce the marketable value of the true gem i tell ye frankly sirs i have an interest in keeping up the price here have i quitted my regular traffic leaving my warehouse in the care of my clerks and putting my credit to great hazard and furthermore have put myself in peril of death or captivity by the accursed heathen savagesand all this without daring to ask the prayers of the congregation because the quest for the great carbuncle is deemed little better than a traffic with the evil one now think ye that i would have done this grievous wrong to my soul body reputation and estate without a reasonable chance of profit  not i pious master pigsnort said the man with the spectacles i never laid such a great folly to thy charge  truly i hope not said the merchant now as touching this great carbuncle i am free to own that i have never had a glimpse of it but be it only the hundredth part so bright as people tell it will surely outvalue the great moguls best diamond which he holds at an incalculable sum wherefore i am minded to put the great carbuncle on shipboard and voyage with it to england france spain italy or into heathendom if providence should send me thither and in a word dispose of the gem to the best bidder among the potentates of the earth that he may place it among his crown jewels if any of ye have a wiser plan let him expound it  that have i thou sordid man exclaimed the poet dost thou desire nothing brighter than gold that thou wouldst transmute all this ethereal lustre into such dross as thou wallowest in already for myself hiding the jewel under my cloak i shall hie me back to my attic chamber in one of the darksome alleys of london there night and day will i gaze upon it my soul shall drink its radiance it shall be diffused throughout my intellectual powers and gleam brightly in every line of poesy that i indite thus long ages after i am gone the splendor of the great carbuncle will blaze around my name  well said master poet cried he of the spectacles hide it under thy cloak sayest thou why it will gleam through the holes and make thee look like a jackolantern  to think ejaculated the lord de vere rather to himself than his companions the best of whom he held utterly unworthy of his intercourse to think that a fellow in a tattered cloak should talk of conveying the great carbuncle to a garret in grub street have not i resolved within myself that the whole earth contains no fitter ornament for the great hall of my ancestral castle there shall it flame for ages making a noonday of midnight glittering on the suits of armor the banners and escutcheons that hang around the wall and keeping bright the memory of heroes wherefore have all other adventurers sought the prize in vain but that i might win it and make it a symbol of the glories of our lofty line and never on the diadem of the white mountains did the great carbuncle hold a place half so honored as is reserved for it in the hall of the de veres  it is a noble thought said the cynic with an obsequious sneer yet might i presume to say so the gem would make a rare sepulchral lamp and would display the glories of your lordships progenitors more truly in the ancestral vault than in the castle hall  nay forsooth observed matthew the young rustic who sat hand in hand with his bride the gentleman has bethought himself of a profitable use for this bright stone hannah here and i are seeking it for a like purpose  how fellow exclaimed his lordship in surprise what castle hall hast thou to hang it in  no castle replied matthew but as neat a cottage as any within sight of the crystal hills ye must know friends that hannah and i being wedded the last week have taken up the search of the great carbuncle because we shall need its light in the long winter evenings and it will be such a pretty thing to show the neighbors when they visit us it will shine through the house so that we may pick up a pin in any corner and will set all the windows aglowing as if there were a great fire of pine knots in the chimney and then how pleasant when we awake in the night to be able to see one anothers faces  there was a general smile among the adventurers at the simplicity of the young couples project in regard to this wondrous and invaluable stone with which the greatest monarch on earth might have been proud to adorn his palace especially the man with spectacles who had sneered at all the company in turn now twisted his visage into such an expression of illnatured mirth that matthew asked him rather peevishly what he himself meant to do with the great carbuncle  the great carbuncle answered the cynic with ineffable scorn why you blockhead there is no such thing in rerum natura i have come three thousand miles and am resolved to set my foot on every peak of these mountains and poke my head into every chasm for the sole purpose of demonstrating to the satisfaction of any man one whit less an ass than thyself that the great carbuncle is all a humbug  vain and foolish were the motives that had brought most of the adventurers to the crystal hills but none so vain so foolish and so impious too as that of the scoffer with the prodigious spectacles he was one of those wretched and evil men whose yearnings are downward to the darkness instead of heavenward and who could they but extinguish the lights which god hath kindled for us would count the midnight gloom their chiefest glory as the cynic spoke several of the party were startled by a gleam of red splendor that showed the huge shapes of the surrounding mountains and the rockbestrewn bed of the turbulent river with an illumination unlike that of their fire on the trunks and black boughs of the forest trees they listened for the roll of thunder but heard nothing and were glad that the tempest came not near them the stars those dial points of heaven now warned the adventurers to close their eyes on the blazing logs and open them in dreams to the glow of the great carbuncle  the young married couple had taken their lodgings in the farthest corner of the wigwam and were separated from the rest of the party by a curtain of curiouslywoven twigs such as might have hung in deep festoons around the bridalbower of eve the modest little wife had wrought this piece of tapestry while the other guests were talking she and her husband fell asleep with hands tenderly clasped and awoke from visions of unearthly radiance to meet the more blessed light of one anothers eyes they awoke at the same instant and with one happy smile beaming over their two faces which grew brighter with their consciousness of the reality of life and love but no sooner did she recollect where they were than the bride peeped through the interstices of the leafy curtain and saw that the outer room of the hut was deserted  up dear matthew cried she in haste the strange folk are all gone up this very minute or we shall lose the great carbuncle  in truth so little did these poor young people deserve the mighty prize which had lured them thither that they had slept peacefully all night and till the summits of the hills were glittering with sunshine while the other adventurers had tossed their limbs in feverish wakefulness or dreamed of climbing precipices and set off to realize their dreams with the earliest peep of dawn but matthew and hannah after their calm rest were as light as two young deer and merely stopped to say their prayers and wash themselves in a cold pool of the amonoosuck and then to taste a morsel of food ere they turned their faces to the mountainside it was a sweet emblem of conjugal affection as they toiled up the difficult ascent gathering strength from the mutual aid which they afforded after several little accidents such as a torn robe a lost shoe and the entanglement of hannahs hair in a bough they reached the upper verge of the forest and were now to pursue a more adventurous course the innumerable trunks and heavy foliage of the trees had hitherto shut in their thoughts which now shrank affrighted from the region of wind and cloud and naked rocks and desolate sunshine that rose immeasurably above them they gazed back at the obscure wilderness which they had traversed and longed to be buried again in its depths rather than trust themselves to so vast and visible a solitude  shall we go on said matthew throwing his arm round hannahs waist both to protect her and to comfort his heart by drawing her close to it  but the little bride simple as she was had a womans love of jewels and could not forego the hope of possessing the very brightest in the world in spite of the perils with which it must be won  let us climb a little higher whispered she yet tremulously as she turned her face upward to the lonely sky  come then said matthew mustering his manly courage and drawing her along with him for she became timid again the moment that he grew bold  and upward accordingly went the pilgrims of the great carbuncle now treading upon the tops and thicklyinterwoven branches of dwarf pines which by the growth of centuries though mossy with age had barely reached three feet in altitude next they came to masses and fragments of naked rock heaped confusedly together like a cairn reared by giants in memory of a giant chief in this bleak realm of upper air nothing breathed nothing grew there was no life but what was concentrated in their two hearts they had climbed so high that nature herself seemed no longer to keep them company she lingered beneath them within the verge of the forest trees and sent a farewell glance after her children as they strayed where her own green footprints had never been but soon they were to be hidden from her eye densely and dark the mists began to gather below casting black spots of shadow on the vast landscape and sailing heavily to one centre as if the loftiest mountain peak had summoned a council of its kindred clouds finally the vapors welded themselves as it were into a mass presenting the appearance of a pavement over which the wanderers might have trodden but where they would vainly have sought an avenue to the blessed earth which they had lost and the lovers yearned to behold that green earth again more intensely alas than beneath a clouded sky they had ever desired a glimpse of heaven they even felt it a relief to their desolation when the mists creeping gradually up the mountain concealed its lonely peak and thus annihilated at least for them the whole region of visible space but they drew closer together with a fond and melancholy gaze dreading lest the universal cloud should snatch them from each others sight  still perhaps they would have been resolute to climb as far and as high between earth and heaven as they could find foothold if hannahs strength had not begun to fail and with that her courage also her breath grew short she refused to burden her husband with her weight but often tottered against his side and recovered herself each time by a feebler effort at last she sank down on one of the rocky steps of the acclivity  we are lost dear matthew said she mournfully we shall never find our way to the earth again and oh how happy we might have been in our cottage  dear heartwe will yet be happy there answered matthew look in this direction the sunshine penetrates the dismal mist by its aid i can direct our course to the passage of the notch let us go back love and dream no more of the great carbuncle  the sun cannot be yonder said hannah with despondence by this time it must be noon if there could ever be any sunshine here it would come from above our heads  but look repeated matthew in a somewhat altered tone it is brightening every moment if not sunshine what can it be  nor could the young bride any longer deny that a radiance was breaking through the mist and changing its dim hue to a dusky red which continually grew more vivid as if brilliant particles were interfused with the gloom now also the cloud began to roll away from the mountain while as it heavily withdrew one object after another started out of its impenetrable obscurity into sight with precisely the effect of a new creation before the indistinctness of the old chaos had been completely swallowed up as the process went on they saw the gleaming of water close at their feet and found themselves on the very border of a mountain lake deep bright clear and calmly beautiful spreading from brim to brim of a basin that had been scooped out of the solid rock a ray of glory flashed across its surface the pilgrims looked whence it should proceed but closed their eyes with a thrill of awful admiration to exclude the fervid splendor that glowed from the brow of a cliff impending over the enchanted lake for the simple pair had reached that lake of mystery and found the longsought shrine of the great carbuncle  they threw their arms around each other and trembled at their own success for as the legends of this wondrous gem rushed thick upon their memory they felt themselves marked out by fateand the consciousness was fearful often from childhood upward they had seen it shining like a distant star and now that star was throwing its intensest lustre on their hearts they seemed changed to one anothers eyes in the red brilliancy that flamed upon their cheeks while it lent the same fire to the lake the rocks and sky and to the mists which had rolled back before its power but with their next glance they beheld an object that drew their attention even from the mighty stone at the base of the cliff directly beneath the great carbuncle appeared the figure of a man with his arms extended in the act of climbing and his face turned upward as if to drink the full gush of splendor but he stirred not no more than if changed to marble  it is the seeker whispered hannah convulsively grasping her husbands arm matthew he is dead  the joy of success has killed him replied matthew trembling violently or perhaps the very light of the great carbuncle was death  the great carbuncle cried a peevish voice behind them the great humbug if you have found it prithee point it out to me  they turned their heads and there was the cynic with his prodigious spectacles set carefully on his nose staring now at the lake now at the rocks now at the distant masses of vapor now right at the great carbuncle itself yet seemingly as unconscious of its light as if all the scattered clouds were condensed about his person though its radiance actually threw the shadow of the unbeliever at his own feet as he turned his back upon the glorious jewel he would not be convinced that there was the least glimmer there  where is your great humbug he repeated i challenge you to make me see it  there said matthew incensed at such perverse blindness and turning the cynic round towards the illuminated cliff take off those abominable spectacles and you cannot help seeing it  now these colored spectacles probably darkened the cynics sight in at least as great a degree as the smoked glasses through which people gaze at an eclipse with resolute bravado however he snatched them from his nose and fixed a bold stare full upon the ruddy blaze of the great carbuncle but scarcely had he encountered it when with a deep shuddering groan he dropped his head and pressed both hands across his miserable eyes thenceforth there was in very truth no light of the great carbuncle nor any other light on earth nor light of heaven itself for the poor cynic so long accustomed to view all objects through a medium that deprived them of every glimpse of brightness a single flash of so glorious a phenomenon striking upon his naked vision had blinded him forever  matthew said hannah clinging to him let us go hence  matthew saw that she was faint and kneeling down supported her in his arms while he threw some of the thrillingly cold water of the enchanted lake upon her face and bosom it revived her but could not renovate her courage  yes dearest cried matthew pressing her tremulous form to his breastwe will go hence and return to our humble cottage the blessed sunshine and the quiet moonlight shall come through our window we will kindle the cheerful glow of our hearth at eventide and be happy in its light but never again will we desire more light than all the world may share with us  no said his bride for how could we live by day or sleep by night in this awful blaze of the great carbuncle  out of the hollow of their hands they drank each a draught from the lake which presented them its waters uncontaminated by an earthly lip then lending their guidance to the blinded cynic who uttered not a word and even stifled his groans in his own most wretched heart they began to descend the mountain yet as they left the shore till then untrodden of the spirits lake they threw a farewell glance towards the cliff and beheld the vapors gathering in dense volumes through which the gem burned duskily  as touching the other pilgrims of the great carbuncle the legend goes on to tell that the worshipful master ichabod pigsnort soon gave up the quest as a desperate speculation and wisely resolved to betake himself again to his warehouse near the town dock in boston but as he passed through the notch of the mountains a war party of indians captured our unlucky merchant and carried him to montreal there holding him in bondage till by the payment of a heavy ransom he had wofully subtracted from his hoard of pinetree shillings by his long absence moreover his affairs had become so disordered that for the rest of his life instead of wallowing in silver he had seldom a sixpence worth of copper doctor cacaphodel the alchemist returned to his laboratory with a prodigious fragment of granite which he ground to powder dissolved in acids melted in the crucible and burned with the blowpipe and published the result of his experiments in one of the heaviest folios of the day and for all these purposes the gem itself could not have answered better than the granite the poet by a somewhat similar mistake made prize of a great piece of ice which he found in a sunless chasm of the mountains and swore that it corresponded in all points with his idea of the great carbuncle the critics say that if his poetry lacked the splendor of the gem it retained all the coldness of the ice the lord de vere went back to his ancestral hall where he contented himself with a waxlighted chandelier and filled in due course of time another coffin in the ancestral vault as the funeral torches gleamed within that dark receptacle there was no need of the great carbuncle to show the vanity of earthly pomp  the cynic having cast aside his spectacles wandered about the world a miserable object and was punished with an agonizing desire of light for the wilful blindness of his former life the whole night long he would lift his splendorblasted orbs to the moon and stars he turned his face eastward at sunrise as duly as a perisan idolater he made a pilgrimage to rome to witness the magnificent illumination of st peters church and finally perished in the great fire of london into the midst of which he had thrust himself with the desperate idea of catching one feeble ray from the blaze that was kindling earth and heaven  matthew and his bride spent many peaceful years and were fond of telling the legend of the great carbuncle the tale however towards the close of their lengthened lives did not meet with the full credence that had been accorded to it by those who remembered the ancient lustre of the gem for it is affirmed that from the hour when two mortals had shown themselves so simply wise as to reject a jewel which would have dimmed all earthly things its splendor waned when other pilgrims reached the cliff they found only an opaque stone with particles of mica glittering on its surface there is also a tradition that as the youthful pair departed the gem was loosened from the forehead of the cliff and fell into the enchanted lake and that at noontide the seekers form may still be seen to bend over its quenchless gleam  some few believe that this inestimable stone is blazing as of old and say that they have caught its radiance like a flash of summer lightning far down the valley of the saco and be it owned that many a mile from the crystal hills i saw a wondrous light around their summits and was lured by the faith of poesy to be the latest pilgrim of the great carbuncle     david swan  a fantasy  we can be but partially acquainted even with the events which actually influence our course through life and our final destiny there are innumerable other eventsif such they may be calledwhich come close upon us yet pass away without actual results or even betraying their near approach by the reflection of any light or shadow across our minds could we know all the vicissitudes of our fortunes life would be too full of hope and fear exultation or disappointment to afford us a single hour of true serenity this idea may be illustrated by a page from the secret history of david swan  we have nothing to do with david until we find him at the age of twenty on the high road from his native place to the city of boston where his uncle a small dealer in the grocery line was to take him behind the counter be it enough to say that he was a native of new hampshire born of respectable parents and had received an ordinary school education with a classic finish by a year at gilmanton academy after journeying on foot from sunrise till nearly noon of a summers day his weariness and the increasing heat determined him to sit down in the first convenient shade and await the coming up of the stagecoach as if planted on purpose for him there soon appeared a little tuft of maples with a delightful recess in the midst and such a fresh bubbling spring that it seemed never to have sparkled for any wayfarer but david swan virgin or not he kissed it with his thirsty lips and then flung himself along the brink pillowing his head upon some shirts and a pair of pantaloons tied up in a striped cotton handkerchief the sunbeams could not reach him the dust did not yet rise from the road after the heavy rain of yesterday and his grassy lair suited the young man better than a bed of down the spring murmured drowsily beside him the branches waved dreamily across the blue sky overhead and a deep sleep perchance hiding dreams within its depths fell upon david swan but we are to relate events which he did not dream of  while he lay sound asleep in the shade other people were wide awake and passed to and fro afoot on horseback and in all sorts of vehicles along the sunny road by his bedchamber some looked neither to the right hand nor the left and knew not that he was there some merely glanced that way without admitting the slumberer among their busy thoughts some laughed to see how soundly he slept and several whose hearts were brimming full of scorn ejected their venomous superfluity on david swan a middleaged widow when nobody else was near thrust her head a little way into the recess and vowed that the young fellow looked charming in his sleep a temperance lecturer saw him and wrought poor david into the texture of his evenings discourse as an awful instance of dead drunkenness by the roadside but censure praise merriment scorn and indifference were all one or rather all nothing to david swan  he had slept only a few moments when a brown carriage drawn by a handsome pair of horses bowled easily along and was brought to a standstill nearly in front of davids restingplace a linchpin had fallen out and permitted one of the wheels to slide off the damage was slight and occasioned merely a momentary alarm to an elderly merchant and his wife who were returning to boston in the carriage while the coachman and a servant were replacing the wheel the lady and gentleman sheltered themselves beneath the mapletrees and there espied the bubbling fountain and david swan asleep beside it impressed with the awe which the humblest sleeped usually sheds around him the merchant trod as lightly as the gout would allow and his spouse took good heed not to rustle her silk gown lest david should start up all of a sudden  how soundly he sleeps whispered the old gentleman from what a depth he draws that easy breath such sleep as that brought on without an opiate would be worth more to me than half my income for it would suppose health and an untroubled mind  and youth besides said the lady healthy and quiet age does not sleep thus our slumber is no more like his than our wakefulness  the longer they looked the more did this elderly couple feel interested in the unknown youth to whom the wayside and the maple shade were as a secret chamber with the rich gloom of damask curtains brooding over him perceiving that a stray sunbeam glimmered down upon his face the lady contrived to twist a branch aside so as to intercept it and having done this little act of kindness she began to feel like a mother to him  providence seems to have laid him here whispered she to her husband and to have brought us hither to find him after our disappointment in our cousins son methinks i can see a likeness to our departed henry shall we waken him  to what purpose said the merchant hesitating we know nothing of the youths character  that open countenance replied his wife in the same hushed voice yet earnestly this innocent sleep  while these whispers were passing the sleepers heart did not throb nor his breath become agitated nor his features betray the least token of interest yet fortune was bending over him just ready to let fall a burden of gold the old merchant had lost his only son and had no heir to his wealth except a distant relative with whose conduct he was dissatisfied in such cases people sometimes do stranger things than to act the magician and awaken a young man to splendor who fell asleep in poverty  shall we not waken him repeated the lady persuasively  the coach is ready sir said the servant behind  the old couple started reddened and hurried away mutually wondering that they should ever have dreamed of doing anything so very ridiculous the merchant threw himself back in the carriage and occupied his mind with the plan of a magnificent asylum for unfortunate men of business meanwhile david swan enjoyed his nap  the carriage could not have gone above a mile or two when a pretty young girl came along with a tripping pace which showed precisely how her little heart was dancing in her bosom perhaps it was this merry kind of motion that causedis there any harm in saying ither garter to slip its knot conscious that the silken girthif silk it werewas relaxing its hold she turned aside into the shelter of the mapletrees and there found a young man asleep by the spring blushing as red as any rose that she should have intruded into a gentlemans bedchamber and for such a purpose too she was about to make her escape on tiptoe but there was peril near the sleeper a monster of a bee had been wandering overheadbuzz buzz buzznow among the leaves now flashing through the strips of sunshine and now lost in the dark shade till finally he appeared to be settling on the eyelid of david swan the sting of a bee is sometimes deadly as free hearted as she was innocent the girl attacked the intruder with her handkerchief brushed him soundly and drove him from beneath the mapleshade how sweet a picture this good deed accomplished with quickened breath and a deeper blush she stole a glance at the youthful stranger for whom she had been battling with a dragon in the air  he is handsome thought she and blushed redder yet  how could it be that no dream of bliss grew so strong within him that shattered by its very strength it should part asunder and allow him to perceive the girl among its phantoms why at least did no smile of welcome brighten upon his face she was come the maid whose soul according to the old and beautiful idea had been severed from his own and whom in all his vague but passionate desires he yearned to meet her only could he love with a perfect love him only could she receive into the depths of her heart and now her image was faintly blushing in the fountain by his side should it pass away its happy lustre would never gleam upon his life again  how sound he sleeps murmured the girl  she departed but did not trip along the road so lightly as when she came  now this girls father was a thriving country merchant in the neighborhood and happened at that identical time to be looking out for just such a young man as david swan had david formed a wayside acquaintance with the daughter he would have become the fathers clerk and all else in natural succession so here again had good fortunethe best of fortunesstolen so near that her garments brushed against him and he knew nothing of the matter  the girl was hardly out of sight when two men turned aside beneath the maple shade both had dark faces set off by cloth caps which were drawn down aslant over their brows their dresses were shabby yet had a certain smartness these were a couple of rascals who got their living by whatever the devil sent them and now in the interim of other business had staked the joint profits of their next piece of villany on a game of cards which was to have been decided here under the trees but finding david asleep by the spring one of the rogues whispered to his fellowhistdo you see that bundle under his head  the other villain nodded winked and leered  ill bet you a horn of brandy said the first that the chap has either a pocketbook or a snug little hoard of small change stowed away amongst his shirts and if not there we shall find it in his pantaloons pocket  but how if he wakes said the other  his companion thrust aside his waistcoat pointed to the handle of a dirk and nodded  so be it muttered the second villain  they approached the unconscious david and while one pointed the dagger towards his heart the other began to search the bundle beneath his head their two faces grim wrinkled and ghastly with guilt and fear bent over their victim looking horrible enough to be mistaken for fiends should he suddenly awake nay had the villains glanced aside into the spring even they would hardly have known themselves as reflected there but david swan had never worn a more tranquil aspect even when asleep on his mothers breast  i must take away the bundle whispered one  if he stirs ill strike muttered the other  but at this moment a dog scenting along the ground came in beneath the mapletrees and gazed alternately at each of these wicked men and then at the quiet sleeper he then lapped out of the fountain  pshaw said one villain we can do nothing now the dogs master must be close behind  lets take a drink and be off said the other  the man with the dagger thrust back the weapon into his bosom and drew forth a pocket pistol but not of that kind which kills by a single discharge it was a flask of liquor with a blocktin tumbler screwed upon the mouth each drank a comfortable dram and left the spot with so many jests and such laughter at their unaccomplished wickedness that they might be said to have gone on their way rejoicing in a few hours they had forgotten the whole affair nor once imagined that the recording angel had written down the crime of murder against their souls in letters as durable as eternity as for david swan he still slept quietly neither conscious of the shadow of death when it hung over him nor of the glow of renewed life when that shadow was withdrawn  he slept but no longer so quietly as at first an hours repose had snatched from his elastic frame the weariness with which many hours of toil had burdened it now he stirrednow moved his lips without a soundnow talked in an inward tone to the noonday spectres of his dream but a noise of wheels came rattling louder and louder along the road until it dashed through the dispersing mist of davids slumberand there was the stagecoach he started up with all his ideas about him  halloo drivertake a passenger shouted he  room on top answered the driver  up mounted david and bowled away merrily towards boston without so much as a parting glance at that fountain of dreamlike vicissitude he knew not that a phantom of wealth had thrown a golden hue upon its watersnor that one of love had sighed softly to their murmurnor that one of death had threatened to crimson them with his bloodall in the brief hour since he lay down to sleep sleeping or waking we hear not the airy footsteps of the strange things that almost happen does it not argue a superintending providence that while viewless and unexpected events thrust themselves continually athwart our path there should still be regularity enough in mortal life to render foresight even partially available     the hollow of the three hills  in those strange old times when fantastic dreams and madmens reveries were realized among the actual circumstances of life two persons met together at an appointed hour and place one was a lady graceful in form and fair of feature though pale and troubled and smitten with an untimely blight in what should have been the fullest bloom of her years the other was an ancient and meanlydressed woman of illfavored aspect and so withered shrunken and decrepit that even the space since she began to decay must have exceeded the ordinary term of human existence in the spot where they encountered no mortal could observe them three little hills stood near each other and down in the midst of them sunk a hollow basin almost mathematically circular two or three hundred feet in breadth and of such depth that a stately cedar might but just be visible above the sides dwarf pines were numerous upon the hills and partly fringed the outer verge of the intermediate hollow within which there was nothing but the brown grass of october and here and there a tree trunk that had fallen long ago and lay mouldering with no green successsor from its roots one of these masses of decaying wood formerly a majestic oak rested close beside a pool of green and sluggish water at the bottom of the basin such scenes as this so gray tradition tells were once the resort of the power of evil and his plighted subjects and here at midnight or on the dim verge of evening they were said to stand round the mantling pool disturbing its putrid waters in the performance of an impious baptismal rite the chill beauty of an autumnal sunset was now gilding the three hilltops whence a paler tint stole down their sides into the hollow  here is our pleasant meeting come to pass said the aged crone according as thou hast desired say quickly what thou wouldst have of me for there is but a short hour that we may tarry here  as the old withered woman spoke a smile glimmered on her countenance like lamplight on the wall of a sepulchre the lady trembled and cast her eyes upward to the verge of the basin as if meditating to return with her purpose unaccomplished but it was not so ordained  i am a stranger in this land as you know said she at length whence i come it matters not but i have left those behind me with whom my fate was intimately bound and from whom i am cut off forever there is a weight in my bosom that i cannot away with and i have come hither to inquire of their welfare  and who is there by this green pool that can bring thee news from the ends of the earth cried the old woman peering into the ladys face not from my lips mayst thou hear these tidings yet be thou bold and the daylight shall not pass away from yonder hilltop before thy wish be granted  i will do your bidding though i die replied the lady desperately  the old woman seated herself on the trunk of the fallen tree threw aside the hood that shrouded her gray locks and beckoned her companion to draw near  kneel down she said and lay your forehead on my knees  she hesitated a moment but the anxiety that had long been kindling burned fiercely up within her as she knelt down the border of her garment was dipped into the pool she laid her forehead on the old womans knees and the latter drew a cloak about the ladys face so that she was in darkness then she heard the muttered words of prayer in the midst of which she started and would have arisen  let me fleelet me flee and hide myself that they may not look upon me she cried but with returning recollection she hushed herself and was still as death  for it seemed as if other voicesfamiliar in infancy and unforgotten through many wanderings and in all the vicissitudes of her heart and fortunewere mingling with the accents of the prayer at first the words were faint and indistinct not rendered so by distance but rather resembling the dim pages of a book which we strive to read by an imperfect and gradually brightening light in such a manner as the prayer proceeded did those voices strengthen upon the ear till at length the petition ended and the conversation of an aged man and of a woman broken and decayed like himself became distinctly audible to the lady as she knelt but those strangers appeared not to stand in the hollow depth between the three hills their voices were encompassed and reechoed by the walls of a chamber the windows of which were rattling in the breeze the regular vibration of a clock the crackling of a fire and the tinkling of the embers as they fell among the ashes rendered the scene almost as vivid as if painted to the eye by a melancholy hearth sat these two old people the man calmly despondent the woman querulous and tearful and their words were all of sorrow they spoke of a daughter a wanderer they knew not where bearing dishonor along with her and leaving shame and affliction to bring their gray heads to the grave they alluded also to other and more recent woe but in the midst of their talk their voices seemed to melt into the sound of the wind sweeping mournfully among the autumn leaves and when the lady lifted her eyes there was she kneeling in the hollow between three hills  a weary and lonesome time yonder old couple have of it remarked the old woman smiling in the ladys face  and did you also hear them exclaimed she a sense of intolerable humiliation triumphing over her agony and fear  yea and we have yet more to hear replied the old woman wherefore cover thy face quickly  again the withered hag poured forth the monotonous words of a prayer that was not meant to be acceptable in heaven and soon in the pauses of her breath strange murmurings began to thicken gradually increasing so as to drown and overpower the charm by which they grew shrieks pierced through the obscurity of sound and were succeeded by the singing of sweet female voices which in their turn gave way to a wild roar of laughter broken suddenly by groanings and sobs forming altogether a ghastly confusion of terror and mourning and mirth chains were rattling fierce and stern voices uttered threats and the scourge resounded at their command all these noises deepened and became substantial to the listeners ear till she could distinguish every soft and dreamy accent of the love songs that died causelessly into funeral hymns she shuddered at the unprovoked wrath which blazed up like the spontaneous kindling of flames and she grew faint at the fearful merriment raging miserably around her in the midst of this wild scene where unbound passions jostled each other in a drunken career there was one solemn voice of a man and a manly and melodious voice it might once have been he went to and fro continually and his feet sounded upon the floor in each member of that frenzied company whose own burning thoughts had become their exclusive world he sought an auditor for the story of his individual wrong and interpreted their laughter and tears as his reward of scorn or pity he spoke of womans perfidy of a wife who had broken her holiest vows of a home and heart made desolate even as he went on the shout the laugh the shriek the sob rose up in unison till they changed into the hollow fitful and uneven sound of the wind as it fought among the pinetrees on those three lonely hills the lady looked up and there was the withered woman smiling in her face  couldst thou have thought there were such merry times in a madhouse inquired the latter  true true said the lady to herself there is mirth within its walls but misery misery without  wouldst thou hear more demanded the old woman  there is one other voice i would fain listen to again replied the lady faintly  then lay down thy head speedily upon my knees that thou mayst get thee hence before the hour be past  the golden skirts of day were yet lingering upon the hills but deep shades obscured the hollow and the pool as if sombre night were rising thence to overspread the world again that evil woman began to weave her spell long did it proceed unanswered till the knolling of a bell stole in among the intervals of her words like a clang that had travelled far over valley and rising ground and was just ready to die in the air the lady shook upon her companions knees as she heard that boding sound stronger it grew and sadder and deepened into the tone of a death bell knolling dolefully from some ivymantled tower and bearing tidings of mortality and woe to the cottage to the hall and to the solitary wayfarer that all might weep for the doom appointed in turn to them then came a measured tread passing slowly slowly on as of mourners with a coffin their garments trailing on the ground so that the ear could measure the length of their melancholy array before them went the priest reading the burial service while the leaves of his book were rustling in the breeze and though no voice but his was heard to speak aloud still there were revilings and anathemas whispered but distinct from women and from men breathed against the daughter who had wrung the aged hearts of her parentsthe wife who had betrayed the trusting fondness of her husbandthe mother who had sinned against natural affection and left her child to die the sweeping sound of the funeral train faded away like a thin vapor and the wind that just before had seemed to shake the coffin pall moaned sadly round the verge of the hollow between three hills but when the old woman stirred the kneeling lady she lifted not her head  here has been a sweet hours sport said the withered crone chuckling to herself     dr heideggers experiment  that very singular man old dr heidegger once invited four venerable friends to meet him in his study there were three whitebearded gentlemen mr medbourne colonel killigrew and mr gascoigne and a withered gentlewoman whose name was the widow wycherly they were all melancholy old creatures who had been unfortunate in life and whose greatest misfortune it was that they were not long ago in their graves mr medbourne in the vigor of his age had been a prosperous merchant but had lost his all by a frantic speculation and was now little better than a mendicant colonel killigrew had wasted his best years and his health and substance in the pursuit of sinful pleasures which had given birth to a brood of pains such as the gout and divers other torments of soul and body mr gascoigne was a ruined politician a man of evil fame or at least had been so till time had buried him from the knowledge of the present generation and made him obscure instead of infamous as for the widow wycherly tradition tells us that she was a great beauty in her day but for a long while past she had lived in deep seclusion on account of certain scandalous stories which had prejudiced the gentry of the town against her it is a circumstance worth mentioning that each of these three old gentlemen mr medbourne colonel killigrew and mr gascoigne were early lovers of the widow wycherly and had once been on the point of cutting each others throats for her sake and before proceeding further i will merely hint that dr heidegger and all his foul guests were sometimes thought to be a little beside themselvesas is not unfrequently the case with old people when worried either by present troubles or woful recollections  my dear old friends said dr heidegger motioning them to be seated i am desirous of your assistance in one of those little experiments with which i amuse myself here in my study  if all stories were true dr heideggers study must have been a very curious place it was a dim oldfashioned chamber festooned with cobwebs and besprinkled with antique dust around the walls stood several oaken bookcases the lower shelves of which were filled with rows of gigantic folios and blackletter quartos and the upper with little parchmentcovered duodecimos over the central bookcase was a bronze bust of hippocrates with which according to some authorities dr heidegger was accustomed to hold consultations in all difficult cases of his practice in the obscurest corner of the room stood a tall and narrow oaken closet with its door ajar within which doubtfully appeared a skeleton between two of the bookcases hung a lookingglass presenting its high and dusty plate within a tarnished gilt frame among many wonderful stories related of this mirror it was fabled that the spirits of all the doctors deceased patients dwelt within its verge and would stare him in the face whenever he looked thitherward the opposite side of the chamber was ornamented with the fulllength portrait of a young lady arrayed in the faded magnificence of silk satin and brocade and with a visage as faded as her dress above half a century ago dr heidegger had been on the point of marriage with this young lady but being affected with some slight disorder she had swallowed one of her lovers prescriptions and died on the bridal evening the greatest curiosity of the study remains to be mentioned it was a ponderous folio volume bound in black leather with massive silver clasps there were no letters on the back and nobody could tell the title of the book but it was well known to be a book of magic and once when a chambermaid had lifted it merely to brush away the dust the skeleton had rattled in its closet the picture of the young lady had stepped one foot upon the floor and several ghastly faces had peeped forth from the mirror while the brazen head of hippocrates frowned and saidforbear  such was dr heideggers study on the summer afternoon of our tale a small round table as black as ebony stood in the centre of the room sustaining a cutglass vase of beautiful form and elaborate workmanship the sunshine came through the window between the heavy festoons of two faded damask curtains and fell directly across this vase so that a mild splendor was reflected from it on the ashen visages of the five old people who sat around four champagne glasses were also on the table  my dear old friends repeated dr heidegger may i reckon on your aid in performing an exceedingly curious experiment  now dr heidegger was a very strange old gentleman whose eccentricity had become the nucleus for a thousand fantastic stories some of these fables to my shame be it spoken might possibly be traced back to my own veracious self and if any passages of the present tale should startle the readers faith i must be content to bear the stigma of a fiction monger  when the doctors four guests heard him talk of his proposed experiment they anticipated nothing more wonderful than the murder of a mouse in an air pump or the examination of a cobweb by the microscope or some similar nonsense with which he was constantly in the habit of pestering his intimates but without waiting for a reply dr heidegger hobbled across the chamber and returned with the same ponderous folio bound in black leather which common report affirmed to be a book of magic undoing the silver clasps he opened the volume and took from among its blackletter pages a rose or what was once a rose though now the green leaves and crimson petals had assumed one brownish hue and the ancient flower seemed ready to crumble to dust in the doctors hands  this rose said dr heidegger with a sigh this same withered and crumbling flower blossomed five and fifty years ago it was given me by sylvia ward whose portrait hangs yonder and i meant to wear it in my bosom at our wedding five and fifty years it has been treasured between the leaves of this old volume now would you deem it possible that this rose of half a century could ever bloom again  nonsense said the widow wycherly with a peevish toss of her head you might as well ask whether an old womans wrinkled face could ever bloom again  see answered dr heidegger  he uncovered the vase and threw the faded rose into the water which it contained at first it lay lightly on the surface of the fluid appearing to imbibe none of its moisture soon however a singular change began to be visible the crushed and dried petals stirred and assumed a deepening tinge of crimson as if the flower were reviving from a deathlike slumber the slender stalk and twigs of foliage became green and there was the rose of half a century looking as fresh as when sylvia ward had first given it to her lover it was scarcely full blown for some of its delicate red leaves curled modestly around its moist bosom within which two or three dewdrops were sparkling  that is certainly a very pretty deception said the doctors friends carelessly however for they had witnessed greater miracles at a conjurers show pray how was it effected  did you never hear of the fountain of youth  asked dr heidegger which ponce de leon the spanish adventurer went in search of two or three centuries ago  but did ponce de leon ever find it said the widow wycherly  no answered dr heidegger for he never sought it in the right place the famous fountain of youth if i am rightly informed is situated in the southern part of the floridian peninsula not far from lake macaco its source is overshadowed by several gigantic magnolias which though numberless centuries old have been kept as fresh as violets by the virtues of this wonderful water an acquaintance of mine knowing my curiosity in such matters has sent me what you see in the vase  ahem said colonel killigrew who believed not a word of the doctors story and what may be the effect of this fluid on the human frame  you shall judge for yourself my dear colonel replied dr heidegger and all of you my respected friends are welcome to so much of this admirable fluid as may restore to you the bloom of youth for my own part having had much trouble in growing old i am in no hurry to grow young again with your permission therefore i will merely watch the progress of the experiment  while he spoke dr heidegger had been filling the four champagne glasses with the water of the fountain of youth it was apparently impregnated with an effervescent gas for little bubbles were continually ascending from the depths of the glasses and bursting in silvery spray at the surface as the liquor diffused a pleasant perfume the old people doubted not that it possessed cordial and comfortable properties and though utter sceptics as to its rejuvenescent power they were inclined to swallow it at once but dr heidegger besought them to stay a moment  before you drink my respectable old friends said he it would be well that with the experience of a lifetime to direct you you should draw up a few general rules for your guidance in passing a second time through the perils of youth think what a sin and shame it would be if with your peculiar advantages you should not become patterns of virtue and wisdom to all the young people of the age  the doctors four venerable friends made him no answer except by a feeble and tremulous laugh so very ridiculous was the idea that knowing how closely repentance treads behind the steps of error they should ever go astray again  drink then said the doctor bowing i rejoice that i have so well selected the subjects of my experiment  with palsied hands they raised the glasses to their lips the liquor if it really possessed such virtues as dr heidegger imputed to it could not have been bestowed on four human beings who needed it more wofully they looked as if they had never known what youth or pleasure was but had been the offspring of natures dotage and always the gray decrepit sapless miserable creatures who now sat stooping round the doctors table without life enough in their souls or bodies to be animated even by the prospect of growing young again they drank off the water and replaced their glasses on the table  assuredly there was an almost immediate improvement in the aspect of the party not unlike what might have been produced by a glass of generous wine together with a sudden glow of cheerful sunshine brightening over all their visages at once there was a healthful suffusion on their cheeks instead of the ashen hue that had made them look so corpselike they gazed at one another and fancied that some magic power had really begun to smooth away the deep and sad inscriptions which father time had been so long engraving on their brows the widow wycherly adjusted her cap for she felt almost like a woman again  give us more of this wondrous water cried they eagerly we are youngerbut we are still too old quickgive us more  patience patience quoth dr heidegger who sat watching the experiment with philosophic coolness you have been a long time growing old surely you might be content to grow young in half an hour but the water is at your service  again he filled their glasses with the liquor of youth enough of which still remained in the vase to turn half the old people in the city to the age of their own grandchildren while the bubbles were yet sparkling on the brim the doctors four guests snatched their glasses from the table and swallowed the contents at a single gulp was it delusion even while the draught was passing down their throats it seemed to have wrought a change on their whole systems their eyes grew clear and bright a dark shade deepened among their silvery locks they sat around the table three gentlemen of middle age and a woman hardly beyond her buxom prime  my dear widow you are charming cried colonel killigrew whose eyes had been fixed upon her face while the shadows of age were flitting from it like darkness from the crimson daybreak  the fair widow knew of old that colonel killigrews compliments were not always measured by sober truth so she started up and ran to the mirror still dreading that the ugly visage of an old woman would meet her gaze meanwhile the three gentlemen behaved in such a manner as proved that the water of the fountain of youth possessed some intoxicating qualities unless indeed their exhilaration of spirits were merely a lightsome dizziness caused by the sudden removal of the weight of years mr gascoignes mind seemed to run on political topics but whether relating to the past present or future could not easily be determined since the same ideas and phrases have been in vogue these fifty years now he rattled forth fullthroated sentences about patriotism national glory and the peoples right now he muttered some perilous stuff or other in a sly and doubtful whisper so cautiously that even his own conscience could scarcely catch the secret and now again he spoke in measured accents and a deeply deferential tone as if a royal ear were listening to his wellturned periods colonel killigrew all this time had been trolling forth a jolly bottle song and ringing his glass in symphony with the chorus while his eyes wandered toward the buxom figure of the widow wycherly on the other side of the table mr medbourne was involved in a calculation of dollars and cents with which was strangely intermingled a project for supplying the east indies with ice by harnessing a team of whales to the polar icebergs  as for the widow wycherly she stood before the mirror courtesying and simpering to her own image and greeting it as the friend whom she loved better than all the world beside she thrust her face close to the glass to see whether some longremembered wrinkle or crows foot had indeed vanished she examined whether the snow had so entirely melted from her hair that the venerable cap could be safely thrown aside at last turning briskly away she came with a sort of dancing step to the table  my dear old doctor cried she pray favor me with another glass  certainly my dear madam certainly replied the complaisant doctor see i have already filled the glasses  there in fact stood the four glasses brimful of this wonderful water the delicate spray of which as it effervesced from the surface resembled the tremulous glitter of diamonds it was now so nearly sunset that the chamber had grown duskier than ever but a mild and moonlike splendor gleamed from within the vase and rested alike on the four guests and on the doctors venerable figure he sat in a highbacked elaboratelycarved oaken armchair with a gray dignity of aspect that might have well befitted that very father time whose power had never been disputed save by this fortunate company even while quaffing the third draught of the fountain of youth they were almost awed by the expression of his mysterious visage  but the next moment the exhilarating gush of young life shot through their veins they were now in the happy prime of youth age with its miserable train of cares and sorrows and diseases was remembered only as the trouble of a dream from which they had joyously awoke the fresh gloss of the soul so early lost and without which the worlds successive scenes had been but a gallery of faded pictures again threw its enchantment over all their prospects they felt like newcreated beings in a newcreated universe   we are young we are young they cried exultingly  youth like the extremity of age had effaced the stronglymarked characteristics of middle life and mutually assimilated them all they were a group of merry youngsters almost maddened with the exuberant frolicsomeness of their years the most singular effect of their gayety was an impulse to mock the infirmity and decrepitude of which they had so lately been the victims they laughed loudly at their oldfashioned attire the wideskirted coats and flapped waistcoats of the young men and the ancient cap and gown of the blooming girl one limped across the floor like a gouty grandfather one set a pair of spectacles astride of his nose and pretended to pore over the blackletter pages of the book of magic a third seated himself in an armchair and strove to imitate the venerable dignity of dr heidegger then all shouted mirthfully and leaped about the room the widow wycherlyif so fresh a damsel could be called a widowtripped up to the doctors chair with a mischievous merriment in her rosy face  doctor you dear old soul cried she get up and dance with me and then the four young people laughed louder than ever to think what a queer figure the poor old doctor would cut  pray excuse me answered the doctor quietly i am old and rheumatic and my dancing days were over long ago but either of these gay young gentlemen will be glad of so pretty a partner  dance with me clara cried colonel killigrew  no no i will be her partner shouted mr gascoigne  she promised me her hand fifty years ago exclaimed mr medbourne  they all gathered round her one caught both her hands in his passionate grasp another threw his arm about her waistthe third buried his hand among the glossy curls that clustered beneath the widows cap blushing panting struggling chiding laughing her warm breath fanning each of their faces by turns she strove to disengage herself yet still remained in their triple embrace never was there a livelier picture of youthful rivalship with bewitching beauty for the prize yet by a strange deception owing to the duskiness of the chamber and the antique dresses which they still wore the tall mirror is said to have reflected the figures of the three old gray withered grandsires ridiculously contending for the skinny ugliness of a shrivelled grandam  but they were young their burning passions proved them so inflamed to madness by the coquetry of the girlwidow who neither granted nor quite withheld her favors the three rivals began to interchange threatening glances still keeping hold of the fair prize they grappled fiercely at one anothers throats as they struggled to and fro the table was overturned and the vase dashed into a thousand fragments the precious water of youth flowed in a bright stream across the floor moistening the wings of a butterfly which grown old in the decline of summer had alighted there to die the insect fluttered lightly through the chamber and settled on the snowy head of dr heidegger  come come gentlemencome madam wycherly exclaimed the doctor i really must protest against this riot  they stood still and shivered for it seemed as if gray time were calling them back from their sunny youth far down into the chill and darksome vale of years they looked at old dr heidegger who sat in his carved armchair holding the rose of half a century which he had rescued from among the fragments of the shattered vase at the motion of his hand the four rioters resumed their seats the more readily because their violent exertions had wearied them youthful though they were  my poor sylvias rose ejaculated dr heidegger holding it in the light of the sunset clouds it appears to be fading again  and so it was even while the party were looking at it the flower continued to shrivel up till it became as dry and fragile as when the doctor had first thrown it into the vase he shook off the few drops of moisture which clung to its petals  i love it as well thus as in its dewy freshness observed he pressing the withered rose to his withered lips while he spoke the butterfly fluttered down from the doctors snowy head and fell upon the floor  his guests shivered again a strange chillness whether of the body or spirit they could not tell was creeping gradually over them all they gazed at one another and fancied that each fleeting moment snatched away a charm and left a deepening furrow where none had been before was it an illusion had the changes of a lifetime been crowded into so brief a space and were they now four aged people sitting with their old friend dr heidegger  are we grown old again so soon cried they dolefully  in truth they had the water of youth possessed merely a virtue more transient than that of wine the delirium which it created had effervesced away yes they were old again with a shuddering impulse that showed her a woman still the widow clasped her skinny hands before her face and wished that the coffin lid were over it since it could be no longer beautiful  yes friends ye are old again said dr heidegger and lo the water of youth is all lavished on the ground welli bemoan it not for if the fountain gushed at my very doorstep i would not stoop to bathe my lips in itno though its delirium were for years instead of moments such is the lesson ye have taught me  but the doctors four friends had taught no such lesson to themselves they resolved forthwith to make a pilgrimage to florida and quaff at morning noon and night from the fountain of youth     legends of the province house  i  howes masquerade  one afternoon last summer while walking along washington street my eye was attracted by a signboard protruding over a narrow archway nearly opposite the old south church the sign represented the front of a stately edifice which was designated as the old province house kept by thomas waite i was glad to be thus reminded of a purpose long entertained of visiting and rambling over the mansion of the old royal governors of massachusetts and entering the arched passage which penetrated through the middle of a brick row of shops a few steps transported me from the busy heart of modern boston into a small and secluded courtyard one side of this space was occupied by the square front of the province house three stories high and surmounted by a cupola on the top of which a gilded indian was discernible with his bow bent and his arrow on the string as if aiming at the weathercock on the spire of the old south the figure has kept this attitude for seventy years or more ever since good deacon drowne a cunning carver of wood first stationed him on his long sentinels watch over the city  the province house is constructed of brick which seems recently to have been overlaid with a coat of lightcolored paint a flight of red freestone steps fenced in by a balustrade of curiously wrought iron ascends from the courtyard to the spacious porch over which is a balcony with an iron balustrade of similar pattern and workmanship to that beneath these letters and figures16 ps 79are wrought into the iron work of the balcony and probably express the date of the edifice with the initials of its founders name a wide door with double leaves admitted me into the hall or entry on the right of which is the entrance to the barroom  it was in this apartment i presume that the ancient governors held their levees with viceregal pomp surrounded by the military men the councillors the judges and other officers of the crown while all the loyalty of the province thronged to do them honor but the room in its present condition cannot boast even of faded magnificence the panelled wainscot is covered with dingy paint and acquires a duskier hue from the deep shadow into which the province house is thrown by the brick block that shuts it in from washington street a ray of sunshine never visits this apartment any more than the glare of the festal torches which have been extinguished from the era of the revolution the most venerable and ornamental object is a chimneypiece set round with dutch tiles of bluefigured china representing scenes from scripture and for aught i know the lady of pownall or bernard may have sat beside this fireplace and told her children the story of each blue tile a bar in modern style well replenished with decanters bottles cigar boxes and network bags of lemons and provided with a beer pump and a soda fount extends along one side of the room at my entrance an elderly person was smacking his lips with a zest which satisfied me that the cellars of the province house still hold good liquor though doubtless of other vintages than were quaffed by the old governors after sipping a glass of port sangaree prepared by the skilful hands of mr thomas waite i besought that worthy successor and representative of so many historic personages to conduct me over their time honored mansion  he readily complied but to confess the truth i was forced to draw strenuously upon my imagination in order to find aught that was interesting in a house which without its historic associations would have seemed merely such a tavern as is usually favored by the custom of decent city boarders and oldfashioned country gentlemen the chambers which were probably spacious in former times are now cut up by partitions and subdivided into little nooks each affording scanty room for the narrow bed and chair and dressingtable of a single lodger the great staircase however may be termed without much hyperbole a feature of grandeur and magnificence it winds through the midst of the house by flights of broad steps each flight terminating in a square landingplace whence the ascent is continued towards the cupola a carved balustrade freshly painted in the lower stories but growing dingier as we ascend borders the staircase with its quaintly twisted and intertwined pillars from top to bottom up these stairs the military boots or perchance the gouty shoes of many a governor have trodden as the wearers mounted to the cupola which afforded them so wide a view over their metropolis and the surrounding country the cupola is an octagon with several windows and a door opening upon the roof from this station as i pleased myself with imagining gage may have beheld his disastrous victory on bunker hill unless one of the trimountains intervened and howe have marked the approaches of washingtons besieging army although the buildings since erected in the vicinity have shut out almost every object save the steeple of the old south which seems almost within arms length descending from the cupola i paused in the garret to observe the ponderous whiteoak framework so much more massive than the frames of modern houses and thereby resembling an antique skeleton the brick walls the materials of which were imported from holland and the timbers of the mansion are still as sound as ever but the floors and other interior parts being greatly decayed it is contemplated to gut the whole and build a new house within the ancient frame and brick work among other inconveniences of the present edifice mine host mentioned that any jar or motion was apt to shake down the dust of ages out of the ceiling of one chamber upon the floor of that beneath it  we stepped forth from the great front window into the balcony where in old times it was doubtless the custom of the kings representative to show himself to a loyal populace requiting their huzzas and tossedup hats with stately bendings of his dignified person in those days the front of the province house looked upon the street and the whole site now occupied by the brick range of stores as well as the present courtyard was laid out in grass plats overshadowed by trees and bordered by a wroughtiron fence now the old aristocratic edifice hides its timeworn visage behind an upstart modern building at one of the back windows i observed some pretty tailoresses sewing and chatting and laughing with now and then a careless glance towards the balcony descending thence we again entered the barroom where the elderly gentleman above mentioned the smack of whose lips had spoken so favorably for mr waites good liquor was still lounging in his chair he seemed to be if not a lodger at least a familiar visitor of the house who might be supposed to have his regular score at the bar his summer seat at the open window and his prescriptive corner at the winters fireside being of a sociable aspect i ventured to address him with a remark calculated to draw forth his historical reminiscences if any such were in his mind and it gratified me to discover that between memory and tradition the old gentleman was really possessed of some very pleasant gossip about the province house the portion of his talk which chiefly interested me was the outline of the following legend he professed to have received it at one or two removes from an eyewitness but this derivation together with the lapse of time must have afforded opportunities for many variations of the narrative so that despairing of literal and absolute truth i have not scrupled to make such further changes as seemed conducive to the readers profit and delight  at one of the entertainments given at the province house during the latter part of the siege of boston there passed a scene which has never yet been satisfactorily explained the officers of the british army and the loyal gentry of the province most of whom were collected within the beleaguered town had been invited to a masked ball for it was the policy of sir william howe to hide the distress and danger of the period and the desperate aspect of the siege under an ostentation of festivity the spectacle of this evening if the oldest members of the provincial court circle might be believed was the most gay and gorgeous affair that had occurred in the annals of the government the brilliantlylighted apartments were thronged with figures that seemed to have stepped from the dark canvas of historic portraits or to have flitted forth from the magic pages of romance or at least to have flown hither from one of the london theatres without a change of garments steeled knights of the conquest bearded statesmen of queen elizabeth and highruffled ladies of her court were mingled with characters of comedy such as a partycolored merry andrew jingling his cap and bells a falstaff almost as provocative of laughter as his prototype and a don quixote with a bean pole for a lance and a pot lid for a shield  but the broadest merriment was excited by a group of figures ridiculously dressed in old regimentals which seemed to have been purchased at a military rag fair or pilfered from some receptacle of the castoff clothes of both the french and british armies portions of their attire had probably been worn at the siege of louisburg and the coats of most recent cut might have been rent and tattered by sword ball or bayonet as long ago as wolfes victory one of these worthiesa tall lank figure brandishing a rusty sword of immense longitudepurported to be no less a personage than general george washington and the other principal officers of the american army such as gates lee putnam schuyler ward and heath were represented by similar scarecrows an interview in the mock heroic style between the rebel warriors and the british commanderinchief was received with immense applause which came loudest of all from the loyalists of the colony there was one of the guests however who stood apart eyeing these antics sternly and scornfully at once with a frown and a bitter smile  it was an old man formerly of high station and great repute in the province and who had been a very famous soldier in his day some surprise had been expressed that a person of colonel joliffes known whig principles though now too old to take an active part in the contest should have remained in boston during the siege and especially that he should consent to show himself in the mansion of sir william howe but thither he had come with a fair granddaughter under his arm and there amid all the mirth and buffoonery stood this stern old figure the best sustained character in the masquerade because so well representing the antique spirit of his native land the other guests affirmed that colonel joliffes black puritanical scowl threw a shadow round about him although in spite of his sombre influence their gayety continued to blaze higher likean ominous comparisonthe flickering brilliancy of a lamp which has but a little while to burn eleven strokes full half an hour ago had pealed from the clock of the old south when a rumor was circulated among the company that some new spectacle or pageant was about to be exhibited which should put a fitting close to the splendid festivities of the night  what new jest has your excellency in hand asked the rev mather byles whose presbyterian scruples had not kept him from the entertainment trust me sir i have already laughed more than beseems my cloth at your homeric confabulation with yonder ragamuffin general of the rebels one other such fit of merriment and i must throw off my clerical wig and band  not so good doctor byles answered sir william howe if mirth were a crime you had never gained your doctorate in divinity as to this new foolery i know no more about it than yourself perhaps not so much honestly now doctor have you not stirred up the sober brains of some of your countrymen to enact a scene in our masquerade  perhaps slyly remarked the granddaughter of colonel joliffe whose high spirit had been stung by many taunts against new englandperhaps we are to have a mask of allegorical figures victory with trophies from lexington and bunker hillplenty with her overflowing horn to typify the present abundance in this good townand glory with a wreath for his excellencys brow  sir william howe smiled at words which he would have answered with one of his darkest frowns had they been uttered by lips that wore a beard he was spared the necessity of a retort by a singular interruption a sound of music was heard without the house as if proceeding from a full band of military instruments stationed in the street playing not such a festal strain as was suited to the occasion but a slow funeral march the drums appeared to be muffled and the trumpets poured forth a wailing breath which at once hushed the merriment of the auditors filling all with wonder and some with apprehension the idea occurred to many that either the funeral procession of some great personage had halted in front of the province house or that a corpse in a velvetcovered and gorgeouslydecorated coffin was about to be borne from the portal after listening a moment sir william howe called in a stern voice to the leader of the musicians who had hitherto enlivened the entertainment with gay and lightsome melodies the man was drummajor to one of the british regiments  dighton demanded the general what means this foolery bid your band silence that dead marchor by my word they shall have sufficient cause for their lugubrious strains silence it sirrah  please your honor answered the drummajor whose rubicund visage had lost all its color the fault is none of mine i and my band are all here together and i question whether there be a man of us that could play that march without book i never heard it but once before and that was at the funeral of his late majesty king george the second  well well said sir william howe recovering his composureit is the prelude to some masquerading antic let it pass  a figure now presented itself but among the many fantastic masks that were dispersed through the apartments none could tell precisely from whence it came it was a man in an oldfashioned dress of black serge and having the aspect of a steward or principal domestic in the household of a nobleman or great english landholder this figure advanced to the outer door of the mansion and throwing both its leaves wide open withdrew a little to one side and looked back towards the grand staircase as if expecting some person to descend at the same time the music in the street sounded a loud and doleful summons the eyes of sir william howe and his guests being directed to the staircase there appeared on the uppermost landingplace that was discernible from the bottom several personages descending towards the door the foremost was a man of stern visage wearing a steeplecrowned hat and a skullcap beneath it a dark cloak and huge wrinkled boots that came halfway up his legs under his arm was a rolledup banner which seemed to be the banner of england but strangely rent and torn he had a sword in his right hand and grasped a bible in his left the next figure was of milder aspect yet full of dignity wearing a broad ruff over which descended a beard a gown of wrought velvet and a doublet and hose of black satin he carried a roll of manuscript in his hand close behind these two came a young man of very striking countenance and demeanor with deep thought and contemplation on his brow and perhaps a flash of enthusiiasm in his eye his garb like that of his predecessors was of an antique fashion and there was a stain of blood upon his ruff in the same group with these were three or four others all men of dignity and evident command and bearing themselves like personages who were accustomed to the gaze of the multitude it was the idea of the beholders that these figures went to join the mysterious funeral that had halted in front of the province house yet that supposition seemed to be contradicted by the air of triumph with which they waved their hands as they crossed the threshold and vanished through the portal  in the devils name what is this muttered sir william howe to a gentleman beside him a procession of the regicide judges of king charles the martyr  these said colonel joliffe breaking silence almost for the first time that eveningthese if i interpret them aright are the puritan governorsthe rulers of the old original democracy of massachusetts endicott with the banner from which he had torn the symbol of subjection and winthrop and sir henry vane and dudley haynes bellingham and leverett  why had that young man a stain of blood upon his ruff asked miss joliffe  because in after years answered her grandfather he laid down the wisest head in england upon the block for the principles of liberty  will not your excellency order out the guard whispered lord percy who with other british officers had now assembled round the general there may be a plot under this mummery  tush we have nothing to fear carelessly replied sir william howe there can be no worse treason in the matter than a jest and that somewhat of the dullest even were it a sharp and bitter one our best policy would be to laugh it off seehere come more of these gentry  another group of characters had now partly descended the staircase the first was a venerable and whitebearded patriarch who cautiously felt his way downward with a staff treading hastily behind him and stretching forth his gauntleted hand as if to grasp the old mans shoulder came a tall soldierlike figure equipped with a plumed cap of steel a bright breastplate and a long sword which rattled against the stairs next was seen a stout man dressed in rich and courtly attire but not of courtly demeanor his gait had the swinging motion of a seamans walk and chancing to stumble on the staircase he suddenly grew wrathful and was heard to mutter an oath he was followed by a noblelooking personage in a curled wig such as are represented in the portraits of queen annes time and earlier and the breast of his coat was decorated with an embroidered star while advancing to the door he bowed to the right hand and to the left in a very gracious and insinuating style but as he crossed the threshold unlike the early puritan governors he seemed to wring his hands with sorrow  prithee play the part of a chorus good doctor byles said sir william howe what worthies are these  if it please your excellency they lived somewhat before my day answered the doctor but doubtless our friend the colonel has been hand and glove with them  their living faces i never looked upon said colonel joliffe gravely although i have spoken face to face with many rulers of this land and shall greet yet another with an old mans blessing ere i die but we talk of these figures i take the venerable patriarch to be bradstreet the last of the puritans who was governor at ninety or thereabouts the next is sir edmund andros a tyrant as any new england schoolboy will tell you and therefore the people cast him down from his high seat into a dungeon then comes sir william phipps shepherd cooper seacaptain and governormay many of his countrymen rise as high from as low an origin lastly you saw the gracious earl of bellamont who ruled us under king william  but what is the meaning of it all asked lord percy  now were i a rebel said miss joliffe half aloud i might fancy that the ghosts of these ancient governors had been summoned to form the funeral procession of royal authority in new england  several other figures were now seen at the turn of the staircase the one in advance had a thoughtful anxious and somewhat crafty expression of face and in spite of his loftiness of manner which was evidently the result both of an ambitious spirit and of long continuance in high stations he seemed not incapable of cringing to a greater than himself a few steps behind came an officer in a scarlet and embroidered uniform cut in a fashion old enough to have been worn by the duke of marlborough his nose had a rubicund tinge which together with the twinkle of his eye might have marked him as a lover of the wine cup and good fellowship notwithstanding which tokens he appeared ill at ease and often glanced around him as if apprehensive of some secret mischief next came a portly gentleman wearing a coat of shaggy cloth lined with silken velvet he had sense shrewdness and humor in his face and a folio volume under his arm but his aspect was that of a man vexed and tormented beyond all patience and harassed almost to death he went hastily down and was followed by a dignified person dressed in a purple velvet suit with very rich embroidery his demeanor would have possessed much stateliness only that a grievous fit of the gout compelled him to hobble from stair to stair with contortions of face and body when dr byles beheld this figure on the staircase he shivered as with an ague but continued to watch him steadfastly until the gouty gentleman had reached the threshold made a gesture of anguish and despair and vanished into the outer gloom whither the funeral music summoned him  governor belchermy old patronin his very shape and dress gasped doctor byles this is an awful mockery  a tedious foolery rather said sir william howe with an air of indifference but who were the three that preceded him  governor dudley a cunning politicianyet his craft once brought him to a prison replied colonel joliffe governor shute formerly a colonel under marlborough and whom the people frightened out of the province and learned governor burnet whom the legislature tormented into a mortal fever  methinks they were miserable men these royal governors of massachusetts observed miss joliffe heavens how dim the light grows  it was certainly a fact that the large lamp which illuminated the staircase now burned dim and duskily so that several figures which passed hastily down the stairs and went forth from the porch appeared rather like shadows than persons of fleshly substance sir william howe and his guests stood at the doors of the contiguous apartments watching the progress of this singular pageant with various emotions of anger contempt or halfacknowledged fear but still with an anxious curiosity the shapes which now seemed hastening to join the mysterious procession were recognized rather by striking peculiarities of dress or broad characteristics of manner than by any perceptible resemblance of features to their prototypes their faces indeed were invariably kept in deep shadow but doctor byles and other gentlemen who had long been familiar with the successive rulers of the province were heard to whisper the names of shirley of pownall of sir francis bernard and of the wellremembered hutchinson thereby confessing that the actors whoever they might be in this spectral march of governors had succeeded in putting on some distant portraiture of the real personages as they vanished from the door still did these shadows toss their arms into the gloom of night with a dread expression of woe following the mimic representative of hutchinson came a military figure holding before his face the cocked hat which he had taken from his powdered head but his epaulettes and other insignia of rank were those of a general officer and something in his mien reminded the beholders of one who had recently been master of the province house and chief of all the land  the shape of gage as true as in a lookingglass exclaimed lord percy turning pale  no surely cried miss joliffe laughing hysterically it could not be gage or sir william would have greeted his old comrade in arms perhaps he will not suffer the next to pass unchallenged  of that be assured young lady answered sir william howe fixing his eyes with a very marked expression upon the immovable visage of her grandfather i have long enough delayed to pay the ceremonies of a host to these departing guests the next that takes his leave shall receive due courtesy  a wild and dreary burst of music came through the open door it seemed as if the procession which had been gradually filling up its ranks were now about to move and that this loud peal of the wailing trumpets and roll of the muffled drums were a call to some loiterer to make haste many eyes by an irresistible impulse were turned upon sir william howe as if it were he whom the dreary music summoned to the funeral or departed power  seehere comes the last whispered miss joliffe pointing her tremulous finger to the staircase  a figure had come into view as if descending the stairs although so dusky was the region whence it emerged some of the spectators fancied that they had seen this human shape suddenly moulding itself amid the gloom downward the figure came with a stately and martial tread and reaching the lowest stair was observed to be a tall man booted and wrapped in a military cloak which was drawn up around the face so as to meet the flapped brim of a laced hat the features therefore were completely hidden but the british officers deemed that they had seen that military cloak before and even recognized the frayed embroidery on the collar as well as the gilded scabbard of a sword which protruded from the folds of the cloak and glittered in a vivid gleam of light apart from these trifling particulars there were characteristics of gait and bearing which impelled the wondering guests to glance from the shrouded figure to sir william howe as if to satisfy themselves that their host had not suddenly vanished from the midst of them  with a dark flush of wrath upon his brow they saw the general draw his sword and advance to meet the figure in the cloak before the latter had stepped one pace upon the floor  villain unmuffle yourself cried he you pass no farther  the figure without blenching a hairs breadth from the sword which was pointed at his breast made a solemn pause and lowered the cape of the cloak from about his face yet not sufficiently for the spectators to catch a glimpse of it but sir william howe had evidently seen enough the sternness of his countenance gave place to a look of wild amazement if not horror while he recoiled several steps from the figure and let fall his sword upon the floor the martial shape again drew the cloak about his features and passed on but reaching the threshold with his back towards the spectators he was seen to stamp his foot and shake his clinched hands in the air it was afterwards affirmed that sir william howe had repeated that selfsame gesture of rage and sorrow when for the last time and as the last royal governor he passed through the portal of the province house  harkthe procession moves said miss joliffe  the music was dying away along the street and its dismal strains were mingled with the knell of midnight from the steeple of the old south and with the roar of artillery which announced that the beleaguering army of washington had intrenched itself upon a nearer height than before as the deep boom of the cannon smote upon his ear colonel joliffe raised himself to the full height of his aged form and smiled sternly on the british general  would your excellency inquire further into the mystery of the pageant said he  take care of your gray head cried sir william howe fiercely though with a quivering lip it has stood too long on a traitors shoulders  you must make haste to chop it off then calmly replied the colonel for a few hours longer and not all the power of sir william howe nor of his master shall cause one of these gray hairs to fall the empire of britain in this ancient province is at its last gasp tonightalmost while i speak it is a dead corpseand methinks the shadows of the old governors are fit mourners at its funeral  with these words colonel joliffe threw on his cloak and drawing his granddaughters arm within his own retired from the last festival that a british ruler ever held in the old province of massachusetts bay it was supposed that the colonel and the young lady possessed some secret intelligence in regard to the mysterious pageant of that night however this might be such knowledge has never become general the actors in the scene have vanished into deeper obscurity than even that wild indian band who scattered the cargoes of the tea ships on the waves and gained a place in history yet left no names but superstition among other legends of this mansion repeats the wondrous tale that on the anniversary night of britains discomfiture the ghosts of the ancient governors of massachusetts still glide through the portal of the province house and last of all comes a figure shrouded in a military cloak tossing his clinched hands into the air and stamping his ironshod boots upon the broad freestone steps with a semblance of feverish despair but without the sound of a foottramp   when the truthtelling accents of the elderly gentleman were hushed i drew a long breath and looked round the room striving with the best energy of my imagination to throw a tinge of romance and historic grandeur over the realities of the scene but my nostrils snuffed up a scent of cigar smoke clouds of which the narrator had emitted by way of visible emblem i suppose of the nebulous obscurity of his tale moreover my gorgeous fantasies were wofully disturbed by the rattling of the spoon in a tumbler of whiskey punch which mr thomas waite was mingling for a customer nor did it add to the picturesque appearance of the panelled walls that the slate of the brookline stage was suspended against them instead of the armorial escutcheon of some fardescended governor a stagedriver sat at one of the windows reading a penny paper of the day the boston timesand presenting a figure which could nowise be brought into any picture of times in boston seventy or a hundred years ago on the window seat lay a bundle neatly done up in brown paper the direction of which i had the idle curiosity to read miss susan huggins at the province house a pretty chambermaid no doubt in truth it is desperately hard work when we attempt to throw the spell of hoar antiquity over localities with which the living world and the day that is passing over us have aught to do yet as i glanced at the stately staircase down which the procession of the old governors had descended and as i emerged through the venerable portal whence their figures had preceded me it gladdened me to be conscious of a thrill of awe then diving through the narrow archway a few strides transported me into the densest throng of washington street     legends of the province house  ii  edward randolphs portrait  the old legendary guest of the province house abode in my remembrance from midsummer till january one idle evening last winter confident that he would be found in the snuggest corner of the barroom i resolved to pay him another visit hoping to deserve well of my country by snatching from oblivion some else unheardof fact of history the night was chill and raw and rendered boisterous by almost a gale of wind which whistled along washington street causing the gaslights to flare and flicker within the lamps as i hurried onward my fancy was busy with a comparison between the present aspect of the street and that which it probably wore when the british governors inhabited the mansion whither i was now going brick edifices in those times were few till a succession of destructive fires had swept and swept again the wooden dwellings and warehouses from the most populous quarters of the town the buildings stood insulated and independent not as now merging their separate existences into connected ranges with a front of tiresome identitybut each possessing features of its own as if the owners individual taste had shaped itand the whole presenting a picturesque irregularity the absence of which is hardly compensated by any beauties of our modern architecture such a scene dimly vanishing from the eye by the ray of here and there a tallow candle glimmering through the small panes of scattered windows would form a sombre contrast to the street as i beheld it with the gaslights blazing from corner to corner flaming within the shops and throwing a noonday brightness through the huge plates of glass  but the black lowering sky as i turned my eyes upward wore doubtless the same visage as when it frowned upon the anterevolutionary new englanders the wintry blast had the same shriek that was familiar to their ears the old south church too still pointed its antique spire into the darkness and was lost between earth and heaven and as i passed its clock which had warned so many generations how transitory was their lifetime spoke heavily and slow the same unregarded moral to myself only seven oclock thought i my old friends legends will scarcely kill the hours twixt this and bedtime  passing through the narrow arch i crossed the courtyard the confined precincts of which were made visible by a lantern over the portal of the province house on entering the barroom i found as i expected the old tradition monger seated by a special good fire of anthracite compelling clouds of smoke from a corpulent cigar he recognized me with evident pleasure for my rare properties as a patient listener invariably make me a favorite with elderly gentlemen and ladies of narrative propensities drawing a chair to the fire i desired mine host to favor us with a glass apiece of whiskey punch which was speedily prepared steaming hot with a slice of lemon at the bottom a darkred stratum of port wine upon the surface and a sprinkling of nutmeg strewn over all as we touched our glasses together my legendary friend made himself known to me as mr bela tiffany and i rejoiced at the oddity of the name because it gave his image and character a sort of individuality in my conception the old gentlemans draught acted as a solvent upon his memory so that it overflowed with tales traditions anecdotes of famous dead people and traits of ancient manners some of which were childish as a nurses lullaby while others might have been worth the notice of the grave historian nothing impressed me more than a story of a black mysterious picture which used to hang in one of the chambers of the province house directly above the room where we were now sitting the following is as correct a version of the fact as the reader would be likely to obtain from any other source although assuredly it has a tinge of romance approaching to the marvellous   in one of the apartments of the province house there was long preserved an ancient picture the frame of which was as black as ebony and the canvas itself so dark with age damp and smoke that not a touch of the painters art could be discerned time had thrown an impenetrable veil over it and left to tradition and fable and conjecture to say what had once been there portrayed during the rule of many successive governors it had hung by prescriptive and undisputed right over the mantelpiece of the same chamber and it still kept its place when lieutenantgovernor hutchinson assumed the administration of the province on the departure of sir francis bernard  the lieutenantgovernor sat one afternoon resting his head against the carved back of his stately armchair and gazing up thoughtfully at the void blackness of the picture it was scarcely a time for such inactive musing when affairs of the deepest moment required the rulers decision for within that very hour hutchinson had received intelligence of the arrival of a british fleet bringing three regiments from halifax to overawe the insubordination of the people these troops awaited his permission to occupy the fortress of castle william and the town itself yet instead of affixing his signature to an official order there sat the lieutenantgovernor so carefully scrutinizing the black waste of canvas that his demeanor attracted the notice of two young persons who attended him one wearing a military dress of buff was his kinsman francis lincoln the provincial captain of castle william the other who sat on a low stool beside his chair was alice vane his favorite niece  she was clad entirely in white a pale ethereal creature who though a native of new england had been educated abroad and seemed not merely a stranger from another clime but almost a being from another world for several years until left an orphan she had dwelt with her father in sunny italy and there had acquired a taste and enthusiasm for sculpture and painting which she found few opportunities of gratifying in the undecorated dwellings of the colonial gentry it was said that the early productions of her own pencil exhibited no inferior genius though perhaps the rude atmosphere of new england had cramped her hand and dimmed the glowing colors of her fancy but observing her uncles steadfast gaze which appeared to search through the mist of years to discover the subject of the picture her curiosity was excited  is it known my dear uncle inquired she what this old picture once represented possibly could it be made visible it might prove a masterpiece of some great artistelse why has it so long held such a conspicuous place  as her uncle contrary to his usual custom for he was as attentive to all the humors and caprices of alice as if she had been his own bestbeloved child did not immediately reply the young captain of castle william took that office upon himself  this dark old square of canvas my fair cousin said he has been an heirloom in the province house from time immemorial as to the painter i can tell you nothing but if half the stories told of it be true not one of the great italian masters has ever produced so marvellous a piece of work as that before you  captain lincoln proceeded to relate some of the strange fables and fantasies which as it was impossible to refute them by ocular demonstration had grown to be articles of popular belief in reference to this old picture one of the wildest and at the same time the best accredited accounts stated it to be an original and authentic portrait of the evil one taken at a witch meeting near salem and that its strong and terrible resemblance had been confirmed by several of the confessing wizards and witches at their trial in open court it was likewise affirmed that a familiar spirit or demon abode behind the blackness of the picture and had shown himself at seasons of public calamity to more than one of the royal governors shirley for instance had beheld this ominous apparition on the eve of general abercrombies shameful and bloody defeat under the walls of ticonderoga many of the servants of the province house had caught glimpses of a visage frowning down upon them at morning or evening twilightor in the depths of night while raking up the fire that glimmered on the hearth beneath although if any were bold enough to hold a torch before the picture it would appear as black and undistinguishable as ever the oldest inhabitant of boston recollected that his father in whose days the portrait had not wholly faded out of sight had once looked upon it but would never suffer himself to be questioned as to the face which was there represented in connection with such stories it was remarkable that over the top of the frame there were some ragged remnants of black silk indicating that a veil had formerly hung down before the picture until the duskiness of time had so effectually concealed it but after all it was the most singular part of the affair that so many of the pompous governors of massachusetts had allowed the obliterated picture to remain in the state chamber of the province house  some of these fables are really awful observed alice vane who had occasionally shuddered as well as smiled while her cousin spoke it would be almost worth while to wipe away the black surface of the canvas since the original picture can hardly be so formidable as those which fancy paints instead of it  but would it be possible inquired her cousin to restore this dark picture to its pristine hues  such arts are known in italy said alice  the lieutenantgovernor had roused himself from his abstracted mood and listened with a smile to the conversation of his young relatives yet his voice had something peculiar in its tones when he undertook the explanation of the mystery  i am sorry alice to destroy your faith in the legends of which you are so fond remarked he but my antiquarian researches have long since made me acquainted with the subject of this pictureif picture it can be calledwhich is no more visible nor ever will be than the face of the long buried man whom it once represented it was the portrait of edward randolph the founder of this house a person famous in the history of new england  of that edward randolph exclaimed captain lincoln who obtained the repeal of the first provincial charter under which our forefathers had enjoyed almost democratic privileges he that was styled the archenemy of new england and whose memory is still held in detestation as the destroyer of our liberties  it was the same randolph answered hutchinson moving uneasily in his chair it was his lot to taste the bitterness of popular odium  our annals tell us continued the captain of castle william that the curse of the people followed this randolph where he went and wrought evil in all the subsequent events of his life and that its effect was seen likewise in the manner of his death they say too that the inward misery of that curse worked itself outward and was visible on the wretched mans countenance making it too horrible to be looked upon if so and if this picture truly represented his aspect it was in mercy that the cloud of blackness has gathered over it  these traditions are folly to one who has proved as i have how little of historic truth lies at the bottom said the lieutenantgovernor as regards the life and character of edward randolph too implicit credence has been given to dr cotton mather whoi must say it though some of his blood runs in my veinshas filled our early history with old womens tales as fanciful and extravagant as those of greece or rome  and yet whispered alice vane may not such fables have a moral and methinks if the visage of this portrait be so dreadful it is not without a cause that it has hung so long in a chamber of the province house when the rulers feel themselves irresponsible it were well that they should be reminded of the awful weight of a peoples curse  the lieutenantgovernor started and gazed for a moment at his niece as if her girlish fantasies had struck upon some feeling in his own breast which all his policy or principles could not entirely subdue he knew indeed that alice in spite of her foreign education retained the native sympathies of a new england girl  peace silly child cried he at last more harshly than he had ever before addressed the gentle alice the rebuke of a king is more to be dreaded than the clamor of a wild misguided multitude captain lincoln it is decided the fortress of castle william must be occupied by the royal troops the two remaining regiments shall be billeted in the town or encamped upon the common it is time after years of tumult and almost rebellion that his majestys government should have a wall of strength about it  trust sirtrust yet awhile to the loyalty of the people said captain lincoln nor teach them that they can ever be on other terms with british soldiers than those of brotherhood as when they fought side by side through the french war do not convert the streets of your native town into a camp think twice before you give up old castle william the key of the province into other keeping than that of trueborn new englanders  young man it is decided repeated hutchinson rising from his chair a british officer will be in attendance this evening to receive the necessary instructions for the disposal of the troops your presence also will be required till then farewell  with these words the lieutenantgovernor hastily left the room while alice and her cousin more slowly followed whispering together and once pausing to glance back at the mysterious picture the captain of castle william fancied that the girls air and mien were such as might have belonged to one of those spirits of fablefairies or creatures of a more antique mythologywho sometimes mingled their agency with mortal affairs half in caprice yet with a sensibility to human weal or woe as he held the door for her to pass alice beckoned to the picture and smiled  come forth dark and evil shape cried she it is thine hour  in the evening lieutenantgovernor hutchinson sat in the same chamber where the foregoing scene had occurred surrounded by several persons whose various interests had summoned them together there were the selectmen of boston plain patriarchal fathers of the people excellent representatives of the old puritanical founders whose sombre strength had stamped so deep an impress upon the new england character contrasting with these were one or two members of council richly dressed in the white wigs the embroidered waistcoats and other magnificence of the time and making a somewhat ostentatious display of courtierlike ceremonial in attendance likewise was a major of the british army awaiting the lieutenantgovernors orders for the landing of the troops which still remained on board the transports the captain of castle william stood beside hutchinsons chair with folded arms glancing rather haughtily at the british officer by whom he was soon to be superseded in his command on a table in the centre of the chamber stood a branched silver candlestick throwing down the glow of half a dozen waxlights upon a paper apparently ready for the lieutenantgovernors signature  partly shrouded in the voluminous folds of one of the window curtains which fell from the ceiling to the floor was seen the white drapery of a ladys robe it may appear strange that alice vane should have been there at such a time but there was something so childlike so wayward in her singular character so apart from ordinary rules that her presence did not surprise the few who noticed it meantime the chairman of the selectmen was addressing to the lieutenantgovernor a long and solemn protest against the reception of the british troops into the town  and if your honor concluded this excellent but somewhat prosy old gentleman shall see fit to persist in bringing these mercenary sworders and musketeers into our quiet streets not on our heads be the responsibility think sir while there is yet time that if one drop of blood be shed that blood shall be an eternal stain upon your honors memory you sir have written with an able pen the deeds of our forefathers the more to be desired is it therefore that yourself should deserve honorable mention as a true patriot and upright ruler when your own doings shall be written down in history  i am not insensible my good sir to the natural desire to stand well in the annals of my country replied hutchinson controlling his impatience into courtesy nor know i any better method of attaining that end than by withstanding the merely temporary spirit of mischief which with your pardon seems to have infected elder men than myself would you have me wait till the mob shall sack the province house as they did my private mansion trust me sir the time may come when you will be glad to flee for protection to the kings banner the raising of which is now so distasteful to you  yes said the british major who was impatiently expecting the lieutenantgovernors orders the demagogues of this province have raised the devil and cannot lay him again we will exorcise him in gods name and the kings  if you meddle with the devil take care of his claws answered the captain of castle william stirred by the taunt against his countrymen  craving your pardon young sir said the venerable selectman let not an evil spirit enter into your words we will strive against the oppressor with prayer and fasting as our forefathers would have done like them moreover we will submit to whatever lot a wise providence may send usalways after our own best exertions to amend it  and there peep forth the devils claws muttered hutchinson who well understood the nature of puritan submission this matter shall be expedited forthwith when there shall be a sentinel at every corner and a court of guard before the town house a loyal gentleman may venture to walk abroad what to me is the outcry of a mob in this remote province of the realm the king is my master and england is my country upheld by their armed strength i set my foot upon the rabble and defy them  he snatched a pen and was about to affix his signature to the paper that lay on the table when the captain of castle william placed his hand upon his shoulder the freedom of the action so contrary to the ceremonious respect which was then considered due to rank and dignity awakened general surprise and in none more than in the lieutenantgovernor himself looking angrily up he perceived that his young relative was pointing his finger to the opposite wall hutchinsons eye followed the signal and he saw what had hitherto been unobserved that a black silk curtain was suspended before the mysterious picture so as completely to conceal it his thoughts immediately recurred to the scene of the preceding afternoon and in his surprise confused by indistinct emotions yet sensible that his niece must have had an agency in this phenomenon he called loudly upon her  alicecome hither alice  no sooner had he spoken than alice vane glided from her station and pressing one hand across her eyes with the other snatched away the sable curtain that concealed the portrait an exclamation of surprise burst from every beholder but the lieutenantgovernors voice had a tone of horror  by heaven said he in a low inward murmur speaking rather to himself than to those around him if the spirit of edward randolph were to appear among us from the place of torment he could not wear more of the terrors of hell upon his face  for some wise end said the aged selectman solemnly hath providence scattered away the mist of years that had so long hid this dreadful effigy until this hour no living man hath seen what we behold  within the antique frame which so recently had inclosed a sable waste of canvas now appeared a visible picture still dark indeed in its hues and shadings but thrown forward in strong relief it was a halflength figure of a gentleman in a rich but very oldfashioned dress of embroidered velvet with a broad ruff and a beard and wearing a hat the brim of which overshadowed his forehead beneath this cloud the eyes had a peculiar glare which was almost lifelike the whole portrait started so distinctly out of the background that it had the effect of a person looking down from the wall at the astonished and awestricken spectators the expression of the face if any words can convey an idea of it was that of a wretch detected in some hideous guilt and exposed to the bitter hatred and laughter and withering scorn of a vast surrounding multitude there was the struggle of defiance beaten down and overwhelmed by the crushing weight of ignominy the torture of the soul had come forth upon the countenance it seemed as if the picture while hidden behind the cloud of immemorial years had been all the time acquiring an intenser depth and darkness of expression till now it gloomed forth again and threw its evil omen over the present hour such if the wild legend may be credited was the portrait of edward randolph as he appeared when a peoples curse had wrought its influence upon his nature   t would drive me madthat awful face said hutchinson who seemed fascinated by the contemplation of it  be warned then whispered alice he trampled on a peoples rights behold his punishmentand avoid a crime like his  the lieutenantgovernor actually trembled for an instant but exerting his energywhich was not however his most characteristic feature he strove to shake off the spell of randolphs countenance  girl cried he laughing bitterly as he turned to alice have you brought hither your painters artyour italian spirit of intrigueyour tricks of stage effectand think to influence the councils of rulers and the affairs of nations by such shallow contrivances see here  stay yet a while said the selectman as hutchinson again snatched the pen for if ever mortal man received a warning from a tormented soul your honor is that man  away answered hutchinson fiercely though yonder senseless picture cried forbearit should not move me  casting a scowl of defiance at the pictured face which seemed at that moment to intensify the horror of its miserable and wicked look he scrawled on the paper in characters that betokened it a deed of desperation the name of thomas hutchinson then it is said he shuddered as if that signature had granted away his salvation  it is done said he and placed his hand upon his brow  may heaven forgive the deed said the soft sad accents of alice vane like the voice of a good spirit flitting away  when morning came there was a stifled whisper through the household and spreading thence about the town that the dark mysterious picture had started from the wall and spoken face to face with lieutenantgovernor hutchinson if such a miracle had been wrought however no traces of it remained behind for within the antique frame nothing could be discerned save the impenetrable cloud which had covered the canvas since the memory of man if the figure had indeed stepped forth it had fled back spiritlike at the daydawn and hidden itself behind a centurys obscurity the truth probably was that alice vanes secret for restoring the hues of the picture had merely effected a temporary renovation but those who in that brief interval had beheld the awful visage of edward randolph desired no second glance and ever afterwards trembled at the recollection of the scene as if an evil spirit had appeared visibly among them and as for hutchinson when far over the ocean his dying hour drew on he gasped for breath and complained that he was choking with the blood of the boston massacre and francis lincoln the former captain of castle william who was standing at his bedside perceived a likeness in his frenzied look to that of edward randolph did his broken spirit feel at that dread hour the tremendous burden of a peoples curse    at the conclusion of this miraculous legend i inquired of mine host whether the picture still remained in the chamber over our heads but mr tiffany informed me that it had long since been removed and was supposed to be hidden in some outoftheway corner of the new england museum perchance some curious antiquary may light upon it there and with the assistance of mr howorth the picture cleaner may supply a not unnecessary proof of the authenticity of the facts here set down during the progress of the story a storm had been gathering abroad and raging and rattling so loudly in the upper regions of the province house that it seemed as if all the old governors and great men were running riot above stairs while mr bela tiffany babbled of them below in the course of generations when many people have lived and died in an ancient house the whistling of the wind through its crannies and the creaking of its beams and rafters become strangely like the tones of the human voice or thundering laughter or heavy footsteps treading the deserted chambers it is as if the echoes of half a century were revived such were the ghostly sounds that roared and murmured in our ears when i took leave of the circle round the fireside of the province house and plunging down the door steps fought my way homeward against a drifting snowstorm     legends of the province house  iii  lady eleanores mantle  mine excellent friend the landlord of the province house was pleased the other evening to invite mr tiffany and myself to an oyster supper this slight mark of respect and gratitude as he handsomely observed was far less than the ingenious taleteller and i the humble notetaker of his narratives had fairly earned by the public notice which our joint lucubrations had attracted to his establishment many a cigar had been smoked within his premisesmany a glass of wine or more potent aqua vitae had been quaffedmany a dinner had been eaten by curious strangers who save for the fortunate conjunction of mr tiffany and me would never have ventured through that darksome avenue which gives access to the historic precincts of the province house in short if any credit be due to the courteous assurances of mr thomas waite we had brought his forgotten mansion almost as effectually into public view as if we had thrown down the vulgar range of shoe shops and dry goods stores which hides its aristocratic front from washington street it may be unadvisable however to speak too loudly of the increased custom of the house lest mr waite should find it difficult to renew the lease on so favorable terms as heretofore  being thus welcomed as benefactors neither mr tiffany nor myself felt any scruple in doing full justice to the good things that were set before us if the feast were less magnificent than those same panelled walls had witnessed in a bygone centuryif mine host presided with somewhat less of state than might have befitted a successor of the royal governorsif the guests made a less imposing show than the bewigged and powdered and embroidered dignitaries who erst banqueted at the gubernatorial table and now sleep within their armorial tombs on copps hill or round kings chapelyet never i may boldly say did a more comfortable little party assemble in the province house from queen annes days to the revolution the occasion was rendered more interesting by the presence of a venerable personage whose own actual reminiscences went back to the epoch of gage and howe and even supplied him with a doubtful anecdote or two of hutchinson he was one of that small and now all but extinguished class whose attachment to royalty and to the colonial institutions and customs that were connected with it had never yielded to the democratic heresies of after times the young queen of britain has not a more loyal subject in her realmperhaps not one who would kneel before her throne with such reverential loveas this old grandsire whose head has whitened beneath the mild sway of the republic which still in his mellower moments he terms a usurpation yet prejudices so obstinate have not made him an ungentle or impracticable companion if the truth must be told the life of the aged loyalist has been of such a scrambling and unsettled characterhe has had so little choice of friends and been so often destitute of anythat i doubt whether he would refuse a cup of kindness with either oliver cromwell or john hancockto say nothing of any democrat now upon the stage in another paper of this series i may perhaps give the reader a closer glimpse of his portrait  our host in due season uncorked a bottle of madeira of such exquisite perfume and admirable flavor that he surely must have discovered it in an ancient bin down deep beneath the deepest cellar where some jolly  old butler stored away the governors choicest wine and forgot to reveal the secret on his deathbed peace to his rednosed ghost and a libation to his memory this precious liquor was imbibed by mr tiffany with peculiar zest and after sipping the third glass it was his pleasure to give us one of the oddest legends which he had yet raked from the storehouse where he keeps such matters with some suitable adornments from my own fancy it ran pretty much as follows   not long after colonel shute had assumed the government of massachusetts bay now nearly a hundred and twenty years ago a young lady of rank and fortune arrived from england to claim his protection as her guardian he was her distant relative but the nearest who had survived the gradual extinction of her family so that no more eligible shelter could be found for the rich and highborn lady eleanore rochcliffe than within the province house of a transatlantic colony the consort of governor shute moreover had been as a mother to her childhood and was now anxious to receive her in the hope that a beautiful young woman would be exposed to infinitely less peril from the primitive society of new england than amid the artifices and corruptions of a court if either the governor or his lady had especially consulted their own comfort they would probably have sought to devolve the responsibility on other hands since with some noble and splendid traits of character lady eleanore was remarkable for a harsh unyielding pride a haughty consciousness of her hereditary and personal advantages which made her almost incapable of control judging from many traditionary anecdotes this peculiar temper was hardly less than a monomania or if the acts which it inspired were those of a sane person it seemed due from providence that pride so sinful should be followed by as severe a retribution that tinge of the marvellous which is thrown over so many of these halfforgotten legends has probably imparted an additional wildness to the strange story of lady eleanore rochcliffe  the ship in which she came passenger had arrived at newport whence lady eleanore was conveyed to boston in the governors coach attended by a small escort of gentlemen on horseback the ponderous equipage with its four black horses attracted much notice as it rumbled through cornhill surrounded by the prancing steeds of half a dozen cavaliers with swords dangling to their stirrups and pistols at their holsters through the large glass windows of the coach as it rolled along the people could discern the figure of lady eleanore strangely combining an almost queenly stateliness with the grace and beauty of a maiden in her teens a singular tale had gone abroad among the ladies of the province that their fair rival was indebted for much of the irresistible charm of her appearance to a certain article of dressan embroidered mantlewhich had been wrought by the most skilful artist in london and possessed even magical properties of adornment on the present occasion however she owed nothing to the witchery of dress being clad in a riding habit of velvet which would have appeared stiff and ungraceful on any other form  the coachman reined in his four black steeds and the whole cavalcade came to a pause in front of the contorted iron balustrade that fenced the province house from the public street it was an awkward coincidence that the bell of the old south was just then tolling for a funeral so that instead of a gladsome peal with which it was customary to announce the arrival of distinguished strangers lady eleanore rochcliffe was ushered by a doleful clang as if calamity had come embodied in her beautiful person  a very great disrespect exclaimed captain langford an english officer who had recently brought dispatches to governor shute the funeral should have been deferred lest lady eleanores spirits be affected by such a dismal welcome  with your pardon sir replied doctor clarke a physician and a famous champion of the popular party whatever the heralds may pretend a dead beggar must have precedence of a living queen king death confers high privileges  these remarks were interchanged while the speakers waited a passage through the crowd which had gathered on each side of the gateway leaving an open avenue to the portal of the province house a black slave in livery now leaped from behind the coach and threw open the door while at the same moment governor shute descended the flight of steps from his mansion to assist lady eleanore in alighting but the governors stately approach was anticipated in a manner that excited general astonishment a pale young man with his black hair all in disorder rushed from the throng and prostrated himself beside the coach thus offering his person as a footstool for lady eleanore rochcliffe to tread upon she held back an instant yet with an expression as if doubting whether the young man were worthy to bear the weight of her footstep rather than dissatisfied to receive such awful reverence from a fellowmortal  up sir said the governor sternly at the same time lifting his cane over the intruder what means the bedlamite by this freak  nay answered lady eleanore playfully but with more scorn than pity in her tone your excellency shall not strike him when men seek only to be trampled upon it were a pity to deny them a favor so easily grantedand so well deserved  then though as lightly as a sunbeam on a cloud she placed her foot upon the cowering form and extended her hand to meet that of the governor there was a brief interval during which lady eleanore retained this attitude and never surely was there an apter emblem of aristocracy and hereditary pride trampling on human sympathies and the kindred of nature than these two figures presented at that moment yet the spectators were so smitten with her beauty and so essential did pride seem to the existence of such a creature that they gave a simultaneous acclamation of applause  who is this insolent young fellow inquired captain langford who still remained beside doctor clarke if he be in his senses his impertinence demands the bastinado if mad lady eleanore should be secured from further inconvenience by his confinement  his name is jervase helwyse answered the doctor a youth of no birth or fortune or other advantages save the mind and soul that nature gave him and being secretary to our colonial agent in london it was his misfortune to meet this lady eleanore rochcliffe he loved herand her scorn has driven him mad  he was mad so to aspire observed the english officer  it may be so said doctor clarke frowning as he spoke but i tell you sir i could wellnigh doubt the justice of the heaven above us if no signal humiliation overtake this lady who now treads so haughtily into yonder mansion she seeks to place herself above the sympathies of our common nature which envelops all human souls see if that nature do not assert its claim over her in some mode that shall bring her level with the lowest  never cried captain langford indignantlyneither in life nor when they lay her with her ancestors  not many days afterwards the governor gave a ball in honor of lady eleanore rochcliffe the principal gentry of the colony received invitations which were distributed to their residences far and near by messengers on horseback bearing missives sealed with all the formality of official dispatches in obedience to the summons there was a general gathering of rank wealth and beauty and the wide door of the province house had seldom given admittance to more numerous and honorable guests than on the evening of lady eleanores ball without much extravagance of eulogy the spectacle might even be termed splendid for according to the fashion of the times the ladies shone in rich silks and satins outspread over wideprojecting hoops and the gentlemen glittered in gold embroidery laid unsparingly upon the purple or scarlet or skyblue velvet which was the material of their coats and waistcoats the latter article of dress was of great importance since it enveloped the wearers body nearly to the knees and was perhaps bedizened with the amount of his whole years income in golden flowers and foliage the altered taste of the present daya taste symbolic of a deep change in the whole system of societywould look upon almost any of those gorgeous figures as ridiculous although that evening the guests sought their reflections in the pierglasses and rejoiced to catch their own glitter amid the glittering crowd what a pity that one of the stately mirrors has not preserved a picture of the scene which by the very traits that were so transitory might have taught us much that would be worth knowing and remembering  would at least that either painter or mirror could convey to us some faint idea of a garment already noticed in this legendthe lady eleanores embroidered mantlewhich the gossips whispered was invested with magic properties so as to lend a new and untried grace to her figure each time that she put it on idle fancy as it is this mysterious mantle has thrown an awe around my image of her partly from its fabled virtues and partly because it was the handiwork of a dying woman and perchance owed the fantastic grace of its conception to the delirium of approaching death  after the ceremonial greetings had been paid lady eleanore rochcliffe stood apart from the mob of guests insulating herself within a small and distinguished circle to whom she accorded a more cordial favor than to the general throng the waxen torches threw their radiance vividly over the scene bringing out its brilliant points in strong relief but she gazed carelessly and with now and then an expression of weariness or scorn tempered with such feminine grace that her auditors scarcely perceived the moral deformity of which it was the utterance she beheld the spectacle not with vulgar ridicule as disdaining to be pleased with the provincial mockery of a court festival but with the deeper scorn of one whose spirit held itself too high to participate in the enjoyment of other human souls whether or no the recollections of those who saw her that evening were influenced by the strange events with which she was subsequently connected so it was that her figure ever after recurred to them as marked by something wild and unnaturalalthough at the time the general whisper was of her exceeding beauty and of the indescribable charm which her mantle threw around her some close observers indeed detected a feverish flush and alternate paleness of countenance with corresponding flow and revulsion of spirits and once or twice a painful and helpless betrayal of lassitude as if she were on the point of sinking to the ground then with a nervous shudder she seemed to arouse her energies and threw some bright and playful yet halfwicked sarcasm into the conversation there was so strange a characteristic in her manners and sentiments that it astonished every rightminded listener till looking in her face a lurking and incomprehensible glance and smile perplexed them with doubts both as to her seriousness and sanity gradually lady eleanore rochcliffes circle grew smaller till only four gentlemen remained in it these were captain langford the english officer before mentioned a virginian planter who had come to massachusetts on some political errand a young episcopal clergyman the grandson of a british earl and lastly the private secretary of governor shute whose obsequiousness had won a sort of tolerance from lady eleanore  at different periods of the evening the liveried servants of the province house passed among the guests bearing huge trays of refreshments and french and spanish wines lady eleanore rochcliffe who refused to wet her beautiful lips even with a bubble of champagne had sunk back into a large damask chair apparently overwearied either with the excitement of the scene or its tedium and while for an instant she was unconscious of voices laughter and music a young man stole forward and knelt down at her feet he bore a salver in his hand on which was a chased silver goblet filled to the brim with wine which he offered as reverentially as to a crowned queen or rather with the awful devotion of a priest doing sacrifice to his idol conscious that some one touched her robe lady eleanore started and unclosed her eyes upon the pale wild features and dishevelled hair of jervase helwyse  why do you haunt me thus said she in a languid tone but with a kindlier feeling than she ordinarily permitted herself to express they tell me that i have done you harm  heaven knows if that be so replied the young man solemnly but lady eleanore in requital of that harm if such there be and for your own earthly and heavenly welfare i pray you to take one sip of this holy wine and then to pass the goblet round among the guests and this shall be a symbol that you have not sought to withdraw yourself from the chain of human sympathieswhich whoso would shake off must keep company with fallen angels  where has this mad fellow stolen that sacramental vessel exclaimed the episcopal clergyman  this question drew the notice of the guests to the silver cup which was recognized as appertaining to the communion plate of the old south church and for aught that could be known it was brimming over with the consecrated wine  perhaps it is poisoned half whispered the governors secretary  pour it down the villains throat cried the virginian fiercely  turn him out of the house cried captain langford seizing jervase helwyse so roughly by the shoulder that the sacramental cup was overturned and its contents sprinkled upon lady eleanores mantle whether knave fool or bedlamite it is intolerable that the fellow should go at large  pray gentlemen do my poor admirer no harm said lady eleanore with a faint and weary smile take him out of my sight if such be your pleasure for i can find in my heart to do nothing but laugh at him whereas in all decency and conscience it would become me to weep for the mischief i have wrought  but while the bystanders were attempting to lead away the unfortunate young man he broke from them and with a wild impassioned earnestness offered a new and equally strange petition to lady eleanore it was no other than that she should throw off the mantle which while he pressed the silver cup of wine upon her she had drawn more closely around her form so as almost to shroud herself within it  cast it from you exclaimed jervase helwyse clasping his hands in an agony of entreaty it may not yet be too late give the accursed garment to the flames  but lady eleanore with a laugh of scorn drew the rich folds of the embroidered mantle over her head in such a fashion as to give a completely new aspect to her beautiful face whichhalf hidden half revealedseemed to belong to some being of mysterious character and purposes  farewell jervase helwyse said she keep my image in your remembrance as you behold it now  alas lady he replied in a tone no longer wild but sad as a funeral bell we must meet shortly when your face may wear another aspectand that shall be the image that must abide within me  he made no more resistance to the violent efforts of the gentlemen and servants who almost dragged him out of the apartment and dismissed him roughly from the iron gate of the province house captain langford who had been very active in this affair was returning to the presence of lady eleanore rochcliffe when he encountered the physician doctor clarke with whom he had held some casual talk on the day of her arrival the doctor stood apart separated from lady eleanore by the width of the room but eying her with such keen sagacity that captain langford involuntarily gave him credit for the discovery of some deep secret  you appear to be smitten after all with the charms of this queenly maiden said he hoping thus to draw forth the physicians hidden knowledge  god forbid answered doctor clarke with a grave smile and if you be wise you will put up the same prayer for yourself woe to those who shall be smitten by this beautiful lady eleanore but yonder stands the governorand i have a word or two for his private ear good night  he accordingly advanced to governor shute and addressed him in so low a tone that none of the bystanders could catch a word of what he said although the sudden change of his excellencys hitherto cheerful visage betokened that the communication could be of no agreeable import a very few moments afterwards it was announced to the guests that an unforeseen circumstance rendered it necessary to put a premature close to the festival  the hall at the province house supplied a topic of conversation for the colonial metropolis for some days after its occurrence and might still longer have been the general theme only that a subject of allengrossing interest thrust it for a time from the public recollection this was the appearance of a dreadful epidemic which in that age and long before and afterwards was wont to slay its hundreds and thousands on both sides of the atlantic on the occasion of which we speak it was distinguished by a peculiar virulence insomuch that it has left its tracesits pitmarks to use an appropriate figureon the history of the country the affairs of which were thrown into confusion by its ravages at first unlike its ordinary course the disease seemed to confine itself to the higher circles of society selecting its victims from among the proud the wellborn and the wealthy entering unabashed into stately chambers and lying down with the slumberers in silken beds some of the most distinguished guests of the province house even those whom the haughty lady eleanore rochcliffe had deemed not unworthy of her favorwere stricken by this fatal scourge it was noticed with an ungenerous bitterness of feeling that the four gentlementhe virginian the british officer the young clergyman and the governors secretarywho had been her most devoted attendants on the evening of the ball were the foremost of whom the plague stroke fell but the disease pursuing its onward progress soon ceased to be exclusively a prerogative of aristocracy its red brand was no longer conferred like a nobles star or an order of knighthood it threaded its way through the narrow and crooked streets and entered the low mean darksome dwellings and laid its hand of death upon the artisans and laboring classes of the town it compelled rich and poor to feel themselves brethren then and stalking to and fro across the three hills with a fierceness which made it almost a new pestilence there was that mighty conquerorthat scourge and horror of our forefathersthe smallpox  we cannot estimate the affright which this plague inspired of yore by contemplating it as the fangless monster of the present day we must remember rather with what awe we watched the gigantic footsteps of the asiatic cholera striding from shore to shore of the atlantic and marching like destiny upon cities far remote which flight had already half depopulated there is no other fear so horrible and unhumanizing as that which makes man dread to breathe heavens vital air lest it be poison or to grasp the hand of a brother or friend lest the gripe of the pestilence should clutch him such was the dismay that now followed in the track of the disease or ran before it throughout the town graves were hastily dug and the pestilential relics as hastily covered because the dead were enemies of the living and strove to draw them headlong as it were into their own dismal pit the public councils were suspended as if mortal wisdom might relinquish its devices now that an unearthly usurper had found his way into the rulers mansion had an enemys fleet been hovering on the coast or his armies trampling on our soil the people would probably have committed their defence to that same direful conqueror who had wrought their own calamity and would permit no interference with his sway this conquerer had a symbol of his triumphs it was a bloodred flag that fluttered in the tainted air over the door of every dwelling into which the smallpox had entered  such a banner was long since waving over the portal of the province house for thence as was proved by tracking its footsteps back had all this dreadful mischief issued it had been traced back to a ladys luxurious chamberto the proudest of the proudto her that was so delicate and hardly owned herself of earthly mouldto the haughty one who took her stand above human sympathiesto lady eleanore there remained no room for doubt that the contagion had lurked in that gorgeous mantle which threw so strange a grace around her at the festival its fantastic splendor had been conceived in the delirious brain of a woman on her deathbed and was the last toil of her stiffening fingers which had interwoven fate and misery with its golden threads this dark tale whispered at first was now bruited far and wide the people raved against the lady eleanore and cried out that her pride and scorn had evoked a fiend and that between them both this monstrous evil had been born at times their rage and despair took the semblance of grinning mirth and whenever the red flag of the pestilence was hoisted over another and yet another door they clapped their hands and shouted through the streets in bitter mockery behold a new triumph for the lady eleanore  one day in the midst of these dismal times a wild figure approached the portal of the province house and folding his arms stood contemplating the scarlet banner which a passing breeze shook fitfully as if to fling abroad the contagion that it typified at length climbing one of the pillars by means of the iron balustrade he took down the flag and entered the mansion waving it above his head at the foot of the staircase he met the governor booted and spurred with his cloak drawn around him evidently on the point of setting forth upon a journey  wretched lunatic what do you seek here exclaimed shute extending his cane to guard himself from contact there is nothing here but death backor you will meet him  death will not touch me the bannerbearer of the pestilence cried jervase helwyse shaking the red flag aloft death and the pestilence who wears the aspect of the lady eleanore will walk through the streets tonight and i must march before them with this banner  why do i waste words on the fellow muttered the governor drawing his cloak across his mouth what matters his miserable life when none of us are sure of twelve hours breath on fool to your own destruction  he made way for jervase helwyse who immediately ascended the staircase but on the first landing place was arrested by the firm grasp of a hand upon his shoulder looking fiercely up with a madmans impulse to struggle with and rend asunder his opponent he found himself powerless beneath a calm stern eye which possessed the mysterious property of quelling frenzy at its height the person whom he had now encountered was the physician doctor clarke the duties of whose sad profession had led him to the province house where he was an infrequent guest in more prosperous times  young man what is your purpose demanded he  i seek the lady eleanore answered jervase helwyse submissively  all have fled from her said the physician why do you seek her now i tell you youth her nurse fell deathstricken on the threshold of that fatal chamber know ye not that never came such a curse to our shores as this lovely lady eleanorethat her breath has filled the air with poisonthat she has shaken pestilence and death upon the land from the folds of her accursed mantle  let me look upon her rejoined the mad youth more wildly let me behold her in her awful beauty clad in the regal garments of the pestilence she and death sit on a throne together let me kneel down before them  poor youth said doctor clarke and moved by a deep sense of human weakness a smile of caustic humor curled his lip even then wilt thou still worship the destroyer and surround her image with fantasies the more magnificent the more evil she has wrought thus man doth ever to his tyrants approach then madness as i have noted has that good efficacy that it will guard you from contagionand perchance its own cure may be found in yonder chamber  ascending another flight of stairs he threw open a door and signed to jervase helwyse that he should enter the poor lunatic it seems probable had cherished a delusion that his haughty mistress sat in state unharmed herself by the pestilential influence which as by enchantment she scattered round about her he dreamed no doubt that her beauty was not dimmed but brightened into superhuman splendor with such anticipations he stole reverentially to the door at which the physician stood but paused upon the threshold gazing fearfully into the gloom of the darkened chamber  where is the lady eleanore whispered he  call her replied the physician  lady eleanoreprincessqueen of death cried jervase helwyse advancing three steps into the chamber she is not here there on yonder table i behold the sparkle of a diamond which once she wore upon her bosom thereand he shudderedthere hangs her mantle on which a dead woman embroidered a spell of dreadful potency but where is the lady eleanore  something stirred within the silken curtains of a canopied bed and a low moan was uttered which listening intently jervase helwyse began to distinguish as a womans voice complaining dolefully of thirst he fancied even that he recognized its tones  my throatmy throat is scorched murmured the voice a drop of water  what thing art thou said the brainstricken youth drawing near the bed and tearing asunder its curtains whose voice hast thou stolen for thy murmurs and miserable petitions as if lady eleanore could be conscious of mortal infirmity fie heap of diseased mortality why lurkest thou in my ladys chamber  o jervase helwyse said the voiceand as it spoke the figure contorted itself struggling to hide its blasted facelook not now on the woman you once loved the curse of heaven hath stricken me because i would not call man my brother nor woman sister i wrapped myself in pride as in a mantle and scorned the sympathies of nature and therefore has nature made this wretched body the medium of a dreadful sympathy you are avengedthey are all avengednature is avengedfor i am eleanore rochcliffe  the malice of his mental disease the bitterness lurking at the bottom of his heart mad as he was for a blighted and ruined life and love that had been paid with cruel scorn awoke within the breast of jervase helwyse he shook his finger at the wretched girl and the chamber echoed the curtains of the bed were shaken with his outburst of insane merriment  another triumph for the lady eleanore he cried all have been her victims who so worthy to be the final victim as herself  impelled by some new fantasy of his crazed intellect he snatched the fatal mantle and rushed from the chamber and the house that night a procession passed by torchlight through the streets bearing in the midst the figure of a woman enveloped with a richly embroidered mantle while in advance stalked jervase helwyse waving the red flag of the pestilence arriving opposite the province house the mob burned the effigy and a strong wind came and swept away the ashes it was said that from that very hour the pestilence abated as if its sway had some mysterious connection from the first plague stroke to the last with lady eleanores mantle a remarkable uncertainty broods over that unhappy ladys fate there is a belief however that in a certain chamber of this mansion a female form may sometimes be duskily discerned shrinking into the darkest corner and muffling her face within an embroidered mantle supposing the legend true can this be other than the once proud lady eleanore   mine host and the old loyalist and i bestowed no little warmth of applause upon this narrative in which we had all been deeply interested for the reader can scarcely conceive how unspeakably the effect of such a tale is heightened when as in the present case we may repose perfect confidence in the veracity of him who tells it for my own part knowing how scrupulous is mr tiffany to settle the foundation of his facts i could not have believed him one whit the more faithfully had he professed himself an eyewitness of the doings and sufferings of poor lady eleanore some sceptics it is true might demand documentary evidence or even require him to produce the embroidered mantle forgetting thatheaven be praisedit was consumed to ashes but now the old loyalist whose blood was warmed by the good cheer began to talk in his turn about the traditions of the province house and hinted that he if it were agreeable might add a few reminiscences to our legendary stock mr tiffany having no cause to dread a rival immediately besought him to favor us with a specimen my own entreaties of course were urged to the same effect and our venerable guest well pleased to find willing auditors awaited only the return of mr thomas waite who had been summoned forth to provide accommodations for several new arrivals perchance the publicbut be this as its own caprice and ours shall settle the mattermay read the result in another tale of the province house     legends of the province house  iv  old esther dudley  our host having resumed the chair he as well as mr tiffany and myself expressed much eagerness to be made acquainted with the story to which the loyalist had alluded that venerable man first of all saw fit to moisten his throat with another glass of wine and then turning his face towards our coal fire looked steadfastly for a few moments into the depths of its cheerful glow finally he poured forth a great fluency of speech the generous liquid that he had imbibed while it warmed his agechilled blood likewise took off the chill from his heart and mind and gave him an energy to think and feel which we could hardly have expected to find beneath the snows of fourscore winters his feelings indeed appeared to me more excitable than those of a younger man or at least the same degree of feeling manifested itself by more visible effects than if his judgment and will had possessed the potency of meridian life at the pathetic passages of his narrative he readily melted into tears when a breath of indignation swept across his spirit the blood flushed his withered visage even to the roots of his white hair and he shook his clinched fist at the trio of peaceful auditors seeming to fancy enemies in those who felt very kindly towards the desolate old soul but ever and anon sometimes in the midst of his most earnest talk this ancient persons intellect would wander vaguely losing its hold of the matter in hand and groping for it amid misty shadows then would he cackle forth a feeble laugh and express a doubt whether his witsfor by that phrase it pleased our ancient friend to signify his mental powerswere not getting a little the worse for wear  under these disadvantages the old loyalists story required more revision to render it fit for the public eye than those of the series which have preceded it nor should it be concealed that the sentiment and tone of the affair may have undergone some slight or perchance more than slight metamorphosis in its transmission to the reader through the medium of a thoroughgoing democrat the tale itself is a mere sketch with no involution of plot nor any great interest of events yet possessing if i have rehearsed it aright that pensive influence over the mind which the shadow of the old province house flings upon the loiterer in its courtyard   the hour had comethe hour of defeat and humiliationwhen sir william howe was to pass over the threshold of the province house and embark with no such triumphal ceremonies as he once promised himself on board the british fleet he bade his servants and military attendants go before him and lingered a moment in the loneliness of the mansion to quell the fierce emotions that struggled in his bosom as with a death throb preferable then would he have deemed his fate had a warriors death left him a claim to the narrow territory of a grave within the soil which the king had given him to defend with an ominous perception that as his departing footsteps echoed adown the staircase the sway of britain was passing forever from new england he smote his clinched hand on his brow and cursed the destiny that had flung the shame of a dismembered empire upon him  would to god cried he hardly repressing his tears of rage that the rebels were even now at the doorstep a bloodstain upon the floor should then bear testimony that the last british ruler was faithful to his trust  the tremulous voice of a woman replied to his exclamation  heavens cause and the kings are one it said go forth sir william howe and trust in heaven to bring back a royal governor in triumph  subduing at once the passion to which he had yielded only in the faith that it was unwitnessed sir william howe became conscious that an aged woman leaning on a goldheaded staff was standing betwixt him and the door it was old esther dudley who had dwelt almost immemorial years in this mansion until her presence seemed as inseparable from it as the recollections of its history she was the daughter of an ancient and once eminent family which had fallen into poverty and decay and left its last descendant no resource save the bounty of the king nor any shelter except within the walls of the province house an office in the household with merely nominal duties had been assigned to her as a pretext for the payment of a small pension the greater part of which she expended in adorning herself with an antique magnificence of attire the claims of esther dudleys gentle blood were acknowledged by all the successive governors and they treated her with the punctilious courtesy which it was her foible to demand not always with success from a neglectful world the only actual share which she assumed in the business of the mansion was to glide through its passages and public chambers late at night to see that the servants had dropped no fire from their flaring torches nor left embers crackling and blazing on the hearths perhaps it was this invariable custom of walking her rounds in the hush of midnight that caused the superstition of the times to invest the old woman with attributes of awe and mystery fabling that she had entered the portal of the province house none knew whence in the train of the first royal governor and that it was her fate to dwell there till the last should have departed but sir william howe if he ever heard this legend had forgotten it  mistress dudley why are you loitering here asked he with some severity of tone it is my pleasure to be the last in this mansion of the king  not so if it please your excellency answered the timestricken woman this roof has sheltered me long i will not pass from it until they bear me to the tomb of my forefathers what other shelter is there for old esther dudley save the province house or the grave  now heaven forgive me said sir william howe to himself i was about to leave this wretched old creature to starve or beg take this good mistress dudley he added putting a purse into her hands king georges head on these golden guineas is sterling yet and will continue so i warrant you even should the rebels crown john hancock their king that purse will buy a better shelter than the province house can now afford  while the burden of life remains upon me i will have no other shelter than this roof persisted esther dudley striking her staff upon the floor with a gesture that expressed immovable resolve and when your excellency returns in triumph i will totter into the porch to welcome you  my poor old friend answered the british generaland all his manly and martial pride could no longer restrain a gush of bitter tears this is an evil hour for you and me the province which the king intrusted to my charge is lost i go hence in misfortuneperchance in disgraceto return no more and you whose present being is incorporated with the pastwho have seen governor after governor in stately pageantry ascend these stepswhose whole life has been an observance of majestic ceremonies and a worship of the kinghow will you endure the change come with us bid farewell to a land that has shaken off its allegiance and live still under a royal government at halifax  never never said the pertinacious old dame here will i abide and king george shall still have one true subject in his disloyal province  beshrew the old fool muttered sir william howe growing impatient of her obstinacy and ashamed of the emotion into which he had been betrayed she is the very moral of oldfashioned prejudice and could exist nowhere but in this musty edifice well then mistress dudley since you will needs tarry i give the province house in charge to you take this key and keep it safe until myself or some other royal governor shall demand it of you  smiling bitterly at himself and her he took the heavy key of the province house and delivering it into the old ladys hands drew his cloak around him for departure as the general glanced back at esther dudleys antique figure he deemed her well fitted for such a charge as being so perfect a representative of the decayed pastof an age gone by with its manners opinions faith and feelings all fallen into oblivion or scornof what had once been a reality but was now merely a vision of faded magnificence then sir william howe strode forth smiting his clinched hands together in the fierce anguish of his spirit and old esther dudley was left to keep watch in the lonely province house dwelling there with memory and if hope ever seemed to flit around her still was it memory in disguise  the total change of affairs that ensued on the departure of the british troops did not drive the venerable lady from her stronghold there was not for many years afterwards a governor of massachusetts and the magistrates who had charge of such matters saw no objection to esther dudleys residence in the province house especially as they must otherwise have paid a hireling for taking care of the premises which with her was a labor of love and so they left her the undisturbed mistress of the old historic edifice many and strange were the fables which the gossips whispered about her in all the chimney corners of the town among the timeworn articles of furniture that had been left in the mansion there was a tall antique mirror which was well worthy of a tale by itself and perhaps may hereafter be the theme of one the gold of its heavilywrought frame was tarnished and its surface so blurred that the old womans figure whenever she paused before it looked indistinct and ghostlike but it was the general belief that esther could cause the governors of the overthrown dynasty with the beautiful ladies who had once adorned their festivals the indian chiefs who had come up to the province house to hold council or swear allegiance the grim provincial warriors the severe clergymenin short all the pageantry of gone daysall the figures that ever swept across the broad plate of glass in former timesshe could cause the whole to reappear and people the inner world of the mirror with shadows of old life such legends as these together with the singularity of her isolated existence her age and the infirmity that each added winter flung upon her made mistress dudley the object both of fear and pity and it was partly the result of either sentiment that amid all the angry license of the times neither wrong nor insult ever fell upon her unprotected head indeed there was so much haughtiness in her demeanor towards intruders among whom she reckoned all persons acting under the new authorities that it was really an affair of no small nerve to look her in the face and to do the people justice stern republicans as they had now become they were well content that the old gentlewoman in her hoop petticoat and faded embroidery should still haunt the palace of ruined pride and overthrown power the symbol of a departed system embodying a history in her person so esther dudley dwelt year after year in the province house still reverencing all that others had flung aside still faithful to her king who so long as the venerable dame yet held her post might be said to retain one true subject in new england and one spot of the empire that had been wrested from him  and did she dwell there in utter loneliness rumor said not so whenever her chill and withered heart desired warmth she was wont to summon a black slave of governor shirleys from the blurred mirror and send him in search of guests who had long ago been familiar in those deserted chambers forth went the sable messenger with the starlight or the moonshine gleaming through him and did his errand in the burial ground knocking at the iron doors of tombs or upon the marble slabs that covered them and whispering to those within my mistress old esther dudley bids you to the province house at midnight and punctually as the clock of the old south told twelve came the shadows of the olivers the hutchinsons the dudleys all the grandees of a bygone generation gliding beneath the portal into the wellknown mansion where esther mingled with them as if she likewise were a shade without vouching for the truth of such traditions it is certain that mistress dudley sometimes assembled a few of the stanch though crestfallen old tories who had lingered in the rebel town during those days of wrath and tribulation out of a cobwebbed bottle containing liquor that a royal governor might have smacked his lips over they quaffed healths to the king and babbled treason to the republic feeling as if the protecting shadow of the throne were still flung around them but draining the last drops of their liquor they stole timorously homeward and answered not again if the rude mob reviled them in the street  yet esther dudleys most frequent and favored guests were the children of the town towards them she was never stern a kindly and loving nature hindered elsewhere from its free course by a thousand rocky prejudices lavished itself upon these little ones by bribes of gingerbread of her own making stamped with a royal crown she tempted their sunny sportiveness beneath the gloomy portal of the province house and would often beguile them to spend a whole playday there sitting in a circle round the verge of her hoop petticoat greedily attentive to her stories of a dead world and when these little boys and girls stole forth again from the dark mysterious mansion they went bewildered full of old feelings that graver people had long ago forgotten rubbing their eyes at the world around them as if they had gone astray into ancient times and become children of the past at home when their parents asked where they had loitered such a weary while and with whom they had been at play the children would talk of all the departed worthies of the province as far back as governor belcher and the haughty dame of sir william phipps it would seem as though they had been sitting on the knees of these famous personages whom the grave had hidden for half a century and had toyed with the embroidery of their rich waistcoats or roguishly pulled the long curls of their flowing wigs but governor belcher has been dead this many a year would the mother say to her little boy and did you really see him at the province house oh yes dear mother yes the halfdreaming child would answer but when old esther had done speaking about him he faded away out of his chair thus without affrighting her little guests she led them by the hand into the chambers of her own desolate heart and made childhoods fancy discern the ghosts that haunted there  living so continually in her own circle of ideas and never regulating her mind by a proper reference to present things esther dudley appears to have grown partially crazed it was found that she had no right sense of the progress and true state of the revolutionary war but held a constant faith that the armies of britain were victorious on every field and destined to be ultimately triumphant whenever the town rejoiced for a battle won by washington or gates or morgan or greene the news in passing through the door of the province house as through the ivory gate of dreams became metamorphosed into a strange tale of the prowess of howe clinton or cornwallis sooner or later it was her invincible belief the colonies would be prostrate at the footstool of the king sometimes she seemed to take for granted that such was already the case on one occasion she startled the townspeople by a brilliant illumination of the province house with candles at every pane of glass and a transparency of the kings initials and a crown of light in the great balcony window the figure of the aged woman in the most gorgeous of her mildewed velvets and brocades was seen passing from casement to casement until she paused before the balcony and flourished a huge key above her head her wrinkled visage actually gleamed with triumph as if the soul within her were a festal lamp  what means this blaze of light what does old esthers joy portend whispered a spectator it is frightful to see her gliding about the chambers and rejoicing there without a soul to bear her company  it is as if she were making merry in a tomb said another  pshaw it is no such mystery observed an old man after some brief exercise of memory mistress dudley is keeping jubilee for the king of englands birthday  then the people laughed aloud and would have thrown mud against the blazing transparency of the kings crown and initials only that they pitied the poor old dame who was so dismally triumphant amid the wreck and ruin of the system to which she appertained  oftentimes it was her custom to climb the weary staircase that wound upward to the cupola and thence strain her dimmed eyesight seaward and countryward watching for a british fleet or for the march of a grand procession with the kings banner floating over it the passengers in the street below would discern her anxious visage and send up a shout when the golden indian on the province house shall shoot his arrow and when the cock on the old south spire shall crow then look for a royal governor againfor this had grown a byword through the town and at last after long long years old esther dudley knew or perchance she only dreamed that a royal governor was on the eve of returning to the province house to receive the heavy key which sir william howe had committed to her charge now it was the fact that intelligence bearing some faint analogy to esthers version of it was current among the townspeople she set the mansion in the best order that her means allowed and arraying herself in silks and tarnished gold stood long before the blurred mirror to admire her own magnificence as she gazed the gray and withered lady moved her ashen lips murmuring half aloud talking to shapes that she saw within the mirror to shadows of her own fantasies to the household friends of memory and bidding them rejoice with her and come forth to meet the governor and while absorbed in this communion mistress dudley heard the tramp of many footsteps in the street and looking out at the window beheld what she construed as the royal governors arrival  o happy day o blessed blessed hour she exclaimed let me but bid him welcome within the portal and my task in the province house and on earth is done  then with tottering feet which age and tremulous joy caused to tread amiss she hurried down the grand staircase her silks sweeping and rustling as she went so that the sound was as if a train of spectral courtiers were thronging from the dim mirror and esther dudley fancied that as soon as the wide door should be flung open all the pomp and splendor of bygone times would pace majestically into the province house and the gilded tapestry of the past would be brightened by the sunshine of the present she turned the keywithdrew it from the lockunclosed the doorand stepped across the threshold advancing up the courtyard appeared a person of most dignified mien with tokens as esther interpreted them of gentle blood high rank and longaccustomed authority even in his walk and every gesture he was richly dressed but wore a gouty shoe which however did not lessen the stateliness of his gait around and behind him were people in plain civic dresses and two or three warworn veterans evidently officers of rank arrayed in a uniform of blue and buff but esther dudley firm in the belief that had fastened its roots about her heart beheld only the principal personage and never doubted that this was the longlookedfor governor to whom she was to surrender up her charge as he approached she involuntary sank down on her knees and tremblingly held forth the heavy key  receive my trust take it quickly cried she for methinks death is striving to snatch away my triumph but he comes too late thank heaven for this blessed hour god save king george  that madam is a strange prayer to be offered up at such a moment replied the unknown guest of the province house and courteously removing his hat he offered his arm to raise the aged woman yet in reverence for your gray hairs and longkept faith heaven forbid that any here should say you nay over the realms which still acknowledge his sceptre god save king george  esther dudley started to her feet and hastily clutching back the key gazed with fearful earnestness at the stranger and dimly and doubtfully as if suddenly awakened from a dream her bewildered eyes half recognized his face years ago she had known him among the gentry of the province but the ban of the king had fallen upon him how then came the doomed victim here proscribed excluded from mercy the monarchs most dreaded and hated foe this new england merchant had stood triumphantly against a kingdoms strength and his foot now trod upon humbled royalty as he ascended the steps of the province house the peoples chosen governor of massachusetts  wretch wretch that i am muttered the old woman with such a heartbroken expression that the tears gushed from the strangers eyes have i bidden a traitor welcome come death come quickly  alas venerable lady said governor hancock tending her his support with all the reverence that a courtier would have shown to a queen  your life has been prolonged until the world has changed around you you have treasured up all that time has rendered worthlessthe principles feelings manners modes of being and acting which another generation has flung asideand you are a symbol of the past and i and these around mewe represent a new race of menliving no longer in the past scarcely in the presentbut projecting our lives forward into the future ceasing to model ourselves on ancestral superstitions it is our faith and principle to press onward onward yet continued he turning to his attendants let us reverence for the last time the stately and gorgeous prejudices of the tottering past  while the republican governor spoke he had continued to support the helpless form of esther dudley her weight grew heavier against his arm but at last with a sudden effort to free herself the ancient woman sank down beside one of the pillars of the portal the key of the province house fell from her grasp and clanked against the stone  i have been faithful unto death murmured she god save the king  she hath done her office said hancock solemnly we will follow her reverently to the tomb of her ancestors and then my fellowcitizens onwardonward we are no longer children of the past   as the old loyalist concluded his narrative the enthusiasm which had been fitfully flashing within his sunken eyes and quivering across his wrinkled visage faded away as if all the lingering fire of his soul were extinguished just then too a lamp upon the mantelpiece threw out a dying gleam which vanished as speedily as it shot upward compelling our eyes to grope for one anothers features by the dim glow of the hearth with such a lingering fire methought with such a dying gleam had the glory of the ancient system vanished from the province house when the spirit of old esther dudley took its flight and now again the clock of the old south threw its voice of ages on the breeze knolling the hourly knell of the past crying out far and wide through the multitudinous city and filling our ears as we sat in the dusky chamber with its reverberating depth of tone in that same mansionin that very chamberwhat a volume of history had been told off into hours by the same voice that was now trembling in the air many a governor had heard those midnight accents and longed to exchange his stately cares for slumber and as for mine host and mr bela tiffany and the old loyalist and me we had babbled about dreams of the past until we almost fancied that the clock was still striking in a bygone century neither of us would have wondered had a hooppetticoated phantom of esther dudley tottered into the chamber walking her rounds in the hush of midnight as of yore and motioned us to quench the fading embers of the fire and leave the historic precincts to herself and her kindred shades but as no such vision was vouchsafed i retired unbidden and would advise mr tiffany to lay hold of another auditor being resolved not to show my face in the province house for a good while henceif ever     the ambitious guest  one september night a family had gathered round their hearth and piled it high with the driftwood of mountain streams the dry cones of the pine and the splintered ruins of great trees that had come crashing down the precipice up the chimney roared the fire and brightened the room with its broad blaze the faces of the father and mother had a sober gladness the children laughed the eldest daughter was the image of happiness at seventeen and the aged grandmother who sat knitting in the warmest place was the image of happiness grown old they had found the herb heartsease in the bleakest spot of all new england this family were situated in the notch of the white hills where the wind was sharp throughout the year and pitilessly cold in the wintergiving their cottage all its fresh inclemency before it descended on the valley of the saco they dwelt in a cold spot and a dangerous one for a mountain towered above their heads so steep that the stones would often rumble down its sides and startle them at midnight  the daughter had just uttered some simple jest that filled them all with mirth when the wind came through the notch and seemed to pause before their cottagerattling the door with a sound of wailing and lamentation before it passed into the valley for a moment it saddened them though there was nothing unusual in the tones but the family were glad again when they perceived that the latch was lifted by some traveller whose footsteps had been unheard amid the dreary blast which heralded his approach and wailed as he was entering and went moaning away from the door  though they dwelt in such a solitude these people held daily converse with the world the romantic pass of the notch is a great artery through which the lifeblood of internal commerce is continually throbbing between maine on one side and the green mountains and the shores of the st lawrence on the other the stagecoach always drew up before the door of the cottage the wayfarer with no companion but his staff paused here to exchange a word that the sense of loneliness might not utterly overcome him ere he could pass through the cleft of the mountain or reach the first house in the valley and here the teamster on his way to portland market would put up for the night and if a bachelor might sit an hour beyond the usual bedtime and steal a kiss from the mountain maid at parting it was one of those primitive taverns where the traveller pays only for food and lodging but meets with a homely kindness beyond all price when the footsteps were heard therefore between the outer door and the inner one the whole family rose up grandmother children and all as if about to welcome some one who belonged to them and whose fate was linked with theirs  the door was opened by a young man his face at first wore the melancholy expression almost despondency of one who travels a wild and bleak road at nightfall and alone but soon brightened up when he saw the kindly warmth of his reception he felt his heart spring forward to meet them all from the old woman who wiped a chair with her apron to the little child that held out its arms to him one glance and smile placed the stranger on a footing of innocent familiarity with the eldest daughter  ah this fire is the right thing cried he especially when there is such a pleasant circle round it i am quite benumbed for the notch is just like the pipe of a great pair of bellows it has blown a terrible blast in my face all the way from bartlett  then you are going towards vermont said the master of the house as he helped to take a light knapsack off the young mans shoulders  yes to burlington and far enough beyond replied he i meant to have been at ethan crawfords tonight but a pedestrian lingers along such a road as this it is no matter for when i saw this good fire and all your cheerful faces i felt as if you had kindled it on purpose for me and were waiting my arrival so i shall sit down among you and make myself at home  the frankhearted stranger had just drawn his chair to the fire when something like a heavy footstep was heard without rushing down the steep side of the mountain as with long and rapid strides and taking such a leap in passing the cottage as to strike the opposite precipice the family held their breath because they knew the sound and their guest held his by instinct  the old mountain has thrown a stone at us for fear we should forget him said the landlord recovering himself he sometimes nods his head and threatens to come down but we are old neighbors and agree together pretty well upon the whole besides we have a sure place of refuge hard by if he should be coming in good earnest  let us now suppose the stranger to have finished his supper of bears meat and by his natural felicity of manner to have placed himself on a footing of kindness with the whole family so that they talked as freely together as if he belonged to their mountain brood he was of a proud yet gentle spirithaughty and reserved among the rich and great but ever ready to stoop his head to the lowly cottage door and be like a brother or a son at the poor mans fireside in the household of the notch he found warmth and simplicity of feeling the pervading intelligence of new england and a poetry of native growth which they had gathered when they little thought of it from the mountain peaks and chasms and at the very threshold of their romantic and dangerous abode he had travelled far and alone his whole life indeed had been a solitary path for with the lofty caution of his nature he had kept himself apart from those who might otherwise have been his companions the family too though so kind and hospitable had that consciousness of unity among themselves and separation from the world at large which in every domestic circle should still keep a holy place where no stranger may intrude but this evening a prophetic sympathy impelled the refined and educated youth to pour out his heart before the simple mountaineers and constrained them to answer him with the same free confidence and thus it should have been is not the kindred of a common fate a closer tie than that of birth  the secret of the young mans character was a high and abstracted ambition he could have borne to live an undistinguished life but not to be forgotten in the grave yearning desire had been transformed to hope and hope long cherished had become like certainty that obscurely as he journeyed now a glory was to beam on all his pathwaythough not perhaps while he was treading it but when posterity should gaze back into the gloom of what was now the present they would trace the brightness of his footsteps brightening as meaner glories faded and confess that a gifted one had passed from his cradle to his tomb with none to recognize him  as yet cried the strangerhis cheek glowing and his eye flashing with enthusiasmas yet i have done nothing were i to vanish from the earth tomorrow none would know so much of me as you that a nameless youth came up at nightfall from the valley of the saco and opened his heart to you in the evening and passed through the notch by sunrise and was seen no more not a soul would ask who was he whither did the wanderer go but i cannot die till i have achieved my destiny then let death come i shall have built my monument  there was a continual flow of natural emotion gushing forth amid abstracted reverie which enabled the family to understand this young mans sentiments though so foreign from their own with quick sensibility of the ludicrous he blushed at the ardor into which he had been betrayed  you laugh at me said he taking the eldest daughters hand and laughing himself you think my ambition as nonsensical as if i were to freeze myself to death on the top of mount washington only that people might spy at me from the country round about and truly that would be a noble pedestal for a mans statue  it is better to sit here by this fire answered the girl blushing and be comfortable and contented though nobody thinks about us  i suppose said her father after a fit of musing there is something natural in what the young man says and if my mind had been turned that way i might have felt just the same it is strange wife how his talk has set my head running on things that are pretty certain never to come to pass  perhaps they may observed the wife is the man thinking what he will do when he is a widower  no no cried he repelling the idea with reproachful kindness when i think of your death esther i think of mine too but i was wishing we had a good farm in bartlett or bethlehem or littleton or some other township round the white mountains but not where they could tumble on our heads i should want to stand well with my neighbors and be called squire and sent to general court for a term or two for a plain honest man may do as much good there as a lawyer and when i should be grown quite an old man and you an old woman so as not to be long apart i might die happy enough in my bed and leave you all crying around me a slate gravestone would suit me as well as a marble onewith just my name and age and a verse of a hymn and something to let people know that i lived an honest man and died a christian  there now exclaimed the stranger it is our nature to desire a monument be it slate or marble or a pillar of granite or a glorious memory in the universal heart of man  were in a strange way tonight said the wife with tears in her eyes they say its a sign of something when folks minds go a wandering so hark to the children  they listened accordingly the younger children had been put to bed in another room but with an open door between so that they could be heard talking busily among themselves one and all seemed to have caught the infection from the fireside circle and were outvying each other in wild wishes and childish projects of what they would do when they came to be men and women at length a little boy instead of addressing his brothers and sisters called out to his mother  ill tell you what i wish mother cried he i want you and father and grandmam and all of us and the stranger too to start right away and go and take a drink out of the basin of the flume  nobody could help laughing at the childs notion of leaving a warm bed and dragging them from a cheerful fire to visit the basin of the flumea brook which tumbles over the precipice deep within the notch the boy had hardly spoken when a wagon rattled along the road and stopped a moment before the door it appeared to contain two or three men who were cheering their hearts with the rough chorus of a song which resounded in broken notes between the cliffs while the singers hesitated whether to continue their journey or put up here for the night  father said the girl they are calling you by name  but the good man doubted whether they had really called him and was unwilling to show himself too solicitous of gain by inviting people to patronize his house he therefore did not hurry to the door and the lash being soon applied the travellers plunged into the notch still singing and laughing though their music and mirth came back drearily from the heart of the mountain  there mother cried the boy again theyd have given us a ride to the flume  again they laughed at the childs pertinacious fancy for a night ramble but it happened that a light cloud passed over the daughters spirit she looked gravely into the fire and drew a breath that was almost a sigh it forced its way in spite of a little struggle to repress it then starting and blushing she looked quickly round the circle as if they had caught a glimpse into her bosom the stranger asked what she had been thinking of  nothing answered she with a downcast smile only i felt lonesome just then  oh i have always had a gift of feeling what is in other peoples hearts said he half seriously shall i tell the secrets of yours for i know what to think when a young girl shivers by a warm hearth and complains of lonesomeness at her mothers side shall i put these feelings into words  they would not be a girls feelings any longer if they could be put into words replied the mountain nymph laughing but avoiding his eye  all this was said apart perhaps a germ of love was springing in their hearts so pure that it might blossom in paradise since it could not be matured on earth for women worship such gentle dignity as his and the proud contemplative yet kindly soul is oftenest captivated by simplicity like hers but while they spoke softly and he was watching the happy sadness the lightsome shadows the shy yearnings of a maidens nature the wind through the notch took a deeper and drearier sound it seemed as the fanciful stranger said like the choral strain of the spirits of the blast who in old indian times had their dwelling among these mountains and made their heights and recesses a sacred region there was a wail along the road as if a funeral were passing to chase away the gloom the family threw pine branches on their fire till the dry leaves crackled and the flame arose discovering once again a scene of peace and humble happiness the light hovered about them fondly and caressed them all there were the little faces of the children peeping from their bed apart and here the fathers frame of strength the mothers subdued and careful mien the highbrowed youth the budding girl and the good old grandam still knitting in the warmest place the aged woman looked up from her task and with fingers ever busy was the next to speak  old folks have their notions said she as well as young ones youve been wishing and planning and letting your heads run on one thing and another till youve set my mind a wandering too now what should an old woman wish for when she can go but a step or two before she comes to her grave children it will haunt me night and day till i tell you  what is it mother cried the husband and wife at once  then the old woman with an air of mystery which drew the circle closer round the fire informed them that she had provided her graveclothes some years beforea nice linen shroud a cap with a muslin ruff and everything of a finer sort than she had worn since her wedding day but this evening an old superstition had strangely recurred to her it used to be said in her younger days that if anything were amiss with a corpse if only the ruff were not smooth or the cap did not set right the corpse in the coffin and beneath the clods would strive to put up its cold hands and arrange it the bare thought made her nervous  dont talk so grandmother said the girl shuddering  nowcontinued the old woman with singular earnestness yet smiling strangely at her own follyi want one of you my childrenwhen your mother is dressed and in the coffini want one of you to hold a lookingglass over my face who knows but i may take a glimpse at myself and see whether alls right  old and young we dream of graves and monuments murmured the stranger youth i wonder how mariners feel when the ship is sinking and they unknown and undistinguished are to be buried together in the oceanthat wide and nameless sepulchre  for a moment the old womans ghastly conception so engrossed the minds of her hearers that a sound abroad in the night rising like the roar of a blast had grown broad deep and terrible before the fated group were conscious of it the house and all within it trembled the foundations of the earth seemed to be shaken as if this awful sound were the peal of the last trump young and old exchanged one wild glance and remained an instant pale affrighted without utterance or power to move then the same shriek burst simultaneously from all their lips  the slide the slide  the simplest words must intimate but not portray the unutterable horror of the catastrophe the victims rushed from their cottage and sought refuge in what they deemed a safer spotwhere in contemplation of such an emergency a sort of barrier had been reared alas they had quitted their security and fled right into the pathway of destruction down came the whole side of the mountain in a cataract of ruin just before it reached the house the stream broke into two branchesshivered not a window there but overwhelmed the whole vicinity blocked up the road and annihilated everything in its dreadful course long ere the thunder of the great slide had ceased to roar among the mountains the mortal agony had been endured and the victims were at peace their bodies were never found  the next morning the light smoke was seen stealing from the cottage chimney up the mountain side within the fire was yet smouldering on the hearth and the chairs in a circle round it as if the inhabitants had but gone forth to view the devastation of the slide and would shortly return to thank heaven for their miraculous escape all had left separate tokens by which those who had known the family were made to shed a tear for each who has not heard their name the story has been told far and wide and will forever be a legend of these mountains poets have sung their fate  there were circumstances which led some to suppose that a stranger had been received into the cottage on this awful night and had shared the catastrophe of all its inmates others denied that there were sufficient grounds for such a conjecture woe for the highsouled youth with his dream of earthly immortality his name and person utterly unknown his history his way of life his plans a mystery never to be solved his death and his existence equally a doubt whose was the agony of that death moment     peter goldthwaites treasure   and so peter you wont even consider of the business said mr john brown buttoning his surtout over the snug rotundity of his person and drawing on his gloves you positively refuse to let me have this crazy old house and the land under and adjoining at the price named  neither at that nor treble the sum responded the gaunt grizzled and threadbare peter goldthwaite the fact is mr brown you must find another site for your brick block and be content to leave my estate with the present owner next summer i intend to put a splendid new mansion over the cellar of the old house  pho peter cried mr brown as he opened the kitchen door content yourself with building castles in the air where houselots are cheaper than on earth to say nothing of the cost of bricks and mortar such foundations are solid enough for your edifices while this underneath us is just the thing for mine and so we may both be suited what say you again  precisely what i said before mr brown answered peter goldthwaite and as for castles in the air mine may not be as magnificent as that sort of architecture but perhaps as substantial mr brown as the very respectable brick block with dry goods stores tailors shops and banking rooms on the lower floor and lawyers offices in the second story which you are so anxious to substitute  and the cost peter eh said mr brown as he withdrew in something of a pet that i suppose will be provided for offhand by drawing a check on bubble bank  john brown and peter goldthwaite had been jointly known to the commercial world between twenty and thirty years before under the firm of goldthwaite  brown which copartnership however was speedily dissolved by the natural incongruity of its constituent parts since that event john brown with exactly the qualities of a thousand other john browns and by just such plodding methods as they used had prospered wonderfully and become one of the wealthiest john browns on earth peter goldthwaite on the contrary after innumerable schemes which ought to have collected all the coin and paper currency of the country into his coffers was as needy a gentleman as ever wore a patch upon his elbow the contrast between him and his former partner may be briefly marked for brown never reckoned upon luck yet always had it while peter made luck the main condition of his projects and always missed it while the means held out his speculations had been magnificent but were chiefly confined of late years to such small business as adventures in the lottery once he had gone on a goldgathering expedition somewhere to the south and ingeniously contrived to empty his pockets more thoroughly than ever while others doubtless were filling theirs with native bullion by the handful more recently he had expended a legacy of a thousand or two of dollars in purchasing mexican scrip and thereby became the proprietor of a province which however so far as peter could find out was situated where he might have had an empire for the same moneyin the clouds from a search after this valuable real estate peter returned so gaunt and threadbare that on reaching new england the scarecrows in the cornfields beckoned to him as he passed by they did but flutter in the wind quoth peter goldthwaite no peter they beckoned for the scarecrows knew their brother  at the period of our story his whole visible income would not have paid the tax of the old mansion in which we find him it was one of those rusty mossgrown manypeaked wooden houses which are scattered about the streets of our elder towns with a beetlebrowed second story projecting over the foundation as if it frowned at the novelty around it this old paternal edifice needy as he was and though being centrally situated on the principal street of the town it would have brought him a handsome sum the sagacious peter had his own reasons for never parting with either by auction or private sale there seemed indeed to be a fatality that connected him with his birthplace for often as he had stood on the verge of ruin and standing there even now he had not yet taken the step beyond it which would have compelled him to surrender the house to his creditors so here he dwelt with bad luck till good should come  here then in his kitchen the only room where a spark of fire took off the chill of a november evening poor peter goldthwaite had just been visited by his rich old partner at the close of their interview peter with rather a mortified look glanced downwards at his dress parts of which appeared as ancient as the days of goldthwaite  brown his upper garment was a mixed surtout wofully faded and patched with newer stuff on each elbow beneath this he wore a threadbare black coat some of the silk buttons of which had been replaced with others of a different pattern and lastly though he lacked not a pair of gray pantaloons they were very shabby ones and had been partially turned brown by the frequent toasting of peters shins before a scanty fire peters person was in keeping with his goodly apparel grayheaded holloweyed palecheeked and leanbodied he was the perfect picture of a man who had fed on windy schemes and empty hopes till he could neither live on such unwholesome trash nor stomach more substantial food but withal this peter goldthwaite crackbrained simpleton as perhaps he was might have cut a very brilliant figure in the world had he employed his imagination in the airy business of poetry instead of making it a demon of mischief in mercantile pursuits after all he was no bad fellow but as harmless as a child and as honest and honorable and as much of the gentleman which nature meant him for as an irregular life and depressed circumstances will permit any man to be  as peter stood on the uneven bricks of his hearth looking round at the disconsolate old kitchen his eyes began to kindle with the illumination of an enthusiasm that never long deserted him he raised his hand clinched it and smote it energetically against the smoky panel over the fireplace  the time is come said he with such a treasure at command it were folly to be a poor man any longer tomorrow morning i will begin with the garret nor desist till i have torn the house down  deep in the chimneycorner like a witch in a dark cavern sat a little old woman mending one of the two pairs of stockings wherewith peter goldthwaite kept his toes from being frostbitten as the feet were ragged past all darning she had cut pieces out of a castoff flannel petticoat to make new soles tabitha porter was an old maid upwards of sixty years of age fiftyfive of which she had sat in that same chimneycorner such being the length of time since peters grandfather had taken her from the almshouse she had no friend but peter nor peter any friend but tabitha so long as peter might have a shelter for his own head tabitha would know where to shelter hers or being homeless elsewhere she would take her master by the hand and bring him to her native home the almshouse should it ever be necessary she loved him well enough to feed him with her last morsel and clothe him with her under petticoat but tabitha was a queer old woman and though never infected with peters flightiness had become so accustomed to his freaks and follies that she viewed them all as matters of course hearing him threaten to tear the house down she looked quietly up from her work  best leave the kitchen till the last mr peter said she  the sooner we have it all down the better said peter goldthwaite i am tired to death of living in this cold dark windy smoky creaking groaning dismal old house i shall feel like a younger man when we get into my splendid brick mansion as please heaven we shall by this time next autumn you shall have a room on the sunny side old tabby finished and furnished as best may suit your own notions  i should like it pretty much such a room as this kitchen answered tabitha it will never be like home to me till the chimneycorner gets as black with smoke as this and that wont be these hundred years how much do you mean to lay out on the house mr peter  what is that to the purpose exclaimed peter loftily did not my greatgranduncle peter goldthwaite who died seventy years ago and whose namesake i am leave treasure enough to build twenty such  i cant say but he did mr peter said tabitha threading her needle  tabitha well understood that peter had reference to an immense hoard of the precious metals which was said to exist somewhere in the cellar or walls or under the floors or in some concealed closet or other outoftheway nook of the house this wealth according to tradition had been accumulated by a former peter goldthwaite whose character seems to have borne a remarkable similitude to that of the peter of our story like him he was a wild projector seeking to heap up gold by the bushel and the cartload instead of scraping it together coin by coin like peter the second too his projects had almost invariably failed and but for the magnificent success of the final one would have left him with hardly a coat and pair of breeches to his gaunt and grizzled person reports were various as to the nature of his fortunate speculation one intimating that the ancient peter had made the gold by alchemy another that he had conjured it out of peoples pockets by the black art and a third still more unaccountable that the devil had given him free access to the old provincial treasury it was affirmed however that some secret impediment had debarred him from the enjoyment of his riches and that he had a motive for concealing them from his heir or at any rate had died without disclosing the place of deposit the present peters father had faith enough in the story to cause the cellar to be dug over peter himself chose to consider the legend as an indisputable truth and amid his many troubles had this one consolation that should all other resources fail he might build up his fortunes by tearing his house down yet unless he felt a lurking distrust of the golden tale it is difficult to account for his permitting the paternal roof to stand so long since he had never yet seen the moment when his predecessors treasure would not have found plenty of room in his own strong box but now was the crisis should he delay the search a little longer the house would pass from the lineal heir and with it the vast heap of gold to remain in its burialplace till the ruin of the aged walls should discover it to strangers of a future generation  yes cried peter goldthwaite again tomorrow i will set about it  the deeper he looked at the matter the more certain of success grew peter his spirits were naturally so elastic that even now in the blasted autumn of his age he could often compete with the springtime gayety of other people enlivened by his brightening prospects he began to caper about the kitchen like a hobgoblin with the queerest antics of his lean limbs and gesticulations of his starved features nay in the exuberance of his feelings he seized both of tabithas hands and danced the old lady across the floor till the oddity of her rheumatic motions set him into a roar of laughter which was echoed back from the rooms and chambers as if peter goldthwaite were laughing in every one finally he bounded upward almost out of sight into the smoke that clouded the roof of the kitchen and alighting safely on the floor again endeavored to resume his customary gravity  tomorrow at sunrise he repeated taking his lamp to retire to bed ill see whether this treasure be hid in the wall of the garret  and as were out of wood mr peter said tabitha puffing and panting with her late gymnastics as fast as you tear the house down ill make a fire with the pieces  gorgeous that night were the dreams of peter goldthwaite at one time he was turning a ponderous key in an iron door not unlike the door of a sepulchre but which being opened disclosed a vault heaped up with gold coin as plentifully as golden corn in a granary there were chased goblets also and tureens salvers dinner dishes and dish covers of gold or silver gilt besides chains and other jewels incalculably rich though tarnished with the damps of the vault for of all the wealth that was irrevocably lost to the man whether buried in the earth or sunken in the sea peter goldthwaite had found it in this one treasureplace anon he had returned to the old house as poor as ever and was received at the door by the gaunt and grizzled figure of a man whom he might have mistaken for himself only that his garments were of a much elder fashion but the house without losing its former aspect had been changed into a palace of the precious metals the floors walls and ceiling were of burnished silver the doors the window frames the cornices the balustrades and the steps of the staircase of pure gold and silver with gold bottoms were the chairs and gold standing on silver legs the high chests of drawers and silver the bedsteads with blankets of woven gold and sheets of silver tissue the house had evidently been transmuted by a single touch for it retained all the marks that peter remembered but in gold or silver instead of wood and the initials of his name which when a boy he had cut in the wooden doorpost remained as deep in the pillar of gold a happy man would have been peter goldthwaite except for a certain ocular deception which whenever he glanced backwards caused the house to darken from its glittering magnificence into the sordid gloom of yesterday  up betimes rose peter seized an axe hammer and saw which he had placed by his bedside and hied him to the garret it was but scantily lighted up as yet by the frosty fragments of a sunbeam which began to glimmer through the almost opaque bullseyes of the window a moralizer might find abundant themes for his speculative and impracticable wisdom in a garret there is the limbo of departed fashions aged trifles of a day and whatever was valuable only to one generation of men and which passed to the garret when that generation passed to the grave not for safe keeping but to be out of the way peter saw piles of yellow and musty accountbooks in parchment covers wherein creditors long dead and buried had written the names of dead and buried debtors in ink now so faded that their mossgrown tombstones were more legible he found old motheaten garments all in rags and tatters or peter would have put them on here was a naked and rusty sword not a sword of service but a gentlemans small french rapier which had never left its scabbard till it lost it here were canes of twenty different sorts but no goldheaded ones and shoebuckles of various pattern and material but not silver nor set with precious stones here was a large box full of shoes with high heels and peaked toes here on a shelf were a multitude of phials halffilled with old apothecaries stuff which when the other half had done its business on peters ancestors had been brought hither from the death chamber herenot to give a longer inventory of articles that will never be put up at auctionwas the fragment of a fulllength lookingglass which by the dust and dimness of its surface made the picture of these old things look older than the reality when peter not knowing that there was a mirror there caught the faint traces of his own figure he partly imagined that the former peter goldthwaite had come back either to assist or impede his search for the hidden wealth and at that moment a strange notion glimmered through his brain that he was the identical peter who had concealed the gold and ought to know whereabout it lay this however he had unacountably forgotten  well mr peter cried tabitha on the garret stairs have you torn the house down enough to heat the teakettle  not yet old tabby answered peter but thats soon doneas you shall see  with the word in his mouth he uplifted the axe and laid about him so vigorously that the dust flew the boards crashed and in a twinkling the old woman had an apron full of broken rubbish  we shall get our winters wood cheap quoth tabitha  the good work being thus commenced peter beat down all before him smiting and hewing at the joists and timbers unclinching spikenails ripping and tearing away boards with a tremendous racket from morning till night he took care however to leave the outside shell of the house untouched so that the neighbors might not suspect what was going on  never in any of his vagaries though each had made him happy while it lasted had peter been happier than now perhaps after all there was something in peter goldthwaites turn of mind which brought him an inward recompense for all the external evil that it caused if he were poor illclad even hungry and exposed as it were to be utterly annihilated by a precipice of impending ruin yet only his body remained in these miserable circumstances while his aspiring soul enjoyed the sunshine of a bright futurity it was his nature to be always young and the tendency of his mode of life to keep him so gray hairs were nothing no nor wrinkles nor infirmity he might look old indeed and be somewhat disagreeably connected with a gaunt old figure much the worse for wear but the true the essential peter was a young man of high hopes just entering on the world at the kindling of each new fire his burntout youth rose afresh from the old embers and ashes it rose exulting now having lived thus longnot too long but just to the right agea susceptible bachelor with warm and tender dreams he resolved so soon as the hidden gold should flash to light to go awooing and win the love of the fairest maid in town what heart could resist him happy peter goldthwaite  every eveningas peter had long absented himself from his former loungingplaces at insurance offices newsrooms and bookstores and as the honor of his company was seldom requested in private circleshe and tabitha used to sit down sociably by the kitchen hearth this was always heaped plentifully with the rubbish of his days labor as the foundation of the fire there would be a goodlysized backlog of red oak which after being sheltered from rain or damp above a century still hissed with the heat and distilled streams of water from each end as if the tree had been cut down within a week or two next these were large sticks sound black and heavy which had lost the principle of decay and were indestructible except by fire wherein they glowed like redhot bars of iron on this solid basis tabitha would rear a lighter structure composed of the splinters of door panels ornamented mouldings and such quick combustibles which caught like straw and threw a brilliant blaze high up the spacious flue making its sooty sides visible almost to the chimneytop meantime the gleam of the old kitchen would be chased out of the cobwebbed corners and away from the dusky crossbeams overhead and driven nobody could tell whither while peter smiled like a gladsome man and tabitha seemed a picture of comfortable age all this of course was but an emblem of the bright fortune which the destruction of the house would shed upon its occupants  while the dry pine was flaming and crackling like an irregular discharge of fairy musketry peter sat looking and listening in a pleasant state of excitement but when the brief blaze and uproar were succeeded by the darkred glow the substantial heat and the deep singing sound which were to last throughout the evening his humor became talkative one night the hundredth time he teased tabitha to tell him something new about his greatgranduncle  you have been sitting in that chimneycorner fiftyfive years old tabby and must have heard many a tradition about him said peter did not you tell me that when you first came to the house there was an old woman sitting where you sit now who had been housekeeper to the famous peter goldthwaite  so there was mr peter answered tabitha and she was near about a hundred years old she used to say that she and old peter goldthwaite had often spent a sociable evening by the kitchen firepretty much as you and i are doing now mr peter  the old fellow must have resembled me in more points than one said peter complacently or he never would have grown so rich but methinks he might have invested the money better than he didno interestnothing but good securityand the house to be torn down to come at it what made him hide it so snug tabby  because he could not spend it said tabitha for as often as he went to unlock the chest the old scratch came behind and caught his arm the money they say was paid peter out of his purse and he wanted peter to give him a deed of this house and land which peter swore he would not do  just as i swore to john brown my old partner remarked peter but this is all nonsense tabby i dont believe the story  well it may not be just the truth said tabitha for some folks say that peter did make over the house to the old scratch and thats the reason it has always been so unlucky to them that lived in it and as soon as peter had given him the deed the chest flew open and peter caught up a handful of the gold but lo and beholdthere was nothing in his fist but a parcel of old rags  hold your tongue you silly old tabby cried peter in great wrath they were as good golden guineas as ever bore the effigies of the king of england it seems as if i could recollect the whole circumstance and how i or old peter or whoever it was thrust in my hand or his hand and drew it out all of a blaze with gold old rags indeed  but it was not an old womans legend that would discourage peter goldthwaite all night long he slept among pleasant dreams and awoke at daylight with a joyous throb of the heart which few are fortunate enough to feel beyond their boyhood day after day he labored hard without wasting a moment except at meal times when tabitha summoned him to the pork and cabbage or such other sustenance as she had picked up or providence had sent them being a truly pious man peter never failed to ask a blessing if the food were none of the best then so much the more earnestly as it was more needednor to return thanks if the dinner had been scanty yet for the good appetite which was better than a sick stomach at a feast then did he hurry back to his toil and in a moment was lost to sight in a cloud of dust from the old walls though sufficiently perceptible to the ear by the clatter which he raised in the midst of it how enviable is the consciousness of being usefully employed nothing troubled peter or nothing but those phantoms of the mind which seem like vague recollections yet have also the aspect of presentiments he often paused with his axe uplifted in the air and said to himselfpeter goldthwaite did you never strike this blow before or peter what need of tearing the whole house down think a little while and you will remember where the gold is hidden days and weeks passed on however without any remarkable discovery sometimes indeed a lean gray rat peeped forth at the lean gray man wondering what devil had got into the old house which had always been so peaceable till now and occasionally peter sympathized with the sorrows of a female mouse who had brought five or six pretty little soft and delicate young ones into the world just in time to see them crushed by its ruin but as yet no treasure  by this time peter being as determined as fate and as diligent as time had made an end with the uppermost regions and got down to the second story where he was busy in one of the front chambers it had formerly been the state bedchamber and was honored by tradition as the sleeping apartment of governor dudley and many other eminent guests the furniture was gone there were remnants of faded and tattered paperhangings but larger spaces of bare wall ornamented with charcoal sketches chiefly of peoples heads in profile these being specimens of peters youthful genius it went more to his heart to obliterate them than if they had been pictures on a church wall by michael angelo one sketch however and that the best one affected him differently it represented a ragged man partly supporting himself on a spade and bending his lean body over a hole in the earth with one hand extended to grasp something that he had found but close behind him with a fiendish laugh on his features appeared a figure with horns a tufted tail and a cloven hoof  avaunt satan cried peter the man shall have his gold  uplifting his axe he hit the horned gentleman such a blow on the head as not only demolished him but the treasureseeker also and caused the whole scene to vanish like magic moreover his axe broke quite through the plaster and laths and discovered a cavity  mercy on us mr peter are you quarrelling with the old scratch said tabitha who was seeking some fuel to put under the pot  without answering the old woman peter broke down a further space of the wall and laid open a small closet or cupboard on one side of the fireplace about breast high from the ground it contained nothing but a brass lamp covered with verdigris and a dusty piece of parchment while peter inspected the latter tabitha seized the lamp and began to rub it with her apron  there is no use in rubbing it tabitha said peter it is not aladdins lamp though i take it to be a token of as much luck look here tabby  tabitha took the parchment and held it close to her nose which was saddled with a pair of ironbound spectacles but no sooner had she began to puzzle over it than she burst into a chuckling laugh holding both her hands against her sides  you cant make a fool of the old woman cried she this is your own handwriting mr peter the same as in the letter you sent me from mexico  there is certainly a considerable resemblance said peter again examining the parchment but you know yourself tabby that this closet must have been plastered up before you came to the house or i came into the world no this is old peter goldthwaites writing these columns of pounds shillings and pence are his figures denoting the amount of the treasure and this at the bottom is doubtless a reference to the place of concealment but the ink has either faded or peeled off so that it is absolutely illegible what a pity  well this lamp is as good as new thats some comfort said tabitha  a lamp thought peter that indicates light on my researches  for the present peter felt more inclined to ponder on this discovery than to resume his labors after tabitha had gone down stairs he stood poring over the parchment at one of the front windows which was so obscured with dust that the sun could barely throw an uncertain shadow of the casement across the floor peter forced it open and looked out upon the great street of the town while the sun looked in at his old house the air though mild and even warm thrilled peter as with a dash of water  it was the first day of the january thaw the snow lay deep upon the housetops but was rapidly dissolving into millions of waterdrops which sparkled downwards through the sunshine with the noise of a summer shower beneath the eaves along the street the trodden snow was as hard and solid as a pavement of white marble and had not yet grown moist in the springlike temperature but when peter thrust forth his head he saw that the inhabitants if not the town were already thawed out by this warm day after two or three weeks of winter weather it gladdened him a gladness with a sigh breathing through itto see the stream of ladies gliding along the slippery sidewalks with their red cheeks set off by quilted hoods boas and sable capes like roses amidst a new kind of foliage the sleighbells jingled to and fro continually sometimes announcing the arrival of a sleigh from vermont laden with the frozen bodies of porkers or sheep and perhaps a deer or two sometimes of a regular marketman with chickens geese and turkeys comprising the whole colony of a barn yard and sometimes of a farmer and his dame who had come to town partly for the ride partly to go ashopping and partly for the sale of some eggs and butter this couple rode in an oldfashioned square sleigh which had served them twenty winters and stood twenty summers in the sun beside their door now a gentleman and lady skimmed the snow in an elegant car shaped somewhat like a cockleshell now a stagesleigh with its cloth curtains thrust aside to admit the sun dashed rapidly down the street whirling in and out among the vehicles that obstructed its passage now came round a corner the similitude of noahs ark on runners being an immense open sleigh with seats for fifty people and drawn by a dozen horses this spacious receptacle was populous with merry maids and merry bachelors merry girls and boys and merry old folks all alive with fun and grinning to the full width of their mouths they kept up a buzz of babbling voices and low laughter and sometimes burst into a deep joyous shout which the spectators answered with three cheers while a gang of roguish boys let drive their snowballs right among the pleasure party the sleigh passed on and when concealed by a bend of the street was still audible by a distant cry of merriment  never had peter beheld a livelier scene than was constituted by all these accessories the bright sun the flashing waterdrops the gleaming snow the cheerful multitude the variety of rapid vehicles and the jingle jangle of merry bells which made the heart dance to their music nothing dismal was to be seen except that peaked piece of antiquity peter goldthwaites house which might well look sad externally since such a terrible consumption was preying on its insides and peters gaunt figure half visible in the projecting second story was worthy of his house  peter how goes it friend peter cried a voice across the street as peter was drawing in his head look out here peter  peter looked and saw his old partner mr john brown on the opposite sidewalk portly and comfortable with his furred cloak thrown open disclosing a handsome surtout beneath his voice had directed the attention of the whole town to peter goldthwaites window and to the dusty scarecrow which appeared at it  i say peter cried mr brown again what the devil are you about there that i hear such a racket whenever i pass by you are repairing the old house i supposemaking a new one of it eh  too late for that i am afraid mr brown replied peter if i make it new it will be new inside and out from the cellar upwards  had not you better let me take the job said mr brown significantly  not yet answered peter hastily shutting the window for ever since he had been in search of the treasure he hated to have people stare at him  as he drew back ashamed of his outward poverty yet proud of the secret wealth within his grasp a haughty smile shone out on peters visage with precisely the effect of the dim sunbeams in the squalid chamber he endeavored to assume such a mien as his ancestor had probably worn when he gloried in the building of a strong house for a home to many generations of his posterity but the chamber was very dark to his snowdazzled eyes and very dismal too in contrast with the living scene that he had just looked upon his brief glimpse into the street had given him a forcible impression of the manner in which the world kept itself cheerful and prosperous by social pleasures and an intercourse of business while he in seclusion was pursuing an object that might possibly be a phantasm by a method which most people would call madness it is one great advantage of a gregarious mode of life that each person rectifies his mind by other minds and squares his conduct to that of his neighbors so as seldom to be lost in eccentricity peter goldthwaite had exposed himself to this influence by merely looking out of the window for a while he doubted whether there were any hidden chest of gold and in that case whether he was so exceedingly wise to tear the house down only to be convinced of its nonexistence  but this was momentary peter the destroyer resumed the task which fate had assigned him nor faltered again till it was accomplished in the course of his search he met with many things that are usually found in the ruins of an old house and also with some that are not what seemed most to the purpose was a rusty key which had been thrust into a chink of the wall with a wooden label appended to the handle bearing the initials p g another singular discovery was that of a bottle of wine walled up in an old oven a tradition ran in the family that peters grandfather a jovial officer in the old french war had set aside many dozens of the precious liquor for the benefit of topers then unborn peter needed no cordial to sustain his hopes and therefore kept the wine to gladden his success many halfpence did he pick up that had been lost through the cracks of the floor and some few spanish coins and the half of a broken sixpence which had doubtless been a love token there was likewise a silver coronation medal of george the third but old peter goldthwaites strong box fled from one dark corner to another or otherwise eluded the second peters clutches till should he seek much farther he must burrow into the earth  we will not follow him in his triumphant progress step by step suffice it that peter worked like a steamengine and finished in that one winter the job which all the former inhabitants of the house with time and the elements to aid them had only half done in a century except the kitchen every room and chamber was now gutted the house was nothing but a shellthe apparition of a houseas unreal as the painted edifices of a theatre it was like the perfect rind of a great cheese in which a mouse had dwelt and nibbled till it was a cheese no more and peter was the mouse  what peter had torn down tabitha had burned up for she wisely considered that without a house they should need no wood to warm it and therefore economy was nonsense thus the whole house might be said to have dissolved in smoke and flown up among the clouds through the great black flue of the kitchen chimney it was an admirable parallel to the feat of the man who jumped down his own throat  on the night between the last day of winter and the first of spring every chink and cranny had been ransacked except within the precincts of the kitchen this fated evening was an ugly one a snowstorm had set in some hours before and was still driven and tossed about the atmosphere by a real hurricane which fought against the house as if the prince of the air in person were putting the final stroke to peters labors the framework being so much weakened and the inward props removed it would have been no marvel if in some stronger wrestle of the blast the rotten walls of the edifice and all the peaked roofs had come crushing down upon the owners head he however was careless of the peril but as wild and restless as the night itself or as the flame that quivered up the chimney at each roar of the tempestuous wind  the wine tabitha he cried my grandfathers rich old wine we will drink it now  tabitha arose from her smokeblackened bench in the chimneycorner and placed the bottle before peter close beside the old brass lamp which had likewise been the prize of his researches peter held it before his eyes and looking through the liquid medium beheld the kitchen illuminated with a golden glory which also enveloped tabitha and gilded her silver hair and converted her mean garments into robes of queenly splendor it reminded him of his golden dream  mr peter remarked tabitha must the wine be drunk before the money is found  the money is found exclaimed peter with a sort of fierceness the chest is within my reach i will not sleep till i have turned this key in the rusty lock but first of all let us drink  there being no corkscrew in the house he smote the neck of the bottle with old peter goldthwaites rusty key and decapitated the sealed cork at a single blow he then filled two little china teacups which tabitha had brought from the cupboard so clear and brilliant was this aged wine that it shone within the cups and rendered the sprig of scarlet flowers at the bottom of each more distinctly visible than when there had been no wine there its rich and delicate perfume wasted itself round the kitchen  drink tabitha cried peter blessings on the honest old fellow who set aside this good liquor for you and me and heres to peter goldthwaites memory  and good cause have we to remember him quoth tabitha as she drank  how many years and through what changes of fortune and various calamity had that bottle hoarded up its effervescent joy to be quaffed at last by two such boon companions a portion of the happiness of the former age had been kept for them and was now set free in a crowd of rejoicing visions to sport amid the storm and desolation of the present time until they have finished the bottle we must turn our eyes elsewhere  it so chanced that on this stormy night mr john brown found himself ill at ease in his wirecushioned armchair by the glowing grate of anthracite which heated his handsome parlor he was naturally a good sort of a man and kind and pitiful whenever the misfortunes of others happened to reach his heart through the padded vest of his own prosperity this evening he had thought much about his old partner peter goldthwaite his strange vagaries and continual ill luck the poverty of his dwelling at mr browns last visit and peters crazed and haggard aspect when he had talked with him at the window  poor fellow thought mr john brown poor crackbrained peter goldthwaite for old acquaintance sake i ought to have taken care that he was comfortable this rough winter  these feelings grew so powerful that in spite of the inclement weather he resolved to visit peter goldthwaite immediately the strength of the impulse was really singular every shriek of the blast seemed a summons or would have seemed so had mr brown been accustomed to hear the echoes of his own fancy in the wind much amazed at such active benevolence he huddled himself in his cloak muffled his throat and ears in comforters and handkerchiefs and thus fortified bade defiance to the tempest but the powers of the air had rather the best of the battle mr brown was just weathering the corner by peter goldthwaites house when the hurricane caught him off his feet tossed him face downward into a snow bank and proceeded to bury his protuberant part beneath fresh drifts there seemed little hope of his reappearance earlier than the next thaw at the same moment his hat was snatched away and whirled aloft into some far distant region whence no tidings have as yet returned  nevertheless mr brown contrived to burrow a passage through the snowdrift and with his bare head bent against the storm floundered onward to peters door there was such a creaking and groaning and rattling and such an ominous shaking throughout the crazy edifice that the loudest rap would have been inaudible to those within he therefore entered without ceremony and groped his way to the kitchen  his intrusion even there was unnoticed peter and tabitha stood with their backs to the door stooping over a large chest which apparently they had just dragged from a cavity or concealed closet on the left side of the chimney by the lamp in the old womans hand mr brown saw that the chest was barred and clamped with iron strengthened with iron plates and studded with iron nails so as to be a fit receptacle in which the wealth of one century might be hoarded up for the wants of another peter goldthwaite was inserting a key into the lock  o tabitha cried he with tremulous rapture how shall i endure the effulgence the goldthe bright bright gold methinks i can remember my last glance at it just as the ironplated lid fell down and ever since being seventy years it has been blazing in secret and gathering its splendor against this glorious moment it will flash upon us like the noonday sun  then shade your eyes mr peter said tabitha with somewhat less patience than usual but for mercys sake do turn the key  and with a strong effort of both hands peter did force the rusty key through the intricacies of the rusty lock mr brown in the mean time had drawn near and thrust his eager visage between those of the other two at the instant that peter threw up the lid no sudden blaze illuminated the kitchen  whats here exclaimed tabitha adjusting her spectacles and holding the lamp over the open chest old peter goldthwaites hoard of old rags  pretty much so tabby said mr brown lifting a handful of the treasure  oh what a ghost of dead and buried wealth had peter goldthwaite raised to scare himself out of his scanty wits withal here was the semblance of an incalculable sum enough to purchase the whole town and build every street anew but which vast as it was no sane man would have given a solid sixpence for what then in sober earnest were the delusive treasures of the chest why here were old provincial bills of credit and treasury notes and bills of land banks and all other bubbles of the sort from the first issue above a century and a half ago down nearly to the revolution bills of a thousand pounds were intermixed with parchment pennies and worth no more than they  and this then is old peter goldthwaites treasure said john brown your namesake peter was something like yourself and when the provincial currency had depreciated fifty or seventyfive per cent he bought it up in expectation of a rise i have heard my grandfather say that old peter gave his father a mortgage of this very house and land to raise cash for his silly project but the currency kept sinking till nobody would take it as a gift and there was old peter goldthwaite like peter the second with thousands in his strong box and hardly a coat to his back he went mad upon the strength of it but never mind peter it is just the sort of capital for building castles in the air  the house will be down about our ears cried tabitha as the wind shook it with increasing violence  let it fall said peter folding his arms as he seated himself upon the chest  no no my old friend peter said john brown i have house room for you and tabby and a safe vault for the chest of treasure tomorrow we will try to come to an agreement about the sale of this old house real estate is well up and i could afford you a pretty handsome price  and i observed peter goldthwaite with reviving spirits have a plan for laying out the cash to great advantage  why as to that muttered john brown to himself we must apply to the next court for a guardian to take care of the solid cash and if peter insists upon speculating he may do it to his hearts content with old peter goldthwaites treasure     the shaker bridal  one day in the sick chamber of father ephraim who had been forty years the presiding elder over the shaker settlement at goshen there was an assemblage of several of the chief men of the sect individuals had come from the rich establishment at lebanon from canterbury harvard and alfred and from all the other localities where this strange people have fertilized the rugged hills of new england by their systematic industry an elder was likewise there who had made a pilgrimage of a thousand miles from a village of the faithful in kentucky to visit his spiritual kindred the children of the sainted mother ann he had partaken of the homely abundance of their tables had quaffed the farfamed shaker cider and had joined in the sacred dance every step of which is believed to alienate the enthusiast from earth and bear him onward to heavenly purity and bliss his brethren of the north had now courteously invited him to be present on an occasion when the concurrence of every eminent member of their community was peculiarly desirable  the venerable father ephraim sat in his easy chair not only hoary headed and infirm with age but worn down by a lingering disease which it was evident would very soon transfer his patriarchal staff to other hands at his footstool stood a man and woman both clad in the shaker garb  my brethren said father ephraim to the surrounding elders feebly exerting himself to utter these few words here are the son and daughter to whom i would commit the trust of which providence is about to lighten my weary shoulders read their faces i pray you and say whether the inward movement of the spirit hath guided my choice aright  accordingly each elder looked at the two candidates with a most scrutinizing gaze the man whose name was adam colburn had a face sunburnt with labor in the fields yet intelligent thoughtful and traced with cares enough for a whole lifetime though he had barely reached middle age there was something severe in his aspect and a rigidity throughout his person characteristics that caused him generally to be taken for a schoolmaster which vocation in fact he had formerly exercised for several years the woman martha pierson was somewhat above thirty thin and pale as a shaker sister almost invariably is and not entirely free from that corpselike appearance which the garb of the sisterhood is so well calculated to impart  this pair are still in the summer of their years observed the elder from harvard a shrewd old man i would like better to see the hoarfrost of autumn on their heads methinks also they will be exposed to peculiar temptations on account of the carnal desires which have heretofore subsisted between them  nay brother said the elder from canterbury the hoarfrost and the blackfrost hath done its work on brother adam and sister martha even as we sometimes discern its traces in our cornfields while they are yet green and why should we question the wisdom of our venerable fathers purpose although this pair in their early youth have loved one another as the worlds people love are there not many brethren and sisters among us who have lived long together in wedlock yet adopting our faith find their hearts purified from all but spiritual affection  whether or no the early loves of adam and martha had rendered it inexpedient that they should now preside together over a shaker village it was certainly most singular that such should be the final result of many warm and tender hopes children of neighboring families their affection was older even than their schooldays it seemed an innate principle interfused among all their sentiments and feelings and not so much a distinct remembrance as connected with their whole volume of remembrances but just as they reached a proper age for their union misfortunes had fallen heavily on both and made it necessary that they should resort to personal labor for a bare subsistence even under these circumstances martha pierson would probably have consented to unite her fate with adam colburns and secure of the bliss of mutual love would patiently have awaited the less important gifts of fortune but adam being of a calm and cautious character was loath to relinquish the advantages which a single man possesses for raising himself in the world year after year therefore their marriage had been deferred adam colburn had followed many vocations had travelled far and seen much of the world and of life martha had earned her bread sometimes as a seamstress sometimes as help to a farmers wife sometimes as schoolmistress of the village children sometimes as a nurse or watcher of the sick thus acquiring a varied experience the ultimate use of which she little anticipated but nothing had gone prosperously with either of the lovers at no subsequent moment would matrimony have been so prudent a measure as when they had first parted in the opening bloom of life to seek a better fortune still they had held fast their mutual faith martha might have been the wife of a man who sat among the senators of his native state and adam could have won the hand as he had unintentionally won the heart of a rich and comely widow but neither of them desired good fortune save to share it with the other  at length that calm despair which occurs only in a strong and somewhat stubborn character and yields to no second spring of hope settled down on the spirit of adam colburn he sought an interview with martha and proposed that they should join the society of shakers the converts of this sect are oftener driven within its hospitable gates by worldly misfortune than drawn thither by fanaticism and are received without inquisition as to their motives martha faithful still had placed her hand in that of her lover and accompanied him to the shaker village here the natural capacity of each cultivated and strengthened by the difficulties of their previous lives had soon gained them an important rank in the society whose members are generally below the ordinary standard of intelligence their faith and feelings had in some degree become assimilated to those of their fellowworshippers adam colburn gradually acquired reputation not only in the management of the temporal affairs of the society but as a clear and efficient preacher of their doctrines martha was not less distinguished in the duties proper to her sex finally when the infirmities of father ephraim had admonished him to seek a successor in his patriarchal office he thought of adam and martha and proposed to renew in their persons the primitive form of shaker government as established by mother ann they were to be the father and mother of the village the simple ceremony which would constitute them such was now to be performed  son adam and daughter martha said the venerable father ephraim fixing his aged eyes piercingly upon them if ye can conscientiously undertake this charge speak that the brethren may not doubt of your fitness  father replied adam speaking with the calmness of his character i came to your village a disappointed man weary of the world worn out with continual trouble seeking only a security against evil fortune as i had no hope of good even my wishes of worldly success were almost dead within me i came hither as a man might come to a tomb willing to lie down in its gloom and coldness for the sake of its peace and quiet there was but one earthly affection in my breast and it had grown calmer since my youth so that i was satisfied to bring martha to be my sister in our new abode we are brother and sister nor would i have it otherwise and in this peaceful village i have found all that i hoped forall that i desire i will strive with my best strength for the spiritual and temporal good of our community my conscience is not doubtful in this matter i am ready to receive the trust  thou hast spoken well son adam said the father god will bless thee in the office which i am about to resign  but our sister observed the elder from harvard hath she not likewise a gift to declare her sentiments  martha started and moved her lips as if she would have made a formal reply to this appeal but had she attempted it perhaps the old recollections the longrepressed feelings of childhood youth and womanhood might have gushed from her heart in words that it would have been profanation to utter there  adam has spoken said she hurriedly his sentiments are likewise mine  but while speaking these few words martha grew so pale that she looked fitter to be laid in her coffin than to stand in the presence of father ephraim and the elders she shuddered also as if there were something awful or horrible in her situation and destiny it required indeed a more than feminine strength of nerve to sustain the fixed observance of men so exalted and famous throughout the sect as these were they had overcome their natural sympathy with human frailties and affections one when he joined the society had brought with him his wife and children but never from that hour had spoken a fond word to the former or taken his bestloved child upon his knee another whose family refused to follow him had been enabledsuch was his gift of holy fortitudeto leave them to the mercy of the world the youngest of the elders a man of about fifty had been bred from infancy in a shaker village and was said never to have clasped a womans hand in his own and to have no conception of a closer tie than the cold fraternal one of the sect old father ephraim was the most awful character of all in his youth he had been a dissolute libertine but was converted by mother ann herself and had partaken of the wild fanaticism of the early shakers tradition whispered at the firesides of the village that mother ann had been compelled to sear his heart of flesh with a redhot iron before it could be purified from earthly passions  however that might be poor martha had a womans heart and a tender one and it quailed within her as she looked round at those strange old men and from them to the calm features of adam colburn but perceiving that the elders eyed her doubtfully she gasped for breath and again spoke  with what strength is left me by my many troubles said she i am ready to undertake this charge and to do my best in it  my children join your hands said father ephraim  they did so the elders stood up around and the father feebly raised himself to a more erect position but continued sitting in his great chair  i have bidden you to join your hands said he not in earthly affection for ye have cast off its chains forever but as brother and sister in spiritual love and helpers of one another in your allotted task teach unto others the faith which ye have received open wide your gatesi deliver you the keys thereofopen them wide to all who will give up the iniquities of the world and come hither to lead lives of purity and peace receive the weary ones who have known the vanity of earthreceive the little children that they may never learn that miserable lesson and a blessing be upon your labors so that the time may hasten on when the mission of mother ann shall have wrought its full effectwhen children shall no more be born and die and the last survivor of mortal race some old and weary man like me shall see the sun go down nevermore to rise on a world of sin and sorrow  the aged father sank back exhausted and the surrounding elders deemed with good reason that the hour was come when the new heads of the village must enter on their patriarchal duties in their attention to father ephraim their eyes were turned from martha pierson who grew paler and paler unnoticed even by adam colburn he indeed had withdrawn his hand from hers and folded his arms with a sense of satisfied ambition but paler and paler grew martha by his side till like a corpse in its burial clothes she sank down at the feet of her early lover for after many trials firmly borne her heart could endure the weight of its desolate agony no longer     endicott and the red cross  at noon of on autumnal day more than two centuries ago the english colors were displayed by the standardbearer of the salem trainband which had mustered for martial exercise under the orders of john endicott it was a period when the religious exiles were accustomed often to buckle on their armor and practise the handling of their weapons of war since the first settlement of new england its prospects had never been so dismal the dissensions between charles the first and his subjects were then and for several years afterwards confined to the floor of parliament the measures of the king and ministry were rendered more tyrannically violent by an opposition which had not yet acquired sufficient confidence in its own strength to resist royal injustice with the sword the bigoted and haughty primate laud archbishop of canterbury controlled the religious affairs of the realm and was consequently invested with powers which might have wrought the utter ruin of the two puritan colonies plymouth and massachusetts there is evidence on record that our forefathers perceived their danger but were resolved that their infant country should not fall without a struggle even beneath the giant strength of the kings right arm  such was the aspect of the times when the folds of the english banner with the red cross in its field were flung out over a company of puritans their leader the famous endicott was a man of stern and resolute countenance the effect of which was heightened by a grizzled beard that swept the upper portion of his breastplate this piece of armor was so highly polished that the whole surrounding scene had its image in the glittering steel the central object in the mirrored picture was an edifice of humble architecture with neither steeple nor bell to proclaim itwhat nevertheless it wasthe house of prayer a token of the perils of the wilderness was seen in the grim head of a wolf which had just been slain within the precincts of the town and according to the regular mode of claiming the bounty was nailed on the porch of the meetinghouse the blood was still plashing on the doorstep there happened to be visible at the same noontide hour so many other characteristics of the times and manners of the puritans that we must endeavor to represent them in a sketch though far less vividly than they were reflected in the polished breastplate of john endicott  in close vicinity to the sacred edifice appeared that important engine of puritanic authority the whippingpostwith the soil around it well trodden by the feet of evil doers who had there been disciplined at one corner of the meetinghouse was the pillory and at the other the stocks and by a singular good fortune for our sketch the head of an episcopalian and suspected catholic was grotesquely incased in the former machine while a fellowcriminal who had boisterously quaffed a health to the king was confined by the legs in the latter side by side on the meetinghouse steps stood a male and a female figure the man was a tall lean haggard personification of fanaticism bearing on his breast this labela wanton gospellerwhich betokened that he had dared to give interpretations of holy writ unsanctioned by the infallible judgment of the civil and religious rulers his aspect showed no lack of zeal to maintain his heterodoxies even at the stake the woman wore a cleft stick on her tongue in appropriate retribution for having wagged that unruly member against the elders of the church and her countenance and gestures gave much cause to apprehend that the moment the stick should be removed a repetition of the offence would demand new ingenuity in chastising it  the abovementioned individuals had been sentenced to undergo their various modes of ignominy for the space of one hour at noonday but among the crowd were several whose punishment would be lifelong some whose ears had been cropped like those of puppy dogs others whose cheeks had been branded with the initials of their misdemeanors one with his nostrils slit and seared and another with a halter about his neck which he was forbidden ever to take off or to conceal beneath his garments methinks he must have been grievously tempted to affix the other end of the rope to some convenient beam or bough there was likewise a young woman with no mean share of beauty whose doom it was to wear the letter a on the breast of her gown in the eyes of all the world and her own children and even her own children knew what that initial signified sporting with her infamy the lost and desperate creature had embroidered the fatal token in scarlet cloth with golden thread and the nicest art of needlework so that the capital a might have been thought to mean admirable or anything rather than adulteress  let not the reader argue from any of these evidences of iniquity that the times of the puritans were more vicious than our own when as we pass along the very street of this sketch we discern no badge of infamy on man or woman it was the policy of our ancestors to search out even the most secret sins and expose them to shame without fear or favor in the broadest light of the noonday sun were such the custom now perchance we might find materials for a no less piquant sketch than the above  except the malefactors whom we have described and the diseased or infirm persons the whole male population of the town between sixteen years and sixty were seen in the ranks of the trainband a few stately savages in all the pomp and dignity of the primeval indian stood gazing at the spectacle their flintheaded arrows were but childish weapons compared with the matchlocks of the puritans and would have rattled harmlessly against the steel caps and hammered iron breastplates which inclosed each soldier in an individual fortress the valiant john endicott glanced with an eye of pride at his sturdy followers and prepared to renew the martial toils of the day  come my stout hearts quoth he drawing his sword let us show these poor heathen that we can handle our weapons like men of might well for them if they put us not to prove it in earnest  the ironbreasted company straightened their line and each man drew the heavy butt of his matchlock close to his left foot thus awaiting the orders of the captain but as endicott glanced right and left along the front he discovered a personage at some little distance with whom it behooved him to hold a parley it was an elderly gentleman wearing a black cloak and band and a highcrowned hat beneath which was a velvet skullcap the whole being the garb of a puritan minister this reverend person bore a staff which seemed to have been recently cut in the forest and his shoes were bemired as if he had been travelling on foot through the swamps of the wilderness his aspect was perfectly that of a pilgrim heightened also by an apostolic dignity just as endicott perceived him he laid aside his staff and stooped to drink at a bubbling fountain which gushed into the sunshine about a score of yards from the corner of the meetinghouse but ere the good man drank he turned his face heavenward in thankfulness and then holding back his gray beard with one hand he scooped up his simple draught in the hollow of the other  what ho good mr williams shouted endicott you are welcome back again to our town of peace how does our worthy governor winthrop and what news from boston  the governor hath his health worshipful sir answered roger williams now resuming his staff and drawing near and for the news here is a letter which knowing i was to travel hitherward today his excellency committed to my charge belike it contains tidings of much import for a ship arrived yesterday from england  mr williams the minister of salem and of course known to all the spectators had now reached the spot where endicott was standing under the banner of his company and put the governors epistle into his hand the broad seal was impressed with winthrops coat of arms endicott hastily unclosed the letter and began to read while as his eye passed down the page a wrathful change came over his manly countenance the blood glowed through it till it seemed to be kindling with an internal heat nor was it unnatural to suppose that his breastplate would likewise become redhot with the angry fire of the bosom which it covered arriving at the conclusion he shook the letter fiercely in his hand so that it rustled as loud as the flag above his head  black tidings these mr williams said he blacker never came to new england doubtless you know their purport  yea truly replied roger williams for the governor consulted respecting this matter with my brethren in the ministry at boston and my opinion was likewise asked and his excellency entreats you by me that the news be not suddenly noised abroad lest the people be stirred up unto some outbreak and thereby give the king and the archbishop a handle against us  the governor is a wise mana wise man and a meek and moderate said endicott setting his teeth grimly nevertheless i must do according to my own best judgment there is neither man woman nor child in new england but has a concern as dear as life in these tidings and if john endicotts voice be loud enough man woman and child shall hear them soldiers wheel into a hollow square ho good people here are news for one and all of you  the soldiers closed in around their captain and he and roger williams stood together under the banner of the red cross while the women and the aged men pressed forward and the mothers held up their children to look endicott in the face a few taps of the drum gave signal for silence and attention  fellowsoldiersfellowexiles began endicott speaking under strong excitement yet powerfully restraining it wherefore did ye leave your native country wherefore i say have we left the green and fertile fields the cottages or perchance the old gray halls where we were born and bred the churchyards where our forefathers lie buried wherefore have we come hither to set up our own tombstones in a wilderness a howling wilderness it is the wolf and the bear meet us within halloo of our dwellings the savage lieth in wait for us in the dismal shadow of the woods the stubborn roots of the trees break our ploughshares when we would till the earth our children cry for bread and we must dig in the sands of the seashore to satisfy them wherefore i say again have we sought this country of a rugged soil and wintry sky was it not for the enjoyment of our civil rights was it not for liberty to worship god according to our conscience  call you this liberty of conscience interrupted a voice on the steps of the meetinghouse  it was the wanton gospeller a sad and quiet smile flitted across the mild visage of roger williams but endicott in the excitement of the moment shook his sword wrathfully at the culpritan ominous gesture from a man like him  what hast thou to do with conscience thou knave cried he i said liberty to worship god not license to profane and ridicule him break not in upon my speech or i will lay thee neck and heels till this time tomorrow hearken to me friends nor heed that accursed rhapsodist as i was saying we have sacrificed all things and have come to a land whereof the old world hath scarcely heard that we might make a new world unto ourselves and painfully seek a path from hence to heaven but what think ye now this son of a scotch tyrantthis grandson of a papistical and adulterous scotch woman whose death proved that a golden crown doth not always save an anointed head from the block  nay brother nay interposed mr williams thy words are not meet for a secret chamber far less for a public street  hold thy peace roger williams answered endicott imperiously my spirit is wiser than thine for the business now in hand i tell ye fellowexiles that charles of england and laud our bitterest persecutor archpriest of canterbury are resolute to pursue us even hither they are taking counsel saith this letter to send over a governorgeneral in whose breast shall be deposited all the law and equity of the land they are minded also to establish the idolatrous forms of english episcopacy so that when laud shall kiss the popes toe as cardinal of rome he may deliver new england bound hand and foot into the power of his master    a deep groan from the auditorsa sound of wrath as well as fear and sorrowresponded to this intelligence  look ye to it brethren resumed endicott with increasing energy if this king and this archprelate have their will we shall briefly behold a cross on the spire of this tabernacle which we have builded and a high altar within its walls with wax tapers burning round it at noonday we shall hear the sacring bell and the voices of the romish priests saying the mass but think ye christian men that these abominations may be suffered without a sword drawn without a shot fired without blood spilt yea on the very stairs of the pulpit nobe ye strong of hand and stout of heart here we stand on our own soil which we have bought with our goods which we have won with our swords which we have cleared with our axes which we have tilled with the sweat of our brows which we have sanctified with our prayers to the god that brought us hither who shall enslave us here what have we to do with this mitred prelatewith this crowned king what have we to do with england  endicott gazed round at the excited countenances of the people now full of his own spirit and then turned suddenly to the standardbearer who stood close behind him  officer lower your banner said he  the officer obeyed and brandishing his sword endicott thrust it through the cloth and with his left hand rent the red cross completely out of the banner he then waved the tattered ensign above his head  sacrilegious wretch cried the highchurchman in the pillory unable longer to restrain himself thou hast rejected the symbol of our holy religion  treason treason roared the royalist in the stocks he hath defaced the kings banner  before god and man i will avouch the deed answered endicott beat a flourish drummershout soldiers and peoplein honor of the ensign of new england neither pope nor tyrant hath part in it now  with a cry of triumph the people gave their sanction to one of the boldest exploits which our history records and forever honored be the name of endicott we look back through the mist of ages and recognize in the rending of the red cross from new englands banner the first omen of that deliverance which our fathers consummated after the bones of the stern puritan had lain more than a century in the dust
