68708182	up in the clouds by rm ballantyne    chapter one  balloon voyages  treats of early efforts to fly etcetera  it is mans nature to soar intellectually and it seems to have been his ambition from earliest ages to soar physically  every one in health knows or at some period of life must have known that upward bounding of the spirit which induces a longing for the possession of wings that the material body might be wafted upwards into those blue realms of light which are so attractive to the eye and imagination of poor creeping man that he has appropriately styled them the heavens  man has envied the birds since the world began  who has not watched with something more than admiration the easy gyrations of the seamew and listened with something more than delight to the song of the soaring lark  to fly with the body as well as with the mind is a wish so universal that the benignant creator himself seems to recognise it in that most attractive passage in holy writ wherein it is said that believers shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint  of course man has not reached the middle of the nineteenth century without making numerous attempts to fly bodily up to the skies fortunately however such ambitious efforts have seldom been made except by the intellectually enthusiastic  prosaic man except in the case of the tower of babel has remained content to gaze upwards with longing desire and only a few of our species in the course of centuries have possessed temerity enough to make the deliberate effort to ride upon the wings of the wind  naturally the first attempts were like most beginnings simple and imitative  the birds flew with wings therefore man put on artificial wings and essayed to fly like the birds  it was not until many grievous disappointments and sad accidents had befallen him that he unwillingly gave up wings in despair and set to work to accomplish his ends by more cumbrous and complex machinery  very early in the worlds history however flying machines were made some of which were doubtless intended by their honest inventors to carry men through the air while others were mere shams made by designing men wherewith to impose upon the ignorant for wicked ends of their own and some of these last were no doubt believed to be capable of the feats attributed to them  the credulity of the ancients is not to be wondered at when we reflect on the magical illusions which science enables us to produce at the present dayillusions so vivid and startling that it requires the most elaborate explanations by adepts and philosophers to convince some among their audiences that what they think they see is absolutely not real no wonder that the men of old had firm faith in the existence of all kinds of flying machines and creatures  they believed that fiery dragons were created by infernal machination which although not what we may call natural creatures were nevertheless supposed to rush impetuous through the sky vomiting flames and scattering the seeds of pestilence far and wide  in those dark ages writers even ventured to describe the method of imitating the composition of such terrific monsters  a number of large hollow reeds were to be bound together then sheathed completely in skin and smeared over with pitch and other inflammable matters  this light and bulky engine when set on fire launched during thick darkness from some cliff into the air and borne along by the force of the wind would undoubtedly carry conviction to the minds of the populace whilst it would fill them with amazement and terror  sometimes however those who attempted to practise on the credulity of their fellows were themselves appalled by the results of their contrivances  such was the case so late as the year 1750 when a small roman catholic town in swabia was almost entirely burnt to ashes by an unsuccessful experiment made by some of the lowest order of priests for the astonishment if not the edification of their flocks  an attempt was made by them to represent the effigy of martin luther whom the monks believed to be in league with satan under the form of a winged serpent with a forked tail and hideous claws  unfortunately martins effigy when ignited refused to fly and instead of doing what was required of it fell against the chimney of a house to which it set fire  the flames spread furiously in every direction and were not subdued until the town was nearly consumed  in the early part of the sixteenth century a very determined attempt at flying was made by an italian who visited scotland and was patronised by james the fourth  he gained the favour of that monarch by holding out to him hopes of replenishing his treasury by means of the philosophers stone  the wily italian managed by his plausible address to obtain a position which replenished to some degree his own empty purse having been collated by royal favour to the abbacy of tungland in galloway  being an ingenious fellow and somewhat apparently of an enthusiast he spent some of his leisure time in fashioning a pair of huge wings of various plumage with which he actually undertook to fly through the air from the walls of stirling castle to france  that he believed himself to be capable of doing so seems probable from the fact that he actually made the attempt but fell to the ground with such violence as to break his leg  he was sharpwitted however for instead of retiring crestfallen at his failure he coolly accounted for the accident by saying my wings were composed of various feathers among them were the feathers of dunghill fowls and they by a certain sympathy were attracted to the dunghill whereas had my wings been composed of eagles feathers alone the same sympathy would have attracted them to the region of the air  about a century later a poor monk whose boldness and enterprise were more conspicuous than his prudence attempted a similar feat  he provided himself with a gigantic pair of wings constructed on a principle propounded by the rector of the grammar school of tubingen in 1617 and leaping from the top of a high tower fell to the ground broke both his legs and lost his life  it was long before men came to see and admit that in regard to this they were attempting to accomplish the impossible  there can be no doubt that it is absolutely impossible for man to fly by the simple power of his own muscles applied to any sort of machinery whatever  this is not an open question  that man may yet contrive to raise himself in the air by means of steam or electricity or some other motive power remains to be seen  it does not seem probable but no one can say authoritatively that it is impossible  it is demonstrable however that to rise or even to remain suspended in the air by means of machinery impelled by human force alone is a feat which is as much an impossibility as it is for a man by the strength of his own legs to leap thirty or forty times his own lengtha grasshopper can do that easily and a bird can fly easily but a man cannot and never will be able to do so because his peculiar conformation forbids it  this was first demonstrated by borelli an eminent italian mathematician and philosopher who lived in a fertile age of discovery and was thoroughly acquainted with the true principles of mechanics and pneumatics  he showed by accurate calculation the prodigious force which in birds must be exerted and maintained by the pectoral muscles with which the allwise creator has supplied them and by applying the same principles to the structure of the human frame he proved how extremely disproportionate was the strength of the corresponding muscles in man  in fact the man who should attempt to fly like a bird would be guilty of greater folly and ignorant presumption than the little infant who should endeavour to perform the feats of a gladiator  it is well for man in all things to attain if possible to a knowledge of what certainly lies beyond his powers for such knowledge prevents the waste and misdirection of energies as well as saving from disappointment and other evil results  but many of those enthusiasts who have attempted at various periods of the worlds history to fly did not fall into the error which we have attempted to point out  on the contrary they went intelligently to work their only aim being modestly to fly somewhat after the manner of a bird but they all failed nevertheless one philosopher of modern times stoutly continued to assert the opinion that there is no impossibility in man being able to fly apparently though not really like a bird  he did not hold that man could ever fly as high or as far or as fast or in any degree as easily as a bird  all that he ventured to say was that he might perhaps fly somewhat like one  as the plan of this philosopher is rather curious we shall detail it  it is well known that balloons filled with appropriate gas will rise big balloons and little ones are equally uppish in their tendencies  it is also known that rotundity of form is not essential to the successful rising of a balloon  well then says this philosopher what is to prevent a man making two balloons flattish and in the form of wings which instead of flying away with him as ordinary balloons would infallibly do should be so proportioned to his size and weight as that they would not do more than raise him an inch or so off the ground and so keep him stotting and bobbing lightly about something like the bright thin indiarubber balls with which children are wont to play nowadays  having attained this position of so to speak readiness to fly there is nothing to prevent him from propelling himself gently along the surface of the ground by means of fans or if you choose small flexible cloth wings attached to the hands and arms  the legs might also be brought into play a little  it is obvious however that such wings would require to be mounted only in calm weather for a breeze of wind would infallibly sweep the flyer off the face of the earth  we would only observe in conclusion that however ridiculous this method of flying may appear in your eyes this at least may be said in its favour that whereas all other plans that have been tried have signally failed this plan has never failednever having been tried  we throw the idea before a discriminating public in the hope that some aspiring enthusiast with plenty of means and nerve and no family to mourn his loss may one day prove to the confusion of the incredulous that our plan is not a mere flight of imagination  when men began to find that wings refused in any circumstances to waft them to the realms of ether they set about inventing aerial machines in which to ascend through the clouds and navigate the skies  in the fourteenth century a glimmering of the true principles on which a balloon could be constructed was entertained by albert of saxony a monk of the order of saint augustin but he never carried his theories into practice  his opinion was that since fire is more attenuated than air and floats above the region of our atmosphere all that was necessary would be to enclose a portion of such ethereal substance in a light hollow globe which would thus be raised to a certain height and kept suspended in the sky and that by introducing a portion of air into the globe it would be rendered heavier than before and might thus be made to descend  this was in fact the statement of the principles on which fireballoons were afterwards constructed and successfully sent up excepting that air heated by fire instead of fire itself was used  others who came after albert of saxony held the same theory but they all failed to reduce it to practice and most of these men coupled with their correct notions on the subject the very erroneous idea that by means of masts sails and a rudder a balloon might be made to sail through the air as a ship sails upon the sea  in this they seem to have confounded two things which are dissimilar namely a vessel driven through water and a vessel floating in air  the fallacy here may be easily pointed out  a ship is driven through water by a body in motion namely wind while its rudder is dragged through a body comparatively at rest namely water hence the rudder slides against or is pushed against the water and according as it is turned to one side or the other it is pushed to one side or the other the stern of the ship going along with it and the bow of course making a corresponding motion in the opposite direction  thus the ship is turned or steered but it is manifest that if the ship were at rest there would be no pushing of the rudder by the waterno steering  on the other hand if though the ship were in motion the sea was also flowing at the same rate with the wind there would be no flowing of water past the ship the rudder would not be acted on and the vessel could not be steered  now a balloon carried by the wind cannot be steered by a rudder because it does not like the ship rest half in one medium which is in motion and half in another medium which is at rest  there is no sliding of any substance past its side no possibility therefore of pushing a rudder against anything  all floats along with the wind  if however the balloon could be made to go faster than the wind then steering would at once become possible but sails cannot accomplish this because although wind can drive a ship faster than water flows wind cannot drive a substance faster than itself flows  the men of old did not however seem to take these points into consideration  it yet remains to be seen whether steam shall ever be successfully applied to aerial machines but this may certainly be assumed in the meantime that until by some means a balloon is propelled faster than the wind through the atmosphere sails will be useless and steering or giving direction impossible  it was believed in those early times when scientific knowledge was slender that the dew which falls during the night is of celestial origin shed by the stars and drawn by the sun in the heat of the day back to its native skies  many people even went the length of asserting that an egg filled with the morning dew would as the day advanced rise spontaneously into the air  indeed one man named father laurus speaks of this as an observed fact and gravely gives directions how it is to be accomplished  take says he a gooses egg and having filled it with dew gathered fresh in the morning expose it to the sun during the hottest part of the day and it will ascend and rest suspended for a few moments  father laurus must surely have omitted to add that a gooses brains in the head of the operator was an element essential to the success of the experiment  but this man although very ignorant in regard to the nature of the substances with which he wrought had some quaint notions in his head he thought for instance that if he were to cram the cavity of an artificial dove with highly condensed air the imprisoned fluid would impel the machine in the same manner as wind impels a sail  if this should not be found to act effectively he proposed to apply fire to it in some way or other and to prevent the machine from being spirited away altogether by that volatile element asbestos or some incombustible material was to be used as a lining  to feed and support this fire steadily he suggested a compound of butter salts and orpiment lodged in metallic tubes which he imagined would at the same time heighten the whole effect by emitting a variety of musical tones like an organ  another man still more sanguine than the lest in his aerial flights of fancy proposed that an ascent should be attempted by the application of fire as in a rocket to an aerial machine  we are not however told that this daring spirit ever ventured to try thus to invade the sky  there can be no doubt that much ingenuity as well as absurdity has been displayed in the various suggestions that have been made from time to time and occasionally carried into practice  one man went the length of describing a huge apparatus consisting of very long tin pipes in which air was to be compressed by the vehement action of fire below  in a boat suspended from the machine a man was to sit and direct the whole by the opening and shutting of valves  another scheme more ingenious but not less fallacious was propounded in 1670 by francis lana a jesuit for navigating the air  this plan was to make four copper balls of very large dimensions yet so extremely thin that after the air had been extracted they should become in a considerable degree specifically lighter than the surrounding medium each of his copper balls was to be about 25 feet in diameter with the thickness of only the 225th part of an inch the metal weighing 365 pounds avoirdupois while the weight of the air which it should contain would be about 670 pounds leaving after a vacuum had been formed an excess of 305 pounds for the power of ascension  the four balls would therefore it was thought rise into the air with a combined force of 1220 pounds which was deemed by lana to be sufficient to transport a boat completely furnished with masts sails oars and rudders and carrying several passengers  the method by which the vacuum was to be obtained was by connecting each globe fitted with a stopcock to a tube of at least thirtyfive feet long the whole being filled with water when raised to the vertical position the water would run out the stopcocks would be closed at the proper time and the vacuum secured it does not seem to have entered the head of this philosopher that the weight of the surrounding atmosphere would crush and destroy his thin exhausted receivers but he seems to have been alarmed at the idea of his supposed discovery being applied to improper uses such as the passing of desperadoes over fortified cities on which they might rain down fire and destruction from the clouds  perhaps the grandest of all the fanciful ideas that have been promulgated on this subject was that of galien a dominican friar who proposed to collect the fine diffused air of the higher regions where hail is formed above the summit of the loftiest mountains and to enclose it in a cubical bag of enormous dimensionsextending more than a mile every way  this vast machine was to be composed of the thickest and strongest sailcloth and was expected to be capable of transporting through the air a whole army with all their munitions of war  there were many other devices which men hit upon some of which embraced a certain modicum of truth mixed with a large proportion of fallacy ignorance more or less complete as to the principles and powers with which they dealt was in days gone by the cause of many of the errors and absurdities into which men were led in their efforts to mount the atmosphere  our space however forbids further consideration of this subject which is undoubtedly one of considerable interest and encircled with a good deal of romance  turning away from all those early and fanciful speculations we now come to that period in the history of balloon voyaging or aeronautics when true theories began to be philosophically applied and ascending into the skies became an accomplished fact    chapter two  the first balloons  the germ of the invention of the balloon lies in the discovery of mr cavendish made in 1766 that hydrogen gas called inflammable air is at least seven times lighter than atmospheric air  founding on this fact dr black of edinburgh proved by experiment that a very thin bag filled with this gas would rise to the ceiling of a room  in dr thomsons history of chemistry an anecdote related by mr benjamin bell refers to this as follows  soon after the appearance of mr cavendishs paper on hydrogen gas in which he made an approximation to the specific gravity of that body showing that it was at least ten times lighter than common air dr black invited a party of friends to supper informing them that he had a curiosity to show them  dr hutton mr clerk of eldin and sir george clerk of penicuik were of the number  when the company invited had arrived he took them into a room where he had the allantois of a calf filled with hydrogen gas and upon setting it at liberty it immediately ascended and adhered to the ceiling  the phenomenon was easily accounted for it was taken for granted that a small black thread had been attached to the allantois that the thread passed through the ceiling and that some one in the apartment above by pulling the thread elevated it to the ceiling and kept it in its position  this explanation was so plausible that it was agreed to by the whole company though like many other plausible theories it turned out wholly fallacious for when the allantois was brought down no thread whatever was found attached to it  dr black explained the cause of the ascent to his admiring friends but such was his carelessness of his own reputation that he never gave the least account of this curious experiment even to his class and several years elapsed before this obvious property of hydrogen gas was applied to the elevation of balloons  cavallo made the first practical attempts with hydrogen gas six years later but he only succeeded in causing soapbubbles to ascend  at last the art of aerial navigation was discovered in france and in 1782 the first ascent was made  the triumph was achieved by stephen and joseph montgolfier sons of a wealthy papermaker who dwelt at annonay on the banks of a rivulet which flows into the rhone not far from lyons  these brothers were remarkable men  although bred in a remote provincial town and without the benefit of a liberal education they were possessed in a high degree of ingenuity and the spirit of observation  they educated themselves and acquired an unusually large stock of information which their inventive and original minds led them to apply in new fields of speculation  they were associated in business with their father a man who passed his quiet days like a patriarch amidst a large family and a numerous body of dependants until he reached the advanced age of ninetythree  stephen devoted himself chiefly to the study of mathematics joseph to chemistry and they were accustomed to form their plans in concert  it appears that they had long contemplated with philosophical interest the floating and ascent of clouds in the air and when they heard of or read cavendishs theories in regard to different kinds of air it at once struck them that by enclosing some gas lighter than the atmosphere in a bag a weight might be raised from the earth into the air  the brothers montgolfier were men of that vigorous stamp who act promptly on receiving their convictions  at once they set about experimenting and constructed large bags of paperthe substance which naturally came readiest to their hands and which appeared to them to be best suited to their purpose  these were filled with hydrogen gas which raised them to the ceiling but owing to the escape of the gas through the pores and cracks of the case those embryo balloons descended in a few minutes  instead of varnishing the paper to prevent the escape of the gas and supposing erroneously that the fault lay in the latter they sought about for a new gas more suitable to the paper this they found as they supposed in the gas which resulted from the combustion of wet straw and wool which had an upward tendency they thought on account of its electrical properties which caused it to be repelled from the ground  it is scarcely necessary now to point out that the true cause of the upward tendency lay in the rarefaction of the air by the heat of the fire and that hot air has a tendency to rise because its bulk is greatly increased beyond the same quantity of the surrounding cold air  although wrong in assigning the cause of the result they were right in the application of it  while on a visit to avignon joseph montgolfier procured a silk bag having a small opening at its lower end and a capacity of about fifty cubic feet  under the orifice some paper was burnt the air inside was heated and expanded so as to fill the bag which when let go soared rapidly up to the height of seventy or eighty feet where it remained until the air cooled and allowed it to descend thus did the first balloon ascend in the month of november 1782  delighted with their success the indefatigable brothers resolved to make further experiment on a larger scale  they procured a quantity of packcloth or coarse linen formed it into a globe about ninety feet in circumference lined it with paper and lighted a fire under it in an iron choffer  this balloon went up with a force which they estimated as equivalent to 500 pounds  after this the montgolfiers appeared to have become ambitious of accomplishing greater things and giving to their discoveries publicity for we are told that they invited the members of the provincial meeting of the states of the vivarais then assembled at annonay to witness the first public aerial ascent  on the 5th june 1783 amidst a very large concourse of spectators the spherical bag or balloon consisting of different pieces of linen merely buttoned together was suspended from cross poles  two men kindled a fire under it and kept feeding the flame with small bundles of chopped straw  the loose bag gradually swelled assuming a graceful form and in the space of five minutes it was completely distended and made such an effort to escape that eight men were required to hold it down  on a signal being given the stays were slipped and the balloon instantly rose with an accelerating motion till it reached some height when its velocity continued uniform and carried it to an elevation of more than a mile  all was admiration and transport  amidst the shouts of unbounded applause the progress of the artificial cloud retiring from sight arrested every eye  it was hurried along by the wind but its buoyant force being soon spent it remained suspended only ten minutes and fell gently in a vineyard at a distance of about a mile and a half from the place of its ascension  so memorable a feat lighted up the glow of national vanity and the two montgolfiers were hailed and exalted by the spontaneous impulse of their fellowcitizens  this event created a sensation not only in france but over the whole of europe  in paris particularly the effect on all classes was so great that they determined to have the experiment repeated set a subscription on foot and appointed a scientific man named charles and two brothers of the name of robert to construct a balloon  this they did but instead of applying the montgolfier motive powerheated airthey used hydrogen gas procured by the action of diluted sulphuric acid upon iron filings  their balloon which was made of thin silk varnished with a solution of elastic gum was a much nearer approach to the balloon of modern days than that of montgolfier  it was a great success it rose and remained suspended at a height of 100 feet in which state it was conveyed with acclamation to the place des victoires where it rested and underwent some repairs  at midnight it was conveyed in solemn procession by torchlight and guarded by a detachment of horse to the champ de mars where on the following day the whole world of paris turned out to witness another ascent  the balloon went up to the sound of cannon and in two minutes reached a height of 3000 feet when it was lost for a time in a dark cloud but speedily reappeared still higher after a flight of fifteen miles performed in threequarters of an hour it sunk to the ground in a field near ecouen where it was secured by the peasants  the parisians now appeared to become balloonmad  the royal academy of sciences invited joseph montgolfier to repeat his experiments and another balloon was prepared by him of coarse linen with a paper lining which however was destroyed by incessant and violent rain before it could be tried  undeterred by this another was constructed by him which ascended from versailles on the 19th of september 1783  this balloon deserves peculiar notice as being the first which carried up living creatures  a sheep a cockerel and a duck were the first aeronauts  they ascended to a height of about 1500 feet remained suspended for a time and descended some two miles off in perfect safetyindeed we may say in perfect comfort for the sheep was discovered to be quietly feeding when it returned to the earth  the practicability of ballooning being now fairly established men soon began to venture their own persons in the frail cars  a young and enthusiastic naturalist named rozier leaped into the car of another of montgolfiers balloons soon after this and ascended in safety to an elevation of about 300 feet but on this occasion the balloon was held down by ropes  the ice however was broken and bolder attempts quickly followed    chapter three  early attempts at aerial navigation  the first free and unfettered balloon voyage was performed very soon after the event mentioned at the end of the last chapter  it was a daring attempt and attended with great danger  a balloon made by montgolfier was used  it was 75 feet high 45 feet wide and spheroidal in formheated air being the motive power  the bold aeronauts on this occasion were the naturalist rozier and the marquis darlandes a major of infantry  from the gardens of the chateau of muetta they ascended on the 21st november 1783  in the car there was a quantity of ballast and a provision of straw to feed the fire  the balloon mounted at first with a majestic steady motion gazed at in breathless wonder by thousands of spectators who assembled not only in the neighbourhood of the chateau but clustered on every point of vantage in paris  when the daring voyagers reached a considerable height they took off their hats and waved them to their friends below and the multitude realising perhaps that that which in former ages had been deemed the dream of visionaries was at last an accomplished factresponded with enthusiastic acclamations until the balloon passed upwards through the clouds and was lost to view  it would seem that these first aeronauts were of different temperaments for after they had reached a height of nearly 3000 feet and the earth was no longer distinguishable the marquis began to think that he had seen enough of the upper regions would fain have descended and murmured against his companion who still kept feeding the fire apparently his alarm was justifiable for rozier continued recklessly to heap on fuel until he almost set the balloon on fire  on hearing some cracks from the top and observing some holes burning in its sides the marquis became so alarmed that he compelled his companion to desist and with wet sponges stopped the conflagration which had actually begun  when the fire diminished however the balloon began to descend much quicker than was safe or agreeable and the marquis himself began to throw fresh straw on the fire to enable them to clear the roofs of paris  this they did very dexterously considering that they were so unaccustomed to such navigation throwing on just as much fuel as was sufficient for the purpose and keeping clear of steeples and chimneys until they alighted in safety beyond the boulevards  their voyage lasted about halfanhour and they described a track of six miles around paris having ascended to a height of 3000 feet  thus was the first balloon voyage successfully accomplished by the french and the montgolfiers besides enjoying the triumph which their persevering efforts deserved were awarded the annual prizesix hundred livresof the academy of sciences  the elder brother was invited to court decorated with the badge of saint michael and received a patent of nobility while the younger received a pension and a sum of forty thousand livres wherewith to prosecute his experiments with balloons  the great success of the montgolfier balloons naturally threw the efforts of monsieur charles and the brothers robert into the shade nevertheless those gentlemen had got hold of a better principle than their rivals and knowing this they resolved to convince the sceptical by constructing another balloon  they wisely began by obtaining subscriptions to enable them to carry out their designs and finally succeeded in making a globe formed of tiffany covered with elastic varnish which was twentyeight feet in diameter  this they filled with hydrogen gas  some idea of their difficulties and expenses may be gathered from the fact that the mere filling of the balloon required an apparatus which cost about 400 pounds sterling onehalf of which was expended on the production of the gas alone  the ascent of this balloon deserves to be regarded with special interest because besides being the first hydrogen balloon which carried up human beings it was the first in which scientific observations were made and recorded  monsieur charles was a lecturer on natural philosophy and like our own great aeronaut mr glaisher does not seem to have been content to produce merely a spectacle but went up to the realms of ether with an intelligent and scientific eye for we read of him recording the indications of the thermometer and barometer at different heights and under various conditions  there were many accidents and delays in the construction of this balloon but at last on the 1st december 1783 it was taken to the tuileries and there filled with gas  the process was slow as the gas had to be generated in large quantities by means of diluted sulphuric acid and iron filings put into wooden casks disposed round a large cistern from which it was conveyed through water in long leaden pipes to keep the impatient populace quiet therefore during the tedious operation montgolfier sent up one of his fireballoons  at last when it was sufficiently filled messieurs charles and robert stepped into the car which was ballasted with sandbags and the ropes were let go  it went up with slow and solemn motion at the rate of about five miles an hour  the car writes a reporter of the day in language more inflated than the balloon itself ascending amidst profound silence and admiration allowed in its soft and measured ascent the bystanders to follow with their eyes and hearts two interesting men who like demigods soared to the abode of the immortals to receive the reward of intellectual progress and carry the imperishable name of montgolfier  after the globe had reached the height of 2000 feet it was no longer possible to distinguish the aerial navigators but the coloured pennants which they waved in the air testified their safety and their tranquil feelings  all fears were now dissipated enthusiasm succeeded to astonishment and every demonstration was given of joy and applause  the period of flight was an hour and threequarters which for those early days of the art was a pretty long voyage  by throwing over ballast the voyagers ascended and by letting off gas they descended at pleasure and they observed that during an hour while they were exposed to the suns rays the gas was heated up to the temperature of fiftyfive degrees of fahrenheits scale which had the effect of sensibly increasing the buoyancy of the balloon  they descended safely on the meadow of nesle about twentyfive miles from paris  but not content with what he had accomplished monsieur charles made a sudden resolve to have another flight alone  the shades of night were falling and the sun had already set when the enthusiastic aeronaut reentered the car and casting off the grapnels began his solitary night voyage  he was well rewarded  the balloon shot up with such celerity as to reach the height of about two miles in ten minutes and the sun rose again to him in full orb  from his lofty station he watched it until it set again below the distant horizon  probably monsieur charles was the first man in the world on whom the sun thus rose and set twice in the same day  in such regions at that romantic period of night the aeronaut as might have been expected saw strange unearthly sights  rising vapours concealed the lower world from view and the moon shed her pale rays on accumulated masses of clouds casting various hues over their fantastic and changing forms  no wonder that one thus surrounded by objects of awful grandeur and sublimity left as it were more completely alone with god than any of his fellowmortals found it impossible to refrain from giving vent to his emotion in tears  monsieur charles did not remain long at this elevation  as the cold was excessive and night advancing he deemed it prudent to descend opened the safetyvalve out of which the gas rushed like a misty vapour with a whistling noise and after the lapse of a little more than half an hour alighted in safety near the wood of tour du lay having travelled about nine miles  after this balloon ascents became frequent  we cannot here give a particular account of each even if it were desirable to do so but before passing to the consideration of the more recent voyages we shall run over a few facts and incidents that occurred during the early period of aerial navigation  the first lady who went up in a balloon was a madame thible  she ascended from lyons on 28th june 1784 with a monsieur fleurant in a fireballoon  this lady of lyons mounted to the extraordinary elevation of 13500 feetat least so it was estimated  the flagstaff a pole of fourteen pounds weight was thrown out and took seven minutes to reach the ground  the thermometer dropped to minus 43 degrees fahrenheit and the voyagers felt a ringing sensation in their ears  the first long voyage accomplished was about the same period by a balloon constructed by monsieur robert which was filled with hydrogen it was 56 feet in height and 36 in diameter  the duke de chartres ascended in it along with robert and two others to a considerable height and in five hours performed a voyage of 135 miles  this machine was furnished with a helm and four oars for men still laboured under the erroneous belief that it was possible to direct the course of a balloon  one of the most interesting balloon voyages of the last century was that of monsieur testu  he ascended from paris on the 18th june 1786 in a balloon of glazed tiffany 29 feet in diameter which was constructed by himself  it was filled with hydrogen and had wings as well as oars when the aeronaut deemed it advisable to descend he attempted to do so by using the wings  these had little or no power but the gradual waste of gas lowered him until he alighted safely in a corn field in the plain of montmorency  here he began to collect stones without quitting the car but while thus engaged was seized by the proprietor of the field with a troop of peasants who demanded indemnification for the damage alleged to have been done by him  poor testu assured them that his wings being broken he was at their mercy whereupon the stupid and illnatured boors seized the stay of the balloon which floated some height above the ground and dragged him in triumph towards their village  their triumph however was shortlived  finding that the loss of his wings and some other articles had lightened him considerably he quietly cut the cord and bade the clowns an abrupt farewell  testu then rose to the clouds where he experienced the violence and witnessed the grandeur of a thunderstorm the terrible nature of which was greatly increased when night closed in while lightning flashed on all sides thunder reverberated in the sky and sleet fell copiously around him  on this voyage he saw some hunters in a field and descended to observe them  he remained out all night saw the sun set and rise and finally alighted near the village of campremi about sixtythree miles from paris    chapter four  the first aerial voyages made in great britainsucceeding ascents  the credit of the first aerial voyage made in great britain has usually been given to vincenzo lunardi an italian  there is ground for believing however that the first balloon voyage was performed by a scotchman as the following extract from chambers book of days will show  it is generally supposed that lunardi was the first person who ascended by means of a balloon in great britain but he certainly was not  a very poor man named james tytler who then lived in edinburgh supporting himself and family in the humblest style of garret or cottage life by the exercise of his pen had this honour  he had effected an ascent at edinburgh on the 27th of august 1784 just nineteen days previous to lunardi  tytlers ascent however was almost a failure by his employing the dangerous and unmanageable montgolfier principle after several ineffectual attempts tytler finding that he could not carry up his firestove with him determined in the maddening desperation of disappointment to go without this his sole sustaining power  jumping into his car which was no other than a common crate used for packing earthenware he and the balloon ascended from comely garden and immediately afterwards fell in the restalrig road  for a wonder tytler was uninjured and though he did not reach a greater altitude than 300 feet nor traverse a greater distance than half a mile yet his name must ever be mentioned as that of the first briton who ascended with a balloon and the first man who ascended in britain  tytler was the son of a clergyman of the church of scotland and had been educated as a surgeon but being of an eccentric and erratic genius he adopted literature as a profession and was the principal editor of the first edition of the encyclopaedia britannica  becoming embroiled in politics he published a handbill of a seditious tendency and consequently was compelled to seek a refuge in america where he died in 1805 after conducting a newspaper at salem in new england for several years  the voyage of vincenzo lunardi was made in september 1784  his letters to a friend in which he comments on the manners and customs of the english are very amusing  his balloon was of the ordinary spherical shape made of the best oiled silk about 520 yards of which were used in its construction  it was filled with hydrogen gas and provided with car oars and wings  the car consisted simply of a wooden platform surrounded by a breast high railing and the oars and wings were intended the one to check by a vertical motion the rapidity of descent and the other to act as sails when becalmed in the upper regions of cloudland  he requested permission to make chelsea hospital the scene of his first aerial exploit and the governor sir george howard with the full approval of his majesty king george the third gave his consent  he accordingly made all necessary arrangements for an ascent and his fondest expectations seemed about to be realised  he was however doomed to disappointment owing to the failure of a rival balloon  writing to a friend at this time he says the events of this extraordinary island are as variable as its climate  it was but lately everything relating to my undertaking wore a favourable and pleasing appearance but i am at this moment overwhelmed with anxiety vexation and despair  this rival balloon was constructed by a frenchman named de moret who having succeeded in attracting a concourse of fifty or sixty thousand people to see his ascent failed in the primary part of his undertakingthat of filling his balloon  the people after waiting patiently for three hours and supposing the whole affair an imposture rushed in and tore it to pieces  in consequence of this failure and the riots with which it was followed the governor forbade signor lunardi to make his ascent from chelsea hospital grounds  he writes again to his friend the national prejudice of the english against france is supposed to have its full effect on a subject from which the literati of england expect to derive but little honour  an unsuccessful attempt has been made by a frenchman and my name being that of a foreigner a very excusable ignorance in the people may place me among the adventurers of that nation who are said to have sometimes distinguished themselves here by ingenious impositions  in vain did he try to obtain another place to launch his aerial ship he was laughed at and ridiculed as an impostor and the colleague of de moret  at length after much exertion he obtained leave to ascend from the ground of the honourable artillery company  by twelve oclock on the day fixed for the ascension an immense mass of people had assembled including the prince of wales  the filling of the balloon caused some delay but in order to keep the patience of the populace within control it was only partially filled  at five minutes past two the balloon ascended amid the loud acclamations of the assembled multitudes and signor lunardi had proved himself no impostor  he writes to his friend the stillness extent and magnificence of the scene rendered it highly awful  my horizon seemed a perfect circle the terminating line several hundred miles in circumference this i conjectured from the view of london the extreme points of which formed an angle only a few degrees it was so reduced on the great scale before me that i can find no simile to convey an idea of it  i could distinguish saint pauls and other churches from the houses i saw the streets as lines all animated with beings whom i knew to be men and women but which otherwise i should have had a difficulty in describing  it was an enormous beehive but the industry of it was suspended  all the moving mass seemed to have no object but myself and the transition from the suspicion perhaps contempt of the preceding hour to the affectionate transport admiration and glory of the present moment was not without its effect on my mind  it seemed as if i had left below all the cares and passions that molest mankind  i had not the slightest sense of motion in the machine i knew not whether it went swiftly or slowly whether it ascended or descended whether it was agitated or tranquil but by the appearance or disappearance of objects on the earth  the height had not the effect which a much less degree of it has near the earth that of producing giddiness  the gradual diminution of objects and the masses of light and shade are intelligible in oblique and common prospects but here everything wore a new appearance and had a new effect  the face of the country had a mild and permanent verdure to which italy is a stranger  the variety of cultivation and the accuracy with which property is divided give the idea ever present to the stranger in england of good civil laws and an equitable administration  the rivulets meandering the immense districts beneath me spotted with cities towns villages and houses pouring out their inhabitants to hail my appearance  you will allow me some merit in not having been exceedingly intoxicated with my situation  he descended at north mimms about halfpast threeoclock but wishing to obtain a second triumph he threw out the remainder of his ballast and provisions landed a cat which he had taken up with him and which had suffered severely from the cold and again ascended to the regions above  this time his ascent was more rapid the thermometer quickly fell to 29 degrees and icicles were soon formed all round his machine  he descended at twenty minutes past four near ware in hertfordshire and the balloon being properly secured the gas was let out and nearly poisoned the whole neighbourhood by the disagreeable stench emitted  the success and triumph of this first attempt in aerial navigation in english air exceeded signor lunardis utmost expectations  everywhere he was received with marks of approbation and treated as a hero  my fame he writes has not been sparingly diffused by the newspapers which in england are the barometers of public opinion often erroneous as other instruments are in their particular information but yielding the best that can be obtained  you will imagine the importance of these vehicles of knowledge when you learn that in london alone there are printed no less than 160000 papers weekly which by a stamp on each paper and a duty on advertisements brings into the treasury of the nation upwards of 80000 pounds a year  they are to the english constitution what the censors were to those of ancient rome  ministers of state are checked and kept in awe by them and they freely and often judiciously expose the pretensions of those who would harass government merely to be taken into its service  there were many other aeronauts who distinguished themselves after this period  in 1785 monsieur blanchard with dr j jeffries an american crossed the channel between england and france in a balloonstarting from dover and descending in safety in the forest of guiennes  they had however a narrow escape having been compelled to throw out all their ballast and everything they could dispense with to prevent their balloon from falling into the sea  the first ascents for scientific purposes were made about the beginning of the present century  in 1803 mr robertson ascended from saint petersburg for the purpose of making electrical magnetical and physiological experiments  messieurs gaylussac and biot followed his example from paris in 1804  gaylussac was an enthusiastic and celebrated aeronaut  he made several interesting ascents  two years afterwards brioschi the astronomerroyal at naples endeavoured to ascend to a higher elevation than had been reached by monsieur gaylussacnamely 22977 feet  he was accompanied by signor andreani the first italian aeronaut  the balloon burst when at a great height but the remnants were sufficient to check the descent so much that both gentlemen escaped with their lives  brioschi however received injuries which afterwards resulted in his death  in england one of the most famous aeronauts was mr green who introduced coal gas for balloons and made many hundreds of ascents  in the year 1836 he ascended from london in a coalgas balloon and with two other gentlemen made an aerial voyage to weilburg in the grand duchy of nassau  it lasted eighteen hours and extended over 500 miles    chapter five  parachutes  of the other voyages which were made in balloons in our own country and in foreign lands about this period we shall say nothing but before describing the most interesting of recent ascents give a short account of the parachute  this contrivance has been considered by some a very important adjunct to the balloon whether it be so or no we do not pretend to determine but certainly it is an interesting and curious machine which merits notice  the parachute may be described as a species of gigantic umbrella attached to the balloon below the car which hangs in a loose form while ascending but expands of necessity when cut adrift and allowed to descend  as the balloon has a car hung beneath it so in like manner the parachute has a small car or basket capable of holding one person suspended from it  the word signifies a guard against fallingfrom the french parer to ward off and chute a fall and is allied to parasol which means literally a warder off of the sun  the parachute was introduced some years after a terrible accident which occurred to the celebrated aeronaut rozier who desirous of emulating blanchard and jeffries by crossing the channel from france to england in a balloon made an attempt which cost him his life  roziers balloon was about forty feet in diameter and had attached to it beneath a smaller balloon on the montgolfier principle  on the 15th of june 1785 he entered the car with monsieur romain and ascended to the height of above three thousand feet when it was observed by the spectators that the lower balloon had caught fire  with horror they saw that the fire spreadthe whole apparatus was in a blazeand in another minute it descended like a shattered meteor to the ground with a terrible crash it fell near the seashore about four miles from boulogne and of course the unfortunate voyagers were killed instantaneously  at a later period a venetian nobleman and his lady fell with their balloon from a great height and were killed  it must be remarked however that cases of this kind were very rare considering the rage which there was at that period for ballooning  in order to provide aeronauts with a means of escapea last resource in case of accidentthe parachute was invented  it may be regarded as a balloons lifeboat which will perhaps bear the passengers in safety to the ground in case of balloonwreck  doubtless the umbrella suggested the parachute  every one knows the tremendous force that this implement exerts in a high wind if the unfortunate owner should happen to get turned round in the wrong direction  the men of the east have it is said turned this power to account by making use of an umbrella to enable them to leap from considerable heights  in particular a native of siam who was noted for his feats of agility was wont to amuse the king and his court by taking tremendous leaps having two small umbrellas with long slender handles attached to his girdle  these eased him down in safety but he was occasionally driven by the wind against trees or houses and sometimes into a neighbouring river  in case any adventurous individual should be tempted to make trial of the powers of himself and his umbrella in this way we think it right by way of caution to tell him that the french general bournonville who was imprisoned in the fortress of olmutz in 1793 became so desperate that he attempted to regain his freedom by leaping with an umbrella from his window which was forty feet from the ground  he hoped that the umbrella would break his fall  doubtless it did so to some extent and saved him from being killed but being a large heavy man he came down with sufficient violence to break his leg and was carried back to his dungeon  the chief differences between a parachute and an umbrella lie in the great size of the former and in the cords which stretch from the outer points of its ribs to the lower end of the handle  these cords give it strength and prevent it from turning inside out  there is also a hole in the top of the parachute to allow some of the air to escape  the first parachute was constructed by blanchard in 1785 and a dog was the first living creature that descended in it and reached the earth unhurt  blanchard afterwards made a descent in person at basle and broke his leg in the fall  the bold aeronaut monsieur garnerin next ventured to make the perilous descent  he visited london in 1802 and made several ascents in a balloon  during one of these on the evening of the 2nd november he cut himself adrift in his parachute when at a vast height  the parachute was made of white canvas having thirtytwo gores which when not in use hung with its cords from a hoop near the top of the machine when expanded it formed a vast umbrella of twentythree feet in diameter with a small basket about four feet high and two and a quarter wide suspended below it  monsieur garnerin stood in this basket when his balloon mounted into the air from an enclosure near north audley street  the parachute hung like a curtain over his head above it towered the balloon beneath stood the anxious multitude  well might they gaze in breathless expectation  after floating for some time in the upper regions of the air as if he dreaded to make the bold attempt he cut the cord that fastened him to the balloon when at the height probably of about half a mile  at first the parachute remained closed and descended with frightful violence then it burst open and for some seconds tossed about to such an extent that the basket was sometimes thrown almost into a horizontal position  the wind carried it over marylebone and somerstown it almost grazed some of the houses of saint pancras in passing and finally came to the ground in a field with such violence that poor garnerin was thrown on his face and severely cut and bruised  no wonder that we are told he received a terrible shock he trembled violently and blood flowed from his nose and ears nevertheless the accident did not deter his daughter from afterwards making the descent several timesand in safety  the cause of the irregularity and violence of garnerins descent was the giving way of one of the stays which had the effect of deranging the balance of the apparatus  in 1837 mr cocking invented a new parachute which he hoped would be free from the faults of the other  it may be described as being the reverse of that of garnerin being made in the form of an umbrella blown inside out  the resistance to the air it was thought would be sufficient to check the rapid descent while its form would prevent the tendency to oscillate  this parachute was 34 feet in diameter and was distended by a strong hoop to prevent its closing  there was also a hole in the middle of it about 6 feet in diameter  mr cocking started from vauxhall gardens on the 24th of july and after ascending to a considerable height cut himself loose from his balloon when over blackheath  the parachute descended rapidly and vibrated with great violence the large hoop broke the machine collapsed and the unfortunate aeronaut was killed and his body dreadfully mutilated  fatal accidents of this kind were to be expected nevertheless it is a fact that the disasters which have befallen aeronauts have been comparatively few considering the extreme danger to which they are necessarily exposed not only from the delicacy of the materials with which they operate and the uncertainty of the medium through which they move but particularly because of the impossibility of giving direction to their airships or to arrest their progress through space parachutes however are not so absolutely incapable of being directed as are balloons  monsieur nadar writes on this point as follows  let us consider the action of the parachute  a parachute is a sort of umbrella in which the handle is replaced at its point of insertion by an opening intended to ease the excess of air in order to avoid the strong oscillations chiefly at the moment at which it is first expanded  cords departing symmetrically from divers points of the circumference meet concentrically at the basket in which is the aeronaut  above this basket and at the entrance of the folded parachute that is to say closed during the rise a hoop of sufficient diameter is intended to facilitate at the moment of the fall the entrance of the air which rushing in under the pressure expands the folds more easily and rapidly  now the parachute where the weight of the car of the attaching cords and the wrigglings of the aeronaut is in equilibrium with the expansionthe parachute which seems to have no other aim but to moderate the shock in fallingthe parachute even has been found capable of being directed and aeronauts who have practised it take care not to forget it  if the current is about to drive the aeronaut over a place where the descent is dangeroussay a river a town or a forestthe aeronaut perceiving to his right let us suppose a piece of ground suitable for his purpose pulls at the cords which surround the right side and by thus imparting a greater obliquity to his roof of silk glides through the air which it cleaves obliquely towards the desired spot  every descent in fact is determined by the side on which the incline is greatest  that these are not mere theoretical opinions or conjectures is certain from the fact that mademoiselle garnerin once wagered to guide herself with a parachute from the point of separation from her balloon to a place determined and very remote  by the combined inclinations which could be given to her parachute she was seen in fact very distinctly to manoeuvre and tend towards the appointed place and succeeded at length in alighting within a few yards of it    chapter six  ascents by messrs glaisher and coxwell  we now come to that point in our subject where it is appropriate to give more detailed and graphic accounts of the recent doings of aeronauts an extremely interesting description of a scientific balloon ascent is given by the celebrated aeronaut mr glaisher in a pamphlet from which we shall make a few extracts  see note 1 his description is illustrative of the subject of ballooning and contains the salient points of several ascents  he asks us to imagine the balloon somewhat more than half inflated eager for flight with only one link connecting it with earth namely a rope attached to an instrument called a liberating iron catch  when all the ballast instruments etcetera were placed in the car mr coxwell brought the balloon to a nice and even balance so that the addition of twenty pounds would have prevented it from rising  as the moment for departure drew near friends became impatient and every one anxiously watched the final arrangements which were made by mr coxwell on whom was laid the important duty of letting go  his hand was on the catch his countenance was fixed and his expression stern as he gazed up into the heavens  he was waiting for the right moment for the sky was partially cloudy and it was necessary to wait until the balloon was midway between the cloud that had just passed and the next that was approaching so that the aeronauts might have a clear sky and be able to see the earth they were about to quit for a time nor was this all he knew that in every wind however strong it might be there are periods of calm  if he could start in one of these he would avoid much rotatory motion  the deciding therefore of the exact moment for making a fair start was not so easy a matter as one might suppose  some one at this critical time with the characteristic eagerness of poor human nature to put its finger in the pie cried out now and another shouted pull but mr coxwell regardless of every one decided for himself and just when the wind lulled and the sun shone bright and the balloon stood proudly erect he pulled the trigger and they were free  but they were more than free  they were suddenly in profound repose forhowever high the wind may be however agitated the balloon swaying to and fro with sudden and violent action despite the efforts of many hands that endeavour to restrain itno sooner do aeronauts quit their hold of earth than in an instant all agitation ceases and they are in perfect stillness without any sense of motion whatever and this freedom continues throughout the entire flightexcept indeed when they sink so low as to come into contact with mother earth when the serenity of their flight is terribly and violently interrupted as shall be seen in the case of another balloon voyage hereafter to be described  they were now fairly away but we pause to remark before joining them in their voyage that their object on this occasion was not merely amusementscientific investigation and experiment were their aim  in order that the reader may have some idea of the nature of such we subjoin mr glaishers list of the objects of his experiments  the primary objects were he says to determine at various heights up to five milesfirst the pressure of the atmosphere second the temperature of the air third the hygrometrical or moistmeasured states of the air  the secondary objects were  to compare the readings of an aneroid barometer with those of a mercurial barometer up to five miles  to determine the electrical state of the air  to determine the oxygenic state of the atmosphere by means of ozone papers  to determine the time of vibration of a magnet on the earth and at different distances from it  to determine the temperature of the dew point by daniells dew point hygrometer and regnaults condensing hygrometer and by the use of the dry and wet bulb thermometers as ordinarily used and their use when under the influence of the aspirator causing considerable volumes of air to pass over both their bulbs at different elevations as high as possible but particularly up to heights where man may be resident or where troops may be located as in the high tablelands and plains of india with the view of ascertaining what confidence may be placed in the use of the dry and wet bulb thermometers at those elevations by comparison with daniells and regnaults hygrometers and also to compare the results as found by the two hygrometers together  to collect air at different elevations  to note the height and kind of clouds their density and thickness at different elevations  to determine the rate and direction of different currents in the atmosphere if possible  to make observations on sound  to note atmospherical phenomena in general and to make general observations  with these objects in view the aeronauts left terra firma and soared into the skies  once away says mr glaisher we are both immediately at work we have no time for graceful acknowledgments to cheering friends  mr coxwell must put the car in order and accordingly looks to it to his balloon and to the course we are taking and i must get my instruments in order and without delay place them in their situations adjust them and take a reading as soon as possible  in a few minutes we are from 1000 to 2000 feet high  mr coxwell looks intently upwards to see how the huge folds of the balloon fill into the netting  if we have started from a town we now hear its busy hum and the now fast fading cheers of our assembled friends naturally attract our attention  we behold at a glance the quicklydiminishing forms of the objects which we so lately left and then resume our work  presently mr coxwell who is always alive to the beauties of the evervarying scene below and to the opening landscape fixes his eye upon me and just when a rural scene of surpassing beauty is lighted up in the west he summons me to look and admire  i struggle against picturesque temptations somewhat at variance with my duties but cannot so quickly suppress them  a fine cloud rears its alpine cap in close proximity to the car mr coxwell looks as delighted as an artist when he displays a magnificent painting  i feel i must conquer such enchantment and exclaim beautiful grand indeed and again resume my observations with a cold philosophic resolve to pursue my readings without further interruption  for a while i am quiet the instruments affording indication that we are rising rapidly  mr coxwell again disturbs me just as we are approaching the clouds and recommends a farewell peep at mother earth and just as i take this the clouds receive us at first in a light gauze of vapour and then in their chilly embrace where i examine their structure and note the temperature of the dew point particularly  shortly it becomes lighter the light gradually increasing till it is succeeded by a flood of light at first striking then dazzling and we pass out of the dense cloud to where the clouds open out in bold and fantastic shapes showing us light and shadow and spectral scenes with prismatic embellishments disporting themselves around us in wild grandeur till at length we break out into brilliant sunshine and the clouds roll away in a perfect sea of vapour obscuring the earth entirely so that now in perfect silence i note the circumstances and make my observations for some time uninterruptedly  after a time mr coxwell directs my attention to the fact that the balloon is full and that the gas is coming out from the safetyvalve i of course look for this is an exciting moment  he then directs my attention to the fit and proportions of the netting  i find the gas which was before cloudy and opaque is now clear and transparent so that i can look right up the balloon and see the meshes of the network showing through it the upper valve with its springs and line reaching to the car and the geometrical form of the balloon itself  nor is this an idle examination  i have already said that in passing through the cloud the netting would gather moisture augmenting the weight of the balloon  if this should not all have evaporated the network would have become frozen and be a wirerope so that if the diamond shape of the netting when under tension and the form of the crown of the balloon be not symmetrical the weight might not be equally distributed and there would be danger of it cutting the balloon  a sense of security therefore follows such an examination  a stream of gas now continually issues from the neck which is very capacious being fully two square feet in area which is always left open  presently i see mr coxwell whose eye has been continually watching the balloon pass his fingers over the valveline as if in readiness to pull the cord  i observe a slight gathering on his brow and look inquiringly at him  he says i have decided upon opening the large upper valve and carefully explains why  the tension he says in the balloon is not greater than it would bear with safety in a warm stratum of air but now that we are three miles up with a chilled balloon it is better to allow some to escape at top as well as a good deal from the neck  at once i see the force of the argument and inwardly infer that i am in no way dependent upon chance and not likely to suffer from carelessness with mr coxwell  we are now far beyond all ordinary sounds from the earth a sea of clouds is below us so dense that it is difficult to persuade ourselves that we have passed through them  up to this time little or no inconvenience is met with but on passing above four miles much personal discomfort is experienced respiration becomes difficult the beating of the heart at times is audible the hands and lips become blue and at higher elevations the face also and it requires the exercise of a strong will to make and record observations  before getting to our highest point mr coxwell counts the number of his sandbags and calculates how much higher we can go with respect to the reserve of ballast necessary to regulate the descent  then i feel a vibration in the car and on turning round see mr coxwell in the act of lowering down the grapnel then looking up at the balloon then scanning the horizon and weighing apparently in his mind some distant clouds through which we are likely to pass in going down  a glance suffices to show that his mind is made up how much higher it is prudent to rise and how much ballast it is expedient to preserve  the balloon is now lingering as it were under the deep blue vault of space hesitating whether to mount higher or begin its descent without further warning  we now hold a consultation and then look around from the highest point giving silent scope to those emotions of the soul which are naturally called forth by such a widespread range of creation  our course is now about to change  but here i interpose with no no stop not yet let us remain so long that the instruments are certain to take up the true temperature and that no doubt can rest upon the observations here  when i am satisfied i shall say pull  then in silencefor here we respire with difficulty and talk but littlein the centre of this immense space in solitude without a single object to interrupt the view for 200 miles or more all round abstracted from the earth upheld by an invisible medium our mouths so dry that we cannot eat a white sea below us so far below we see few if any irregularities  i watch the instruments but forcibly impelled again look round from the centre of this vacuity whose boundaryline is 1500 miles commanding nearly 130000 square miles till i catch mr coxwells eye turned towards me when i again direct mine to the instruments and when i find no further changes are proceeding i wave my hand and say pull  a deep resonant sound is heard overhead a second pull is followed by a second report that rings as with shrill accompaniment down the very sides of the balloon  it is the working of the valve which causes a loud booming noise as from a soundingboard as the springs force the shutters back  but this sound in that solitary region amid silence so profound that no silence on earth is equal to ita drumlike sound meeting the ear from above from whence we do not usually hear soundsstrikes one forcibly  it is however one sound only there is no reverberation no reflection and this is characteristic of all sounds in the balloon one clear sound continuing during its vibrations then gone in a moment no sound ever reaches the ear a second time  but though the sound from the closing of the valve in those silent regions is striking it is also cheeringit is reassuring it proves all to be right that the balloon is sound that the colder regions have not frozen tight the outlet for gas and that we are so far safe  we have descended a mile and our feelings improve with the increase of air and warmth  but silence reigns supreme and mr coxwell i observe turns his back upon me scanning intently the cloudscape speculating as to when and where we shall break through and catch sight of the earth  we have been now two hours without seeing terra firma  how striking and impressive is it to realise a position such as this and yet as men of action whose province it is to subordinate mere feelings we refrain from indulging in sentiment  i say refrain for presently mr coxwell breaks out no longer able to contain himself here mr glaisher you must welcome another balloon  it is the counterpart of our own  this spectral balloon is charming to look upon and presents itself under a variety of imposing aspects which are magnified or diminished by the relative distance of our balloon from the clouds and by its position in relation to the sun which produces the shadow  at midday it is deep down almost underneath but it is more grandly defined towards evening when the golden and ruby tints of the declining sun impart a gorgeous colouring to cloudland  you may then see the spectre balloon magnified upon the distant cloudtops with three beautiful circles of rainbow tints  language fails utterly to describe these illuminated photographs which spring up with matchless truthfulness and choice decoration  just before we enter the clouds mr coxwell having made all preparations for the descent strictly enjoins me to be ready to put up the instruments lest when we lose the powerful rays of the sun and absorb the moisture of the lower clouds we should approach the earth with too great rapidity  we now near the confines of the clouds and dip swiftly into the thickest of them we experience a decided chill and hear the rustling of the collapsing balloon which is now but onethird full but cannot see it so dense is the mass of vapour  one two three or more minutes pass and we are still in the cloud  how thick it must be considering the rapidity of the descent  presently we pass below and the earth is visible  there is a high road intersecting green pastures a piece of water looking like polished steel presents itself a farmhouse with stacks and cattle is directly under us  we see the seacoast but at a distance  an open country lies before us  a shout comes up and announces that we are seen and all goes well save the rapidity of our descent which has been caused by that dark frowning cloud which shut us out from the suns rays and bedewed us with moisture  mr coxwell however is counteracting it by means of the ballast and streams out one bag which appears to fly up instead of falling down now another is cast forth but still it goes up up  a third reduces the wayward balloon within the bounds of moderation and mr coxwell exultingly exclaims that he has it now under perfect command with sand enough and to spare  delighted to find the balloon is thus checked as it is favourable to good readings of the several instruments at this elevation i work as quickly as i can noticing also the landscape below rich mounds of green foliage fields of various shades of green like a tessellated pavement in motion with roads rivers rivulets and the undulatory nature of the ground varying the scene every instant  should our passage be over a town it is like a model in motion and all is seen with a distinctness superior to that from the earth the line of sight is through a purer and less dense medium everything seems clearer though smaller even at the height of four miles above birmingham we distinguished the new street station and the streets  we have been descending slowly for a little time when i am challenged to signify when i can close my observations as yonder about two miles distant is a fine park where mr coxwells eye seems to wander with something like a desire to enter it  i approve of the spot as it is in every way suitable for a descent  the undercurrent which is oftentimes stronger than the upper is wafting us merrily in that direction  we are now only a few hundred feet above the surface  put up your instruments cries mr coxwell and we will keep on this level until you are ready  a little more sand is let out and i pack up the instruments quickly in their wadded cases  are you all right inquires the aeronaut  all right i respond look out then and hold fast by the ropes as the grapnel will stop us in that large meadow with the hedgerow in front  there sure enough we land  the cattle stand at bay affrighted their tails are horizontal and they run wildly away  but a group of friends from among the gentry and villagers draws up near the balloon and although some few question whether we belong to this planet or whether we are just imported from another yet any doubt upon this point is soon set at rest and we are greeted with a hearty welcome from all when we tell our story how we travelled the realms of space not from motives of curiosity but for the advancement of science its applicability to useful purposes and the good of mankind  in commenting on the several ascents thus combined in one description mr glaisher gives us various pieces of information which are highly interesting  the clouds he says on which the sun was shining brightly each moment opened up to view deep ravines and shining masses appeared like mountain ranges some rising perpendicularly from rolling seas or plains with summits of dazzling brightness some pyramidal others undulatory with deep shadows between  while passing over london on one occasion at night at the height of about one mile he heard the hum of the great city and saw its lights the river looked dull but the bridges that spanned it and the many miles of straight intersecting and winding streets were distinctly visible  in referring to sound he tells us that on different occasions at a height of 11800 feet above the earth a band was heard playing  at between four and five thousand feet a railway whistle and the shouting of people were heard and at 10070 feet the report of a gun  a dog was also heard barking at a height of two miles  at a height of 19000 feet the hands and lips were observed during one ascent to be of a dark bluish colour  at four miles the palpitations of the heart were audible and the breathing was affected  considerable difficulty was experienced in respiration at higher elevations  from his various observations he found that the effect of high elevation is different upon the same individuals at different times and believed that up to heights less than three milesto which persons of ordinary selfpossession might ascenddelicate and accurate scientific observations might be made with ease but at heights approaching to four miles such observations could not be made so well because of the personal distress of the observer and on approaching to five miles above the earth it required the exercise of a strong will to take any observations at all  the most wonderful and alarming of the experiences of mr glaisher appear to have occurred to him and his companion mr coxwell during an ascent made from wolverhampton on the 5th september when they reached the enormous elevation of between six and seven miles  they felt no particular inconvenience until after passing above the fifth mile  when at a height of 26000 feet mr glaisher could not see the column of mercury in the tube then the fine divisions on the scale of the instrument became invisible  shortly afterwards he laid his arm on the table and on attempting again to use it found that the limb was powerless  he tried to move the other arm and found that it also was paralysed  he then tried to shake himself and succeeded in shaking his body but experienced the curious sensation of having no legs  while in this condition he attempted to look at the barometer and while doing so his head fell on his left shoulder  struggling to get out of this lethargic state he found that he could still shake his body although he could not move either arms or legs  he got his head upright for an instant but it dropped again on his shoulder and he fell backwards his back resting against the side of the car and his head on its edge  in this position his eyes were directed to mr coxwell who did not at first observe the state of his companion in consequence of his having had to ascend into the ring of the balloon to disentangle the valveline which had become twisted  hitherto mr glaisher had retained the power of moving the muscles of his back and neck but suddenly this was lost to him  he saw mr coxwell dimly in the ring and attempted to speak to him but could not do so  a moment later intense black darkness surrounded himthe optic nerve had lost its power  he was still conscious however and with his brain as active as at other times  he fancied he had been seized with asphyxia and that death would quickly ensue unless they descended without delay  suddenly the power of thought ceased and he became unconscious  all these extraordinary and alarming sensations he calculated must have taken place within five or six minutes  while still powerless he heard the words temperature and observation and knew that mr coxwell was in the car endeavouring to arouse him  presently he heard him speak more emphatically but could neither see reply nor move  then he heard him say do try now do after which vision slightly returned and in a short time he saw clearly again rose from his seat looked round and said to mr coxwell i have been insensible  his friend replied you have and i too very nearly  mr coxwell had lost the use of his hands which were black mr glaisher therefore poured brandy over them  his companion then told him that on descending from the ring he thought he had laid himself back to rest but noticing that his legs projected and his arms hung down by his side it struck him there was something wrong and he attempted to go to his assistance but felt insensibility coming over himself  he tried to open the valve so that they might descend but having lost the use of his hands could not  in this critical moment he seized the cord with his teeth dipped his head two or three times and thus succeeded in opening the valve and descending from those dangerous regions of attenuated atmosphere  at first they went down at the tremendous rate of twenty miles an hour but after descending three miles in nine minutes the balloons progress was checked and they finally alighted safely in a grass field where their appearance so terrified the country folk that it required a good deal of coaxing in plain english to convince them that the aeronauts were not inhabitants of another world    note 1  exeter hall lecturesscientific experiments in balloons by james glaisher esquire frspublished by james nisbet and company london    chapter seven  account of nadars balloon le geant  first ascent  as the giant is the largest balloon that has yet been made and as its experiences on the occasions of its first and second ascents were not only peculiar but terrible we shall give an account of it in detail commencing with its construction and ending with the thrilling termination of its brief but wild career  monsieur nadar a photographer of paris was the enthusiastic and persevering aeronaut who called it into being and encountered the perils of its ascents from which he did not emerge scatheless as we shall see  besides being an experimental voyager in cloudland monsieur nadar started a newspaper named laeronaute in which he gives an account of the giant and his reasons for constructing it  these latter were peculiar  he is emphatic in asserting that the huge balloon was never intended by him to be an end but a mere steppingstone to an endwhich end was the construction of an aeromotivea machine which was to be driven by means of a screw and which he intended should supersede balloons altogether so that his own giant was meant to be the last of its race  in reference to this monsieur nadar tells us that he was deeply impressed with the belief that the screw would ultimately become our aerial motor but that being ignorant of what it was likely the experiments of this first aeromotive would cost he had resolved instead of begging for funds to enable him to accomplish his great end to procure funds for himself in the following manner  i shall says he make a balloonthe last balloonin proportions extraordinarily gigantic twenty times larger than the largest which shall realise that which has never been but a dream in the american journals which shall attract in france england and america the crowd always ready to run to witness the most insignificant ascent  in order to add further to the interest of the spectaclewhich i declare beforehand without fear of being belied shall be the most beautiful spectacle which it has ever been given to man to contemplatei shall dispose under this monster balloon a small balloon balloneau destined to receive and preserve the excess of gas produced by dilation instead of losing this excess as has hitherto been the case which will permit my balloon to undertake veritable long voyages instead of remaining in the air two or three hours only like our predecessors  i do not wish to ask anything of any one nor of the state to aid me even in this question of general and also of such immense interest  i shall endeavour to furnish myself the two hundred thousand francs necessary for the construction of my balloon  the said balloon finished by public ascents and successive exhibitions at paris london brussels vienna baden berlin new york and everywhere i know that i shall collect ten times the funds necessary for the construction of our first aeromotive  this first aeromotive however has not yet made its appearance whether from want of funds or of practicability we do not know but monsieur nadar carried his designs triumphantly into effect with the monster balloon which in course of time made its appearance performed flights attracted the wonder and admiration as well as a good deal of the coin of hundreds of thousands in france and england even conveyed royalty up into the clouds broke the bones of its originator and was exhibited in the great transept which it nearly filled of the crystal palace at sydenham  while there we had the good fortune to behold it with our own eyes  the construction of this balloon merits particular notice but first it may be remarked that it is well worthy of being named a giant seeing that its height was only fortyfive feet less than that of the towers of notre dame cathedral namely 196 feet  that nadar had cut out for himself an arduous task will be readily believed  touching on this he writes thus  i have set myself to work immediately and with difficulties sleepless nights vexations which i have kept to myself alone to this hour and which some one of the days of this winter the most urgent part of my task being finished i shall in part make in confidence to my readers i have succeeded in establishing my balloon in founding at the same time this journalindispensable moniteur to the aerial automotive and in laying the basis of that which shall be perhaps the greatest financial operation of the age  those who shall see and appreciate these labours will please to pardon me i hope for having wiped my forehead with a little touch of pride when at the end of a monthone monthi have said to myself it is done  the giant was composed of yellowish white silk of which there were used 22000 yards at about 5 shillings 4 pence a yard so that the cost of the silk alone was 5866 pounds  this was cut into 118 gores which were entirely handsewed with a double seam and some idea of the vastness of the work may be gathered from the fact that 200 women were employed during a month in the sewing of the gores  for the sake of greater strength the silk was doubled  in other words there were two balloons of the same size one within the other  directly beneath and attached to its lower orifice there was a small balloon called a compensator the object of which was to receive and retain for use the surplus gas  when a balloon rises to the higher regions of the atmosphere the gas within it expands so that a large quantity of it is allowed to rush out at the open mouth beneath or at the safetyvalve above  were this not the case the balloon would certainly burst  this loss of gas however is undesirable because when the balloon descends the gas contracts and the loss is then felt to be a great one  by collecting the overflow of gas in the compensator this disadvantage is obviated  the car which was made chiefly of wickerwork was actually a small cottage of two storeys a groundfloor and platform or upper deck with door and windows  its height was about eight and its length thirteen feet  the groundfloor contained a cruciform passage and six divisions at one extremity was a captains cabin with a bed in it and underneath a compartment for luggage  at the other was the passengers cabin with three beds one above the other  the four other divisions or rooms were a provision store a lavatory a place for conducting photographic operations and a room for a small lithographic press with which it was intended to print an account of the voyage to be scattered about the localities over which they should pass  in reference to this last monsieur nadar writes  an english company a month ago our neighbours are marvellous in not losing time appreciating the bustle which the sight of a balloon always excites in every inhabited place and judging rightly that papers would never be better received and more greedily read than those thrown overboard by us despatched a messenger to propose to me to accept commercial prospectuses  we shall never have too much money for the construction of our first aeromotive  i have accepted and made a contract  besides many miscellaneous articles such as grapnels fowlingpieces speakingtrumpets etcetera that were to be carried up in this cot there were provisions of all sorts instruments for scientific observations games means of defence in case of descent among an inhospitable people and two cages of carrierpigeons sent from liege the car and all it contained was secured by twenty cables traversing on and beneath its walls interlaced with the fabric and fastened to a large hoop just below the neck to which hoop was also attached the ropes of the network by which the balloon itself was enveloped  there were two axles and four wheels connected with the car by means of which it could when necessary be drawn along an ordinary road  canes disposed to act as springs were placed underneath and round the middle of it to protect it from concussions besides which internal buoys and an immense girdle in compartments of inflated indiarubber rendered it incapable of submersion in water  such was the giant balloon in which monsieur nadar and his friends made two ascents of the first of which 4th october 1863 galignani writes thus  the departure of this leviathan of the airy regions attracted immense crowds to the champ de mars yesterday afternoon  considering that the avenues encircling that vast space were filled to suffocation so that we found it extremely difficult to force our way to the open ground reserved for tickets and that all the housetops were occupied by spectators we think the number of persons present may fairly be stated at 80000  ample precautions had been taken to prevent disastersa strong police force supported by a company of infantry and some cavalry being present to maintain order  the balloon which is 90 yards in circumference and has consumed upwards of 20000 yards of silk in its manufacture was held down while filling by about 100 men and the weight of at least 200 sandbags  the car was of wickerwork comprising an inner surface of about 54 square feet divided into three compartments or small rooms surmounted by an open terrace to which the balloon was braced  outside grapnels wheels and fowlingpieces four of each besides two speakingtrumpets were lashed to the sides of the car  the wheels were intended to be put to the car after alighting in order to convey it back with horses  the preliminary operations took considerable time putting the patience of the spectators to a severe trial a circumstance which perhaps prevented them from cheering when the words lachez tout were given and the immense machine rose slowly and majestically into the air  we were rather surprised at the silence of the public considering the very remarkable and interesting feat in aeronautics thus successfully performed  there were fifteen persons in the car or rather cabinmonsieur nadar captain messieurs marcel louis and jules godard lieutenants the prince de saynwittgenstein count de saint martin monsieur tournachon nadars brother messieurs eugene delessert thirion piallat robert mitchell gabriel morris paul de saint victor de villemessant and one lady the princess de la tour dauvergne  the princess was taking her usual drive to the bois de boulogne when observing an unusual movement in the neighbourhood of the invalides and having inquired the cause she ordered her coach man to drive to the champ de mars  having seen the balloon she expressed a wish to make the ascent and although nadar had to the last moment refused to take any lady and even his own wife he could not resist the entreaty of the princess  on starting monsieur nadar climbed up the network and took off his hat to the spectators the balloon took a northeasterly direction and was visible for some time  at the moment of going to press a communication has reached us signed by the captain monsieur nadar and all those who had taken places in the balloon stating that on alighting yesterday evening at nine oclock at ibarcy near meaux seineetmarne three severe shocks were experienced which had the effect of completely capsizing the balloon and inflicting on its occupants several rather severe contusions  interesting details of the ascent of the nadar balloon said to have been narrated by prince wittgenstein are given by the france  the most extraordinary is that at halfpast eight when the balloon attained the height of 1500 metres the aeronauts saw the sun which had set for the earth below upwards of two hours before  the effect of the light upon the balloon is described as something marvellous and as having thrown the travellers into a sort of ecstasy  although they met with no rain their clothes were all dripping wet from the mist which they passed through  the descent was more perilous than at first reported  the car dragged on its side for nearly a mile and the passengers took refuge in the ropes to which they clung  several were considerably bruisedthough as before stated no one sustained any very serious injury  everybody behaved well  nadar visibly uneasy about his fair charge the young princess de la tour dauvergne was told by her to attend to his duty as captain  every one at his post said she i will keep to mine  notwithstanding all the shaking which the car underwent the 37 bottles of wine provided for the journey were all found unbroken and they were most joyously broached when the party got on terra firma  the rifles the crockery as well as a cake and 13 ices presented to nadar by siraudin of the rue de la paix were all uninjured  when the descent was effected the lights and the speakingtrumpets soon attracted a number of peasants who brought carts and helped the party to the village of barcy where most of them passed the night but monsieur nadar and the prince de wittgenstein with two or three others came to paris by the first train from meaux  it is said that the descent was resolved upon in consequence of the advice of the brothers godard and contrary to the wish of monsieur nadar who as captain had made every one of his companions sign an agreement to act upon his orders even though the vote should be unanimously against him  he however yielded his opinion in deference to that of these experienced aeronauts  a truly extraordinary statement is that they fancied the wind was blowing them to the sea and certain destruction whereas they were going due east with no sea at all before them nearer than the caspian  there was great disappointment in the receipts at the champ de mars which are said to have realised only 27000 francs whereas 150000 had been calculated upon  the papers say that the public broke down the barriers and got in for nothing instead of paying their franc  it is quite certain that at the moment of the ascent there could not have been less than 50000 people on the champ de mars and on the terraces and heights around there must have been four times that number  monsieur nadar on his return to paris wrote as follows  here as briefly as possible is the account which you asked me to send  yesterday evening at nine oclock the giant was compelled to descend near the barcy marsh two leagues from meaux after three violent shocks the last of which completely turned everything in the car topsyturvy and it descended on its side  the rupture of our valvepipe rope while travelling by night forced us to throw out our anchors  one of the prongs of the first anchor having broken the principal anchor fortunately took hold of the ground  we were able to let out the gas notwithstanding the violence of the wind and the car was set up at halfpast one in the morning  some slight contusions and a concussion of the knee of one of the passengersthat is our receipt in full  it is not too dear  a  nadar  this bold and zealous aeronaut unfortunately paid dearer for his succeeding ascent as shall be seen in the next chapter    chapter eight  second ascent of nadars giant balloon  before describing the second ascent which was decidedly the more adventurous we shall give the rules laid down for his party by monsieur nadar which were remarkably stringent and somewhat amusing  1  every traveller on board the geant must before mounting take knowledge of the present rules and engage himself upon his honour to respect them and to make them respected both in the letter and in the spirit  he accepts and will obey this obligation until the descent  2  from the departure to the return there shall be only one command that of the captain  that command shall be absolute  3  as legal penalty cannot be enforced the captain having the responsibility of the lives of the passengers decides alone and without appeal in all circumstances the means of assuring the execution of his orders with the aid of all under him  the captain can in certain cases take the advice of the crew but his own authority is decisive  4  every passenger declares at the time of ascending that he carries with him no inflammable materials  5  every passenger accepts by his simple presence on board his entire part and perfect cooperation in all manoeuvres and submits himself to all the necessities of the service above all to the command of the captain  on landing he must not quit the balloon without permission duly acquired  6  silence must be absolutely observed when ordered by the captain  7  victuals and liquors carried up by the travellers must be deposited in the common canteen of which the captain alone has the key and who regulates the distribution thereof  passengers have no claim to victuals and liquors except when on board  8  the duration of the journey is not limited  the captain alone decides the limitation the same judgment decides without appeal the putting down of one or more travellers in the course of the voyage  9  all gambling is expressly prohibited  10  it is absolutely forbidden to any traveller to throw overboard ballast or any packet whatever  11  no passenger can carry up with him luggage exceeding thirty pounds in weight and occupying more space than a travellingbag  12  except in very rare cases of which the captain alone shall be judge it is absolutely forbidden to smoke on board or on land within the vicinity of the balloon  the second ascent took place on the 18th of october when monsieur nadar nothing daunted by his former experience again went up in his giant from the champ de mars  on this occasion preliminaries were managed with greater success than on the former and the event was regarded with much more general interest  soldiers kept the ground the emperor himself was present and conversed with the bold aeronaut on the subject of his balloon george the first of greece was there also and the crowd which assembled to witness the ascent surpassed all expectation  there were two peculiar features in this second ascent  it had been doubted whether the balloon which was said to be capable of raising fourandahalf tons could carry more than thirteen men  in order to set this question at rest a short preliminary flight was made with a rope attached to restrain the giant  about thirty soldiers were then put into the car who mounted to the extent of the rope and were pulled down again  the other feature was that a balloon of more ordinary dimensions was let fly along with the giant to give by contrast a better idea of its size  the balloon used for this purpose was the godillot which had been used by the emperor in the italian campaign for reconnoitring the enemy  after the usual delays which are inseparable from such displays monsieur nadar with eight friends stepped into the car the rope was let go and the giant rose slowly towards the clouds grew small by degrees and beautifully less until it finally disappeared about nightfallbeing wafted along by a gentle southeasterly breeze  nothing more was heard of the aeronauts for the next two days and their friends were becoming naturally very anxious about them when at last a telegram came from bremen dated the 21st which ran as follows  nadars balloon descended near eystrup in hanover  there were nine persons in it of whom three were seriously and two slightly injured  other telegrams quickly followed stating that monsieur nadar had both legs dislocated monsieur saint felix had sustained severe fractures and contusions and that madame nadar had also been severely injured  it was stated that the voyagers would probably all have perished if jules godard a celebrated aeronaut who with his brother louis accompanied nadar had not at the risk of his life climbed up the network and cut a hole in the silk with a hatchet so as to allow the gas to escape  by so doing he stopped the furious course of the balloon which was making truly gigantic bounds of from forty to fifty yards over the ground with a violence that would soon have knocked the car to pieces  a full and graphic but inflated and sentimental account of the voyage which was one of real and thrilling interestis given by one of the voyagers monsieur eugene arnould a reporter of the french newspaper la nation  had monsieur arnould confined himself to a simple statement of facts he would have greatly increased the interest and power of his description  however we must take him as we find him and as his account is the most completeand correct in the main although exaggerated in detailwe present it to the reader  at nine oclock at night the same night on which they started we were at erquelines we passed over malines and towards midnight we were in holland  we rose up very high but it was necessary to come down to see where we were  ignorant of that our position was a critical one below as far as we could see were marshes and in the distance we could hear the roar of the sea  we threw out ballast and mounting again soon lost sight of the earth  what a night  nobody slept as you may suppose for the idea of falling into the sea had nothing pleasant about it and it was necessary to keep a lookout in order to effect if necessary a descent  my compass showed that we were going towards the eastthat is to say towards germany  in the morning after a frugal breakfast made in the clouds we redescended  an immense plain was beneath us the villages appeared to us like childrens toysrivers seemed like little rivuletsit was magical the sun shone splendidly over all  towards eight oclock we arrived near a great lake there i found out our bearings and announced that we were at the end of holland near the sea  we passed i know not how much time in contemplating the enchanting scene around us but at length we all felt the necessity of going downwards to see where we were  presently the balloon came so near to the earth that we could readily distinguish the tall chimneys of a great many flaming furnaces  if we were to fall upon some of them said montgolfier anxiously  these furnaces told us very clearly that we were in belgium and besides the flemish songs that continually reached our ears left no doubt upon the point  godard nadar all of us called out frequently to the people below where are we but we got no other answer than shouts of laughter  there were two bells in the car and yon and myself rang them as hard as we could while nadar roared through his speakingtrumpet  i had an opportunity of observing that the purity of the air in no degree attenuates the quantity of false notes lodged in the throats of certain individuals  our aerial charivari at length provoked a corresponding one on earth and we could hear dogs barking ducks quacking men swearing and women screaming  all this had a droll effect but time went on the wind blew hard it was dark night and our balloon drove on with prodigious rapidity and we were not able to tell exactly where we were  i could not see my compass and we were not allowed to light a lucifer match under any pretext whatsoever  from the direction in which we had passed over lille we judged that we must be going towards the sea louis godard fancied that he could see lighthouses  we descended again to within 150 yards of the earth beneath us we saw a flat marshy country of sinister aspect and indicating plainly the neighbourhood of the coast  every one listened with all his ears and many fancied they heard the murmurs of the sea the further we went on the more desert the country became there was no light whatever and it became more and more difficult to guess where we were going  i am entirely out of my reckoning exclaimed louis godard and my opinion is that the only thing we have to do is to descend at once  what here in the marshes remonstrated all of us and suppose we are driven into the sea  the balloon went driving on still  we cannot descend here said jules godard we are over water  two or three of us looked over the edge of the car and affirmed that we were not over water but trees  it is water jules godard persisted  every one now looked out attentively and as the balloon descended a little we saw plainly that there was no water but without being able to say positively whether there were trees or not at the moment when jules godard thought he saw water nadar exclaimed i see a railway  it turned out that what nadar took for a railway was a canal running towards the scheldt which we had passed over a few minutes before  hurrah for balloons  they are the things to travel in rivers mountains customhousesall are passed without let or hindrance  but every medal has its reverse and if we were delighted at having safely got over the scheldt we by no means relished the prospect of going on to the zuyder zee  shall we go down asked louis godard  there was a moments pause  we consulted together  suddenly i uttered a cry of joy the position of the needle of my compass indicated that the balloon had made a half turn to the right and was now going due east  the aspect of the stars confirmed this assertion  forward was now the cry  we threw out a little ballast mounted higher and started with renewed vigour with our backs turned to the depreciated zuyder zee  it was now three in the morning and none of us had slept just as we began to try to sleep a little my diabolical compass showed that the balloon was turning back again  where are you going to take us to cried out yon to the immense mass of canvas which was oscillating above our heads  louis godard again proposed to descend but we said no forward forward  two hours sped away without our being able to tell where we were  at five oclock day broke and broad daylight came on with marvellous rapidity  it is true that we were at a height of 980 metres  novelwriters and others have so much abused descriptions of sunrise on mountains and on the ocean that i shall say little about this one although it is not a common thing to see the horizon on fire below the clouds  the finest venetian paintings could alone give an idea of the luxuriant tones of the heaven that we saw such dazzling magnificence led me to wonder that there is no revival of sun worship since men must necessarily have some material representation of the divinity  it is true that the sun is not made in mans image  we now had beneath us an immense plain the same probably that we had passed over in the night  there is nothing more pleasant at first sight nor more monotonous in the longrun than the sort of country which forms at least onethird of holland  there are miniature woods the size of bouquets fields admirably cultivated and divided into little patches like gardens rivers with extraordinary windings microscopic roads coquettishlooking villages so white and so clean that i think the dutch housewives must scour the very roofs of their houses every morning  in the midst of every village there is a jewel of a church with a shining steeple  while riding along at a height of 700 metres we had beneath us a picture of paul potters fifty leagues square  all at once the tableaux became animated  the people below had perceived the balloon  we heard cries expressive of astonishment fright and even of anger but the feeling of fright seemed to predominate  we distinctly saw women in their chemises look hurriedly out of windows and then rush back again  we saw chubby boys looking at us and blubbering as if they were mad  some men more determined than the rest fired off guns at us  i saw several mammas pointing us out to stubborn babies with an attitude which seemed to say that our balloon was old bogy  old women raised their hands against us and at their signal many ran away making the sign of the cross  it is evident that in some of these villages we were taken to be the devil in person  on this point it is apropos to cite a letter communicated to me which has been addressed to the courrier de hanovre  i translate it textually  this morning at about six oclock we saw passing over our heads at a prodigious height an immense round form to which was suspended some thing which looked like a square house of a red colour  some people pretend to have seen animated beings in this strange machine and to have heard issuing from it superhuman cries  what think you mr editor  the whole country is in a state of alarm and it will be long before our people recover their equanimity  at seven am we crossed over a lake near yssel the wind then again pushed us in a new direction nearly at right angles with that which we were taking before  in less than a quarter of an hour the balloon got into westphalia near renheim then we crossed the great river ems the towns of rheine and ibbenburen and returned to hanover a little above osnabruck  we traversed without deigning to take notice of them a little chain of mountains and by way no doubt of relaxation after so long a journey went all round a lake which is called in german dummersee  we then got into a great plain through which runs a road at this time the balloon became almost motionless  the reason of this was that the heat of the sun had caused the gas to expand  the thermometer was then at 145 degrees about 59 degrees fahrenheit no editor  louis godard was very uneasy about this dilation  after two or three oscillations our aerial courser decided upon going off rapidly in an eastern direction with about two degrees variation towards the north  this course would have taken us to hamburg and the baltic but we were all so completely absorbed by the splendour of the tableau before us that we took little note of the change  our hippogriff passed over wagenfeldsteyerberg where there is a river which flows into the weser  we came within sight of the great river and nienburg a considerable town on one of its banks  we saw a steamboat going down the river from the town  the view here was charming  a rustling of the silk of our balloon made us look upwards the monster under the influence of the sun now very hot was palpably swelling  as it would have been supremely ridiculous after having made such a firstrate journey to have treated the inhabitants of nienburg with the spectacle of seeing us blown upto say nothing of the consequences of such a catastrophe to our own limbswe resolved to come down  the remaining bags of ballast were got in order the ropes and the anchors prepared and godard opened the safetyvalve  the monster is disgorging exclaimed thirion  and the balloon did vomit forth its gas with a tremendous noise which may be compared to the snoring of some gigantic animal  while our companion made this observation we were descending at the rate of two metres to the second  to the ropes to the ropes hold on well cried the brothers godard who seemed quite in their element take care of the shock  every one climbed up to the ropes which attach the car to the circular handles underneath the balloon madame nadar whose sangfroid was truly magnificent grasped two large ropes with her delicate hands  nadar did the like but at the same time put his arms round his wife so as to protect her body  i was on one side towards the middle of the sort of hurdle which serves as a balcony  i was on my knees and clinging to two ropes  montgolfier thirion and saint felix were near me  the balloon descended so rapidly that it gave us the vertigo  the air which we had left so calm above became a violent wind as we neared the earth  we are going to throw down the anchors said godard hold tight  ah the car struck the earth with tremendous violence  i cannot imagine how it was that my arms were not broken  after the first terrible shock the balloon went up again but the safetyvalve was openedit again felland we suffered a second shock if not more violent at least more painful to us than the first  up we went again the balloon dragged its anchors several times we thought we should be thrown out  the anchors are broken exclaimed godard  the balloon beat the ground with its head like a kite when it falls down  it was horrible  on we went towards nienburg at the rate of ten leagues an hour  three large trees were cut through by the car as clean as if by a woodmans hatchet  one small anchor still remained to us  we threw it down and it carried away the roof of a house  if the balloon had dragged us through the town we should inevitably have been cut to pieces  but fortunately it rose a little and then bumped against the ground again with as much violence as before  every one of these shocks wrenched our limbs to complete our misfortunes the rope of the safetyvalve got loose from us and the safetyvalve shutting up we lost all hope of the balloon emptying itself  it went on by bounds of twentyfive thirty and forty metres from the earth and continued to fall upon its head  everything that stood in the way of the car was dashed to pieces  jules godard then tried and accomplished an act of sublime heroism he clambered up into the netting the shocks of which were so terrible that three times he fell on my head  at length he reached the cord of the valve opened it and the gas having a way of escape the monster ceased to rise but it still shot along in a horizontal line with prodigious rapidity  there were we squatting down upon the frail osier car  take care we cried when a tree was in the way  we turned from it and the tree was broken but the balloon was discharging its gas and if the immense plain we were crossing had yet a few leagues we were saved  but suddenly a forest appeared in the horizon we must leap out at whatever risk for the car would be dashed to pieces at the first collision with those trees  i got down into the car and raising myself i know not howfor i suffered from a wound in my knees my trousers were torni jumped and made i know not how many revolutions and fell upon my head  after a minutes dizziness i rose  the car was then far off  by the aid of a stick i dragged myself to the forest and having gone a few steps i heard some groans  saint felix was stretched on the soil frightfully disfigured his body was one wound he had an arm broken the chest torn and an ankle dislocated  the car had disappeared  after crossing a river i heard a cry  nadar was stretched on the ground with a dislocated thigh his wife had fallen into the river  another companion was shattered  we occupied ourselves with saint felix and nadar and his wife  in trying to assist the latter i was nearly drowned for i fell into the water and sank  they picked me up again and i found the bath had done me good  by the assistance of the inhabitants the salvage was got together  vehicles were brought they placed us upon straw  my knees bled my loins and head seemed to be like mincemeat but i did not lose my presence of mind an instant and for a second i felt humiliated at looking from the truss of straw at those clouds which in the night i had had under my feet  it was in this way we reached rethem in hanover  in seventeen hours we had made nearly 250 leagues  our course infernale had covered a space of three leagues  now that it is over i have some shudderings  it does not signify we have made a good journey and i marvel to see with what indifference we may regard the most frightful death for besides the prospect of being dashed about on our way we had that of gaining the sea and how long should we have lived then  i am glad to have seen thishappier yet at having to narrate it to you  these germans who surround us are brave people and we have been as well cared for as the resources of the little spot will allow  psi have just reached hanover with my companions and reopen my letter to tell you so  the king has sent an aidedecamp to us  are we at the end of our reverses  at any rate i am consoled to think they can no longer laugh at us in paris  we have kept our promises and more  making some allowance for the palpable exaggeration of small details this excitable frenchmans description of the ascent is the best that we have seen therefore we have given it in full  the accounts given by other members of the party corroborate most of it and correct a few of its errors  for instance where monsieur arnould represents the anchor as dragging off the roof of a house another account states that it tore away one of the rafters and while he tells us that large trees were cut through by the car as clean as if by a woodmans hatchet monsieur godard says that they were knocked down or uprooted  but upon the whole after comparing the several narratives we are of opinion that with all his tendency to exaggeration and the use of inflated language monsieur arnould has found it impossible to convey by means of words an adequate conception of this perhaps the most wonderful and thrilling balloon voyage on record  many dangerous voyages of thrilling interest have been undertaken since this ascent of monsieur nadar  we shall just give a brief account of two of these which occurred at a comparatively recent date to show the reader that men are not to be deterred by the misfortunes of predecessors from prosecuting inquiries and experiments in this field  a fete was held some years ago in the park of mr north basford near nottingham  amongst the amusements it was arranged that mr coxwell should make a balloon ascent  the balloon was almost new but not of very large dimensions  after it had been fully inflated mr coxwell tried it and found there would be some difficulty in ascending in it owing to its weight  at this juncture a mr james chambers of nottingham who had previously made many ascents stepped forward and offered to go in his stead saying that he was lighter than mr coxwell and that he wished to make the ascent  after some conversation it was agreed that chambers should go up but mr coxwell told him not to attempt an ascent unless he felt quite confident that he could manage the balloon  chambers replied that he had no fear about managing it and accordingly he was allowed to make the ascent  the balloon rose steadily and was carried somewhat rapidly in a northeasterly direction towards nottingham  it proceeded as far as arno vale when it was seen suddenly to collapse while still at a considerable altitude and then to fall quickly in an unshapely mass  some young men who were near the spot where the balloon fell hastened to render assistance  the balloon dropped into the car as it descended completely covering it and ultimately both fell in a field near scout lane three miles from nottingham  the car struck the ground and rebounded several feet and then fell again when it was seized and stopped by the young men who had followed it  at the bottom of the car lay stretched the body of the unfortunate aeronaut  he was lifted out and found to be breathing but quite insensible  he was conveyed to the nearest dwelling and means were adopted to restore animation but without effect  two medical gentlemen named robertson and maltby afterwards saw him and it was discovered that his left thigh was fractured and some of the ribs on his left side were broken but they considered it very probable that the unfortunate man had died through suffocation as a handkerchief which had been found in his mouth had probably been placed there by himself when he found that he was in danger of being stifled by the gas from the collapsing balloon  on another occasion still more recent a perilous balloon voyage was accomplished by an aeronaut named vouens  he ascended from the bellevue gardens near huddersfield in a balloon which was capable of containing 20000 cubic feet of gas  its height was 50 feet and it expanded to 100 feet in circumference  away floated the balloon in a westerly direction oscillating for a considerable distance in a most extraordinary and unusual manner  mr vouens experienced a stronger breeze than he had anticipated and the current changing rapidly his energy and knowledge as an aeronaut were very severely taxed  a fresh current drove him to the east for a time but presently another gust unexpectedly sent him in the direction of halifax and thence towards bradford in a northerly course  after the lapse of twenty minutes the balloon and its occupant pierced the clouds  mr vouens then began to make observations for the purpose of selecting a suitable site on which to descend and in a few minutes concentrated his attention upon a field in which a fete was being held  the breeze however carried him some three miles further and a second time mr vouens attempted to lower himself in a field adjoining some farmhouses at denholme cautiously opening the escapevalve he continued the journey downwards and threw out the grapnels  impetuous blasts of wind increased the difficulty of bringing the balloon to anchor  a strong wind prevailing it became unmanageable and drifted over fields and stone walls with amazing velocity  the flukes of the grapnels penetrated the ground and uprooted the earth as they followed in the wake of the balloon while the aerial chariot dashed onwards making in its career wide gaps in several stone walls  mr vouens preparing to encounter the worst fate wrapped the end of the cord which opens the escapevalve round one of his wrists and burying himself in the car permitted the balloon to proceed until the breeze subsided when after the car had been thrice capsized and every article which it contained thrown out mr vouens who received no injuries anchored and completed a voyage of many miles which occupied halfanhour in its accomplishment    chapter nine  warballoons  as the french were the first to teach mankind the art of navigating the air by means of balloons so they were the first to set the example of applying them to the art of war  it may not be generally known perhaps that balloons have actually been used in war  they were first introduced to this new field of action at valenciennes in 1793 and the result of the experiment was a failure not however owing to the fault of man but to the unpropitious nature of the winds  the garrison being hard pressed by the english and their allies attached a letter addressed to the national assembly to a small balloon or parachute and committed it to a breeze which blew in the direction of paris  towards evening the wind changed and the faithless messenger fell into the enemys camp  about the same time the subject of warballoons was brought before the committee of public safety who commissioned a young captain of engineers named coutelle to make experiments and report on the matter  he made a balloon twentyseven feet in diameter with a car to hold two persons which when filled with hydrogen gas was capable of lifting about a quarter of a ton and cost a little above 80 pounds  it was not intended that this balloon should go free  it was to be held down by two guyropes each between four and five hundred yards in length by which when at the full length of its tether the balloon was to be hauled about in any direction pulled down or allowed to rise in obedience to the wishes of the aeronaut who was to communicate his orders by means of a system of signals  reports of what he might be thus enabled to discover of the enemys position were to be written on slips of paper put into small sandbags and tossed overboard  small coloured flags were attached to each bag so that it might be easily observed in its descent  after several satisfactory ascents to the height of above 500 feet had taken placethe balloon being held easily by ten men five to each guyropean order was given in april 1794 for the formation of a company of military aeronautsstyled aerostiers to which coutelle was appointed captaincommandant  his company consisted of one lieutenant one sergeantmajor one sergeant two corporals and twenty privates who wore a dark blue uniform with black velvet facings and were armed with pistols and swords  this new and peculiar company of aerostiers was very soon sent to join the army at maubeuge and was regarded with some ridicule and contempt by the rest of the army  coutelle however took an effectual method of commanding respect  he begged that he and his men might be allowed to take part in a projected sortie  they were permitted and went an officer and private were wounded and the corps behaved with such gallantry that it was from that time treated with becoming respect  ascents were made daily in the balloon for reconnoitring purposes and the austrians fired at their audacious and inquisitive enemy both with muskets and cannon but without effect  after a time the balloon was ordered to take the road and join that part of the army which was marching on charleroi  its march through the country in leadingstrings was curious to spectators and harassing to the aerostiers  the car with all its appurtenances was placed on a cart over which the balloon was allowed to float at a height sufficient to admit of the passage of cavalry under it  twenty men marching in single file held it down by twenty stays but they had a sad time of it for their charge was headstrong and restive jerking and tugging at them continually not only with its own inherent power of ascension but with the irregular impetus derived from gusts and squalls of wind which caused it to make sudden and violent charges against trees houses or whatever chanced to come in its way and sometimes to beat its blunt forehead wildly on the ground as if it had been a monster in despair  it reached charleroi however on the 22nd of june after a journey of three days and took part in the battle of fleurus on the 26th  a high wind rendered it necessary on the day of battle to fasten its guyropes to thirty horsesfifteen to each ropeand thus secured it remained in the air eight hours passing from place to place and making observations  its services were so highly appreciated by the generals on that occasion that a second balloon was made and sent to the field of action  the first one which was named lentreprenant met with accidents which rendered it necessary that it should be sent to maubeuge for repair but it afterwards rejoined the army and took part in the battle of aldenhoven at the capture of bonn and at the operations before ehrenbreitstein in all of which it escaped without a wound although frequently exposed to a furious fire of musketry and shells from the exasperated austrians  nevertheless its natural enemy the wind did not allow it to escape scatheless as coutelle shows in one of his letters  he writes thus  i received orders to make a reconnaissance of mayence  i accordingly posted myself between our lines and the town at about half cannonshot distance  the wind was very high so to counteract its effects as far as lay in my power i ascended alone with two hundred pounds additional buoyancy  i was at a height of five hundred metres when three successive gusts dashed me to the ground with such violence that several portions of the car were smashed to bits  each time the balloon darted up again with so much force that sixtyfour menthirtytwo at each guyropewere dragged to some distance  had the guys been made fast to grapnels as had been suggested to me they must infallibly have given way  notwithstanding this rough treatment the aerial warrior managed during a lull in the wind to count the number of the enemys guns  but the successes of these warballoons were sadly intermingled with reverses of fortune and harassing difficulties  the aeronauts had indeed won the respect and admiration of the army but this did not compensate for the terribly fatiguing work of holding on with scarcely a moments intermission to the ropes of the intractable monsters during long and frequent marches  the second balloon at length succeeded in breaking loose and was so much damaged as to become unserviceable and the first one was afterwards found riddled with ballsdestroyed it was supposed by its own men who had become tired of the hardships to which they were continually subjected  the balloon was repaired but was taken prisoner at wurtzburg in september 1796 after a short but brilliant and it is said useful career  after this the warballooning fell into disrepute  some attempts have been made in modern times to revive it but these are not worth mentioning    chapter ten  aerial locomotives etcetera  having treated of the balloon in all its different aspects it is both just and appropriate to conclude with an account of the theory and construction of that curious machine which is according to some enthusiastic aeronauts to supplant the balloon altogether and enable us to accomplish that which has been one of the great aims and desires of mankind from the earliest ages namely the directing of our flight or steering a course not only through but if need were in opposition to the winds  monsieur nadar being perhaps the most zealous advocate of this machine we draw our information chiefly from his writings  of course the reader will understand that we do not support the views which we are about to set forth neither however do we treat them lightly because we have lived long enough to see proposals which not many years ago would have been deemed worthy of the most visionary of lunatics carried out to a successful issue and reduced to sober facts  when we hear of a flying machine which is to rise from the earth at the bidding of man and like the fabulous creations in the arabian nights entertainment dart through the air with passengers and luggage bound for definite localities turning hither and thither or alighting on the earth according to the will of a steersmanwe confess to a feeling which is apt to wrinkle our visage with the smile of incredulity but we sternly rebuke the smile for we know that similar smiles wreathed the faces of exceedingly wise people when in former days it was proposed to drive ships and coaches by steam and hold instantaneous converse with our friends across the atlantic by means of electricity  let us therefore gravely consider the aerial locomotive  monsieur nadar as the reader already knows scouts the idea of steering balloons  in reference to this he states with truth that a balloon which presents to the action of the atmosphere a volume of from 22000 to 42000 cubic feet of a gas from ten to fifteen times lighter than air is by its very nature smitten with incapacity to struggle against the slightest current no matter what may be the resisting motive force which may be imparted to it  both by its constitution and by the medium which drives it hither and thither at the pleasure of the winds it can never become a vessel  it is a buoy and remains a buoy  discarding therefore with contempt the balloon as an aerial locomotive he announces his belief that it is the screw which is destined to drive us or clamber with us into the blue vault above and convey us from place to place  and here it is right to assure the reader that the theoretical power of the screw to accomplish the end in view is not a disputable question  it has been practically proved by models and the only point that remains to be settled is the possibility of applying the power to machines large enough to carry human beings with a sufficient degree of safety to warrant risking the attempt  monsieur nadar sets out with a statement which he deems selfevident namely that in order to contend against the air we must be specifically heavier than the aira truth which was also we are told announced by the first napoleon in the epigrammatic sentence there can be no progress without resistance  from this the frenchman proceeds to prove that in order to command the air it is necessary to support onesself upon it instead of being at its mercy that we can only rest upon that which resists and that the air itself furnishes us amply with the needful resistanceit being the same atmosphere which overturns walls tears up by the root trees a century old and enables ships to ascend impetuous currents  glowing with the ardour of a man whose faith is refreshingly great he tells us that the time has at last come when the atmosphere must yield to man  it is for man he says to restrain and subdue this insolent and abnormal rebellion which has for so many years laughed at our vain efforts  we are in turn about to make it serve us as a slave just as the water on which we launch the ship as the solid earth on which we press the wheel  there is a toy called the spiralifer which is common enough in towns and which is doubtless known to almost every one  it consists of four flat fans attached to a spindle somewhat after the manner of the arms of a windmill  it is placed in a hollow tube and made to spin violently by pulling a string wound round the spindle  the result is that the spiralifer leaps out of the hollow tube and ascends powerfully as long as the violent spinning motion continues  if properly constructed this toy acts with great force and certainty and if the spinning motion could only be kept up by any means the ascent would be continued  the principal here involved is precisely the same as that which causes a windmill to turn a screwpropeller to drive a ship and a corkscrew to enter a cork  it is pressure against a resisting medium  air is the resisting medium in the case of the mill water and cork respectively in the other cases  the only difference between the windmill and the spiralifer is that the first is moved by the air pressing against it the other by itself in its rotatory action pressing against the air if you turn a bottle upside down and while in that position send a corkscrew up into the cork you set in motion the same force which is applied in the spiralifer  as the screw screws itself up into the cork so the spiralifer screws itself up into the air  of course the screw remains sticking there when the motive power ceases because of the density of the medium through which it moves while the spiralifer when at rest sinks because of the fluidity of the air but the principle of motion in each is the same  the screwpropeller of a ship is just a spiralifer placed horizontally acting on water instead of air and having a vessel placed in front of it  now monsieur nadars aerial locomotive is a huge spiralifer made strong enough to carry up a steamengine which shall keep it perpetually spinning and therefore perpetually ascending  perhaps we should have said that his locomotive is a huge machine to which several spiralifers are attached so that while one set raises or by reversing the engine depresses it other sets drive it sideways  the theory is perfect and the practice has been successfully attempted in models  messieurs ponton damecourt and de la laudelle we are toldthe one a man of the world and the other a man of lettersengaged the services of two skilled mechanics messieurs joseph of arras and j richard who constructed models of machines which ascended the atmosphere carrying their motive power springs along with them  besides horizontal screws it is proposed to furnish additional guiding power to the locomotive by means of inclined planes  these by being arranged in various positions while the machine is in motion would act on the air as do the wings of a bird and give it direction  no doubt despite the simplicity of all this difficulties will present themselves to most minds some of which may perhaps bulk very large in the minds of mechanicianssuch as the power of materials to withstand the violence of the forces to which they are to be applied etcetera we do not know however no difficulties seem to have afflicted monsieur nadar who thus grandly waives them all aside and revels in the contemplation of the triumphant flights that lie before him in the future  it will be understood he writes that it belongs not to us to determine at present either the mechanism or the necessary manoeuvres neither shall we attempt to fix even approximately the future velocity of the aerial locomotive  let us rather attempt to calculate the probable velocity of a locomotive gliding through the air without the possibility of running off the rails without any oscillation without the least obstacle  let us fancy such locomotive encountering on its way in the midst one of those atmospheric currents which travel at the rate of forty leagues an hour and following that current add together these formidable data and your imagination will recoil in adding still further to these giddy velocities that of a machine falling through an angle of descent of from 12000 to 15000 feet in a series of gigantic zigzags and making the tour of the globe in a succession of fantastic leaps  truly monsieur nadar seems to us to be right  there are few men or women we suspect who would not recoil from such fantastic leaps and unless the prospect of a more sedate style of travelling be held out it is not probable that aerial locomotives will receive much patronage from the general public  lord carlingford who mistook the sentiments of monsieur nadar in regard to the aerial locomotive claimed for himself in 1863 the honour of having previously invented and successfully launched an aerial chariot weighing seventeen stone which rose on the air without any assistance but that of the wind and having arrived at a horizontal position on the air it remained stationary there until pulled down  monsieur nadar at the conclusion of a courteous letter in reply to this claim gives his intentions and opinions on the subject pretty clearly as follows  in fine and that there may be no possible mistake on the part of any one regarding what i am attempting i desire to find the necessary resources for the constitution of a society which shall be the centre of all hitherto isolated and therefore lost attempts to solve a question so profound so vast so complex that it does not seem to belong to a single individual to achieve it  i have my system which i believe to be good since it is mine but i shall aid with all the strength of my will and with all the energy of my perseverance every system which shall be proved to be better than mine  the question to me is not at all who may have determined the great problem it is that the solution may be found at last  the fruit is ripe i long to see it plucked no matter by whom and this is the sole cause of the agitation which i have endeavoured to call forth and which i am now pursuing  a man who takes up a subject with such hearty enthusiasm and in such a liberal spirit is we hold entitled to the utmost respect  as we have however done our best to lay his case before the public we feel entitled to express with all humility some of the doubts which have been suggested to our own mind while meditating on the subject  no doubt the theory propounded is correct and as carried into practice with models the aerial locomotive has been a great success  no doubt also it is pleasant to contemplate the possibility of traversing space like a bird a meteor or a comet and the absolute impossibility of getting off the rails but what we would ask would be the result of a hitchever so smallin the working of the steamengine or of the spring motor  if a railway engine breaks down there are all sorts of chances of escape open to the traveller  the engine may not quit the rails or it may bound off alone snap the coupling chains and leave the carriages to run until they come to a gradual standstill or the concussion may be so modified that no serious injury may result or should it come to the worst the traveller may be among the fortunate number who make miraculous escapes  but if a crank of an aerial machine should snap while it is careering through space or even a screw get loose and cause a momentary stoppage of the motor it is abundantly evident that escape from total and swift destruction would be miraculous indeed for the whole affair would come to the ground like a thunderbolt and leave not a wrack behind  probably it might be answered in reply that a parachute attached to the machine or the inclined planes acting as a parachute would moderate the descent  well there may be something in that nevertheless parachutes have not yet proved themselves to be very trustworthyand we are constrained to reiterate the fact that while an accident causing the breakdown of the motive power of a steamboat or a railway carriage does not necessarily involve fatal consequences an accident which should stop the motive power in an aerial locomotive would almost to a certainty result in a grand smash which would involve machine and passengers in one inconceivable whirl of chaotic destruction  whether this machine shall ever be successfully completed or not it is evident that it still engages the earnest attention of men as we gather from the following paragraph recently published in the san francisco bulletin  at a meeting of the aerial navigation company held on friday july 24 1869 in san francisco it was voted to raise the necessary funds to construct an improved avitor of large size  the opinion of the engineers of the company was unanimous as to success so far and the feasibility and success of the projected flyingship  it will be about 150 feet in length 20 to 40 feet diameter of the gasometer with propelling blades on each side of the centre describing a radius of about 16 feet  the propellers are shaped like a steamships with two blades each very light  they will be driven by a steamengine of fivehorse power weighing with boiler connections and water 430 pounds weight  the planes on each side for floating the machine will be about twenty feet wide at the centre of the machine and made in sections so that they can be depressed or elevated at pleasure with the rudder or tail  the gasometer will be made in sections so that in the event of accident to one section the remainder will be sufficient for all practical purposes indeed it is claimed that the ship can fly through the air with such speed that the sustaining power of the planes alone will be sufficient to maintain the avitor in midair  the gasometer will be made probably of thin muslin or silk saturated with guttapercha  it is to carry four persons and will be ready for trial in sixty or ninety days  the result of this experiment will be looked for with great interest all over the country  the americans with that vigour of conception and promptitude in action for which they are celebrated have done a good deal in the cause of aerostation but as their doings and experiences have been in many respects similar to those men whose voyages have been already recounted or touched upon it would involve too much repetition to detail them here  some of their attempts however have outshone those of the men of the eastern hemisphere  for instance mr j wise a noted aeronaut has several times exploded his balloons while in the air to show that the fragments with network form a sort of parachute which moderates the descent  he also with mr la mountain and others accomplished in 1859 the longest flight on record namely 1150 miles in less than twenty hours and the latter gentleman did 300 miles in four hours in the same year  another american mr lowe made an enormous balloon with which he resolved to cross the atlantic in about 48 hours  we await the accomplishment of this feat with much solicitude  in conclusion we may say that the subject of aerostation is still in its infancy and that we have still to learn how to conduct ourselves properly whenup in the clouds  the end
