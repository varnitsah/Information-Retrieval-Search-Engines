77356101	sartor resartus  the life and opinions of herr teufelsdrockh  by thomas carlyle  1831     book i    chapter i preliminary  considering our present advanced state of culture and how the torch of science has now been brandished and borne about with more or less effect for five thousand years and upwards how in these times especially not only the torch still burns and perhaps more fiercely than ever but innumerable rushlights and sulphurmatches kindled thereat are also glancing in every direction so that not the smallest cranny or doghole in nature or art can remain unilluminatedit might strike the reflective mind with some surprise that hitherto little or nothing of a fundamental character whether in the way of philosophy or history has been written on the subject of clothes  our theory of gravitation is as good as perfect lagrange it is well known has proved that the planetary system on this scheme will endure forever laplace still more cunningly even guesses that it could not have been made on any other scheme whereby at least our nautical logbooks can be better kept and watertransport of all kinds has grown more commodious of geology and geognosy we know enough what with the labors of our werners and huttons what with the ardent genius of their disciples it has come about that now to many a royal society the creation of a world is little more mysterious than the cooking of a dumpling concerning which last indeed there have been minds to whom the question how the apples were got in presented difficulties why mention our disquisitions on the social contract on the standard of taste on the migrations of the herring then have we not a doctrine of rent a theory of value philosophies of language of history of pottery of apparitions of intoxicating liquors mans whole life and environment have been laid open and elucidated scarcely a fragment or fibre of his soul body and possessions but has been probed dissected distilled desiccated and scientifically decomposed our spiritual faculties of which it appears there are not a few have their stewarts cousins royer collards every cellular vascular muscular tissue glories in its lawrences majendies bichats  how then comes it may the reflective mind repeat that the grand tissue of all tissues the only real tissue should have been quite overlooked by sciencethe vestural tissue namely of woollen or other cloth which mans soul wears as its outmost wrappage and overall wherein his whole other tissues are included and screened his whole faculties work his whole self lives moves and has its being for if now and then some straggling brokenwinged thinker has cast an owls glance into this obscure region the most have soared over it altogether heedless regarding clothes as a property not an accident as quite natural and spontaneous like the leaves of trees like the plumage of birds in all speculations they have tacitly figured man as a clothed animal whereas he is by nature a naked animal and only in certain circumstances by purpose and device masks himself in clothes shakespeare says we are creatures that look before and after the more surprising that we do not look round a little and see what is passing under our very eyes  but here as in so many other cases germany learned indefatigable deepthinking germany comes to our aid it is after all a blessing that in these revolutionary times there should be one country where abstract thought can still take shelter that while the din and frenzy of catholic emancipations and rotten boroughs and revolts of paris deafen every french and every english ear the german can stand peaceful on his scientific watchtower and to the raging struggling multitude here and elsewhere solemnly from hour to hour with preparatory blast of cowhorn emit his horet ihr herren und lassets euch sagen in other words tell the universe which so often forgets that fact what oclock it really is not unfrequently the germans have been blamed for an unprofitable diligence as if they struck into devious courses where nothing was to be had but the toil of a rough journey as if forsaking the goldmines of finance and that political slaughter of fat oxen whereby a man himself grows fat they were apt to run goosehunting into regions of bilberries and crowberries and be swallowed up at last in remote peatbogs of that unwise science which as our humorist expresses it                     by geometric scale      doth take the size of pots of ale  still more of that altogether misdirected industry which is seen vigorously thrashing mere straw there can nothing defensive be said in so far as the germans are chargeable with such let them take the consequence nevertheless be it remarked that even a russian steppe has tumult and gold ornaments also many a scene that looks desert and rockbound from the distance will unfold itself when visited into rare valleys nay in any case would criticism erect not only fingerposts and turnpikes but spiked gates and impassable barriers for the mind of man it is written many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased surely the plain rule is let each considerate person have his way and see what it will lead to for not this man and that man but all men make up mankind and their united tasks the task of mankind how often have we seen some such adventurous and perhaps muchcensured wanderer light on some outlying neglected yet vitally momentous province the hidden treasures of which he first discovered and kept proclaiming till the general eye and effort were directed thither and the conquest was completedthereby in these his seemingly so aimless rambles planting new standards founding new habitable colonies in the immeasurable circumambient realm of nothingness and night wise man was he who counselled that speculation should have free course and look fearlessly towards all the thirtytwo points of the compass whithersoever and howsoever it listed   perhaps it is proof of the stunted condition in which pure science especially pure moral science languishes among us english and how our mercantile greatness and invaluable constitution impressing a political or other immediately practical tendency on all english culture and endeavor cramps the free flight of thoughtthat this not philosophy of clothes but recognition even that we have no such philosophy stands here for the first time published in our language what english intellect could have chosen such a topic or by chance stumbled on it but for that same unshackled and even sequestered condition of the german learned which permits and induces them to fish in all manner of waters with all manner of nets it seems probable enough this abtruse inquiry might in spite of the results it leads to have continued dormant for indefinite periods the editor of these sheets though otherwise boasting himself a man of confirmed speculative habits and perhaps discursive enough is free to confess that never till these last months did the above very plain considerations on our total want of a philosophy of clothes occur to him and then by quite foreign suggestion by the arrival namely of a new book from professor teufelsdrockh of weissnichtwo treating expressly of this subject and in a style which whether understood or not could not even by the blindest be overlooked in the present editors way of thought this remarkable treatise with its doctrines whether as judicially acceded to or judicially denied has not remained without effect  die kleider ihr werden und wirken clothes their origin and influence von diog teufelsdrockh j u d etc stillschweigen und cognie weissnichtwo 1831  here says the weissnichtwosche anzeiger comes a volume of that extensive closeprinted closemeditated sort which be it spoken with pride is seen only in germany perhaps only in weissnichtwo issuing from the hitherto irreproachable firm of stillschweigen and company with every external furtherance it is of such internal quality as to set neglect at defiance a work concludes the wellnigh enthusiastic reviewer interesting alike to the antiquary the historian and the philosophic thinker a masterpiece of boldness lynxeyed acuteness and rugged independent germanism and philanthropy derber kerndeutschheit und menschenliebe which will not assuredly pass current without opposition in high places but must and will exalt the almost new name of teufelsdrockh to the first ranks of philosophy in our german temple of honor  mindful of old friendship the distinguished professor in this the first blaze of his fame which however does not dazzle him sends hither a presentationcopy of his book with compliments and encomiums which modesty forbids the present editor to rehearse yet without indicated wish or hope of any kind except what may be implied in the concluding phrase mochte es this remarkable treatise auch im brittischen boden gedeihen    chapter ii editorial difficulties  if for a speculative man whose seedfield in the sublime words of the poet is time no conquest is important but that of new ideas then might the arrival of professor teufelsdrockhs book be marked with chalk in the editors calendar it is indeed an extensive volume of boundless almost formless contents a very sea of thought neither calm nor clear if you will yet wherein the toughest pearldiver may dive to his utmost depth and return not only with seawreck but with true orients  directly on the first perusal almost on the first deliberate inspection it became apparent that here a quite new branch of philosophy leading to as yet undescried ulterior results was disclosed farther what seemed scarcely less interesting a quite new human individuality an almost unexampled personal character that namely of professor teufelsdrockh the discloser of both which novelties as far as might be possible we resolved to master the significance but as man is emphatically a proselytizing creature no sooner was such mastery even fairly attempted than the new question arose how might this acquired good be imparted to others perhaps in equal need thereof how could the philosophy of clothes and the author of such philosophy be brought home in any measure to the business and bosoms of our own english nation for if newgot gold is said to burn the pockets till it be cast forth into circulation much more may new truth  here however difficulties occurred the first thought naturally was to publish article after article on this remarkable volume in such widely circulating critical journals as the editor might stand connected with or by money or love procure access to but on the other hand was it not clear that such matter as must here be revealed and treated of might endanger the circulation of any journal extant if indeed all partydivisions in the state could have been abolished whig tory and radical embracing in discrepant union and all the journals of the nation could have been jumbled into one journal and the philosophy of clothes poured forth in incessant torrents therefrom the attempt had seemed possible but alas what vehicle of that sort have we except frasers magazine a vehicle all strewed figuratively speaking with the maddest waterloocrackers exploding distractively and destructively wheresoever the mystified passenger stands or sits nay in any case understood to be of late years a vehicle full to overflowing and inexorably shut besides to state the philosophy of clothes without the philosopher the ideas of teufelsdrockh without something of his personality was it not to insure both of entire misapprehension now for biography had it been otherwise admissible there were no adequate documents no hope of obtaining such but rather owing to circumstances a special despair thus did the editor see himself for the while shut out from all public utterance of these extraordinary doctrines and constrained to revolve them not without disquietude in the dark depths of his own mind  so had it lasted for some months and now the volume on clothes read and again read was in several points becoming lucid and lucent the personality of its author more and more surprising but in spite of all that memory and conjecture could do more and more enigmatic whereby the old disquietude seemed fast settling into fixed discontentwhen altogether unexpectedly arrives a letter from herr hofrath heuschrecke our professors chief friend and associate in weissnichtwo with whom we had not previously corresponded the hofrath after much quite extraneous matter began dilating largely on the agitation and attention which the philosophy of clothes was exciting in its own german republic of letters on the deep significance and tendency of his friends volume and then at length with great circumlocution hinted at the practicability of conveying some knowledge of it and of him to england and through england to the distant west a work on professor teufelsdrockh were undoubtedly welcome to the family the national or any other of those patriotic libraries at present the glory of british literature might work revolutions in thought and so forthin conclusion intimating not obscurely that should the present editor feel disposed to undertake a biography of teufelsdrockh he hofrath heuschrecke had it in his power to furnish the requisite documents  as in some chemical mixture that has stood long evaporating but would not crystallize instantly when the wire or other fixed substance is introduced crystallization commences and rapidly proceeds till the whole is finished so was it with the editors mind and this offer of heuschreckes form rose out of void solution and discontinuity like united itself with like in definite arrangement and soon either in actual vision and possession or in fixed reasonable hope the image of the whole enterprise had shaped itself so to speak into a solid mass cautiously yet courageously through the twopenny post application to the famed redoubtable oliver yorke was now made an interview interviews with that singular man have taken place with more of assurance on our side with less of satire at least of open satire on his than we anticipated for the rest with such issue as is now visible as to those same patriotic libraries the hofraths counsel could only be viewed with silent amazement but with his offer of documents we joyfully and almost instantaneously closed thus too in the sure expectation of these we already see our task begun and this our sartor resartus which is properly a life and opinions of herr teufelsdrockh hourly advancing   of our fitness for the enterprise to which we have such title and vocation it were perhaps uninteresting to say more let the british reader study and enjoy in simplicity of heart what is here presented him and with whatever metaphysical acumen and talent for meditation he is possessed of let him strive to keep a free open sense cleared from the mists of prejudice above all from the paralysis of cant and directed rather to the book itself than to the editor of the book who or what such editor may be must remain conjectural and even insignificant  it is a voice publishing tidings of the philosophy of clothes undoubtedly a spirit addressing spirits whoso hath ears let him hear        with us even he still communicates in some sort of mask      or muffler and we have reason to think under a feigned      nameo y  on one other point the editor thinks it needful to give warning namely that he is animated with a true though perhaps a feeble attachment to the institutions of our ancestors and minded to defend these according to ability at all hazards nay it was partly with a view to such defence that he engaged in this undertaking to stem or if that be impossible profitably to divert the current of innovation such a volume as teufelsdrockhs if cunningly planted down were no despicable pile or floodgate in the logical wear  for the rest be it nowise apprehended that any personal connection of ours with teufelsdrockh heuschrecke or this philosophy of clothes can pervert our judgment or sway us to extenuate or exaggerate powerless we venture to promise are those private compliments themselves grateful they may well be as generous illusions of friendship as fair mementos of bygone unions of those nights and suppers of the gods when lapped in the symphonies and harmonies of philosophic eloquence though with baser accompaniments the present editor revelled in that feast of reason never since vouchsafed him in so full measure but what then amicus plato magis amica veritas teufelsdrockh is our friend truth is our divinity in our historical and critical capacity we hope we are strangers to all the world have feud or favor with no onesave indeed the devil with whom as with the prince of lies and darkness we do at all times wage internecine war this assurance at an epoch when puffery and quackery have reached a height unexampled in the annals of mankind and even english editors like chinese shopkeepers must write on their doorlintels no cheating herewe thought it good to premise    chapter iii reminiscences  to the authors private circle the appearance of this singular work on clothes must have occasioned little less surprise than it has to the rest of the world for ourselves at least few things have been more unexpected professor teufelsdrockh at the period of our acquaintance with him seemed to lead a quite still and selfcontained life a man devoted to the higher philosophies indeed yet more likely if he published at all to publish a refutation of hegel and bardili both of whom strangely enough he included under a common ban than to descend as he has here done into the angry noisy forum with an argument that cannot but exasperate and divide not that we can remember was the philosophy of clothes once touched upon between us if through the high silent meditative transcendentalism of our friend we detected any practical tendency whatever it was at most political and towards a certain prospective and for the present quite speculative radicalism as indeed some correspondence on his part with herr oken of jena was now and then suspected though his special contributions to the isis could never be more than surmised at but at all events nothing moral still less anything didacticoreligious was looked for from him  well do we recollect the last words he spoke in our hearing which indeed with the night they were uttered in are to be forever remembered lifting his huge tumbler of gukguk  and for a moment lowering his tobaccopipe he stood up in full coffeehouse it was zur grunen gans the largest in weissnichtwo where all the virtuosity and nearly all the intellect of the place assembled of an evening and there with low soulstirring tone and the look truly of an angel though whether of a white or of a black one might be dubious proposed this toast die sache der armen in gottes und teufels namen the cause of the poor in heavens name ands one full shout breaking the leaden silence then a gurgle of innumerable emptying bumpers again followed by universal cheering returned him loud acclaim it was the finale of the night resuming their pipes in the highest enthusiasm amid volumes of tobaccosmoke triumphant cloudcapt without and within the assembly broke up each to his thoughtful pillow bleibt doch ein echter spass und galgenvogel said several meaning thereby that one day he would probably be hanged for his democratic sentiments wo steckt doch der schalk added they looking round but teufelsdrockh had retired by private alleys and the compiler of these pages beheld him no more        gukguk is unhappily only an academicalbeer  in such scenes has it been our lot to live with this philosopher such estimate to form of his purposes and powers and yet thou brave teufelsdrockh who could tell what lurked in thee under those thick locks of thine so long and lank overlapping roofwise the gravest face we ever in this world saw there dwelt a most busy brain in thy eyes too deep under their shaggy brows and looking out so still and dreamy have we not noticed gleams of an ethereal or else a diabolic fire and half fancied that their stillness was but the rest of infinite motion the sleep of a spinningtop thy little figure there as in loose illbrushed threadbare habiliments thou sattest amid litter and lumber whole days to think and smoke tobacco held in it a mighty heart the secrets of mans life were laid open to thee thou sawest into the mystery of the universe farther than another thou hadst in petto thy remarkable volume on clothes nay was there not in that clear logically founded transcendentalism of thine still more in thy meek silent deepseated sansculottism combined with a true princely courtesy of inward nature the visible rudiments of such speculation but great men are too often unknown or what is worse misknown already when we dreamed not of it the warp of thy remarkable volume lay on the loom and silently mysterious shuttles were putting in the woof   how the hofrath heuschrecke is to furnish biographical data in this case may be a curious question the answer of which however is happily not our concern but his to us it appeared after repeated trial that in weissnichtwo from the archives or memories of the bestinformed classes no biography of teufelsdrockh was to be gathered not so much as a false one he was a stranger there wafted thither by what is called the course of circumstances concerning whose parentage birthplace prospects or pursuits curiosity had indeed made inquiries but satisfied herself with the most indistinct replies for himself he was a man so still and altogether unparticipating that to question him even afar off on such particulars was a thing of more than usual delicacy besides in his sly way he had ever some quaint turn not without its satirical edge wherewith to divert such intrusions and deter you from the like wits spoke of him secretly as if he were a kind of melchizedek without father or mother of any kind sometimes with reference to his great historic and statistic knowledge and the vivid way he had of expressing himself like an eyewitness of distant transactions and scenes they called him the ewige jude everlasting or as we say wandering jew  to the most indeed he had become not so much a man as a thing which thing doubtless they were accustomed to see and with satisfaction but no more thought of accounting for than for the fabrication of their daily allgemeine zeitung or the domestic habits of the sun both were there and welcome the world enjoyed what good was in them and thought no more of the matter the man teufelsdrockh passed and repassed in his little circle as one of those originals and nondescripts more frequent in german universities than elsewhere of whom though you see them alive and feel certain enough that they must have a history no history seems to be discoverable or only such as men give of mountain rocks and antediluvian ruins that they have been created by unknown agencies are in a state of gradual decay and for the present reflect light and resist pressure that is are visible and tangible objects in this phantasm world where so much other mystery is  it was to be remarked that though by title and diploma professor der allerleywissenschaft or as we should say in english professor of things in general he had never delivered any course perhaps never been incited thereto by any public furtherance or requisition to all appearance the enlightened government of weissnichtwo in founding their new university imagined they had done enough if in times like ours as the halfofficial program expressed it when all things are rapidly or slowly resolving themselves into chaos a professorship of this kind had been established whereby as occasion called the task of bodying somewhat forth again from such chaos might be even slightly facilitated that actual lectures should be held and public classes for the science of things in general they doubtless considered premature on which ground too they had only established the professorship nowise endowed it so that teufelsdrockh recommended by the highest names had been promoted thereby to a name merely  great among the more enlightened classes was the admiration of this new professorship how an enlightened government had seen into the want of the age zeitbedurfniss how at length instead of denial and destruction we were to have a science of affirmation and reconstruction and germany and weissnichtwo were where they should be in the vanguard of the world considerable also was the wonder at the new professor dropt opportunely enough into the nascent university so able to lecture should occasion call so ready to hold his peace for indefinite periods should an enlightened government consider that occasion did not call but such admiration and such wonder being followed by no act to keep them living could last only nine days and long before our visit to that scene had quite died away the more cunning heads thought it was all an expiring clutch at popularity on the part of a minister whom domestic embarrassments court intrigues old age and dropsy soon afterwards finally drove from the helm  as for teufelsdrockh except by his nightly appearances at the grune gans weissnichtwo saw little of him felt little of him here over his tumbler of gukguk he sat reading journals sometimes contemplatively looking into the clouds of his tobaccopipe without other visible employment always from his mild ways an agreeable phenomenon there more especially when he opened his lips for speech on which occasions the whole coffeehouse would hush itself into silence as if sure to hear something noteworthy nay perhaps to hear a whole series and river of the most memorable utterances such as when once thawed he would for hours indulge in with fit audience and the more memorable as issuing from a head apparently not more interested in them not more conscious of them than is the sculptured stone head of some public fountain which through its brass mouthtube emits water to the worthy and the unworthy careless whether it be for cooking victuals or quenching conflagrations indeed maintains the same earnest assiduous look whether any water be flowing or not  to the editor of these sheets as to a young enthusiastic englishman however unworthy teufelsdrockh opened himself perhaps more than to the most pity only that we could not then half guess his importance and scrutinize him with due power of vision we enjoyed what not three men weissnichtwo could boast of a certain degree of access to the professors private domicile it was the attic floor of the highest house in the wahngasse and might truly be called the pinnacle of weissnichtwo for it rose sheer up above the contiguous roofs themselves rising from elevated ground moreover with its windows it looked towards all the four orte or as the scotch say and we ought to say airts the sitting room itself commanded three another came to view in the schlafgemach bedroom at the opposite end to say nothing of the kitchen which offered two as it were duplicates showing nothing new so that it was in fact the speculum or watchtower of teufelsdrockh wherefrom sitting at ease he might see the whole lifecirculation of that considerable city the streets and lanes of which with all their doing and driving thun und treiben were for the most part visible there  i look down into all that waspnest or beehive we have heard him say and witness their waxlaying and honeymaking and poisonbrewing and choking by sulphur from the palace esplanade where music plays while serene highness is pleased to eat his victuals down to the low lane where in her doorsill the aged widow knitting for a thin livelihood sits to feel the afternoon sun i see it all for except schlosskirche weathercock no biped stands so high couriers arrive bestrapped and bebooted bearing joy and sorrow bagged up in pouches of leather there topladen and with four swift horses rolls in the country baron and his household here on timberleg the lamed soldier hops painfully along begging alms a thousand carriages and wains cars come tumbling in with food with young rusticity and other raw produce inanimate or animate and go tumbling out again with produce manufactured that living flood pouring through these streets of all qualities and ages knowest thou whence it is coming whither it is going aus der ewigkeit zu der ewigkeit hin from eternity onwards to eternity these are apparitions what else are they not souls rendered visible in bodies that took shape and will lose it melting into air their solid pavement is a picture of the sense they walk on the bosom of nothing blank time is behind them and before them or fanciest thou the red and yellow clothesscreen yonder with spurs on its heels and feather in its crown is but of today without a yesterday or a tomorrow and had not rather its ancestor alive when hengst and horsa overran thy island friend thou seest here a living link in that tissue of history which inweaves all being watch well or it will be past thee and seen no more  ach mein lieber said he once at midnight when we had returned from the coffeehouse in rather earnest talk it is a true sublimity to dwell here these fringes of lamplight struggling up through smoke and thousandfold exhalation some fathoms into the ancient reign of night what thinks bootes of them as he leads his huntingdogs over the zenith in their leash of sidereal fire that stifled hum of midnight when traffic has lain down to rest and the chariotwheels of vanity still rolling here and there through distant streets are bearing her to halls roofed in and lighted to the due pitch for her and only vice and misery to prowl or to moan like nightbirds are abroad that hum i say like the stertorous unquiet slumber of sick life is heard in heaven oh under that hideous coverlet of vapors and putrefactions and unimaginable gases what a fermentingvat lies simmering and hid the joyful and the sorrowful are there men are dying there men are being born men are prayingon the other side of a brick partition men are cursing and around them all is the vast void night the proud grandee still lingers in his perfumed saloons or reposes within damask curtains wretchedness cowers into bucklebeds or shivers hungerstricken into its lair of straw in obscure cellars rougeetnoir languidly emits its voiceofdestiny to haggard hungry villains while councillors of state sit plotting and playing their high chessgame whereof the pawns are men the lover whispers his mistress that the coach is ready and she full of hope and fear glides down to fly with him over the borders the thief still more silently sets to his picklocks and crowbars or lurks in wait till the watchmen first snore in their boxes gay mansions with supperrooms and dancingrooms are full of light and music and highswelling hearts but in the condemned cells the pulse of life beats tremulous and faint and bloodshot eyes look out through the darkness which is around and within for the light of a stern last morning six men are to be hanged on the morrow comes no hammering from the rabensteintheir gallows must even now be o building upwards of five hundred thousand twolegged animals without feathers lie round us in horizontal position their heads all in nightcaps and full of the foolishest dreams riot cries aloud and staggers and swaggers in his rank dens of shame and the mother with streaming hair kneels over her pallid dying infant whose cracked lips only her tears now moistenall these heaped and huddled together with nothing but a little carpentry and masonry between themcrammed in like salted fish in their barrelor weltering shall i say like an egyptian pitcher of tamed vipers each struggling to get its head above the others such work goes on under that smokecounterpanebut i mein werther sit above it all i am alone with the stars  we looked in his face to see whether in the utterance of such extraordinary nightthoughts no feeling might be traced there but with the light we had which indeed was only a single tallowlight and far enough from the window nothing save that old calmness and fixedness was visible  these were the professors talking seasons most commonly he spoke in mere monosyllables or sat altogether silent and smoked while the visitor had liberty either to say what he listed receiving for answer an occasional grunt or to look round for a space and then take himself away it was a strange apartment full of books and tattered papers and miscellaneous shreds of all conceivable substances united in a common element of dust books lay on tables and below tables here fluttered a sheet of manuscript there a torn handkerchief or nightcap hastily thrown aside inkbottles alternated with breadcrusts coffeepots tobaccoboxes periodical literature and blucher boots old lieschen lisekin liza who was his bedmaker and stovelighter his washer and wringer cook errandmaid and general lionsprovider and for the rest a very orderly creature had no sovereign authority in this last citadel of teufelsdrockh only some once in the month she halfforcibly made her way thither with broom and duster and teufelsdrockh hastily saving his manuscripts effected a partial clearance a jaildelivery of such lumber as was not literary these were her erdbeben earthquakes which teufelsdrockh dreaded worse than the pestilence nevertheless to such length he had been forced to comply glad would he have been to sit here philosophizing forever or till the litter by accumulation drove him out of doors but lieschen was his rightarm and spoon and necessary of life and would not be flatly gainsayed we can still remember the ancient woman so silent that some thought her dumb deaf also you would often have supposed her for teufelsdrockh and teufelsdrockh only would she serve or give heed to and with him she seemed to communicate chiefly by signs if it were not rather by some secret divination that she guessed all his wants and supplied them assiduous old dame she scoured and sorted and swept in her kitchen with the least possible violence to the ear yet all was tight and right there hot and black came the coffee ever at the due moment and the speechless lieschen herself looked out on you from under her clean white coif with its lappets through her clean withered face and wrinkles with a look of helpful intelligence almost of benevolence  few strangers as above hinted had admittance hither the only one we ever saw there ourselves excepted was the hofrath heuschrecke already known by name and expectation to the readers of these pages to us at that period herr heuschrecke seemed one of those pursemouthed cranenecked cleanbrushed pacific individuals perhaps sufficiently distinguished in society by this fact that in dry weather or in wet they never appear without their umbrella had we not known with what little wisdom the world is governed and how in germany as elsewhere the ninetyandnine public men can for most part be but mute trainbearers to the hundredth perhaps but stalkinghorses and willing or unwilling dupesit might have seemed wonderful how herr heuschrecke should be named a rath or councillor and counsellor even in weissnichtwo what counsel to any man or to any woman could this particular hofrath give in whose loose zigzag figure in whose thin visage as it went jerking to and fro in minute incessant fluctuationyou traced rather confusion worse confounded at most timidity and physical cold some indeed said withal he was the very spirit of love embodied blue earnest eyes full of sadness and kindness purse ever open and so forth the whole of which we shall now hope for many reasons was not quite groundless nevertheless friend teufelsdrockhs outline who indeed handled the burin like few in these cases was probably the best er hat gemuth und geist hat wenigstens gehabt doch ohne organ ohne schicksalsgunst ist gegenwartig aber halbzerruttet halberstarrt he has heart and talent at least has had such yet without fit mode of utterance or favor of fortune and so is now halfcracked halfcongealedwhat the hofrath shall think of this when he sees it readers may wonder we safe in the stronghold of historical fidelity are careless  the main point doubtless for us all is his love of teufelsdrockh which indeed was also by far the most decisive feature of heuschrecke himself we are enabled to assert that he hung on the professor with the fondness of a boswell for his johnson and perhaps with the like return for teufelsdrockh treated his gaunt admirer with little outward regard as some halfrational or altogether irrational friend and at best loved him out of gratitude and by habit on the other hand it was curious to observe with what reverent kindness and a sort of fatherly protection our hofrath being the elder richer and as he fondly imagined far more practically influential of the two looked and tended on his little sage whom he seemed to consider as a living oracle let but teufelsdrockh open his mouth heuschreckes also unpuckered itself into a free doorway besides his being all eye and all ear so that nothing might be lost and then at every pause in the harangue he gurgled out his pursy chuckle of a coughlaugh for the machinery of laughter took some time to get in motion and seemed crank and slack or else his twanging nasal bravo das glaub ich in either case by way of heartiest approval in short if teufelsdrockh was dalailama of which except perhaps in his selfseclusion and godlike indifference there was no symptom then might heuschrecke pass for his chief talapoin to whom no doughpill he could knead and publish was other than medicinal and sacred  in such environment social domestic physical did teufelsdrockh at the time of our acquaintance and most likely does he still live and meditate here perched up in his high wahngasse watchtower and often in solitude outwatching the bear it was that the indomitable inquirer fought all his battles with dulness and darkness here in all probability that he wrote this surprising volume on clothes additional particulars of his age which was of that standing middle sort you could only guess at of his wide surtout the color of his trousers fashion of his broadbrimmed steeplehat and so forth we might report but do not the wisest truly is in these times the greatest so that an enlightened curiosity leaving kings and such like to rest very much on their own basis turns more and more to the philosophic class nevertheless what reader expects that with all our writing and reporting teufelsdrockh could be brought home to him till once the documents arrive his life fortunes and bodily presence are as yet hidden from us or matter only of faint conjecture but on the other hand does not his soul lie enclosed in this remarkable volume much more truly than pedro garcias did in the buried bag of doubloons to the soul of diogenes teufelsdrockh to his opinions namely on the origin and influence of clothes we for the present gladly return    chapter iv characteristics  it were a piece of vain flattery to pretend that this work on clothes entirely contents us that it is not like all works of genius like the very sun which though the highest published creation or work of genius has nevertheless black spots and troubled nebulosities amid its effulgencea mixture of insight inspiration with dulness doublevision and even utter blindness  without committing ourselves to those enthusiastic praises and prophesyings of the weissnichtwosche anzeiger we admitted that the book had in a high degree excited us to selfactivity which is the best effect of any book that it had even operated changes in our way of thought nay that it promised to prove as it were the opening of a new mineshaft wherein the whole world of speculation might henceforth dig to unknown depths more specially may it now be declared that professor teufelsdrockhs acquirements patience of research philosophic and even poetic vigor are here made indisputably manifest and unhappily no less his prolixity and tortuosity and manifold ineptitude that on the whole as in opening new mineshafts is not unreasonable there is much rubbish in his book though likewise specimens of almost invaluable ore a paramount popularity in england we cannot promise him apart from the choice of such a topic as clothes too often the manner of treating it betokens in the author a rusticity and academic seclusion unblamable indeed inevitable in a german but fatal to his success with our public  of good society teufelsdrockh appears to have seen little or has mostly forgotten what he saw he speaks out with a strange plainness calls many things by their mere dictionary names to him the upholsterer is no pontiff neither is any drawingroom a temple were it never so begilt and overhung a whole immensity of brussels carpets and pierglasses and ormolu as he himself expresses it cannot hide from me that such drawingroom is simply a section of infinite space where so many godcreated souls do for the time meet together to teufelsdrockh the highest duchess is respectable is venerable but nowise for her pearl bracelets and malines laces in his eyes the star of a lord is little less and little more than the broad button of birmingham spelter in a clowns smock each is an implement he says in its kind a tag for hookingtogether and for the rest was dug from the earth and hammered on a stithy before smiths fingers thus does the professor look in mens faces with a strange impartiality a strange scientific freedom like a man unversed in the higher circles like a man dropped thither from the moon rightly considered it is in this peculiarity running through his whole system of thought that all these shortcomings overshootings and multiform perversities take rise if indeed they have not a second source also natural enough in his transcendental philosophies and humor of looking at all matter and material things as spirit whereby truly his case were but the more hopeless the more lamentable  to the thinkers of this nation however of which class it is firmly believed there are individuals yet extant we can safely recommend the work nay who knows but among the fashionable ranks too if it be true as teufelsdrockh maintains that within the most starched cravat there passes a windpipe and weasand and under the thickliest embroidered waistcoat beats a heartthe force of that rapt earnestness may be felt and here and there an arrow of the soul pierce through in our wild seer shaggy unkempt like a baptist living on locusts and wild honey there is an untutored energy a silent as it were unconscious strength which except in the higher walks of literature must be rare many a deep glance and often with unspeakable precision has he cast into mysterious nature and the still more mysterious life of man wonderful it is with what cutting words now and then he severs asunder the confusion sheers down were it furlongs deep into the true centre of the matter and there not only hits the nail on the head but with crushing force smites it home and buries iton the other hand let us be free to admit he is the most unequal writer breathing often after some such feat he will play truant for long pages and go dawdling and dreaming and mumbling and maundering the merest commonplaces as if he were asleep with eyes open which indeed he is  of his boundless learning and how all reading and literature in most known tongues from sanchoniathon to dr lingard from your oriental shasters and talmuds and korans with cassinis siamese fables and laplaces mecanique celeste down to robinson crusoe and the belfast town and country almanack are familiar to himwe shall say nothing for unexampled as it is with us to the germans such universality of study passes without wonder as a thing commendable indeed but natural indispensable and there of course a man that devotes his life to learning shall he not be learned  in respect of style our author manifests the same genial capability marred too often by the same rudeness inequality and apparent want of intercourse with the higher classes occasionally as above hinted we find consummate vigor a true inspiration his burning thoughts step forth in fit burning words like so many fullformed minervas issuing amid flame and splendor from joves head a rich idiomatic diction picturesque allusions fiery poetic emphasis or quaint tricksy turns all the graces and terrors of a wild imagination wedded to the clearest intellect alternate in beautiful vicissitude were it not that sheer sleeping and soporific passages circumlocutions repetitions touches even of pure doting jargon so often intervene on the whole professor teufelsdrockh is not a cultivated writer of his sentences perhaps not more than ninetenths stand straight on their legs the remainder are in quite angular attitudes buttressed up by props of parentheses and dashes and ever with this or the other tagrag hanging from them a few even sprawl out helplessly on all sides quite brokenbacked and dismembered nevertheless in almost his very worst moods there lies in him a singular attraction a wild tone pervades the whole utterance of the man like its keynote and regulator now screwing itself aloft as into the song of spirits or else the shrill mockery of fiends now sinking in cadences not without melodious heartiness though sometimes abrupt enough into the common pitch when we hear it only as a monotonous hum of which hum the true character is extremely difficult to fix up to this hour we have never fully satisfied ourselves whether it is a tone and hum of real humor which we reckon among the very highest qualities of genius or some echo of mere insanity and inanity which doubtless ranks below the very lowest  under a like difficulty in spite even of our personal intercourse do we still lie with regard to the professors moral feeling gleams of an ethereal love burst forth from him soft wailings of infinite pity he could clasp the whole universe into his bosom and keep it warm it seems as if under that rude exterior there dwelt a very seraph then again he is so sly and still so imperturbably saturnine shows such indifference malign coolness towards all that men strive after and ever with some halfvisible wrinkle of a bitter sardonic humor if indeed it be not mere stolid callousnessthat you look on him almost with a shudder as on some incarnate mephistopheles to whom this great terrestrial and celestial round after all were but some huge foolish whirligig where kings and beggars and angels and demons and stars and streetsweepings were chaotically whirled in which only children could take interest his look as we mentioned is probably the gravest ever seen yet it is not of that castiron gravity frequent enough among our own chancery suitors but rather the gravity as of some silent highencircled mountainpool perhaps the crater of an extinct volcano into whose black deeps you fear to gaze those eyes those lights that sparkle in it may indeed be reflexes of the heavenly stars but perhaps also glances from the region of nether fire  certainly a most involved selfsecluded altogether enigmatic nature this of teufelsdrockh here however we gladly recall to mind that once we saw him laugh once only perhaps it was the first and last time in his life but then such a peal of laughter enough to have awakened the seven sleepers it was of jean pauls doing some single billow in that vast worldmahlstrom of humor with its heavenkissing coruscations which is now alas all congealed in the frost of death the largebodied poet and the small both large enough in soul sat talking miscellaneously together the present editor being privileged to listen and now paul in his serious way was giving one of those inimitable extraharangues and as it chanced on the proposal for a castmetal king gradually a light kindled in our professors eyes and face a beaming mantling loveliest light through those murky features a radiant everyoung apollo looked and he burst forth like the neighing of all tattersallstears streaming down his cheeks pipe held aloft foot clutched into the airloud longcontinuing uncontrollable a laugh not of the face and diaphragm only but of the whole man from head to heel the present editor who laughed indeed yet with measure began to fear all was not right however teufelsdrockh composed himself and sank into his old stillness on his inscrutable countenance there was if anything a slight look of shame and richter himself could not rouse him again readers who have any tincture of psychology know how much is to be inferred from this and that no man who has once heartily and wholly laughed can be altogether irreclaimably bad how much lies in laughter the cipherkey wherewith we decipher the whole man some men wear an everlasting barren simper in the smile of others lies a cold glitter as of ice the fewest are able to laugh what can be called laughing but only sniff and titter and snigger from the throat outwards or at best produce some whiffling husky cachinnation as if they were laughing through wool of none such comes good the man who cannot laugh is not only fit for treasons stratagems and spoils but his whole life is already a treason and a stratagem  considered as an author herr teufelsdrockh has one scarcely pardonable fault doubtless his worst an almost total want of arrangement in this remarkable volume it is true his adherence to the mere course of time produces through the narrative portions a certain show of outward method but of true logical method and sequence there is too little apart from its multifarious sections and subdivisions the work naturally falls into two parts a historicaldescriptive and a philosophicalspeculative but falls unhappily by no firm line of demarcation in that labyrinthic combination each part overlaps and indents and indeed runs quite through the other many sections are of a debatable rubric or even quite nondescript and unnamable whereby the book not only loses in accessibility but too often distresses us like some mad banquet wherein all courses had been confounded and fish and flesh soup and solid oystersauce lettuces rhinewine and french mustard were hurled into one huge tureen or trough and the hungry public invited to help itself to bring what order we can out of this chaos shall be part of our endeavor    chapter v the world in clothes  as montesquieu wrote a spirit of laws observes our professor so could i write a spirit of clothes thus with an esprit des lois properly an esprit de coutumes we should have an esprit de costumes for neither in tailoring nor in legislating does man proceed by mere accident but the hand is ever guided on by mysterious operations of the mind in all his modes and habilatory endeavors an architectural idea will be found lurking his body and the cloth are the site and materials whereon and whereby his beautified edifice of a person is to be built whether he flow gracefully out in folded mantles based on light sandals tower up in high headgear from amid peaks spangles and bellgirdles swell out in starched ruffs buckram stuffings and monstrous tuberosities or girth himself into separate sections and front the world an agglomeration of four limbswill depend on the nature of such architectural idea whether grecian gothic later gothic or altogether modern and parisian or anglodandiacal again what meaning lies in color from the soberest drab to the highflaming scarlet spiritual idiosyncrasies unfold themselves in choice of color if the cut betoken intellect and talent so does the color betoken temper and heart in all which among nations as among individuals there is an incessant indubitable though infinitely complex working of cause and effect every snip of the scissors has been regulated and prescribed by everactive influences which doubtless to intelligences of a superior order are neither invisible nor illegible  for such superior intelligences a causeandeffect philosophy of clothes as of laws were probably a comfortable winterevening entertainment nevertheless for inferior intelligences like men such philosophies have always seemed to me uninstructive enough nay what is your montesquieu himself but a clever infant spelling letters from a hieroglyphical prophetic book the lexicon of which lies in eternity in heavenlet any causeandeffect philosopher explain not why i wear such and such a garment obey such and such a law but even why i am here to wear and obey anythingmuch therefore if not the whole of that same spirit of clothes i shall suppress as hypothetical ineffectual and even impertinent naked facts and deductions drawn therefrom in quite another than that omniscient style are my humbler and proper province  acting on which prudent restriction teufelsdrockh has nevertheless contrived to take in a wellnigh boundless extent of field at least the boundaries too often lie quite beyond our horizon selection being indispensable we shall here glance over his first part only in the most cursory manner this first part is no doubt distinguished by omnivorous learning and utmost patience and fairness at the same time in its results and delineations it is much more likely to interest the compilers of some library of general entertaining useful or even useless knowledge than the miscellaneous readers of these pages was it this part of the book which heuschrecke had in view when he recommended us to that jointstock vehicle of publication at present the glory of british literature if so the library editors are welcome to dig in it for their own behoof  to the first chapter which turns on paradise and figleaves and leads us into interminable disquisitions of a mythological metaphorical cabalisticosartorial and quite antediluvian cast we shall content ourselves with giving an unconcerned approval still less have we to do with lilis adams first wife whom according to the talmudists he had before eve and who bore him in that wedlock the whole progeny of aerial aquatic and terrestrial devilsvery needlessly we think on this portion of the work with its profound glances into the adamkadmon or primeval element here strangely brought into relation with the nifl and muspel darkness and light of the antique north it may be enough to say that its correctness of deduction and depth of talmudic and rabbinical lore have filled perhaps not the worst hebraist in britain with something like astonishment  but quitting this twilight region teufelsdrockh hastens from the tower of babel to follow the dispersion of mankind over the whole habitable and habilable globe walking by the light of oriental pelasgic scandinavian egyptian otaheitean ancient and modern researches of every conceivable kind he strives to give us in compressed shape as the nurnbergers give an orbis pictus an orbis vestitus or view of the costumes of all mankind in all countries in all times it is here that to the antiquarian to the historian we can triumphantly say fall to here is learning an irregular treasury if you will but inexhaustible as the hoard of king nibelung which twelve wagons in twelve days at the rate of three journeys a day could not carry off sheepskin cloaks and wampum belts phylacteries stoles albs chlamydes togas chinese silks afghaun shawls trunkhose leather breeches celtic hilibegs though breeches as the name gallia braccata indicates are the more ancient hussar cloaks vandyke tippets ruffs fardingales are brought vividly before useven the kilmarnock nightcap is not forgotten for most part too we must admit that the learning heterogeneous as it is and tumbled down quite pellmell is true concentrated and purified learning the drossy parts smelted out and thrown aside  philosophical reflections intervene and sometimes touching pictures of human life of this sort the following has surprised us the first purpose of clothes as our professor imagines was not warmth or decency but ornament miserable indeed says he was the condition of the aboriginal savage glaring fiercely from under his fleece of hair which with the beard reached down to his loins and hung round him like a matted cloak the rest of his body sheeted in its thick natural fell he loitered in the sunny glades of the forest living on wildfruits or as the ancient caledonian squatted himself in morasses lurking for his bestial or human prey without implements without arms save the ball of heavy flint to which that his sole possession and defence might not be lost he had attached a long cord of plaited thongs thereby recovering as well as hurling it with deadly unerring skill nevertheless the pains of hunger and revenge once satisfied his next care was not comfort but decoration putz warmth he found in the toils of the chase or amid dried leaves in his hollow tree in his bark shed or natural grotto but for decoration he must have clothes nay among wild people we find tattooing and painting even prior to clothes the first spiritual want of a barbarous man is decoration as indeed we still see among the barbarous classes in civilized countries  reader the heaveninspired melodious singer loftiest serene highness nay thy own amberlocked snowandrosebloom maiden worthy to glide sylphlike almost on air whom thou lovest worshippest as a divine presence which indeed symbolically taken she ishas descended like thyself from that same hairmantled flinthurling aboriginal anthropophagus out of the eater cometh forth meat out of the strong cometh forth sweetness what changes are wrought not by time yet in time for not mankind only but all that mankind does or beholds is in continual growth regenesis and selfperfecting vitality cast forth thy act thy word into the everliving everworking universe it is a seedgrain that cannot die unnoticed today says one it will be found flourishing as a banyangrove perhaps alas as a hemlockforest after a thousand years  he who first shortened the labor of copyists by device of movable types was disbanding hired armies and cashiering most kings and senates and creating a whole new democratic world he had invented the art of printing the first ground handful of nitre sulphur and charcoal drove monk schwartzs pestle through the ceiling what will the last do achieve the final undisputed prostration of force under thought of animal courage under spiritual a simple invention it was in the oldworld graziersick of lugging his slow ox about the country till he got it bartered for corn or oilto take a piece of leather and thereon scratch or stamp the mere figure of an ox or pecus put it in his pocket and call it pecunia money yet hereby did barter grow sale the leather money is now golden and paper and all miracles have been outmiracled for there are rothschilds and english national debts and whoso has sixpence is sovereign to the length of sixpence over all men commands cooks to feed him philosophers to teach him kings to mount guard over himto the length of sixpenceclothes too which began in foolishest love of ornament what have they not become increased security and pleasurable heat soon followed but what of these shame divine shame schaam modesty as yet a stranger to the anthropophagous bosom arose there mysteriously under clothes a mystic groveencircled shrine for the holy in man clothes gave us individuality distinctions social polity clothes have made men of us they are threatening to make clothesscreens of us  but on the whole continues our eloquent professor man is a toolusing animal handthierendes thier weak in himself and of small stature he stands on a basis at most for the flattestsoled of some halfsquare foot insecurely enough has to straddle out his legs lest the very wind supplant him feeblest of bipeds three quintals are a crushing load for him the steer of the meadow tosses him aloft like a waste rag nevertheless he can use tools can devise tools with these the granite mountain melts into light dust before him he kneads glowing iron as if it were soft paste seas are his smooth highway winds and fire his unwearying steeds nowhere do you find him without tools without tools he is nothing with tools he is all  here may we not for a moment interrupt the stream of oratory with a remark that this definition of the toolusing animal appears to us of all that animalsort considerably the precisest and best man is called a laughing animal but do not the apes also laugh or attempt to do it and is the manliest man the greatest and oftenest laugher teufelsdrockh himself as we said laughed only once still less do we make of that other french definition of the cooking animal which indeed for rigorous scientific purposes is as good as useless can a tartar be said to cook when he only readies his steak by riding on it again what cookery does the greenlander use beyond stowing up his whaleblubber as a marmot in the like case might do or how would monsieur ude prosper among those orinoco indians who according to humboldt lodge in crownests on the branches of trees and for half the year have no victuals but pipeclay the whole country being under water but on the other hand show us the human being of any period or climate without his tools those very caledonians as we saw had their flintball and thong to it such as no brute has or can have  man is a toolusing animal concludes teufelsdrockh in his abrupt way of which truth clothes are but one example and surely if we consider the interval between the first wooden dibble fashioned by man and those liverpool steamcarriages or the british house of commons we shall note what progress he has made he digs up certain black stones from the bosom of the earth and says to them transport me and this luggage at the rate of fileandthirty miles an hour and they do it he collects apparently by lot six hundred and fiftyeight miscellaneous individuals and says to them make this nation toil for us bleed for us hunger and sorrow and sin for us and they do it    chapter vi aprons  one of the most unsatisfactory sections in the whole volume is that on aprons what though stout old gao the persian blacksmith whose apron now indeed hidden under jewels because raised in revolt which proved successful is still the royal standard of that country what though john knoxs daughter who threatened sovereign majesty that she would catch her husbands head in her apron rather than he should lie and be a bishop what though the landgravine elizabeth with many other apron worthiesfigure here an idle wiredrawing spirit sometimes even a tone of levity approaching to conventional satire is too clearly discernible what for example are we to make of such sentences as the following  aprons are defences against injury to cleanliness to safety to modesty sometimes to roguery from the thin slip of notched silk as it were the emblem and beatified ghost of an apron which some highestbred housewife sitting at nurnberg workboxes and toyboxes has gracefully fastened on to the thicktanned hide girt round him with thongs wherein the builder builds and at evening sticks his trowel or to those jingling sheetiron aprons wherein your otherwise halfnaked vulcans hammer and smelt in their smeltfurnaceis there not range enough in the fashion and uses of this vestment how much has been concealed how much has been defended in aprons nay rightly considered what is your whole military and police establishment charged at uncalculated millions but a huge scarletcolored ironfastened apron wherein society works uneasily enough guarding itself from some soil and stithysparks in this devilssmithy teufelsschmiede of a world but of all aprons the most puzzling to me hitherto has been the episcopal or cassock wherein consists the usefulness of this apron the overseer episcopus of souls i notice has tucked in the corner of it as if his days work were done what does he shadow forth thereby c c  or again has it often been the lot of our readers to read such stuff as we shall now quote  i consider those printed paper aprons worn by the parisian cooks as a new vent though a slight one for typography therefore as an encouragement to modern literature and deserving of approval nor is it without satisfaction that i hear of a celebrated london firm having in view to introduce the same fashion with important extensions in englandwe who are on the spot hear of no such thing and indeed have reason to be thankful that hitherto there are other vents for our literature exuberant as it isteufelsdrockh continues if such supply of printed paper should rise so far as to choke up the highways and public thoroughfares new means must of necessity be had recourse to in a world existing by industry we grudge to employ fire as a destroying element and not as a creating one however heaven is omnipotent and will find us an outlet in the mean while is it not beautiful to see five million quintals of rags picked annually from the laystall and annually after being macerated hotpressed printed on and soldreturned thither filling so many hungry mouths by the way thus is the laystall especially with its rags or clothesrubbish the grand electric battery and fountainofmotion from which and to which the social activities like vitreous and resinous electricities circulate in larger or smaller circles through the mighty billowy stormtost chaos of life which they keep alivesuch passages fill us who love the man and partly esteem him with a very mixed feeling  farther down we meet with this the journalists are now the true kings and clergy henceforth historians unless they are fools must write not of bourbon dynasties and tudors and hapsburgs but of stamped broadsheet dynasties and quite new successive names according as this or the other able editor or combination of able editors gains the worlds ear of the british newspaper press perhaps the most important of all and wonderful enough in its secret constitution and procedure a valuable descriptive history already exists in that language under the title of satans invisible world displayed which however by search in all the weissnichtwo libraries i have not yet succeeded in procuring vermochte night aufzutreiben  thus does the good homer not only nod but snore thus does teufelsdrockh wandering in regions where he had little business confound the old authentic presbyterian witchfinder with a new spurious imaginary historian of the brittische journalistik and so stumble on perhaps the most egregious blunder in modern literature    chapter vii miscellaneoushistorical  happier is our professor and more purely scientific and historic when he reaches the middle ages in europe and down to the end of the seventeenth century the true era of extravagance in costume it is here that the antiquary and student of modes comes upon his richest harvest fantastic garbs beggaring all fancy of a teniers or a callot succeed each other like monster devouring monster in a dream the whole too in brief authentic strokes and touched not seldom with that breath of genius which makes even old raiment live indeed so learned precise graphical and every way interesting have we found these chapters that it may be thrown out as a pertinent question for parties concerned whether or not a good english translation thereof might henceforth be profitably incorporated with mr merricks valuable work on ancient armor take by way of example the following sketch as authority for which paulinuss zeitkurzende lust ii 678 is with seeming confidence referred to  did we behold the german fashionable dress of the fifteenth century we might smile as perhaps those bygone germans were they to rise again and see our haberdashery would cross themselves and invoke the virgin but happily no bygone german or man rises again thus the present is not needlessly trammelled with the past and only grows out of it like a tree whose roots are not intertangled with its branches but lie peaceably underground nay it is very mournful yet not useless to see and know how the greatest and dearest in a short while would find his place quite filled up here and no room for him the very napoleon the very byron in some seven years has become obsolete and were now a foreigner to his europe thus is the law of progress secured and in clothes as in all other external things whatsoever no fashion will continue  of the military classes in those old times whose buffbelts complicated chains and gorgets huge churnboots and other riding and fighting gear have been bepainted in modern romance till the whole has acquired somewhat of a signpost characteri shall here say nothing the civil and pacific classes less touched upon are wonderful enough for us  rich men i find have teusinke a perhaps untranslatable article also a silver girdle whereat hang little bells so that when a man walks it is with continual jingling some few of musical turn have a whole chime of bells glockenspiel fastened there which especially in sudden whirls and the other accidents of walking has a grateful effect observe too how fond they are of peaks and gothicarch intersections the male world wears peaked caps an ell long which hang bobbing over the side schief their shoes are peaked in front also to the length of an ell and laced on the side with tags even the wooden shoes have their elllong noses some also clap bells on the peak further according to my authority the men have breeches without seat ohne gesass these they fasten peakwise to their shirts and the long round doublet must overlap them  rich maidens again flit abroad in gowns scolloped out behind and before so that back and breast are almost bare wives of quality on the other hand have traingowns four or five ells in length which trains there are boys to carry brave cleopatras sailing in their silkcloth galley with a cupid for steersman consider their welts a handbreadth thick which waver round them by way of hem the long flood of silver buttons or rather silver shells from throat to shoe wherewith these same weltgowns are buttoned the maidens have bound silver snoods about their hair with gold spangles and pendent flames flammen that is sparkling hairdrops but of their mothers headgear who shall speak neither in love of grace is comfort forgotten in winter weather you behold the whole fair creation that can afford it in long mantles with skirts wide below and for hem not one but two sufficient handbroad welts all ending atop in a thick wellstarched ruff some twenty inches broad these are their ruffmantles kragenmantel  as yet among the womankind hooppetticoats are not but the men have doublets of fustian under which lie multiple ruffs of cloth pasted together with batter mit teig zusammengekleistert which create protuberance enough thus do the two sexes vie with each other in the art of decoration and as usual the stronger carries it  our professor whether he have humor himself or not manifests a certain feeling of the ludicrous a sly observance of it which could emotion of any kind be confidently predicated of so still a man we might call a real love none of those bellgirdles bushelbreeches counted shoes or other the like phenomena of which the history of dress offers so many escape him more especially the mischances or striking adventures incident to the wearers of such are noticed with due fidelity sir walter raleighs fine mantle which he spread in the mud under queen elizabeths feet appears to provoke little enthusiasm in him he merely asks whether at that period the maiden queen was redpainted on the nose and whitepainted on the cheeks as her tirewomen when from spleen and wrinkles she would no longer look in any glass were wont to serve her we can answer that sir walter knew well what he was doing and had the maiden queen been stuffed parchment dyed in verdigris would have done the same  thus too treating of those enormous habiliments that were not only slashed and gallooned but artificially swollen out on the broader parts of the body by introduction of branour professor fails not to comment on that luckless courtier who having seated himself on a chair with some projecting nail on it and therefrom rising to pay his devoir on the entrance of majesty instantaneously emitted several pecks of dry wheatdust and stood there diminished to a spindle his galloons and slashes dangling sorrowful and flabby round him whereupon the professor publishes this reflection  by what strange chances do we live in history erostratus by a torch milo by a bullock henry darnley an unfledged booby and bustard by his limbs most kings and queens by being born under such and such a bedtester boileau despreaux according to helvetius by the peck of a turkey and this illstarred individual by a rent in his breechesfor no memoirist of kaiser ottos court omits him vain was the prayer of themistocles for a talent of forgetting my friends yield cheerfully to destiny and read since it is writtenhas teufelsdrockh to be put in mind that nearly related to the impossible talent of forgetting stands that talent of silence which even travelling englishmen manifest  the simplest costume observes our professor which i anywhere find alluded to in history is that used as regimental by bolivars cavalry in the late colombian wars a square blanket twelve feet in diagonal is provided some were wont to cut off the corners and make it circular in the centre a slit is effected eighteen inches long through this the mothernaked trooper introduces his head and neck and so rides shielded from all weather and in battle from many strokes for he rolls it about his left arm and not only dressed but harnessed and draperied  with which picture of a state of nature affecting by its singularity and oldroman contempt of the superfluous we shall quit this part of our subject    chapter viii the world out of clothes  if in the descriptivehistorical portion of this volume teufelsdrockh discussing merely the werden origin and successive improvement of clothes has astonished many a reader much more will he in the speculativephilosophical portion which treats of their wirken or influences it is here that the present editor first feels the pressure of his task for here properly the higher and new philosophy of clothes commences all untried almost inconceivable region or chaos in venturing upon which how difficult yet how unspeakably important is it to know what course of survey and conquest is the true one where the footing is firm substance and will bear us where it is hollow or mere cloud and may engulf us teufelsdrockh undertakes no less than to expound the moral political even religious influences of clothes he undertakes to make manifest in its thousandfold bearings this grand proposition that mans earthly interests are all hooked and buttoned together and held up by clothes he says in so many words society is founded upon cloth and again society sails through the infinitude on cloth as on a fausts mantle or rather like the sheet of clean and unclean beasts in the apostles dream and without such sheet or mantle would sink to endless depths or mount to inane limbos and in either case be no more  by what chains or indeed infinitely complected tissues of meditation this grand theorem is here unfolded and innumerable practical corollaries are drawn therefrom it were perhaps a mad ambition to attempt exhibiting our professors method is not in any case that of common school logic where the truths all stand in a row each holding by the skirts of the other but at best that of practical reason proceeding by large intuition over whole systematic groups and kingdoms whereby we might say a noble complexity almost like that of nature reigns in his philosophy or spiritual picture of nature a mighty maze yet as faith whispers not without a plan nay we complained above that a certain ignoble complexity what we must call mere confusion was also discernible often also we have to exclaim would to heaven those same biographical documents were come for it seems as if the demonstration lay much in the authors individuality as if it were not argument that had taught him but experience at present it is only in local glimpses and by significant fragments picked often at wideenough intervals from the original volume and carefully collated that we can hope to impart some outline or foreshadow of this doctrine readers of any intelligence are once more invited to favor us with their most concentrated attention let these after intense consideration and not till then pronounce whether on the utmost verge of our actual horizon there is not a looming as of land a promise of new fortunate islands perhaps whole undiscovered americas for such as have canvas to sail thitheras exordium to the whole stand here the following long citation  with men of a speculative turn writes teufelsdrockh there come seasons meditative sweet yet awful hours when in wonder and fear you ask yourself that unanswerable question who am i the thing that can say i das wesen das sich ich nennt the world with its loud trafficking retires into the distance and through the paperhangings and stonewalls and thickplied tissues of commerce and polity and all the living and lifeless integuments of society and a body wherewith your existence sits surroundedthe sight reaches forth into the void deep and you are alone with the universe and silently commune with it as one mysterious presence with another  who am i what is this me a voice a motion an appearancesome embodied visualized idea in the eternal mind cogito ergo sum alas poor cogitator this takes us but a little way sure enough i am and lately was not but whence how whereto the answer lies around written in all colors and motions uttered in all tones of jubilee and wail in thousandfigured thousandvoiced harmonious nature but where is the cunning eye and ear to whom that godwritten apocalypse will yield articulate meaning we sit as in a boundless phantasmagoria and dreamgrotto boundless for the faintest star the remotest century lies not even nearer the verge thereof sounds and manycolored visions flit round our sense but him the unslumbering whose work both dream and dreamer are we see not except in rare halfwaking moments suspect not creation says one lies before us like a glorious rainbow but the sun that made it lies behind us hidden

dreamtheorem a net quotient confidently given out where divisor and dividend are both unknown what are all your national wars with their moscow retreats and sanguinary hatefilled revolutions but the somnambulism of uneasy sleepers this dreaming this somnambulism is what we on earth call life wherein the most indeed undoubtingly wander as if they knew right hand from left yet they only are wise who know that they know nothing  pity that all metaphysics had hitherto proved so inexpressibly unproductive the secret of mans being is still like the sphinxs secret a riddle that he cannot rede and

dreams and lifevisions are painted nevertheless has not a deeper meditation taught certain of every climate and age that the where and when so mysteriously inseparable from all our thoughts are but superficial terrestrial adhesions to thought that the seer may discern them where they mount up out of the celestial everywhere and forever have not all nations conceived their god as omnipresent and eternal as existing in a universal here an everlasting now think well thou too wilt find that space is but a mode of our human sense so likewise time there is no space and no time we arewe know not whatlightsparkles floating in the ether of deity  so that this so solidseeming world after all were but an airimage our me the only reality and nature with its thousandfold production and destruction but the reflex of our own inward force the phantasy of our dream or what the earthspirit in faust names it the living visible garment of god      in beings floods in actions storm     i walk and work above beneath     work and weave in endless motion           birth and death           an infinite ocean           a seizing and giving           the fire of living     tis thus at the roaring loom of time i ply     and weave for god the garment thou seest him by  of twenty millions that have read and spouted this thunderspeech of the erdgeist are there yet twenty units of us that have learned the meaning thereof  it was in some such mood when wearied and fordone with these high speculations that i first came upon the question of clothes strange enough it strikes me is this same fact of there being tailors and tailored the horse i ride has his own whole fell strip him of the girths and flaps and extraneous tags i have fastened round him and the noble creature is his own sempster and weaver and spinner nay his own bootmaker jeweller and manmilliner he bounds free through the valleys with a perennial rainproof courtsuit on his body wherein warmth and easiness of fit have reached perfection nay the graces also have been considered and frills and fringes with gay variety of color featly appended and ever in the right place are not wanting while igood heavenhave thatched myself over with the dead fleeces of sheep the bark of vegetables the entrails of worms the hides of oxen or seals the felt of furred beasts and walk abroad a moving ragscreen overheaped with shreds and tatters raked from the charnelhouse of nature where they would have rotted to rot on me more slowly day after day i must thatch myself anew day after day this despicable thatch must lose some film of its thickness some film of it frayed away by tear and wear must be brushed off into the ashpit into the laystall till by degrees the whole has been brushed thither and i the dustmaking patent ratgrinder get new material to grind down o subterbrutish vile most vile for have not i too a compact allenclosing skin whiter or dingier am i a botched mass of tailors and cobblers shreds then or a tightly articulated homogeneous little figure automatic nay alive  strange enough how creatures of the humankind shut their eyes to plainest facts and by the mere inertia of oblivion and stupidity live at ease in the midst of wonders and terrors but indeed man is and was always a blockhead and dullard much readier to feel and digest than to think and consider prejudice which he pretends to hate is his absolute lawgiver mere useandwont everywhere leads him by the nose thus let but a rising of the sun let but a creation of the world happen twice and it ceases to be marvellous to be noteworthy or noticeable perhaps not once in a lifetime does it occur to your ordinary biped of any country or generation be he goldmantled prince or russetjerkined peasant that his vestments and his self are not one and indivisible that he is naked without vestments till he buy or steal such and by forethought sew and button them  for my own part these considerations of our clothesthatch and how reaching inwards even to our heart of hearts it tailorizes and demoralizes us fill me with a certain horror at myself and mankind almost as one feels at those dutch cows which during the wet season you see grazing deliberately with jackets and petticoats of striped sacking in the meadows of gouda nevertheless there is something great in the moment when a man first strips himself of adventitious wrappages and sees indeed that he is naked and as swift has it a forked straddling animal with bandy legs yet also a spirit and unutterable mystery of mysteries    chapter ix adamitism  let no courteous reader take offence at the opinions broached in the conclusion of the last chapter the editor himself on first glancing over that singular passage was inclined to exclaim what have we got not only a sansculottist but an enemy to clothes in the abstract a new adamite in this century which flatters itself that it is the nineteenth and destructive both to superstition and enthusiasm  consider thou foolish teufelsdrockh what benefits unspeakable all ages and sexes derive from clothes for example when thou thyself a watery pulpy slobbery freshman and newcomer in this planet sattest muling and puking in thy nurses arms sucking thy coral and looking forth into the world in the blankest manner what hadst thou been without thy blankets and bibs and other nameless hulls a terror to thyself and mankind or hast thou forgotten the day when thou first receivedst breeches and thy long clothes became short the village where thou livedst was all apprised of the fact and neighbor after neighbor kissed thy puddingcheek and gave thee as handsel silver or copper coins on that the first galaday of thy existence again wert not thou at one period of life a buck or blood or macaroni or incroyable or dandy or by whatever name according to year and place such phenomenon is distinguished in that one word lie included mysterious volumes nay now when the reign of folly is over or altered and thy clothes are not for triumph but for defence hast thou always worn them perforce and as a consequence of mans fall never rejoiced in them as in a warm movable house a body round thy body wherein that strange thee of thine sat snug defying all variations of climate girt with thick doublemilled kerseys half buried under shawls and broadbrims and overalls and mudboots thy very fingers cased in doeskin and mittens thou hast bestrode that horse i ride and though it were in wild winter dashed through the world glorying in it as if thou wert its lord in vain did the sleet beat round thy temples it lighted only on thy impenetrable felted or woven case of wool in vain did the winds howlforests sounding and creaking deep calling unto deepand the storms heap themselves together into one huge arctic whirlpool thou flewest through the middle thereof striking fire from the highway wild music hummed in thy ears thou too wert as a sailor of the air the wreck of matter and the crash of worlds was thy element and propitiously wafting tide without clothes without bit or saddle what hadst thou been what had thy fleet quadruped beennature is good but she is not the best here truly was the victory of art over nature a thunderbolt indeed might have pierced thee all short of this thou couldst defy  or cries the courteous reader has your teufelsdrockh forgotten what he said lately about aboriginal savages and their condition miserable indeed would he have all this unsaid and us betake ourselves again to the matted cloak and go sheeted in a thick natural fell  nowise courteous reader the professor knows full well what he is saying and both thou and we in our haste do him wrong if clothes in these times so tailorize and demoralize us have they no redeeming value can they not be altered to serve better must they of necessity be thrown to the dogs the truth is teufelsdrockh though a sansculottist is no adamite and much perhaps as he might wish to go forth before this degenerate age as a sign would nowise wish to do it as those old adamites did in a state of nakedness the utility of clothes is altogether apparent to him nay perhaps he has an insight into their more recondite and almost mystic qualities what we might call the omnipotent virtue of clothes such as was never before vouchsafed to any man for example  you see two individuals he writes one dressed in fine red the other in coarse threadbare blue red says to blue be hanged and anatomized blue hears with a shudder and o wonder of wonders marches sorrowfully to the gallows is there noosed up vibrates his hour and the surgeons dissect him and fit his bones into a skeleton for medical purposes how is this or what make ye of your nothing can act but where it is red has no physical hold of blue no clutch of him is nowise in contact with him neither are those ministering sheriffs and lordlieutenants and hangmen and tipstaves so related to commanding red that he can tug them hither and thither but each stands distinct within his own skin nevertheless as it is spoken so is it done the articulated word sets all hands in action and rope and improveddrop perform their work  thinking reader the reason seems to me twofold first that man is a spirit and bound by invisible bonds to all men secondly that he wears clothes which are the visible emblems of that fact has not your red hangingindividual a horsehair wig squirrelskins and a plushgown whereby all mortals know that he is a judgesociety which the more i think of it astonishes me the more is founded upon cloth  often in my atrabiliar moods when i read of pompous ceremonials frankfort coronations royal drawingrooms levees couchees and how the ushers and macers and pursuivants are all in waiting how duke this is presented by archduke that and colonel a by general b and innumerable bishops admirals and miscellaneous functionaries are advancing gallantly to the anointed presence and i strive in my remote privacy to form a clear picture of that solemnityon a sudden as by some enchanters wand theshall i speak itthe clothes fly off the whole dramatic corps and dukes grandees bishops generals anointed presence itself every mothers son of them stand straddling there not a shirt on them and i know not whether to laugh or weep this physical or psychical infirmity in which perhaps i am not singular i have after hesitation thought right to publish for the solace of those afflicted with the like  would to heaven say we thou hadst thought right to keep it secret who is there now that can read the five columns of presentations in his morning newspaper without a shudder hypochondriac men and all men are to a certain extent hypochondriac should be more gently treated with what readiness our fancy in this shattered state of the nerves follows out the consequences which teufelsdrockh with a devilish coolness goes on to draw  what would majesty do could such an accident befall in reality should the buttons all simultaneously start and the solid wool evaporate in very deed as here in dream ach gott how each skulks into the nearest hidingplace their high state tragedy haupt und staatsaction becomes a pickleherringfarce to weep at which is the worst kind of farce the tables according to horace and with them the whole fabric of government legislation property police and civilized society are dissolved in wails and howls  lives the man that can figure a naked duke of windlestraw addressing a naked house of lords imagination choked as in mephitic air recoils on itself and will not forward with the picture the woolsack the ministerial the opposition benchesinfandum infandum and yet why is the thing impossible was not every soul or rather every body of these guardians of our liberties naked or nearly so last night a forked radish with a head fantastically carved and why might he not did our stern fate so order it walk out to st stephens as well as into bed in that nofashion and there with other similar radishes hold a bed of justice solace of those afflicted with the like unhappy teufelsdrockh had man ever such a physical or psychical infirmity before and now how many perhaps may thy unparalleled confession which we even to the sounder british world and goaded on by critical and biographical duty grudge to reimpart incurably infect therewith art thou the malignest of sansculottists or only the maddest  it will remain to be examined adds the inexorable teufelsdrockh in how far the scarecrow as a clothed person is not also entitled to benefit of clergy and english trial by jury nay perhaps considering his high function for is not he too a defender of property and sovereign armed with the terrors of the law to a certain royal immunity and inviolability which however misers and the meaner class of persons are not always voluntarily disposed to grant him  o my friends we are in yorick sternes words but as turkeys driven with a stick and red clout to the market or if some drivers as they do in norfolk take a dried bladder and put peas in it the rattle thereof terrifies the boldest    chapter x pure reason  it must now be apparent enough that our professor as above hinted is a speculative radical and of the very darkest tinge acknowledging for most part in the solemnities and paraphernalia of civilized life which we make so much of nothing but so many clothrags turkeypoles and bladders with dried peas to linger among such speculations longer than mere science requires a discerning public can have no wish for our purposes the simple fact that such a naked world is possible nay actually exists under the clothed one will be sufficient much therefore we omit about kings wrestling naked on the green with carmen and the kings being thrown dissect them with scalpels says teufelsdrockh the same viscera tissues livers lights and other lifetackle are there examine their spiritual mechanism the same great need great greed and little faculty nay ten to one but the carman who understands draughtcattle the rimming of wheels something of the laws of unstable and stable equilibrium with other branches of wagonscience and has actually put forth his hand and operated on nature is the more cunningly gifted of the two whence then their so unspeakable difference from clothes much also we shall omit about confusion of ranks and joan and my lady and how it would be everywhere hail fellow well met and chaos were come again all which to any one that has once fairly pictured out the grand motheridea society in a state of nakedness will spontaneously suggest itself should some sceptical individual still entertain doubts whether in a world without clothes the smallest politeness polity or even police could exist let him turn to the original volume and view there the boundless serbonian bog of sansculottism stretching sour and pestilential over which we have lightly flown where not only whole armies but whole nations might sink if indeed the following argument in its brief riveting emphasis be not of itself incontrovertible and final  are we opossums have we natural pouches like the kangaroo or how without clothes could we possess the masterorgan souls seat and true pineal gland of the body social i mean a purse  nevertheless it is impossible to hate professor teufelsdrockh at worst one knows not whether to hate or to love him for though in looking at the fair tapestry of human life with its royal and even sacred figures he dwells not on the obverse alone but here chiefly on the reverse and indeed turns out the rough seams tatters and manifold thrums of that unsightly wrongside with an almost diabolic patience and indifference which must have sunk him in the estimation of most readersthere is that within which unspeakably distinguishes him from all other past and present sansculottists the grand unparalleled peculiarity of teufelsdrockh is that with all this descendentalism he combines a transcendentalism no less superlative whereby if on the one hand he degrade man below most animals except those jacketed gouda cows he on the other exalts him beyond the visible heavens almost to an equality with the gods  to the eye of vulgar logic says he what is man an omnivorous biped that wears breeches to the eye of pure reason what is he a soul a spirit and divine apparition round his mysterious me there lies under all those woolrags a garment of flesh or of senses contextured in the loom of heaven whereby he is revealed to his like and dwells with them in union and division and sees and fashions for himself a universe with azure starry spaces and long thousands of years deephidden is he under that strange garment amid sounds and colors and forms as it were swathed in and inextricably overshrouded yet it is skywoven and worthy of a god stands he not thereby in the centre of immensities in the conflux of eternities he feels power has been given him to know to believe nay does not the spirit of love free in its celestial primeval brightness even here though but for moments look through well said saint chrysostom with his lips of gold the true shekinah is man where else is the godspresence manifested not to our eyes only but to our hearts as in our fellowman  in such passages unhappily too rare the high platonic mysticism of our author which is perhaps the fundamental element of his nature bursts forth as it were in full flood and through all the vapor and tarnish of what is often so perverse so mean in his exterior and environment we seem to look into a whole inward sea of light and lovethough alas the grim coppery clouds soon roll together again and hide it from view  such tendency to mysticism is everywhere traceable in this man and indeed to attentive readers must have been long ago apparent nothing that he sees but has more than a common meaning but has two meanings thus if in the highest imperial sceptre and charlemagnemantle as well as in the poorest oxgoad and gypsyblanket he finds prose decay contemptibility there is in each sort poetry also and a reverend worth for matter were it never so despicable is spirit the manifestation of spirit were it never so honorable can it be more the thing visible nay the thing imagined the thing in any way conceived as visible what is it but a garment a clothing of the higher celestial invisible unimaginable formless dark with excess of bright under which point of view the following passage so strange in purport so strange in phrase seems characteristic enough  the beginning of all wisdom is to look fixedly on clothes or even with armed eyesight till they become transparent the philosopher says the wisest of this age must station himself in the middle how true the philosopher is he to whom the highest has descended and the lowest has mounted up who is the equal and kindly brother of all  shall we tremble before clothwebs and cobwebs whether woven in arkwright looms or by the silent arachnes that weave unrestingly in our imagination or on the other hand what is there that we cannot love since all was created by god  happy he who can look through the clothes of a man the woollen and fleshly and official bankpaper and statepaper clothes into the man himself and discern it may be in this or the other dread potentate a more or less incompetent digestiveapparatus yet also an inscrutable venerable mystery in the meanest tinker that sees with eyes  for the rest as is natural to a man of this kind he deals much in the feeling of wonder insists on the necessity and high worth of universal wonder which he holds to be the only reasonable temper for the denizen of so singular a planet as ours wonder says he is the basis of worship the reign of wonder is perennial indestructible in man only at certain stages as the present it is for some short season a reign in partibus infidelium that progress of science which is to destroy wonder and in its stead substitute mensuration and numeration finds small favor with teufelsdrockh much as he otherwise venerates these two latter processes  shall your science exclaims he proceed in the small chinklighted or even oillighted underground workshop of logic alone and mans mind become an arithmetical mill whereof memory is the hopper and mere tables of sines and tangents codification and treatises of what you call political economy are the meal and what is that science which the scientific head alone were it screwed off and like the doctors in the arabian tale set in a basin to keep it alive could prosecute without shadow of a heartbut one other of the mechanical and menial handicrafts for which the scientific head having a soul in it is too noble an organ i mean that thought without reverence is barren perhaps poisonous at best dies like cookery with the day that called it forth does not live like sowing in successive tilths and widerspreading harvests bringing food and plenteous increase to all time  in such wise does teufelsdrockh deal hits harder or softer according to ability yet ever as we would fain persuade ourselves with charitable intent above all that class of logicchoppers and treblepipe scoffers and professed enemies to wonder who in these days so numerously patrol as nightconstables about the mechanics institute of science and cackle like true oldroman geese and goslings round their capitol on any alarm or on none nay who often as illuminated sceptics walk abroad into peaceable society in full daylight with rattle and lantern and insist on guiding you and guarding you therewith though the sun is shining and the street populous with mere justiceloving men that whole class is inexpressibly wearisome to him hear with what uncommon animation he perorates  the man who cannot wonder who does not habitually wonder and worship were he president of innumerable royal societies and carried the whole mecanique celeste and hegels philosophy and the epitome of all laboratories and observatories with their results in his single headis but a pair of spectacles behind which there is no eye let those who have eyes look through him then he may be useful  thou wilt have no mystery and mysticism wilt walk through thy world by the sunshine of what thou callest truth or even by the handlamp of what i call attorneylogic and explain all account for all or believe nothing of it nay thou wilt attempt laughter whoso recognizes the unfathomable allpervading domain of mystery which is everywhere under our feet and among our hands to whom the universe is an oracle and temple as well as a kitchen and cattlestallhe shall be a delirious mystic to him thou with sniffing charity wilt protrusively proffer thy handlamp and shriek as one injured when he kicks his foot through itarmer teufel doth not thy cow calve doth not thy bull gender thou thyself wert thou not born wilt thou not die explain me all this or do one of two things retire into private places with thy foolish cackle or what were better give it up and weep not that the reign of wonder is done and gods world all disembellished and prosaic but that thou hitherto art a dilettante and sandblind pedant    chapter xi prospective  the philosophy of clothes is now to all readers as we predicted it would do unfolding itself into new boundless expansions of a cloudcapt almost chimerical aspect yet not without azure loomings in the far distance and streaks as of an elysian brightness the highly questionable purport and promise of which it is becoming more and more important for us to ascertain is that a real elysian brightness cries many a timid wayfarer or the reflex of pandemonian lava is it of a truth leading us into beatific asphodel meadows or the yellowburning marl of a hellonearth  our professor like other mystics whether delirious or inspired gives an editor enough to do ever higher and dizzier are the heights he leads us to more piercing allcomprehending allconfounding are his views and glances for example this of nature being not an aggregate but a whole  well sang the hebrew psalmist if i take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the universe god is there thou thyself o cultivated reader who too probably art no psalmist but a prosaist knowing god only by tradition knowest thou any corner of the world where at least force is not the drop which thou shakest from thy wet hand rests not where it falls but tomorrow thou findest it swept away already on the wings of the northwind it is nearing the tropic of cancer how came it to evaporate and not lie motionless thinkest thou there is aught motionless without force and utterly dead  as i rode through the schwarzwald i said to myself that little fire which glows starlike across the darkgrowing nachtende moor where the sooty smith bends over his anvil and thou hopest to replace thy lost horseshoeis it a detached separated speck cut off from the whole universe or indissolubly joined to the whole thou fool that smithyfire was primarily kindled at the sun is fed by air that circulates from before noahs deluge from beyond the dogstar therein with iron force and coal force and the far stranger force of man are cunning affinities and battles and victories of force brought about it is a little ganglion or nervous centre in the great vital system of immensity call it if thou wilt an unconscious altar kindled on the bosom of the all whose iron sacrifice whose iron smoke and influence reach quite through the all whose dingy priest not by word yet by brain and sinew preaches forth the mystery of force nay preaches forth exoterically enough one little textlet from the gospel of freedom the gospel of mans force commanding and one day to be allcommanding  detached separated i say there is no such separation nothing hitherto was ever stranded cast aside but all were it only a withered leaf works together with all is borne forward on the bottomless shoreless flood of action and lives through perpetual metamorphoses the withered leaf is not dead and lost there are forces in it and around it though working in inverse order else how could it rot despise not the rag from which man makes paper or the litter from which the earth makes corn rightly viewed no meanest object is insignificant all objects are as windows through which the philosophic eye looks into infinitude itself  again leaving that wondrous schwarzwald smithyaltar what vacant highsailing airships are these and whither will they sail with us  all visible things are emblems what thou seest is not there on its own account strictly taken is not there at all matter exists only spiritually and to represent some idea and body it forth hence clothes as despicable as we think them are so unspeakably significant clothes from the kings mantle downwards are emblematic not of want only but of a manifold cunning victory over want on the other hand all emblematic things are properly clothes thoughtwoven or handwoven must not the imagination weave garments visible bodies wherein the else invisible creations and inspirations of our reason are like spirits revealed and first become allpowerful the rather if as we often see the hand too aid her and by wool clothes or otherwise reveal such even to the outward eye  men are properly said to be clothed with authority clothed with beauty with curses and the like nay if you consider it what is man himself and his whole terrestrial life but an emblem a clothing or visible garment for that divine me of his cast hither like a lightparticle down from heaven thus is he said also to be clothed with a body  language is called the garment of thought however it should rather be language is the fleshgarment the body of thought i said that imagination wove this fleshgarment and does not she metaphors are her stuff examine language what if you except some few primitive elements of natural sound what is it all but metaphors recognized as such or no longer recognized still fluid and florid or now solidgrown and colorless if those same primitive elements are the osseous fixtures in the fleshgarment languagethen are metaphors its muscles and tissues and living integuments an unmetaphorical style you shall in vain seek for is not your very attention a stretchingto the difference lies here some styles are lean adust wiry the muscle itself seems osseous some are even quite pallid hungerbitten and deadlooking while others again glow in the flush of health and vigorous selfgrowth sometimes as in my own case not without an apoplectic tendency moreover there are sham metaphors which overhanging that same thoughtsbody best naked and deceptively bedizening or bolstering it out may be called its false stuffings superfluous showcloaks putzmantel and tawdry woollen rags whereof he that runs and reads may gather whole hampersand burn them  than which paragraph on metaphors did the reader ever chance to see a more surprisingly metaphorical however that is not our chief grievance the professor continues  why multiply instances it is written the heavens and the earth shall fade away like a vesture which indeed they are the timevesture of the eternal whatsoever sensibly exists whatsoever represents spirit to spirit is properly a clothing a suit of raiment put on for a season and to be laid off thus in this one pregnant subject of clothes rightly understood is included all that men have thought dreamed done and been the whole external universe and what it holds is but clothing and the essence of all science lies in the philosophy of clothes  towards these dim infinitely expanded regions closebordering on the impalpable inane it is not without apprehension and perpetual difficulties that the editor sees himself journeying and struggling till lately a cheerful daystar of hope hung before him in the expected aid of hofrath heuschrecke which daystar however melts now not into the red of morning but into a vague gray halflight uncertain whether dawn of day or dusk of utter darkness for the last week these socalled biographical documents are in his hand by the kindness of a scottish hamburg merchant whose name known to the whole mercantile world he must not mention but whose honorable courtesy now and often before spontaneously manifested to him a mere literary stranger he cannot soon forgetthe bulky weissnichtwo packet with all its customhouse seals foreign hieroglyphs and miscellaneous tokens of travel arrived here in perfect safety and free of cost the reader shall now fancy with what hot haste it was broken up with what breathless expectation glanced over and alas with what unquiet disappointment it has since then been often thrown down and again taken up  hofrath heuschrecke in a too longwinded letter full of compliments weissnichtwo politics dinners dining repartees and other ephemeral trivialities proceeds to remind us of what we knew well already that however it may be with metaphysics and other abstract science originating in the head verstand alone no lifephilosophy lebensphilosophie such as this of clothes pretends to be which originates equally in the character gemuth and equally speaks thereto can attain its significance till the character itself is known and seen till the authors view of the world weltansicht and how he actively and passively came by such view are clear in short till a biography of him has been philosophicopoetically written and philosophicopoetically read nay adds he were the speculative scientific truth even known you still in this inquiring age ask yourself whence came it and why and howand rest not till if no better may be fancy have shaped out an answer and either in the authentic lineaments of fact or the forged ones of fiction a complete picture and genetical history of the man and his spiritual endeavor lies before you but why says the hofrath and indeed say we do i dilate on the uses of our teufelsdrockhs biography the great herr minister von goethe has penetratingly remarked that man is properly the only object that interests man thus i too have noted that in weissnichtwo our whole conversation is little or nothing else but biography or autobiography ever humanoanecdotical menschlichanekdotisch biography is by nature the most universally profitable universally pleasant of all things especially biography of distinguished individuals  by this time mein verehrtester my most esteemed continues he with an eloquence which unless the words be purloined from teufelsdrockh or some trick of his as we suspect is wellnigh unaccountable by this time you are fairly plunged vertieft in that mighty forest of clothesphilosophy and looking round as all readers do with astonishment enough such portions and passages as you have already mastered and brought to paper could not but awaken a strange curiosity touching the mind they issued from the perhaps unparalleled psychical mechanism which manufactured such matter and emitted it to the light of day had teufelsdrockh also a father and mother did he at one time wear drivelbibs and live on spoonmeat did he ever in rapture and tears clasp a friends bosom to his looks he also wistfully into the long burialaisle of the past where only winds and their low harsh moan give inarticulate answer has he fought duelsgood heaven how did he comport himself when in love by what singular stairsteps in short and subterranean passages and sloughs of despair and steep pisgah hills has he reached this wonderful prophetic hebron a true oldclothes jewry where he now dwells  to all these natural questions the voice of public history is as yet silent certain only that he has been and is a pilgrim and traveller from a far country more or less footsore and travelsoiled has parted with roadcompanions fallen among thieves been poisoned by bad cookery blistered with bugbites nevertheless at every stage for they have let him pass has had the bill to discharge but the whole particulars of his route his weatherobservations the picturesque sketches he took though all regularly jotted down in indelible sympatheticink by an invisible interior penman are these nowhere forthcoming perhaps quite lost one other leaf of that mighty volume of human memory left to fly abroad unprinted unpublished unbound up as waste paper and to rot the sport of rainy winds  no verehrtester herr herausgeber in no wise i here by the unexampled favor you stand in with our sage send not a biography only but an autobiography at least the materials for such wherefrom if i misreckon not your perspicacity will draw fullest insight and so the whole philosophy and philosopher of clothes will stand clear to the wondering eyes of england nay thence through america through hindostan and the antipodal new holland finally conquer einnehmen great part of this terrestrial planet  and now let the sympathizing reader judge of our feeling when in place of this same autobiography with fullest insight we findsix considerable paperbags carefully sealed and marked successively in gilt chinaink with the symbols of the six southern zodiacal signs beginning at libra in the inside of which sealed bags lie miscellaneous masses of sheets and oftener shreds and snips written in professor teufelsdrockhs scarce legible cursivschrift and treating of all imaginable things under the zodiac and above it but of his own personal history only at rare intervals and then in the most enigmatic manner  whole fascicles there are wherein the professor or as he here speaking in the third person calls himself the wanderer is not once named then again amidst what seems to be a metaphysicotheological disquisition detached thoughts on the steamengine or the continued possibility of prophecy we shall meet with some quite private not unimportant biographical fact on certain sheets stand dreams authentic or not while the circumjacent waking actions are omitted anecdotes oftenest without date of place or time fly loosely on separate slips like sibylline leaves interspersed also are long purely autobiographical delineations yet without connection without recognizable coherence so unimportant so superfluously minute they almost remind us of pp clerk of this parish thus does famine of intelligence alternate with waste selection order appears to be unknown to the professor in all bags the same imbroglio only perhaps in the bag capricorn and those near it the confusion a little worse confounded close by a rather eloquent oration on receiving the doctorshat lie washbills marked bezahlt settled his travels are indicated by the streetadvertisements of the various cities he has visited of which streetadvertisements in most living tongues here is perhaps the completest collection extant  so that if the clothesvolume itself was too like a chaos we have now instead of the solar luminary that should still it the airy limbo which by intermixture will farther volatilize and discompose it as we shall perhaps see it our duty ultimately to deposit these six paperbags in the british museum farther description and all vituperation of them may be spared biography or autobiography of teufelsdrockh there is clearly enough none to be gleaned here at most some sketchy shadowy fugitive likeness of him may by unheardof efforts partly of intellect partly of imagination on the side of editor and of reader rise up between them only as a gaseouschaotic appendix to that aqueouschaotic volume can the contents of the six bags hover round us and portions thereof be incorporated with our delineation of it  daily and nightly does the editor sit with green spectacles deciphering these unimaginable documents from their perplexed cursivschrift collating them with the almost equally unimaginable volume which stands in legible print over such a universal medley of high and low of hot cold moist and dry is he here struggling by union of like with like which is method to build a firm bridge for british travellers never perhaps since our first bridgebuilders sin and death built that stupendous arch from hellgate to the earth did any pontifex or pontiff undertake such a task as the present editor for in this arch too leading as we humbly presume far otherwards than that grand primeval one the materials are to be fished up from the weltering deep and down from the simmering air here one mass there another and cunningly cemented while the elements boil beneath nor is there any supernatural force to do it with but simply the diligence and feeble thinking faculty of an english editor endeavoring to evolve printed creation out of a german printed and written chaos wherein as he shoots to and fro in it gathering clutching piecing the why to the fardistant wherefore his whole faculty and self are like to be swallowed up  patiently under these incessant toils and agitations does the editor dismissing all anger see his otherwise robust health declining some fraction of his allotted natural sleep nightly leaving him and little but an inflamed nervoussystem to be looked for what is the use of health or of life if not to do some work therewith and what work nobler than transplanting foreign thought into the barren domestic soil except indeed planting thought of your own which the fewest are privileged to do wild as it looks this philosophy of clothes can we ever reach its real meaning promises to reveal newcoming eras the first dim rudiments and alreadybudding germs of a nobler era in universal history is not such a prize worth some striving forward with us courageous reader be it towards failure or towards success the latter thou sharest with us the former also is not all our own     book ii    chapter i genesis  in a psychological point of view it is perhaps questionable whether from birth and genealogy how closely scrutinized soever much insight is to be gained nevertheless as in every phenomenon the beginning remains always the most notable moment so with regard to any great man we rest not till for our scientific profit or not the whole circumstances of his first appearance in this planet and what manner of public entry he made are with utmost completeness rendered manifest to the genesis of our clothesphilosopher then be this first chapter consecrated unhappily indeed he seems to be of quite obscure extraction uncertain we might almost say whether of any so that this genesis of his can properly be nothing but an exodus or transit out of invisibility into visibility whereof the preliminary portion is nowhere forthcoming  in the village of entepfuhl thus writes he in the bag libra on various papers which we arrange with difficulty dwelt andreas futteral and his wife childless in still seclusion and cheerful though now verging towards old age andreas had been grenadier sergeant and even regimental schoolmaster under frederick the great but now quitting the halbert and ferule for the spade and pruninghook cultivated a little orchard on the produce of which he cincinnatuslike lived not without dignity fruits the peach the apple the grape with other varieties came in their season all which andreas knew how to sell on evenings he smoked largely or read as beseemed a regimental schoolmaster and talked to neighbors that would listen about the victory of rossbach and how fritz the only der einzige had once with his own royal lips spoken to him had been pleased to say when andreas as campsentinel demanded the password schweig hund peace hound before any of his staffadjutants could answer das nenn ich mir einen konig there is what i call a king would andreas exclaim but the smoke of kunersdorf was still smarting his eyes  gretchen the housewife won like desdemona by the deeds rather than the looks of her now veteran othello lived not in altogether military subordination for as andreas said the womankind will not drill wer kann die weiberchen dressiren nevertheless she at heart loved him both for valor and wisdom to her a prussian grenadier sergeant and regiments schoolmaster was little other than a cicero and cid what you see yet cannot see over is as good as infinite nay was not andreas in very deed a man of order courage downrightness geradheit that understood buschings geography had been in the victory of rossbach and left for dead in the camisade of hochkirch the good gretchen for all her fretting watched over him and hovered round him as only a true housemother can assiduously she cooked and sewed and scoured for him so that not only his old regimental sword and grenadiercap but the whole habitation and environment where on pegs of honor they hung looked ever trim and gay a roomy painted cottage embowered in fruittrees and foresttrees evergreens and honeysuckles rising manycolored from amid shaven grassplots flowers struggling in through the very windows under its long projecting eaves nothing but gardentools in methodic piles to screen them from rain and seats where especially on summer nights a king might have wished to sit and smoke and call it his such a bauergut copyhold had gretchen given her veteran whose sinewy arms and longdisused gardening talent had made it what you saw  into this umbrageous mansnest one meek yellow evening or dusk when the sun hidden indeed from terrestrial entepfuhl did nevertheless journey visible and radiant along the celestial balance libra it was that a stranger of reverend aspect entered and with grave salutation stood before the two rather astonished housemates he was closemuffled in a wide mantle which without farther parley unfolding he deposited therefrom what seemed some basket overhung with green persian silk saying only ihr lieben leute hier bringe ein unschatzbares verleihen nehmt es in aller acht sorgfaltigst benutzt es mit hohem lohn oder wohl mit schweren zinsen wirds einst zuruckgefordert good christian people here lies for you an invaluable loan take all heed thereof in all carefulness employ it with high recompense or else with heavy penalty will it one day be required back uttering which singular words in a clear belllike forever memorable tone the stranger gracefully withdrew and before andreas or his wife gazing in expectant wonder had time to fashion either question or answer was clean gone neither out of doors could aught of him be seen or heard he had vanished in the thickets in the dusk the orchardgate stood quietly closed the stranger was gone once and always so sudden had the whole transaction been in the autumn stillness and twilight so gentle noiseless that the futterals could have fancied it all a trick of imagination or some visit from an authentic spirit only that the greensilk basket such as neither imagination nor authentic spirits are wont to carry still stood visible and tangible on their little parlortable towards this the astonished couple now with lit candle hastily turned their attention lifting the green veil to see what invaluable it hid they descried there amid down and rich white wrappages no pitt diamond or hapsburg regalia but in the softest sleep a little redcolored infant beside it lay a roll of gold friedrichs the exact amount of which was never publicly known also a taufschein baptismal certificate wherein unfortunately nothing but the name was decipherable other document or indication none whatever  to wonder and conjecture was unavailing then and always thenceforth nowhere in entepfuhl on the morrow or next day did tidings transpire of any such figure as the stranger nor could the traveller who had passed through the neighboring town in coachandfour be connected with this apparition except in the way of gratuitous surmise meanwhile for andreas and his wife the grand practical problem was what to do with this little sleeping redcolored infant amid amazements and curiosities which had to die away without external satisfying they resolved as in such circumstances charitable prudent people needs must on nursing it though with spoonmeat into whiteness and if possible into manhood the heavens smiled on their endeavor thus has that same mysterious individual ever since had a status for himself in this visible universe some modicum of victual and lodging and paradeground and now expanded in bulk faculty and knowledge of good and evil he as herr diogenes teufelsdrockh professes or is ready to profess perhaps not altogether without effect in the new university of weissnichtwo the new science of things in general  our philosopher declares here as indeed we should think he well might that these facts first communicated by the good gretchen futteral in his twelfth year produced on the boyish heart and fancy a quite indelible impression who this reverend personage he says that glided into the orchard cottage when the sun was in libra and then as on spirits wings glided out again might be an inexpressible desire full of love and of sadness has often since struggled within me to shape an answer ever in my distresses and my loneliness has fantasy turned full of longing sehnsuchtsvoll to that unknown father who perhaps far from me perhaps near either way invisible might have taken me to his paternal bosom there to lie screened from many a woe thou beloved father dost thou still shut out from me only by thin penetrable curtains of earthly space wend to and fro among the crowd of the living or art thou hidden by those far thicker curtains of the everlasting night or rather of the everlasting day through which my mortal eye and outstretched arms need not strive to reach alas i know not and in vain vex myself to know more than once heartdeluded have i taken for thee this and the other noblelooking stranger and approached him wistfully with infinite regard but he too had to repel me he too was not thou  and yet o man born of woman cries the autobiographer with one of his sudden whirls wherein is my case peculiar hadst thou any more than i a father whom thou knowest the andreas and gretchen or the adam and eve who led thee into life and for a time suckled and papfed thee there whom thou namest father and mother these were like mine but thy nursingfather and nursingmother thy true beginning and father is in heaven whom with the bodily eye thou shalt never behold but only with the spiritual  the little green veil adds he among much similar moralizing and embroiled discoursing i yet keep still more inseparably the name diogenes teufelsdrockh from the veil can nothing be inferred a piece of now quite faded persian silk like thousands of others on the name i have many times meditated and conjectured but neither in this lay there any clew that it was my unknown fathers name i must hesitate to believe to no purpose have i searched through all the heralds books in and without the german empire and through all manner of subscriberlists pranumeranten militiarolls and other namecatalogues extraordinary names as we have in germany the name teufelsdrockh except as appended to my own person nowhere occurs again what may the unchristian rather than christian diogenes mean did that reverend basketbearer intend by such designation to shadow forth my future destiny or his own present malign humor perhaps the latter perhaps both thou illstarred parent who like an ostrich hadst to leave thy illstarred offspring to be hatched into selfsupport by the mere skyinfluences of chance can thy pilgrimage have been a smooth one beset by misfortune thou doubtless hast been or indeed by the worst figure of misfortune by misconduct often have i fancied how in thy hard lifebattle thou wert shot at and slung at wounded handfettered hamstrung browbeaten and bedevilled by the timespirit zeitgeist in thyself and others till the good soul first given thee was seered into grim rage and thou hadst nothing for it but to leave in me an indignant appeal to the future and living speaking protest against the devil as that same spirit not of the time only but of time itself is well named which appeal and protest may i now modestly add was not perhaps quite lost in air  for indeed as walter shandy often insisted there is much nay almost all in names the name is the earliest garment you wrap round the earthvisiting me to which it thenceforth cleaves more tenaciously for there are names that have lasted nigh thirty centuries than the very skin and now from without what mystic influences does it not send inwards even to the centre especially in those plastic firsttimes when the whole soul is yet infantine soft and the invisible seedgrain will grow to be an all overshadowing tree names could i unfold the influence of names which are the most important of all clothings i were a

very plain sense the proverb says call one a thief and he will steal in an almost similar sense may we not perhaps say call one diogenes teufelsdrockh and he will open the philosophy of clothes   meanwhile the incipient diogenes like others all ignorant of his why his how or whereabout was opening his eyes to the kind light sprawling out his ten fingers and toes listening tasting feeling in a word by all his five senses still more by his sixth sense of hunger and a whole infinitude of inward spiritual halfawakened senses endeavoring daily to acquire for himself some knowledge of this strange universe where he had arrived be his task therein what it might infinite was his progress thus in some fifteen months he could perform the miracle ofspeech to breed a fresh soul is it not like brooding a fresh celestial egg wherein as yet all is formless powerless yet by degrees organic elements and fibres shoot through the watery albumen and out of vague sensation grows thought grows fantasy and force and we have philosophies dynasties nay poetries and religions  young diogenes or rather young gneschen for by such diminutive had they in their fondness named him travelled forward to those high consummations by quick yet easy stages the futterals to avoid vain talk and moreover keep the roll of gold friedrichs safe gave out that he was a grandnephew the orphan of some sisters daughter suddenly deceased in andreass distant prussian birthland of whom as of her indigent sorrowing widower little enough was known at entepfuhl heedless of all which the nursling took to his spoonmeat and throve i have heard him noted as a still infant that kept his mind much to himself above all that seldom or never cried he already felt that time was precious that he had other work cut out for him than whimpering   such after utmost painful search and collation among these miscellaneous papermasses is all the notice we can gather of herr teufelsdrockhs genealogy more imperfect more enigmatic it can seem to few readers than to us the professor in whom truly we more and more discern a certain satirical turn and deep undercurrents of roguish whim for the present stands pledged in honor so we will not doubt him but seems it not conceivable that by the good gretchen futteral or some other perhaps interested party he has himself been deceived should these sheets translated or not ever reach the entepfuhl circulating library some cultivated native of that district might feel called to afford explanation nay since books like invisible scouts permeate the whole habitable globe and timbuctoo itself is not safe from british literature may not some copy find out even the mysterious basketbearing stranger who in a state of extreme senility perhaps still exists and gently force even him to disclose himself to claim openly a son in whom any father may feel pride    chapter ii idyllic  happy season of childhood exclaims teufelsdrockh kind nature that art to all a bountiful mother that visitest the poor mans hut with auroral radiance and for thy nursling hast provided a soft swathing of love and infinite hope wherein he waxes and slumbers danced round umgaukelt by sweetest dreams if the paternal cottage still shuts us in its roof still screens us with a father we have as yet a prophet priest and king and an obedience that makes us free the young spirit has awakened out of eternity and knows not what we mean by time as yet time is no fasthurrying stream but a sportful sunlit ocean years to the child are as ages ah the secret of vicissitude of that slower or quicker decay and ceaseless downrushing of the universal worldfabric from the granite mountain to the man or daymoth is yet unknown and in a motionless universe we taste what afterwards in this quickwhirling universe is forever denied us the balm of rest sleep on thou fair child for thy long rough journey is at hand a little while and thou too shalt sleep no more but thy very dreams shall be mimic battles thou too with old arnauld wilt have to say in stern patience rest rest shall i not have all eternity to rest in celestial nepenthe though a pyrrhus conquer empires and an alexander sack the world he finds thee not and thou hast once fallen gently of thy own accord on the eyelids on the heart of every mothers child for as yet sleep and waking are one the fair lifegarden rustles infinite around and everywhere is dewy fragrance and the budding of hope which budding if in youth too frostnipt it grow to flowers will in manhood yield no fruit but a prickly bitterrinded stonefruit of which the fewest can find the kernel  in such rosecolored light does our professor as poets are wont look back on his childhood the historical details of which to say nothing of much other vague oratorical matter he accordingly dwells on with an almost wearisome minuteness we hear of entepfuhl standing in trustful derangement among the woody slopes the paternal orchard flanking it as extreme outpost from below the little kuhbach gushing kindly by among beechrows through river after river into the donau into the black sea into the atmosphere and universe and how the brave old linden stretching like a parasol of twenty ells in radius overtopping all other rows and clumps towered up from the central agora and campus martius of the village like its sacred tree and how the old men sat talking under its shadow gneschen often greedily listening and the wearied laborers reclined and the unwearied children sported and the young men and maidens often danced to flutemusic glorious summer twilights cries teufelsdrockh when the sun like a proud conqueror and imperial taskmaster turned his back with his goldpurple emblazonry and all his fireclad bodyguard of prismatic colors and the tired brickmakers of this clay earth might steal a little frolic and those few meek stars would not tell of them  then we have long details of the weinlesen vintage the harvesthome christmas and so forth with a whole cycle of the entepfuhl childrensgames differing apparently by mere superficial shades from those of other countries concerning all which we shall here for obvious reasons say nothing what cares the world for our as yet miniature philosophers achievements under that brave old linden  or even where is the use of such practical reflections as the following in all the sports of children were it only in their wanton breakages and defacements you shall discern a creative instinct schaffenden trieb the mankin feels that he is a born man that his vocation is to work the choicest present you can make him is a tool be it knife or pengun for construction or for destruction either way it is for work for change in gregarious sports of skill or strength the boy trains himself to cooperation for war or peace as governor or governed the little maid again provident of her domestic destiny takes with preference to dolls  perhaps however we may give this anecdote considering who it is that relates it my first shortclothes were of yellow serge or rather i should say my first shortcloth for the vesture was one and indivisible reaching from neck to ankle a mere body with four limbs of which fashion how little could i then divine the architectural how much less the moral significance  more graceful is the following little picture on fine evenings i was wont to carry forth my supper breadcrumb boiled in milk and eat it outofdoors on the coping of the orchardwall which i could reach by climbing or still more easily if father andreas would set up the pruningladder my porringer was placed there many a sunset have i looking at the distant western mountains consumed not without relish my evening meal those hues of gold and azure that hush of worlds expectation as day died were still a hebrew speech for me nevertheless i was looking at the fair illuminated letters and had an eye for their gilding  with the little ones friendship for cattle and poultry we shall not much intermeddle it may be that hereby he acquired a certain deeper sympathy with animated nature but when we would ask saw any man in a collection of biographical documents such a piece as this impressive enough bedeutungsvoll was it to hear in early morning the swineherds horn and know that so many hungry happy quadrupeds were on all sides starting in hot haste to join him for breakfast on the heath or to see them at eventide all marching in again with short squeak almost in military order and each topographically correct trotting off in succession to the right or left through its own lane to its own dwelling till old kunz at the villagehead now left alone blew his last blast and retired for the night we are wont to love the hog chiefly in the form of ham yet did not these bristly thickskinned beings here manifest intelligence perhaps humor of character at any rate a touching trustful submissiveness to manwho were he but a swineherd in darned gabardine and leather breeches more resembling slate or discoloredtin breeches is still the hierarch of this lower world  it is maintained by helvetius and his set that an infant of genius is quite the same as any other infant only that certain surprisingly favorable influences accompany him through life especially through childhood and expand him while others lie closefolded and continue dunces herein say they consists the whole difference between an inspired prophet and a doublebarrelled gamepreserver the inner man of the one has been fostered into generous development that of the other crushed down perhaps by vigor of animal digestion and the like has exuded and evaporated or at best sleeps now irresuscitably stagnant at the bottom of his stomach with which opinion cries teufelsdrockh i should as soon agree as with this other that an acorn might by favorable or unfavorable influences of soil and climate be nursed into a cabbage or the cabbageseed into an oak  nevertheless continues he i too acknowledge the allbut omnipotence of early culture and nurture hereby we have either a doddered dwarf bush or a hightowering wideshadowing tree either a sick yellow cabbage or an edible luxuriant green one of a truth it is the duty of all men especially of all philosophers to note down with accuracy the characteristic circumstances of their education what furthered what hindered what in any way modified it to which duty nowadays so pressing for many a german autobiographer i also zealously address myselfthou rogue is it by short clothes of yellow serge and swineherd horns that an infant of genius is educated and yet as usual it ever remains doubtful whether he is laughing in his sleeve at these autobiographical times of ours or writing from the abundance of his own fond ineptitude for he continues if among the everstreaming currents of sights hearings feelings for pain or pleasure whereby as in a magic hall young gneschen went about environed i might venture to select and specify perhaps these following were also of the number  doubtless as childish sports call forth intellect activity so the young creatures imagination was stirred up and a historical tendency given him by the narrative habits of father andreas who with his battlereminiscences and gray austere yet hearty patriarchal aspect could not but appear another ulysses and muchenduring man eagerly i hung upon his tales when listening neighbors enlivened the hearth from these perils and these travels wild and far almost as hades itself a dim world of adventure expanded itself within me incalculable also was the knowledge i acquired in standing by the old men under the lindentree the whole of immensity was yet new to me and had not these reverend seniors talkative enough been employed in partial surveys thereof for nigh fourscore years with amazement i began to discover that entepfuhl stood in the middle of a country of a world that there was such a thing as history as biography to which i also one day by hand and tongue might contribute  in a like sense worked the postwagen stagecoach which slowrolling under its mountains of men and luggage wended through our village northwards truly in the dead of night yet southwards visibly at eventide not till my eighth year did i reflect that this postwagen could be other than some terrestrial moon rising and setting by mere law of nature like the heavenly one that it came on made highways from far cities towards far cities weaving them like a monstrous shuttle into closer and closer union it was then that independently of schillers wilhelm tell i made this not quite insignificant reflection so true also in spiritual things any road this simple entepfuhl road will lead you to the end of the world  why mention our swallows which out of far africa as i learned threading their way over seas and mountains corporate cities and belligerent nations yearly found themselves with the month of may snuglodged in our cottage lobby the hospitable father for cleanliness sake had fixed a little bracket plumb under their nest there they built and caught flies and twittered and bred and all i chiefly from the heart loved them bright nimble creatures who taught you the masoncraft nay stranger still gave you a masonic incorporation almost social police for if by ill chance and when time pressed your house fell have i not seen five neighborly helpers appear next day and swashing to and fro with animated loud longdrawn chirpings and activity almost superhirundine complete it again before nightfall  but undoubtedly the grand summary of entepfuhl childs culture where as in a funnel its manifold influences were concentrated and simultaneously poured down on us was the annual cattlefair here assembling from all the four winds came the elements of an unspeakable hurryburly nutbrown maids and nutbrown men all clearwashed loudlaughing bedizened and beribanded who came for dancing for treating and if possible for happiness topbooted graziers from the north swiss brokers italian drovers also topbooted from the south these with their subalterns in leather jerkins leather skullcaps and long oxgoads shouting in halfarticulate speech amid the inarticulate barking and bellowing apart stood potters from far saxony with their crockery in fair rows nurnberg pedlers in booths that to me seemed richer than ormuz bazaars showmen from the lago maggiore detachments of the wiener schub offscourings of vienna vociferously superintending games of chance balladsingers brayed auctioneers grew hoarse cheap new wine heuriger flowed like water still worse confounding the confusion and high over all vaulted in groundandlofty tumbling a particolored merryandrew like the genius of the place and of life itself  thus encircled by the mystery of existence under the deep heavenly firmament waited on by the four golden seasons with their vicissitudes of contribution for even grim winter brought its skatingmatches and shootingmatches its snowstorms and christmascarolsdid the child sit and learn these things were the alphabet whereby in aftertime he was to syllable and partly read the grand volume of the world what matters it whether such alphabet be in large gilt letters or in small ungilt ones so you have an eye to read it for gneschen eager to learn the very act of looking thereon was a blessedness that gilded all his existence was a bright soft element of joy out of which as in prosperos island wonder after wonder bodied itself forth to teach by charming  nevertheless i were but a vain dreamer to say that even then my felicity was perfect i had once for all come down from heaven into the earth among the rainbow colors that glowed on my horizon lay even in childhood a dark ring of care as yet no thicker than a thread and often quite overshone yet always it reappeared nay ever waxing broader and broader till in afteryears it almost overshadowed my whole canopy and threatened to engulf me in final night it was the ring of necessity whereby we are all begirt happy he for whom a kind heavenly sun brightens it into a ring of duty and plays round it with beautiful prismatic diffractions yet ever as basis and as bourn for our whole being it is there  for the first few years of our terrestrial apprenticeship we have not much work to do but boarded and lodged gratis are set down mostly to look about us over the workshop and see others work till we have understood the tools a little and can handle this and that if good passivity alone and not good passivity and good activity together were the thing wanted then was my early position favorable beyond the most in all that respects openness of sense affectionate temper ingenuous curiosity and the fostering of these what more could i have wished on the other side however things went not so well my active power thatkraft was unfavorably hemmed in of which misfortune how many traces yet abide with me in an orderly house where the litter of childrens sports is hateful enough your training is too stoical rather to bear and forbear than to make and do i was forbid much wishes in any measure bold i had to renounce everywhere a strait bond of obedience inflexibly held me down thus already freewill often came in painful collision with necessity so that my tears flowed and at seasons the child itself might taste that root of bitterness wherewith the whole fruitage of our life is mingled and tempered  in which habituation to obedience truly it was beyond measure safer to err by excess than by defect obedience is our universal duty and destiny wherein whoso will not bend must break too early and too thoroughly we cannot be trained to know that would in this world of ours is as mere zero to should and for most part as the smallest of fractions even to shall hereby was laid for me the basis of worldly discretion nay of morality itself let me not quarrel with my upbringing it was rigorous too frugal compressively secluded every way unscientific yet in that very strictness and domestic solitude might there not lie the root of deeper earnestness of the stem from which all noble fruit must grow above all how unskilful soever it was loving it was wellmeant honest whereby every deficiency was helped my kind mother for as such i must ever love the good gretchen did me one altogether invaluable service she taught me less indeed by word than by act and daily reverent look and habitude her own simple version of the christian faith andreas too attended church yet more like a paradeduty for which he in the other world expected pay with arrearsas i trust he has received but my mother with a true womans heart and fine though uncultivated sense was in the strictest acceptation religious how indestructibly the good grows and propagates itself even among the weedy entanglements of evil the highest whom i knew on earth i here saw bowed down with awe unspeakable before a higher in heaven such things especially in infancy reach inwards to the very core of your being mysteriously does a holy of holies build itself into visibility in the mysterious deeps and reverence the divinest in man springs forth undying from its mean envelopment of fear wouldst thou rather be a peasants son that knew were it never so rudely there was a god in heaven and in man or a dukes son that only knew there were twoandthirty quarters on the familycoach  to which last question we must answer beware o teufelsdrockh of spiritual pride    chapter iii pedagogy  hitherto we see young gneschen in his indivisible case of yellow serge borne forward mostly on the arms of kind nature alone seated indeed and much to his mind in the terrestrial workshop but except his soft hazel eyes which we doubt not already gleamed with a still intelligence called upon for little voluntary movement there hitherto accordingly his aspect is rather generic that of an incipient philosopher and poet in the abstract perhaps it would puzzle herr heuschrecke himself to say wherein the special doctrine of clothes is as yet foreshadowed or betokened for with gneschen as with others the man may indeed stand pictured in the boy at least all the pigments are there yet only some half of the man stands in the child or young boy namely his passive endowment not his active the more impatient are we to discover what figure he cuts in this latter capacity how when to use his own words he understands the tools a little and can handle this or that he will proceed to handle it  here however may be the place to state that in much of our philosophers history there is something of an almost hindoo character nay perhaps in that so wellfostered and every way excellent passivity of his which with no free development of the antagonist activity distinguished his childhood we may detect the rudiments of much that in after days and still in these present days astonishes the world for the shallowsighted teufelsdrockh is oftenest a man without activity of any kind a noman for the deepsighted again a man with activity almost superabundant yet so spiritual closehidden enigmatic that no mortal can foresee its explosions or even when it has exploded so much as ascertain its significance a dangerous difficult temper for the modern european above all disadvantageous in the hero of a biography now as heretofore it will behoove the editor of these pages were it never so unsuccessfully to do his endeavor  among the earliest tools of any complicacy which a man especially a man of letters gets to handle are his classbooks on this portion of his history teufelsdrockh looks down professedly as indifferent reading he cannot remember ever to have learned so perhaps had it by nature he says generally of the insignificant portion of my education which depended on schools there need almost no notice be taken i learned what others learn and kept it stored by in a corner of my head seeing as yet no manner of use in it my schoolmaster a downbent brokenhearted underfoot martyr as others of that guild are did little for me except discover that he could do little he good soul pronounced me a genius fit for the learned professions and that i must be sent to the gymnasium and one day to the university meanwhile what printed thing soever i could meet with i read my very copper pocketmoney i laid out on stallliterature which as it accumulated i with my own hands sewed into volumes by this means was the young head furnished with a considerable miscellany of things and shadows of things history in authentic fragments lay mingled with fabulous chimeras wherein also was reality and the whole not as dead stuff but as living pabulum tolerably nutritive for a mind as yet so peptic  that the entepfuhl schoolmaster judged well we now know indeed already in the youthful gneschen with all his outward stillness there may have been manifest an inward vivacity that promised much symptoms of a spirit singularly open thoughtful almost poetical thus to say nothing of his suppers on the orchardwall and other phenomena of that earlier period have many readers of these pages stumbled in their twelfth year on such reflections as the following it struck me much as i sat by the kuhbach one silent noontide and watched it flowing gurgling to think how this same streamlet had flowed and gurgled through all changes of weather and of fortune from beyond the earliest date of history yes probably on the morning when joshua forded jordan even as at the midday when caesar doubtless with difficulty swam the nile yet kept his commentaries drythis little kuhbach assiduous as tiber eurotas or siloa was murmuring on across the wilderness as yet unnamed unseen here too as in the euphrates and the ganges is a vein or veinlet of the grand worldcirculation of waters which with its atmospheric arteries has lasted and lasts simply with the world thou fool nature alone is antique and the oldest art a mushroom that idle crag thou sittest on is six thousand years of age in which little thought as in a little fountain may there not lie the beginning of those wellnigh unutterable meditations on the grandeur and mystery of time and its relation to eternity which play such a part in this philosophy of clothes  over his gymnasic and academic years the professor by no means lingers so lyrical and joyful as over his childhood green sunny tracts there are still but intersected by bitter rivulets of tears here and there stagnating into sour marshes of discontent with my first view of the hinterschlag gymnasium writes he my evil days began well do i still remember the red sunny whitsuntide morning when trotting full of hope by the side of father andreas i entered the main street of the place and saw its steepleclock then striking eight and schuldthurm jail and the aproned or disaproned burghers moving in to breakfast a little dog in mad terror was rushing past for some human imps had tied a tin kettle to its tail thus did the agonized creature loudjingling career through the whole length of the borough and become notable enough fit emblem of many a conquering hero to whom fate wedding fantasy to sense as it often elsewhere does has malignantly appended a tin kettle of ambition to chase him on which the faster he runs urges him the faster the more loudly and more foolishly fit emblem also of much that awaited myself in that mischievous den as in the world whereof it was a portion and epitome  alas the kind beechrows of entepfuhl were hidden in the distance i was among strangers harshly at best indifferently disposed towards me the young heart felt for the first time quite orphaned and alone his schoolfellows as is usual persecuted him they were boys he says mostly rude boys and obeyed the impulse of rude nature which bids the deerherd fall upon any stricken hart the duckflock put to death any brokenwinged brother or sister and on all hands the strong tyrannize over the weak he admits that though perhaps in an unusual degree morally courageous he succeeded ill in battle and would fain have avoided it a result as would appear owing less to his small personal stature for in passionate seasons he was incredibly nimble than to his virtuous principles if it was disgraceful to be beaten says he it was only a shade less disgraceful to have so much as fought thus was i drawn two ways at once and in this important element of schoolhistory the warelement had little but sorrow on the whole that same excellent passivity so notable in teufelsdrockhs childhood is here visibly enough again getting nourishment he wept often indeed to such a degree that he was nicknamed der weinende the tearful which epithet till towards his thirteenth year was indeed not quite unmerited only at rare intervals did the young soul burst forth into fireeyed rage and with a stormfulness ungestum under which the boldest quailed assert that he too had rights of man or at least of mankin in all which who does not discern a fine flowertree and cinnamontree of genius nigh choked among pumpkins reedgrass and ignoble shrubs and forced if it would live to struggle upwards only and not outwards into a height quite sickly and disproportioned to its breadth  we find moreover that his greek and latin were mechanically taught hebrew scarce even mechanically much else which they called history cosmography philosophy and so forth no better than not at all so that except inasmuch as nature was still busy and he himself went about as was of old his wont among the craftsmens workshops there learning many things and farther lighted on some small store of curious reading in hans wachtel the coopers house where he lodgedhis time it would appear was utterly wasted which facts the professor has not yet learned to look upon with any contentment indeed throughout the whole of this bag scorpio where we now are and often in the following bag he shows himself unusually animated on the matter of education and not without some touch of what we might presume to be anger  my teachers says he were hidebound pedants without knowledge of mans nature or of boys or of aught save their lexicons and quarterly accountbooks innumerable dead vocables no dead language for they themselves knew no language they crammed into us and called it fostering the growth of mind how can an inanimate mechanical gerundgrinder the like of whom will in a subsequent century be manufactured at nurnberg out of wood and leather foster the growth of anything much more of mind which grows not like a vegetable by having its roots littered with etymological compost but like a spirit by mysterious contact of spirit thought kindling itself at the fire of living thought how shall he give kindling in whose own inward man there is no live coal but all is burnt out to a dead grammatical cinder the hinterschlag professors knew syntax enough and of the human soul thus much that it had a faculty called memory and could be acted on through the muscular integument by appliance of birchrods  alas so is it everywhere so will it ever be till the hodman is discharged or reduced to hodbearing and an architect is hired and on all hands fitly encouraged till communities and individuals discover not without surprise that fashioning the souls of a generation by knowledge can rank on a level with blowing their bodies to pieces by gunpowder that with generals and fieldmarshals for killing there should be worldhonored dignitaries and were it possible true godordained priests for teaching but as yet though the soldier wears openly and even parades his butcheringtool nowhere far as i have travelled did the schoolmaster make show of his instructingtool nay were he to walk abroad with birch girt on thigh as if he therefrom expected honor would there not among the idler class perhaps a certain levity be excited  in the third year of this gymnasic period father andreas seems to have died the young scholar otherwise so maltreated saw himself for the first time clad outwardly in sables and inwardly in quite inexpressible melancholy the dark bottomless abyss that lies under our feet had yawned open the pale kingdoms of death with all their innumerable silent nations and generations stood before him the inexorable word never now first showed its meaning my mother wept and her sorrow got vent but in my heart there lay a whole lake of tears pent up in silent desolation nevertheless the unworn spirit is strong life is so healthful that it even finds nourishment in death these stern experiences planted down by memory in my imagination rose there to a whole cypressforest sad but beautiful waving with not unmelodious sighs in dark luxuriance in the hottest sunshine through long years of youthas in manhood also it does and will do for i have now pitched my tent under a cypresstree the tomb is now my inexpugnable fortress ever close by the gate of which i look upon the hostile armaments and pains and penalties of tyrannous life placidly enough and listen to its loudest threatenings with a still smile o ye loved ones that already sleep in the noiseless bed of rest whom in life i could only weep for and never help and ye who widescattered still toil lonely in the monsterbearing desert dyeing the flinty ground with your bloodyet a little while and we shall all meet there and our mothers bosom will screen us all and oppressions harness and sorrows firewhip and all the gehenna bailiffs that patrol and inhabit evervexed time cannot thenceforth harm us any more  close by which rather beautiful apostrophe lies a labored character of the deceased andreas futteral of his natural ability his deserts in life as prussian sergeant with long historical inquiries into the genealogy of the futteral family here traced back as far as henry the fowler the whole of which we pass over not without astonishment it only concerns us to add that now was the time when mother gretchen revealed to her fosterson that he was not at all of this kindred or indeed of any kindred having come into historical existence in the way already known to us thus was i doubly orphaned says he bereft not only of possession but even of remembrance sorrow and wonder here suddenly united could not but produce abundant fruit such a disclosure in such a season struck its roots through my whole nature ever till the years of mature manhood it mingled with my whole thoughts was as the stem whereon all my daydreams and nightdreams grew a certain poetic elevation yet also a corresponding civic depression it naturally imparted i was like no other in which fixed idea leading sometimes to highest and oftener to frightfullest results may there not lie the first spring of tendencies which in my life have become remarkable enough as in birth so in action speculation and social position my fellows are perhaps not numerous   in the bag sagittarius as we at length discover teufelsdrockh has become a university man though how when or of what quality will nowhere disclose itself with the smallest certainty few things in the way of confusion and capricious indistinctness can now surprise our readers not even the total want of dates almost without parallel in a biographical work so enigmatic so chaotic we have always found and must always look to find these scattered leaves in sagittarius however teufelsdrockh begins to show himself even more than usually sibylline fragments of all sorts scraps of regular memoir collegeexercises programs professional testimoniums milkscores torn billets sometimes to appearance of an amatory cast all blown together as if by merest chance henceforth bewilder the sane historian to combine any picture of these university and the subsequent years much more to decipher therein any illustrative primordial elements of the clothesphilosophy becomes such a problem as the reader may imagine  so much we can see darkly as through the foliage of some wavering thicket a youth of no common endowment who has passed happily through childhood less happily yet still vigorously through boyhood now at length perfect in dead vocables and set down as he hopes by the living fountain there to superadd ideas and capabilities from such fountain he draws diligently thirstily yet never or seldom with his whole heart for the water nowise suits his palate discouragements entanglements aberrations are discoverable or supposable nor perhaps are even pecuniary distresses wanting for the good gretchen who in spite of advices from not disinterested relatives has sent him hither must after a time withdraw her willing but too feeble hand nevertheless in an atmosphere of poverty and manifold chagrin the humor of that young soul what character is in him first decisively reveals itself and like strong sunshine in weeping skies gives out variety of colors some of which are prismatic thus with the aid of time and of what time brings has the stripling diogenes teufelsdrockh waxed into manly stature and into so questionable an aspect that we ask with new eagerness how he specially came by it and regret anew that there is no more explicit answer certain of the intelligible and partially significant fragments which are few in number shall be extracted from that limbo of a paperbag and presented with the usual preparation  as if in the bag scorpio teufelsdrockh had not already expectorated his antipedagogic spleen as if from the name sagittarius he had thought himself called upon to shoot arrows we here again fall in with such matter as this the university where i was educated still stands vivid enough in my remembrance and i know its name well which name however i from tenderness to existing interests and persons shall in nowise divulge it is my painful duty to say that out of england and spain ours was the worst of all hitherto discovered universities this is indeed a time when right education is as nearly as may be impossible however in degrees of wrongness there is no limit nay i can conceive a worse system than that of the nameless itself as poisoned victual may be worse than absolute hunger  it is written when the blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch wherefore in such circumstances may it not sometimes be safer if both leader and led simplysit still had you anywhere in crim tartary walled in a square enclosure furnished it with a small illchosen library and then turned loose into it eleven hundred christian striplings to tumble about as they listed from three to seven years certain persons under the title of professors being stationed at the gates to declare aloud that it was a university and exact considerable admissionfeesyou had not indeed in mechanical structure yet in spirit and result some imperfect resemblance of our high seminary i say imperfect for if our mechanical structure was quite other so neither was our result altogether the same unhappily we were not in crim tartary but in a corrupt european city full of smoke and sin moreover in the middle of a public which without far costlier apparatus than that of the square enclosure and declaration aloud you could not be sure of gulling  gullible however by fit apparatus all publics are and gulled with the most surprising profit towards anything like a statistics of imposture indeed little as yet has been done with a strange indifference our economists nigh buried under tables for minor branches of industry have altogether overlooked the grand allovertopping hypocrisy branch as if our whole arts of puffery of quackery priestcraft kingcraft and the innumerable other crafts and mysteries of that genus had not ranked in productive industry at all can any one for example so much as say what moneys in literature and shoeblacking are realized by actual instruction and actual jet polish what by fictitiouspersuasive proclamation of such specifying in distinct items the distributions circulations disbursements incomings of said moneys with the smallest approach to accuracy but to ask how far in all the several infinitely complected departments of social business in government education in manual commercial intellectual fabrication of every sort mans want is supplied by true ware how far by the mere appearance of true warein other words to what extent by what methods with what effects in various times and countries deception takes the place of wages of performance here truly is an inquiry big with results for the future time but to which hitherto only the vaguest answer can be given if for the present in our europe we estimate the ratio of ware to appearance of ware so high even as at one to a hundred which considering the wages of a pope russian autocrat or english gamepreserver is probably not far from the markwhat almost prodigious saving may there not be anticipated as the statistics of imposture advances and so the manufacturing of shams that of realities rising into clearer and clearer distinction therefrom gradually declines and at length becomes all but wholly unnecessary  this for the coming golden ages what i had to remark for the present brazen one is that in several provinces as in education polity religion where so much is wanted and indispensable and so little can as yet be furnished probably imposture is of sanative anodyne nature and mans gullibility not his worst blessing suppose your sinews of war quite broken i mean your military chest insolvent forage all but exhausted and that the whole army is about to mutiny disband and cut your and each others throatthen were it not well could you as if by miracle pay them in any sort of fairymoney feed them on coagulated water or mere imagination of meat whereby till the real supply came up they might be kept together and quiet such perhaps was the aim of nature who does nothing without aim in furnishing her favorite man with this his so omnipotent or rather omnipatient talent of being gulled  how beautifully it works with a little mechanism nay almost makes mechanism for itself these professors in the nameless lived with ease with safety by a mere reputation constructed in past times and then too with no great effort by quite another class of persons which reputation like a strong briskgoing undershot wheel sunk into the general current bade fair with only a little annual repainting on their part to hold long together and of its own accord assiduously grind for them happy that it was so for the millers they themselves needed not to work their attempts at working at what they called educating now when i look back on it fill me with a certain mute admiration  besides all this we boasted ourselves a rational university in the highest degree hostile to mysticism thus was the young vacant mind furnished with much talk about progress of the species dark ages prejudice and the like so that all were quickly enough blown out into a state of windy argumentativeness whereby the better sort had soon to end in sick impotent scepticism the worser sort explode crepiren in finished selfconceit and to all spiritual intents become deadbut this too is portion of mankinds lot if our era is the era of unbelief why murmur under it is there not a better coming nay come as in longdrawn systole and longdrawn diastole must the period of faith alternate with the period of denial must the vernal growth the summer luxuriance of all opinions spiritual representations and creations be followed by and again follow the autumnal decay the winter dissolution for man lives in time has his whole earthly being endeavor and destiny shaped for him by time only in the transitory timesymbol is the evermotionless eternity we stand on made manifest and yet in such winterseasons of denial it is for the noblerminded perhaps a comparative misery to have been born and to be awake and work and for the duller a felicity if like hibernating animals safelodged in some salamanca university or sybaris city or other superstitious or voluptuous castle of indolence they can slumber through in stupid dreams and only awaken when the loudroaring hailstorms have all alone their work and to our prayers and martyrdoms the new spring has been vouchsafed  that in the environment here mysteriously enough shadowed forth teufelsdrockh must have felt ill at ease cannot be doubtful the hungry young he says looked up to their spiritual nurses and for food were bidden eat the eastwind what vain jargon of controversial metaphysic etymology and mechanical manipulation falsely named science was current there i indeed learned better perhaps than the most among eleven hundred christian youths there will not be wanting some eleven eager to learn by collision with such a certain warmth a certain polish was communicated by instinct and happy accident i took less to rioting renommiren than to thinking and reading which latter also i was free to do nay from the chaos of that library i succeeded in fishing up more books perhaps than had been known to the very keepers thereof the foundation of a literary life was hereby laid i learned on my own strength to read fluently in almost all cultivated languages on almost all subjects and sciences farther as man is ever the prime object to man already it was my favorite employment to read character in speculation and from the writing to construe the writer a certain groundplan of human nature and life began to fashion itself in me wondrous enough now when i look back on it for my whole universe physical and spiritual was as yet a machine however such a conscious recognized groundplan the truest i had was beginning to be there and by additional experiments might be corrected and indefinitely extended  thus from poverty does the strong educe nobler wealth thus in the destitution of the wild desert does our young ishmael acquire for himself the highest of all possessions that of selfhelp nevertheless a desert this was waste and howling with savage monsters teufelsdrockh gives us long details of his feverparoxysms of doubt his inquiries concerning miracles and the evidences of religious faith and how in the silent nightwatches still darker in his heart than over sky and earth he has cast himself before the allseeing and with audible prayers cried vehemently for light for deliverance from death and the grave not till after long years and unspeakable agonies did the believing heart surrender sink into spellbound sleep under the nightmare unbelief and in this hagridden dream mistake gods fair living world for a pallid vacant hades and extinct pandemonium but through such purgatory pain continues he it is appointed us to pass first must the dead letter of religion own itself dead and drop piecemeal into dust if the living spirit of religion freed from this its charnelhouse is to arise on us newborn of heaven and with new healing under its wings  to which purgatory pains seemingly severe enough if we add a liberal measure of earthly distresses want of practical guidance want of sympathy want of money want of hope and all this in the fervid season of youth so exaggerated in imagining so boundless in desires yet here so poor in meansdo we not see a strong incipient spirit oppressed and overloaded from without and from within the fire of genius struggling up among fuelwood of the greenest and as yet with more of bitter vapor than of clear flame  from various fragments of letters and other documentary scraps it is to be inferred that teufelsdrockh isolated shy retiring as he was had not altogether escaped notice certain established men are aware of his existence and if stretching out no helpful hand have at least their eyes on him he appears though in dreary enough humor to be addressing himself to the profession of lawwhereof indeed the world has since seen him a public graduate but omitting these broken unsatisfactory thrums of economical relation let us present rather the following small thread of moral relation and therewith the reader for himself weaving it in at the right place conclude our dim arraspicture of these university years  here also it was that i formed acquaintance with herr towgood or as it is perhaps better written herr toughgut a young person of quality von adel from the interior parts of england he stood connected by blood and hospitality with the counts von zahdarm in this quarter of germany to which noble family i likewise was by his means with all friendliness brought near towgood had a fair talent unspeakably illcultivated with considerable humor of character and bating his total ignorance for he knew nothing except boxing and a little grammar showed less of that aristocratic impassivity and silent fury than for most part belongs to travellers of his nation to him i owe my first practical knowledge of the english and their ways perhaps also something of the partiality with which i have ever since regarded that singular people towgood was not without an eye could he have come at any light invited doubtless by the presence of the zahdarm family he had travelled hither in the almost frantic hope of perfecting his studies he whose studies had as yet been those of infancy hither to a university where so much as the notion of perfection not to say the effort after it no longer existed often we would condole over the hard destiny of the young in this era how after all our toil we were to be turned out into the world with beards on our chins indeed but with few other attributes of manhood no existing thing that we were trained to act on nothing that we could so much as believe how has our head on the outside a polished hat would towgood exclaim and in the inside vacancy or a froth of vocables and attorneylogic at a small cost men are educated to make leather into shoes but at a great cost what am i educated to make by heaven brother what i have already eaten and worn as i came thus far would endow a considerable hospital of incurablesman indeed i would answer has a digestive faculty which must be kept working were it even partly by stealth but as for our miseducation make not bad worse waste not the time yet ours in trampling on thistles because they have yielded us no figs frisch zu bruder here are books and we have brains to read them here is a whole earth and a whole heaven and we have eyes to look on them frisch zu  often also our talk was gay not without brilliancy and even fire we looked out on life with its strange scaffolding where all at once harlequins dance and men are beheaded and quartered motley not unterrific was the aspect but we looked on it like brave youths for myself these were perhaps my most genial hours towards this young warmhearted strongheaded and wrongheaded herr towgood i was even near experiencing the now obsolete sentiment of friendship yes foolish heathen that i was i felt that under certain conditions i could have loved this man and taken him to my bosom and been his brother once and always by degrees however i understood the new time and its wants if mans soul is indeed as in the finnish language and utilitarian philosophy a kind of stomach what else is the true meaning of spiritual union but an eating together thus we instead of friends are dinnerguests and here as elsewhere have cast away chimeras  so ends abruptly as is usual and enigmatically this little incipient romance what henceforth becomes of the brave herr towgood or toughgut he has dived under in the autobiographical chaos and swims we see not where does any reader in the interior parts of england know of such a man    chapter iv getting under way  thus nevertheless writes our autobiographer apparently as quitting college was there realized somewhat namely i diogenes teufelsdrockh a visible temporary figure zeitbild occupying some cubic feet of space and containing within it forces both physical and spiritual hopes passions thoughts the whole wondrous furniture in more or less perfection belonging to that mystery a man capabilities there were in me to give battle in some small degree against the great empire of darkness does not the very ditcher and delver with his spade extinguish many a thistle and puddle and so leave a little order where he found the opposite nay your very daymoth has capabilities in this kind and ever organizes something into its own body if no otherwise which was before inorganic and of mute dead air makes living music though only of the faintest by humming  how much more one whose capabilities are spiritual who has learned or begun learning the grand thaumaturgic art of thought thaumaturgic i name it for hitherto all miracles have been wrought thereby and henceforth innumerable will be wrought whereof we even in these days witness some of the poets and prophets inspired message and how it makes and unmakes whole worlds i shall forbear mention but cannot the dullest hear steamengines clanking around him has he not seen the scottish brasssmiths idea and this but a mechanical one travelling on firewings round the cape and across two oceans and stronger than any other enchanters familiar on all hands unweariedly fetching and carrying at home not only weaving cloth but rapidly enough overturning the whole old system of society and for feudalism and preservation of the game preparing us by indirect but sure methods industrialism and the government of the wisest truly a thinking man is the worst enemy the prince of darkness can have every time such a one announces himself i doubt not there runs a shudder through the nether empire and new emissaries are trained with new tactics to if possible entrap him and hoodwink and handcuff him  with such high vocation had i too as denizen of the universe been called unhappy it is however that though born to the amplest sovereignty in this way with no less than sovereign right of peace and war against the timeprince zeitfurst or devil and all his dominions your coronationceremony costs such trouble your sceptre is so difficult to get at or even to get eye on  by which last wiredrawn similitude does teufelsdrockh mean no more than that young men find obstacles in what we call getting under way not what i have continues he but what i do is my kingdom to each is given a certain inward talent a certain outward environment of fortune to each by wisest combination of these two a certain maximum of capability but the hardest problem were ever this first to find by study of yourself and of the ground you stand on what your combined inward and outward capability specially is for alas our young soul is all budding with capabilities and we see not yet which is the main and true one always too the new man is in a new time under new conditions his course can be the facsimile of no prior one but is by its nature original and then how seldom will the outward capability fit the inward though talented wonderfully enough we are poor unfriended dyspeptical bashful nay what is worse than all we are foolish thus in a whole imbroglio of capabilities we go stupidly groping about to grope which is ours and often clutch the wrong one in this mad work must several years of our small term be spent till the purblind youth by practice acquire notions of distance and become a seeing man nay many so spend their whole term and in evernew expectation evernew disappointment shift from enterprise to enterprise and from side to side till at length as exasperated striplings of threescoreandten they shift into their last enterprise that of getting buried  such since the most of us are too ophthalmic would be the general fate were it not that one thing saves us our hunger for on this ground as the prompt nature of hunger is well known must a prompt choice be made hence have we with wise foresight indentures and apprenticeships for our irrational young whereby in due season the vague universality of a man shall find himself readymoulded into a specific craftsman and so thenceforth work with much or with little waste of capability as it may be yet not with the worst waste that of time nay even in matters spiritual since the spiritual artist too is born blind and does not like certain other creatures receive sight in nine days but far later sometimes neveris it not well that there should be what we call professions or breadstudies brodzwecke preappointed us here circling like the ginhorse for whom partial or total blindness is no evil the breadartist can travel contentedly round and round still fancying that it is forward and forward and realize much for himself victual for the world an additional horses power in the grand cornmill or hempmill of economic society for me too had such a leadingstring been provided only that it proved a neckhalter and had nigh throttled me till i broke it off then in the words of ancient pistol did the world generally become mine oyster which i by strength or cunning was to open as i would and could almost had i deceased fast war ich umgekommen so obstinately did it continue shut  we see here significantly foreshadowed the spirit of much that was to befall our autobiographer the historical embodiment of which as it painfully takes shape in his life lies scattered in dim disastrous details through this bag pisces and those that follow a young man of high talent and high though still temper like a young mettled colt breaks off his neckhalter and bounds forth from his peculiar manger into the wide world which alas he finds all rigorously fenced in richest cloverfields tempt his eye but to him they are forbidden pasture either pining in progressive starvation he must stand or in mad exasperation must rush to and fro leaping against sheer stonewalls which he cannot leap over which only lacerate and lame him till at last after thousand attempts and endurances he as if by miracle clears his way not indeed into luxuriant and luxurious clover yet into a certain bosky wilderness where existence is still possible and freedom though waited on by scarcity is not without sweetness in a word teufelsdrockh having thrown up his legal profession finds himself without landmark of outward guidance whereby his previous want of decided belief or inward guidance is frightfully aggravated necessity urges him on time will not stop neither can he a son of time wild passions without solacement wild faculties without employment ever vex and agitate him he too must enact that stern monodrama no object and no rest must front its successive destinies work through to its catastrophe and deduce therefrom what moral he can  yet let us be just to him let us admit that his neckhalter sat nowise easy on him that he was in some degree forced to break it off if we look at the young mans civic position in this nameless capital as he emerges from its nameless university we can discern well that it was far from enviable his first lawexamination he has come through triumphantly and can even boast that the examen rigorosum need not have frightened him but though he is hereby an auscultator of respectability what avails it there is next to no employment to be had neither for a youth without connections is the process of expectation very hopeful in itself nor for one of his disposition much cheered from without my fellow auscultators he says were auscultators they dressed and digested and talked articulate words other vitality showed they almost none small speculation in those eyes that they did glare withal sense neither for the high nor for the deep nor for aught human or divine save only for the faintest scent of coming preferment in which words indicating a total estrangement on the part of teufelsdrockh may there not also lurk traces of a bitterness as from wounded vanity doubtless these prosaic auscultators may have sniffed at him with his strange ways and tried to hate and what was much more impossible to despise him friendly communion in any case there could not be already has the young teufelsdrockh left the other young geese and swims apart though as yet uncertain whether he himself is cygnet or gosling  perhaps too what little employment he had was performed ill at best unpleasantly great practical method and expertness he may brag of but is there not also great practical pride though deephidden only the deeperseated so shy a man can never have been popular we figure to ourselves how in those days he may have played strange freaks with his independence and so forth do not his own words betoken as much like a very young person i imagined it was with work alone and not also with folly and sin in myself and others that i had been appointed to struggle be this as it may his progress from the passive auscultatorship towards any active assessorship is evidently of the slowest by degrees those same established men once partially inclined to patronize him seem to withdraw their countenance and give him up as a man of genius against which procedure he in these papers loudly protests as if says he the higher did not presuppose the lower as if he who can fly into heaven could not also walk post if he resolved on it but the world is an old woman and mistakes any gilt farthing for a gold coin whereby being often cheated she will thenceforth trust nothing but the common copper  how our winged skymessenger unaccepted as a terrestrial runner contrived in the mean while to keep himself from flying skyward without return is not too clear from these documents good old gretchen seems to have vanished from the scene perhaps from the earth other horn of plenty or even of parsimony nowhere flows for him so that the prompt nature of hunger being well known we are not without our anxiety from private tuition in never so many languages and sciences the aid derivable is small neither to use his own words does the young adventurer hitherto suspect in himself any literary gift but at best earns breadandwater wages by his wide faculty of translation nevertheless continues he that i subsisted is clear for you find me even now alive which fact however except upon the principle of our truehearted kind old proverb that there is always life for a living one we must profess ourselves unable to explain  certain landlords bills and other economic documents bearing the mark of settlement indicate that he was not without money but like an independent hearthholder if not householder paid his way here also occur among many others two little mutilated notes which perhaps throw light on his condition the first has now no date or writers name but a huge blot and runs to this effect the inkblot tied down by previous promise cannot except by best wishes forward the herr teufelsdrockhs views on the assessorship in question and sees himself under the cruel necessity of forbearing for the present what were otherwise his duty and joy to assist in opening the career for a man of genius on whom far higher triumphs are yet waiting the other is on gilt paper and interests us like a sort of epistolary mummy now dead yet which once lived and beneficently worked we give it in the original herr teufelsdrockh wird von der frau grafinn auf donnerstag zum aesthetischen thee schonstens eingeladen  thus in answer to a cry for solid pudding whereof there is the most urgent need comes epigrammatically enough the invitation to a wash of quite fluid aesthetic tea how teufelsdrockh now at actual handgrips with destiny herself may have comported himself among these musical and literary dilettanti of both sexes like a hungry lion invited to a feast of chickenweed we can only conjecture perhaps in expressive silence and abstinence otherwise if the lion in such case is to feast at all it cannot be on the chickenweed but only on the chickens for the rest as this frau grafinn dates from the zahdarm house she can be no other than the countess and mistress of the same whose intellectual tendencies and goodwill to teufelsdrockh whether on the footing of herr towgood or on his own footing are hereby manifest that some sort of relation indeed continued for a time to connect our autobiographer though perhaps feebly enough with this noble house we have elsewhere express evidence doubtless if he expected patronage it was in vain enough for him if he here obtained occasional glimpses of the great world from which we at one time fancied him to have been always excluded the zahdarms says he lived in the soft sumptuous garniture of aristocracy whereto literature and art attracted and attached from without were to serve as the handsomest fringing it was to the gnadigen frau her ladyship that this latter improvement was due assiduously she gathered dexterously she fitted on what fringing was to be had lace or cobweb as the place yielded was teufelsdrockh also a fringe of lace or cobweb or promising to be such with his excellenz the count continues he i have more than once had the honor to converse chiefly on general affairs and the aspect of the world which he though now past middle life viewed in no unfavorable light finding indeed except the outrooting of journalism die auszurottende journalistik little to desiderate therein on some points as his excellenz was not uncholeric i found it more pleasant to keep silence besides his occupation being that of owning land there might be faculties enough which as superfluous for such use were little developed in him  that to teufelsdrockh the aspect of the world was nowise so faultless and many things besides the outrooting of journalism might have seemed improvements we can readily conjecture with nothing but a barren auscultatorship from without and so many mutinous thoughts and wishes from within his position was no easy one the universe he says was as a mighty sphinxriddle which i knew so little of yet must rede or be devoured in red streaks of unspeakable grandeur yet also in the blackness of darkness was life to my toounfurnished thought unfolding itself a strange contradiction lay in me and i as yet knew not the solution of it knew not that spiritual music can spring only from discords set in harmony that but for evil there were no good as victory is only possible by battle  i have heard affirmed surely in jest observes he elsewhere by not unphilanthropic persons that it were a real increase of human happiness could all young men from the age of nineteen be covered under barrels or rendered otherwise invisible and there left to follow their lawful studies and callings till they emerged sadder and wiser at the age of twentyfive with which suggestion at least as considered in the light of a practical scheme i need scarcely say that i nowise coincide nevertheless it is plausibly urged that as young ladies madchen are to mankind precisely the most delightful in those years so young gentlemen bubchen do then attain their maximum of detestability such gawks gecken are they and foolish peacocks and yet with such a vulturous hunger for selfindulgence so obstinate obstreperous vainglorious in all senses so froward and so forward no mortals endeavor or attainment will in the smallest content the as yet unendeavoring unattaining young gentleman but he could make it all infinitely better were it worthy of him life everywhere is the most manageable matter simple as a question in the ruleofthree multiply your second and third term together divide the product by the first and your quotient will be the answerwhich you are but an ass if you cannot come at the booby has not yet found out by any trial that do what one will there is ever a cursed fraction oftenest a decimal repeater and no net integer quotient so much as to be thought of  in which passage does not there lie an implied confession that teufelsdrockh himself besides his outward obstructions had an inward still greater to contend with namely a certain temporary youthful yet still afflictive derangement of head alas on the former side alone his case was hard enough it continues ever true says he that saturn or chronos or what we call time devours all his children only by incessant running by incessant working may you for some threescoreandten years escape him and you too he devours at last can any sovereign or holy alliance of sovereigns bid time stand still even in thought shake themselves free of time our whole terrestrial being is based on time and built of time it is wholly a movement a timeimpulse time is the author of it the material of it hence also our whole duty which is to move to workin the right direction are not our bodies and our souls in continual movement whether we will or not in a continual waste requiring a continual repair utmost satisfaction of our whole outward and inward wants were but satisfaction for a space of time thus whatso we have done is done and for us annihilated and ever must we go and do anew o timespirit how hast thou environed and imprisoned us and sunk us so deep in thy troublous dim timeelement that only in lucid moments can so much as glimpses of our upper azure home be revealed to us me however as a son of time unhappier than some others was time threatening to eat quite prematurely for strive as i might there was no good running so obstructed was the path so gyved were the feet that is to say we presume speaking in the dialect of this lower world that teufelsdrockhs whole duty and necessity was like other mens to workin the right direction and that no work was to be had whereby he became wretched enough as was natural with haggard scarcity threatening him in the distance and so vehement a soul languishing in restless inaction and forced thereby like sir hudibrass sword by rust       to eat into itself for lack      of something else to hew and hack  but on the whole that same excellent passivity as it has all along done is here again vigorously flourishing in which circumstance may we not trace the beginnings of much that now characterizes our professor and perhaps in faint rudiments the origin of the clothesphilosophy itself already the attitude he has assumed towards the world is too defensive not as would have been desirable a bold attitude of attack so far hitherto he says as i had mingled with mankind i was notable if for anything for a certain stillness of manner which as my friends often rebukingly declared did but ill express the keen ardor of my feelings i in truth regarded men with an excess both of love and of fear the mystery of a person indeed is ever divine to him that has a sense for the godlike often notwithstanding was i blamed and by halfstrangers hated for my socalled hardness harte my indifferentism towards men and the seemingly ironic tone i had adopted as my favorite dialect in conversation alas the panoply of sarcasm was but as a buckram case wherein i had striven to envelop myself that so my own poor person might live safe there and in all friendliness being no longer exasperated by wounds sarcasm i now see to be in general the language of the devil for which reason i have long since as good as renounced it but how many individuals did i in those days provoke into some degree of hostility thereby an ironic man with his sly stillness and ambuscading ways more especially an ironic young man from whom it is least expected may be viewed as a pest to society have we not seen persons of weight and name coming forward with gentlest indifference to tread such a one out of sight as an insignificancy and worm start ceilinghigh balkenhock and thence fall shattered and supine to be borne home on shutters not without indignation when he proved electric and a torpedo  alas how can a man with this devilishness of temper make way for himself in life where the first problem as teufelsdrockh too admits is to unite yourself with some one and with somewhat sich anzuschliessen division not union is written on most part of his procedure let us add too that in no great length of time the only important connection he had ever succeeded in forming his connection with the zahdarm family seems to have been paralyzed for all practical uses by the death of the not uncholeric old count this fact stands recorded quite incidentally in a certain discourse on epitaphs huddled into the present bag among so much else of which essay the learning and curious penetration are more to be approved of than the spirit his grand principle is that lapidary inscriptions of what sort soever should be historical rather than lyrical by request of that worthy noblemans survivors says he i undertook to compose his epitaph and not unmindful of my own rules produced the following which however for an alleged defect of latinity a defect never yet fully visible to myself still remains unengravenwherein we may predict there is more than the latinity that will surprise an english reader       hic jacet      philippus zaehdarm cognomine magnus      zaehdarmi comes      ex imperii concilio      velleris aurei periscelidis necnon vulturis nigri

postremum sub dato    chapter v romance  for long years writes teufelsdrockh had the poor hebrew in this egypt of an auscultatorship painfully toiled baking bricks without stubble before ever the question once struck him with entire force for whatbeym himmel for food and warmth and are food and warmth nowhere else in the whole wide universe discoverablecome of it what might i resolved to try  thus then are we to see him in a new independent capacity though perhaps far from an improved one teufelsdrockh is now a man without profession quitting the common fleet of herringbusses and whalers where indeed his leeward laggard condition was painful enough he desperately steers off on a course of his own by sextant and compass of his own unhappy teufelsdrockh though neither fleet nor traffic nor commodores pleased thee still was it not a fleet sailing in prescribed track for fixed objects above all in combination wherein by mutual guidance by all manner of loans and borrowings each could manifoldly aid the other how wilt thou sail in unknown seas and for thyself find that shorter northwest passage to thy fair spicecountry of a nowherea solitary rover on such a voyage with such nautical tactics will meet with adventures nay as we forthwith discover a certain calypsoisland detains him at the very outset and as it were falsifies and oversets his whole reckoning  if in youth writes he once the universe is majestically unveiling and everywhere heaven revealing itself on earth nowhere to the young man does this heaven on earth so immediately reveal itself as in the young maiden strangely enough in this strange life of ours it has been so appointed on the whole as i have often said a person personlichkeit is ever holy to us a certain orthodox anthropomorphism connects my me with all thees in bonds of love but it is in this approximation of the like and unlike that such heavenly attraction as between negative and positive first burns out into a flame is the pitifullest mortal person think you indifferent to us is it not rather our heartfelt wish to be made one with him to unite him to us by gratitude by admiration even by fear or failing all these unite ourselves to him but how much more in this case of the likeunlike here is conceded us the higher mystic possibility of such a union the highest in our earth thus in the conducting medium of fantasy flames forth that firedevelopment of the universal spiritual electricity which as unfolded between man and woman we first emphatically denominate love  in every wellconditioned stripling as i conjecture there already blooms a certain prospective paradise cheered by some fairest eve nor in the stately vistas and flowerage and foliage of that garden is a tree of knowledge beautiful and awful in the midst thereof wanting perhaps too the whole is but the lovelier if cherubim and a flaming sword divide it from all footsteps of men and grant him the imaginative stripling only the view not the entrance happy season of virtuous youth when shame is still an impassable celestial barrier and the sacred aircities of hope have not shrunk into the mean clayhamlets of reality and man by his nature is yet infinite and free  as for our young forlorn continues teufelsdrockh evidently meaning himself in his secluded way of life and with his glowing fantasy the more fiery that it burnt under cover as in a reverberating furnace his feeling towards the queens of this earth was and indeed is altogether unspeakable a visible divinity dwelt in them to our young friend all women were holy were heavenly as yet he but saw them flitting past in their manycolored angelplumage or hovering mute and inaccessible on the outskirts of aesthetic tea all of air they were all soul and form so lovely like mysterious priestesses in whose hand was the invisible jacobsladder whereby man might mount into very heaven that he our poor friend should ever win for himself one of these gracefuls holdenach gott how could he hope it should he not have died under it there was a certain delirious vertigo in the thought  thus was the young man if allsceptical of demons and angels such as the vulgar had once believed in nevertheless not unvisited by hosts of true skyborn who visibly and audibly hovered round him wheresoever he went and they had that religious worship in his thought though as yet it was by their mere earthly and trivial name that he named them but now if on a soul so circumstanced some actual airmaiden incorporated into tangibility and reality should cast any electric glance of kind eyes saying thereby thou too mayest love and be loved and so kindle himgood heaven what a volcanic earthquakebringing allconsuming fire were probably kindled  such a fire it afterwards appears did actually burst forth with explosions more or less vesuvian in the inner man of herr diogenes as indeed how could it fail a nature which in his own figurative style we might say had now not a little carbonized tinder of irritability with so much nitre of latent passion and sulphurous humor enough the whole lying in such hot neighborhood close by a reverberating furnace of fantasy have we not here the components of driest gunpowder ready on occasion of the smallest spark to blaze up neither in this our lifeelement are sparks anywhere wanting without doubt some angel whereof so many hovered round would one day leaving the outskirts of aesthetic tea flit higher and by electric promethean glance kindle no despicable firework happy if it indeed proved a firework and flamed off rocketwise in successive beautiful bursts of splendor each growing naturally from the other through the several stages of a happy youthful love till the whole were safely burnt out and the young soul relieved with little damage happy if it did not rather prove a conflagration and mad explosion painfully lacerating the heart itself nay perhaps bursting the heart in pieces which were death or at best bursting the thin walls of your reverberating furnace so that it rage thenceforth all unchecked among the contiguous combustibles which were madness till of the so fair and manifold internal world of our diogenes there remained nothing or only the crater of an extinct volcano  from multifarious documents in this bag capricornus and in the adjacent ones on both sides thereof it becomes manifest that our philosopher as stoical and cynical as he now looks was heartily and even frantically in love here therefore may our old doubts whether his heart were of stone or of flesh give way he loved once not wisely but too well and once only for as your congreve needs a new case or wrappage for every new rocket so each human heart can properly exhibit but one love if even one the first love which is infinite can be followed by no second like unto it in more recent years accordingly the editor of these sheets was led to regard teufelsdrockh as a man not only who would never wed but who would never even flirt whom the grandclimacteric itself and st martins summer of incipient dotage would crown with no new myrtlegarland to the professor women are henceforth pieces of art of celestial art indeed which celestial pieces he glories to survey in galleries but has lost thought of purchasing  psychological readers are not without curiosity to see how teufelsdrockh in this for him unexampled predicament demeans himself with what specialties of successive configuration splendor and color his firework blazes off small as usual is the satisfaction that such can meet with here from amid these confused masses of eulogy and elegy with their mad petrarchan and werterean ware lying madly scattered among all sorts of quite extraneous matter not so much as the fair ones name can be deciphered for without doubt the title blumine whereby she is here designated and which means simply goddess of flowers must be fictitious was her real name flora then but what was her surname or had she none of what station in life was she of what parentage fortune aspect specially by what preestablished harmony of occurrences did the lover and the loved meet one another in so wide a world how did they behave in such meeting to all which questions not unessential in a biographic work mere conjecture must for most part return answer it was appointed says our philosopher that the high celestial orbit of blumine should intersect the low sublunary one of our forlorn that he looking in her empyrean eyes should fancy the upper sphere of light was come down into this nether sphere of shadows and finding himself mistaken make noise enough  we seem to gather that she was young hazeleyed beautiful and some ones cousin highborn and of high spirit but unhappily dependent and insolvent living perhaps on the not too gracious bounty of moneyed relatives but how came the wanderer into her circle was it by the humid vehicle of aesthetic tea or by the arid one of mere business was it on the hand of herr towgood or of the gnadige frau who as an ornamental artist might sometimes like to promote flirtation especially for young cynical nondescripts to all appearance it was chiefly by accident and the grace of nature  thou fair waldschloss writes our autobiographer what stranger ever saw thee were it even an absolved auscultator officially bearing in his pocket the last relatio ex actis he would ever write but must have paused to wonder noble mansion there stoodest thou in deep mountain amphitheatre on umbrageous lawns in thy serene solitude stately massive all of granite glittering in the western sunbeams like a palace of el dorado overlaid with precious metal beautiful rose up in wavy curvature the slope of thy guardian hills of the greenest was their sward embossed with its darkbrown frets of crag or spotted by some spreading solitary tree and its shadow to the unconscious wayfarer thou wert also as an ammons temple in the libyan waste where for joy and woe the tablet of his destiny lay written well might he pause and gaze in that glance of his were prophecy and nameless forebodings  but now let us conjecture that the so presentient auscultator has handed in his relatio ex actis been invited to a glass of rhinewine and so instead of returning dispirited and athirst to his dusty townhome is ushered into the gardenhouse where sit the choicest party of dames and cavaliers if not engaged in aesthetic tea yet in trustful evening conversation and perhaps musical coffee for we hear of harps and pure voices making the stillness live scarcely it would seem is the gardenhouse inferior in respectability to the noble mansion itself embowered amid rich foliage roseclusters and the hues and odors of thousand flowers here sat that brave company in front from the wideopened doors fair outlook over blossom and bush over grove and velvet green stretching undulating onwards to the remote mountain peaks so bright so mild and everywhere the melody of birds and happy creatures it was all as if man had stolen a shelter from the suit in the bosomvesture of summer herself how came it that the wanderer advanced thither with such forecasting heart ahndungsvoll by the side of his gay host did he feel that to these soft influences his hard bosom ought to be shut that here once more fate had it in view to try him to mock him and see whether there were humor in him  next moment he finds himself presented to the party and especially by name toblumine peculiar among all dames and damosels glanced blumine there in her modesty like a star among earthly lights noblest maiden whom he bent to in body and in soul yet scarcely dared look at for the presence filled him with painful yet sweetest embarrassment  blumines was a name well known to him far and wide was the fair one heard of for her gifts her graces her caprices from all which vague colorings of rumor from the censures no less than from the praises had our friend painted for himself a certain imperious queen of hearts and blooming warm earthangel much more enchanting than your mere white heavenangels of women in whose placid veins circulates too little naphthafire herself also he had seen in public places that light yet so stately form those dark tresses shading a face where smiles and sunlight played over earnest deeps but all this he had seen only as a magic vision for him inaccessible almost without reality her sphere was too far from his how should she ever think of him o heaven how should they so much as once meet together and now that rosegoddess sits in the same circle with him the light of her eyes has smiled on him if he speak she will hear it nay who knows since the heavenly sun looks into lowest valleys but blumine herself might have aforetime noted the so unnotable perhaps from his very gainsayers as he had from hers gathered wonder gathered favor for him was the attraction the agitation mutual then pole and pole trembling towards contact when once brought into neighborhood say rather heart swelling in presence of the queen of hearts like the sea swelling when once near its moon with the wanderer it was even so as in heavenward gravitation suddenly as at the touch of a seraphs wand his whole soul is roused from its deepest recesses and all that was painful and that was blissful there dim images vague feelings of a whole past and a whole future are heaving in unquiet eddies within him  often in far less agitating scenes had our still friend shrunk forcibly together and shrouded up his tremors and flutterings of what sort soever in a safe cover of silence and perhaps of seeming stolidity how was it then that here when trembling to the core of his heart he did not sink into swoons but rose into strength into fearlessness and clearness it was his guiding genius damon that inspired him he must go forth and meet his destiny show thyself now whispered it or be forever hid thus sometimes it is even when your anxiety becomes transcendental that the soul first feels herself able to transcend it that she rises above it in fiery victory and borne on newfound wings of victory moves so calmly even because so rapidly so irresistibly always must the wanderer remember with a certain satisfaction and surprise how in this case he sat not silent but struck adroitly into the stream of conversation which thenceforth to speak with an apparent not a real vanity he may say that he continued to lead surely in those hours a certain inspiration was imparted him such inspiration as is still possible in our late era the selfsecluded unfolds himself in noble thoughts in free glowing words his soul is as one sea of light the peculiar home of truth and intellect wherein also fantasy bodies forth form after form radiant with all prismatic hues  it appears in this otherwise so happy meeting there talked one philisitine who even now to the general weariness was dominantly pouring forth philistinism philistriositaten little witting what hero was here entering to demolish him we omit the series of socratic or rather diogenic utterances not unhappy in their way whereby the monster persuaded into silence seems soon after to have withdrawn for the night of which dialectic marauder writes our hero the discomfiture was visibly felt as a benefit by most but what were all applauses to the glad smile threatening every moment to become a laugh wherewith blumine herself repaid the victor he ventured to address her she answered with attention nay what if there were a slight tremor in that silver voice what if the red glow of evening were hiding a transient blush  the conversation took a higher tone one fine thought called forth another it was one of those rare seasons when the soul expands with full freedom and man feels himself brought near to man gayly in light graceful abandonment the friendly talk played round that circle for the burden was rolled from every heart the barriers of ceremony which are indeed the laws of polite living had melted as into vapor and the poor claims of me and thee no longer parted by rigid fences now flowed softly into one another and life lay all harmonious manytinted like some fair royal champaign the sovereign and owner of which were love only such music springs from kind hearts in a kind environment of place and time and yet as the light grew more aerial on the mountaintops and the shadows fell longer over the valley some faint tone of sadness may have breathed through the heart and in whispers more or less audible reminded every one that as this bright day was drawing towards its close so likewise must the day of mans existence decline into dust and darkness and with all its sick toilings and joyful and mournful noises sink in the still eternity  to our friend the hours seemed moments holy was he and happy the words from those sweetest lips came over him like dew on thirsty grass all better feelings in his soul seemed to whisper it is good for us to be here at parting the blumines hand was in his in the balmy twilight with the kind stars above them he spoke something of meeting again which was not contradicted he pressed gently those small soft fingers and it seemed as if they were not hastily not angrily withdrawn  poor teufelsdrockh it is clear to demonstration thou art smit the queen of hearts would see a man of genius also sigh for her and there by artmagic in that preternatural hour has she bound and spellbound thee love is not altogether a delirium says he elsewhere yet has it many points in common therewith i call it rather a discerning of the infinite in the finite of the idea made real which discerning again may be either true or false either seraphic or demoniac inspiration or insanity but in the former case too as in common madness it is fantasy that superadds itself to sight on the so petty domain of the actual plants its archimedeslever whereby to move at will the infinite spiritual fantasy i might call the true heavengate and hellgate of man his sensuous life is but the small temporary stage zeitbuhne whereon thickstreaming influences from both these far yet near regions meet visibly and act tragedy and melodrama sense can support herself handsomely in most countries for some eighteenpence a day but for fantasy planets and solarsystems will not suffice witness your pyrrhus conquering the world yet drinking no better red wine than he had before alas witness also your diogenes flameclad scaling the upper heaven and verging towards insanity for prize of a highsouled brunette as if the earth held but one and not several of these  he says that in town they met again day after day like his hearts sun the blooming blumine shone on him ah a little while ago and he was yet in all darkness him what graceful holde would ever love disbelieving all things the poor youth had never learned to believe in himself withdrawn in proud timidity within his own fastnesses solitary from men yet baited by nightspectres enough he saw himself with a sad indignation constrained to renounce the fairest hopes of existence and now o now she looks on thee cried he she the fairest noblest do not her dark eyes tell thee thou art not despised the heavensmessenger all heavens blessings be hers thus did soft melodies flow through his heart tones of an infinite gratitude sweetest intimations that he also was a man that for him also unutterable joys had been provided  in free speech earnest or gay amid lambent glances laughter tears and often with the inarticulate mystic speech of music such was the element they now lived in in such a manytinted radiant aurora and by this fairest of orient lightbringers must our friend be blandished and the new apocalypse of nature enrolled to him fairest blumine and even as a star all fire and humid softness a very lightray incarnate was there so much as a fault a caprice he could have dispensed with was she not to him in very deed a morningstar did not her presence bring with it airs from heaven as from aeolian harps in the breath of dawn as from the memnons statue struck by the rosy finger of aurora unearthly music was around him and lapped him into untried balmy rest pale doubt fled away to the distance life bloomed up with happiness and hope the past then was all a haggard dream he had been in the garden of eden then and could not discern it but lo now the black walls of his prison melt away the captive is alive is free if he loved his disenchantress ach gott his whole heart and soul and life were hers but never had he named it love existence was all a feeling not yet shaped into a thought  nevertheless into a thought nay into an action it must be shaped for neither disenchanter nor disenchantress mere children of time can abide by feeling alone the professor knows not to this day how in her soft fervid bosom the lovely found determination even on hest of necessity to cut asunder these so blissful bonds he even appears surprised at the duenna cousin whoever she may have been in whose meagre hungerbitten philosophy the religion of young hearts was from the first faintly approved of we even at such distance can explain it without necromancy let the philosopher answer this one question what figure at that period was a mrs teufelsdrockh likely to make in polished society could she have driven so much as a brassbound gig or even a simple ironspring one thou foolish absolved auscultator before whom lies no prospect of capital will any yet known religion of young hearts keep the human kitchen warm pshaw thy divine blumine when she resigned herself to wed some richer shows more philosophy though but a woman of genius than thou a pretended man  our readers have witnessed the origin of this lovemania and with what royal splendor it waxes and rises let no one ask us to unfold the glories of its dominant state much less the horrors of its almost instantaneous dissolution how from such inorganic masses henceforth madder than ever as lie in these bags can even fragments of a living delineation be organized besides of what profit were it we view with a lively pleasure the gay silk montgolfier start from the ground and shoot upwards cleaving the liquid deeps till it dwindle to a luminous star but what is there to look longer on when once by natural elasticity or accident of fire it has exploded a hapless airnavigator plunging amid torn parachutes sandbags and confused wreck fast enough into the jaws of the devil suffice it to know that teufelsdrockh rose into the highest regions of the empyrean by a natural parabolic track and returned thence in a quick perpendicular one for the rest let any feeling reader who has been unhappy enough to do the like paint it out for himself considering only that if he for his perhaps comparatively insignificant mistress underwent such agonies and frenzies what must teufelsdrockhs have been with a fireheart and for a nonpareil blumine we glance merely at the final scene  one morning he found his morningstar all dimmed and duskyred the fair creature was silent absent she seemed to have been weeping alas no longer a morningstar but a troublous skyey portent announcing that the doomsday had dawned she said in a tremulous voice they were to meet no more the thunderstruck airsailor is not wanting to himself in this dread hour but what avails it we omit the passionate expostulations entreaties indignations since all was vain and not even an explanation was conceded him and hasten to the catastrophe farewell then madam said he not without sternness for his stung pride helped him she put her hand in his she looked in his face tears started to her eyes in wild audacity he clasped her to his bosom their lips were joined their two souls like two dewdrops rushed into onefor the first time and for the last thus was teufelsdrockh made immortal by a kiss and then why thenthick curtains of night rushed over his soul as rose the immeasurable crash of doom and through the ruins as of a shivered universe was he falling falling towards the abyss   chapter vi sorrows of teufelsdrockh  we have long felt that with a man like our professor matters must often be expected to take a course of their own that in so multiplex intricate a nature there might be channels both for admitting and emitting such as the psychologist had seldom noted in short that on no grand occasion and convulsion neither in the joystorm nor in the woestorm could you predict his demeanor  to our less philosophical readers for example it is now clear that the so passionate teufelsdrockh precipitated through a shivered universe in this extraordinary way has only one of three things which he can next do establish himself in bedlam begin writing satanic poetry or blow out his brains in the progress towards any of which consummations do not such readers anticipate extravagance enough breastbeating browbeating against walls lionbellowings of blasphemy and the like stampings smitings breakages of furniture if not arson itself  nowise so does teufelsdrockh deport him he quietly lifts his pilgerstab pilgrimstaff old business being soon wound up and begins a perambulation and circumambulation of the terraqueous globe curious it is indeed how with such vivacity of conception such intensity of feeling above all with these unconscionable habits of exaggeration in speech he combines that wonderful stillness of his that stoicism in external procedure thus if his sudden bereavement in this matter of the flowergoddess is talked of as a real doomsday and dissolution of nature in which light doubtless it partly appeared to himself his own nature is nowise dissolved thereby but rather is compressed closer for once as we might say a blumine by magic appliances has unlocked that shut heart of his and its hidden things rush out tumultuous boundless like genii enfranchised from their glass vial but no sooner are your magic appliances withdrawn than the strange casket of a heart springs to again and perhaps there is now no key extant that will open it for a teufelsdrockh as we remarked will not love a second time singular diogenes no sooner has that heartrending occurrence fairly taken place than he affects to regard it as a thing natural of which there is nothing more to be said one highest hope seemingly legible in the eyes of an angel had recalled him as out of deathshadows into celestial life but a gleam of tophet passed over the face of his angel he was rapt away in whirlwinds and heard the laughter of demons it was a calenture adds he whereby the youth saw green paradisegroves in the waste oceanwaters a lying vision yet not wholly a lie for he saw it but what things soever passed in him when he ceased to see it what ragings and despairings soever teufelsdrockhs soul was the scene of he has the goodness to conceal under a quite opaque cover of silence we know it well the first mad paroxysm past our brave gneschen collected his dismembered philosophies and buttoned himself together he was meek silent or spoke of the weather and the journals only by a transient knitting of those shaggy brows by some deep flash of those eyes glancing one knew not whether with teardew or with fierce firemight you have guessed what a gehenna was within that a whole satanic school were spouting though inaudibly there to consume your own choler as some chimneys consume their own smoke to keep a whole satanic school spouting if it must spout inaudibly is a negative yet no slight virtue nor one of the commonest in these times  nevertheless we will not take upon us to say that in the strange measure he fell upon there was not a touch of latent insanity whereof indeed the actual condition of these documents in capricornus and aquarius is no bad emblem his so unlimited wanderings toilsome enough are without assigned or perhaps assignable aim internal unrest seems his sole guidance he wanders wanders as if that curse of the prophet had fallen on him and he were made like unto a wheel doubtless too the chaotic nature of these paperbags aggravates our obscurity quite without note of preparation for example we come upon the following slip a peculiar feeling it is that will rise in the traveller when turning some hillrange in his desert road he descries lying far below embosomed among its groves and green natural bulwarks and all diminished to a toybox the fair town where so many souls as it were seen and yet unseen are driving their multifarious traffic its white steeple is then truly a starwardpointing finger the canopy of blue smoke seems like a sort of lifebreath for always of its own unity the soul gives unity to whatsoever it looks on with love thus does the little dwellingplace of men in itself a congeries of houses and huts become for us an individual almost a person but what thousand other thoughts unite thereto if the place has to ourselves been the arena of joyous or mournful experiences if perhaps the cradle we were rocked in still stands there if our loving ones still dwell there if our buried ones there slumber does teufelsdrockh as the wounded eagle is said to make for its own eyrie and indeed military deserters and all hunted outcast creatures turn as if by instinct in the direction of their birthlandfly first in this extremity towards his native entepfuhl but reflecting that there no help awaits him take only one wistful look from the distance and then wend elsewhither  little happier seems to be his next flight into the wilds of nature as if in her motherbosom he would seek healing so at least we incline to interpret the following notice separated from the former by some considerable space wherein however is nothing noteworthy  mountains were not new to him but rarely are mountains seen in such combined majesty and grace as here the rocks are of that sort called primitive by the mineralogists which always arrange themselves in masses of a rugged gigantic character which ruggedness however is here tempered by a singular airiness of form and softness of environment in a climate favorable to vegetation the gray cliff itself covered with lichens shoots up through a garment of foliage or verdure and white bright cottages treeshaded cluster round the everlasting granite in fine vicissitude beauty alternates with grandeur you ride through stony hollows along strait passes traversed by torrents overhung by high walls of rock now winding amid broken shaggy chasms and huge fragments now suddenly emerging into some emerald valley where the streamlet collects itself into a lake and man has again found a fair dwelling and it seems as if peace had established herself in the bosom of strength  to peace however in this vortex of existence can the son of time not pretend still less if some spectre haunt him from the past and the future is wholly a stygian darkness spectrebearing reasonably might the wanderer exclaim to himself are not the gates of this worlds happiness inexorably shut against thee hast thou a hope that is not mad nevertheless one may still murmur audibly or in the original greek if that suit thee better whoso can look on death will start at no shadows  from such meditations is the wanderers attention called outwards for now the valley closes in abruptly intersected by a huge mountain mass the stony waterworn ascent of which is not to be accomplished on horseback arrived aloft he finds himself again lifted into the evening sunset light and cannot but pause and gaze round him some moments there an upland irregular expanse of wold where valleys in complex branchings are suddenly or slowly arranging their descent towards every quarter of the sky the mountainranges are beneath your feet and folded together only the loftier summits look down here and there as on a second plain lakes also lie clear and earnest in their solitude no trace of man now visible unless indeed it were he who fashioned that little visible link of highway here as would seem scaling the inaccessible to unite province with province but sunwards lo you how it towers sheer up a world of mountains the diadem and centre of the mountain region a hundred and a hundred savage peaks in the last light of day all glowing of gold and amethyst like giant spirits of the wilderness there in their silence in their solitude even as on the night when noahs deluge first dried beautiful nay solemn was the sudden aspect to our wanderer he gazed over those stupendous masses with wonder almost with longing desire never till this hour had he known nature that she was one that she was his mother and divine and as the ruddy glow was fading into clearness in the sky and the sun had now departed a murmur of eternity and immensity of death and of life stole through his soul and he felt as if death and life were one as if the earth were not dead as if the spirit of the earth had its throne in that splendor and his own spirit were therewith holding communion  the spell was broken by a sound of carriagewheels emerging from the hidden northward to sink soon into the hidden southward came a gay baroucheandfour it was open servants and postilions wore wedding favors that happy pair then had found each other it was their marriage evening few moments brought them near du himmel it was herr towgood andblumine with slight unrecognizing salutation they passed me plunged down amid the neighboring thickets onwards to heaven and to england and i in my friend richters words i remained alone behind them with the night  were it not cruel in these circumstances here might be the place to insert an observation gleaned long ago from the great clothesvolume where it stands with quite other intent some time before smallpox was extirpated says the professor there came a new malady of the spiritual sort on europe i mean the epidemic now endemical of viewhunting poets of old date being privileged with senses had also enjoyed external nature but chiefly as we enjoy the crystal cup which holds good or bad liquor for us that is to say in silence or with slight incidental commentary never as i compute till after the sorrows of werter was there man found who would say come let us make a description having drunk the liquor come let us eat the glass of which endemic the jenner is unhappily still to seek too true  we reckon it more important to remark that the professors wanderings so far as his stoical and cynical envelopment admits us to clear insight here first take their permanent character fatuous or not that basiliskglance of the baroucheandfour seems to have withered up what little remnant of a purpose may have still lurked in him life has become wholly a dark labyrinth wherein through long years our friend flying from spectres has to stumble about at random and naturally with more haste than progress  foolish were it in us to attempt following him even from afar in this extraordinary worldpilgrimage of his the simplest record of which were clear record possible would fill volumes hopeless is the obscurity unspeakable the confusion he glides from country to country from condition to condition vanishing and reappearing no man can calculate how or where through all quarters of the world he wanders and apparently through all circles of society if in any scene perhaps difficult to fix geographically he settles for a time and forms connections be sure he will snap them abruptly asunder let him sink out of sight as private scholar privatsirender living by the grace of god in some european capital you may next find him as hadjee in the neighborhood of mecca it is an inexplicable phantasmagoria capricious quickchanging as if our traveller instead of limbs and highways had transported himself by some wishingcarpet or fortunatus hat the whole too imparted emblematically in dim multifarious tokens as that collection of streetadvertisements with only some touch of direct historical notice sparingly interspersed little lightislets in the world of haze so that from this point the professor is more of an enigma than ever in figurative language we might say he becomes not indeed a spirit yet spiritualized vaporized fact unparalleled in biography the river of his history which we have traced from its tiniest fountains and hoped to see flow onward with increasing current into the ocean here dashes itself over that terrific lovers leap and as a madfoaming cataract flies wholly into tumultuous clouds of spray low down it indeed collects again into pools and plashes yet only at a great distance and with difficulty if at all into a general stream to cast a glance into certain of those pools and plashes and trace whither they run must for a chapter or two form the limit of our endeavor  for which end doubtless those direct historical notices where they can be met with are the best nevertheless of this sort too there occurs much which with our present light it were questionable to emit teufelsdrockh vibrating everywhere between the highest and the lowest levels comes into contact with public history itself for example those conversations and relations with illustrious persons as sultan mahmoud the emperor napoleon and others are they not as yet rather of a diplomatic character than of a biographic the editor appreciating the sacredness of crowned heads nay perhaps suspecting the possible trickeries of a clothesphilosopher will eschew this province for the present a new time may bring new insight and a different duty  if we ask now not indeed with what ulterior purpose for there was none yet with what immediate outlooks at all events in what mood of mind the professor undertook and prosecuted this worldpilgrimagethe answer is more distinct than favorable a nameless unrest says he urged me forward to which the outward motion was some momentary lying solace whither should i go my loadstars were blotted out in that canopy of grim fire shone no star yet forward must i the ground burnt under me there was no rest for the sole of my foot i was alone alone ever too the strong inward longing shaped phantasms for itself towards these one after the other must i fruitlessly wander a feeling i had that for my feverthirst there was and must be somewhere a healing fountain to many fondly imagined fountains the saints wells of these days did i pilgrim to great men to great cities to great events but found there no healing in strange countries as in the wellknown in savage deserts as in the press of corrupt civilization it was ever the same how could your wanderer escape fromhis own shadow nevertheless still forward i felt as if in great haste to do i saw not what from the depths of my own heart it called to me forwards the winds and the streams and all nature sounded to me forwards ach gott i was even once for all a son of time  from which is it not clear that the internal satanic school was still active enough he says elsewhere the enchiridion of epictetus i had ever with me often as my sole rational companion and regret to mention that the nourishment it yielded was trifling thou foolish teufelsdrockh how could it else hadst thou not greek enough to understand thus much the end of man is an action and not a thought though it were the noblest  how i lived writes he once friend hast thou considered the rugged allnourishing earth as sophocles well names her how she feeds the sparrow on the housetop much more her darling man while thou stirrest and livest thou hast a probability of victual my breakfast of tea has been cooked by a tartar woman with water of the amur who wiped her earthen kettle with a horsetail i have roasted wild eggs in the sand of sahara i have awakened in paris estrapades and vienna malzleins with no prospect of breakfast beyond elemental liquid that i had my living to seek saved me from dyingby suicide in our busy europe is there not an everlasting demand for intellect in the chemical mechanical political religious educational commercial departments in pagan countries cannot one write fetishes living little knowest thou what alchemy is in an inventive soul how as with its little finger it can create provision enough for the body of a philosopher and then as with both hands create quite other than provision namely spectres to torment itself withal  poor teufelsdrockh flying with hunger always parallel to him and a whole infernal chase in his rear so that the countenance of hunger is comparatively a friends thus must he in the temper of ancient cain or of the modern wandering jewsave only that he feels himself not guilty and but suffering the pains of guiltwend to and fro with aimless speed thus must he over the whole surface of the earth by footprints write his sorrows of teufelsdrockh even as the great goethe in passionate words had to write his sorrows of werter before the spirit freed herself and he could become a man vain truly is the hope of your swiftest runner to escape from his own shadow nevertheless in these sick days when the born of heaven first descries himself about the age of twenty in a world such as ours richer than usual in two things in truths grown obsolete and trades grown obsoletewhat can the fool think but that it is all a den of lies wherein whoso will not speak lies and act lies must stand idle and despair whereby it happens that for your nobler minds the publishing of some such work of art in one or the other dialect becomes almost a necessity for what is it properly but an altercation with the devil before you begin honestly fighting him your byron publishes his sorrows of lord george in verse and in prose and copiously otherwise your bonaparte represents his sorrows of napoleon opera in an alltoo stupendous style with music of cannonvolleys and murdershrieks of a world his stagelights are the fires of conflagration his rhyme and recitative are the tramp of embattled hosts and the sound of falling citieshappier is he who like our clothesphilosopher can write such matter since it must be written on the insensible earth with his shoesoles only and also survive the writing thereof    chapter vii the everlasting no  under the strange nebulous envelopment wherein our professor has now shrouded himself no doubt but his spiritual nature is nevertheless progressive and growing for how can the son of time in any case stand still we behold him through those dim years in a state of crisis of transition his mad pilgrimings and general solution into aimless discontinuity what is all this but a mad fermentation wherefrom the fiercer it is the clearer product will one day evolve itself  such transitions are ever full of pain thus the eagle when he moults is sickly and to attain his new beak must harshly dash off the old one upon rocks what stoicism soever our wanderer in his individual acts and motions may affect it is clear that there is a hot fever of anarchy and misery raging within coruscations of which flash out as indeed how could there be other have we not seen him disappointed bemocked of destiny through long years all that the young heart might desire and pray for has been denied nay as in the last worst instance offered and then snatched away ever an excellent passivity but of useful reasonable activity essential to the former as food to hunger nothing granted till at length in this wild pilgrimage he must forcibly seize for himself an activity though useless unreasonable alas his cup of bitterness which had been filling drop by drop ever since that first ruddy morning in the hinterschlag gymnasium was at the very lip and then with that poisondrop of the towgoodandblumine business it runs over and even hisses over in a deluge of foam  he himself says once with more justness than originality men is properly speaking based upon hope he has no other possession but hope this world of his is emphatically the place of hope what then was our professors possession we see him for the present quite shut out from hope looking not into the golden orient but vaguely all round into a dim copper firmament pregnant with earthquake and tornado  alas shut out from hope in a deeper sense than we yet dream of for as he wanders wearisomely through this world he has now lost all tidings of another and higher full of religion or at least of religiosity as our friend has since exhibited himself he hides not that in those days he was wholly irreligious doubt had darkened into unbelief says he shade after shade goes grimly over your soul till you have the fixed starless tartarean black to such readers as have reflected what can be called reflecting on mans life and happily discovered in contradiction to much profitandloss philosophy speculative and practical that soul is not synonymous with stomach who understand therefore in our friends words that for mans wellbeing faith is properly the one thing needful how with it martyrs otherwise weak can cheerfully endure the shame and the cross and without it worldlings puke up their sick existence by suicide in the midst of luxury to such it will be clear that for a pure moral nature the loss of his religious belief was the loss of everything unhappy young man all wounds the crush of longcontinued destitution the stab of false friendship and of false love all wounds in thy so genial heart would have healed again had not its lifewarmth been withdrawn well might he exclaim in his wild way is there no god then but at best an absentee god sitting idle ever since the first sabbath at the outside of his universe and seeing it go has the word duty no meaning is what we call duty no divine messenger and guide but a false earthly phantasm made up of desire and fear of emanations from the gallows and from doctor grahams celestialbed happiness of an approving conscience did not paul of tarsus whom admiring men have since named saint feel that he was the chief of sinners and nero of rome jocund in spirit wohlgemuth spend much of his time in fiddling foolish wordmonger and motivegrinder who in thy logicmill hast an earthly mechanism for the godlike itself and wouldst fain grind me out virtue from the husks of pleasurei tell thee nay to the unregenerate prometheus vinctus of a man it is ever the bitterest aggravation of his wretchedness that he is conscious of virtue that he feels himself the victim not of suffering only but of injustice what then is the heroic inspiration we name virtue but some passion some bubble of the blood bubbling in the direction others profit by i know not only this i know if what thou namest happiness be our true aim then are we all astray with stupidity and sound digestion man may front much but what in these dull unimaginative days are the terrors of conscience to the diseases of the liver not on morality but on cookery let us build our stronghold there brandishing our fryingpan as censer let us offer sweet incense to the devil and live at ease on the fat things he has provided for his elect  thus has the bewildered wanderer to stand as so many have done shouting question after question into the sibylcave of destiny and receive no answer but an echo it is all a grim desert this oncefair world of his wherein is heard only the howling of wild beasts or the shrieks of despairing hatefilled men and no pillar of cloud by day and no pillar of fire by night any longer guides the pilgrim to such length has the spirit of inquiry carried him but what boots it was thuts cries he it is but the common lot in this era not having come to spiritual majority prior to the siecle de louis quinze and not being born purely a loghead dummkopf  thou hadst no other outlook the whole world is like thee sold to unbelief their old temples of the godhead which for long have not been rainproof crumble down and men ask now where is the godhead our eyes never saw him  pitiful enough were it for all these wild utterances to call our diogenes wicked unprofitable servants as we all are perhaps at no era of his life was he more decisively the servant of goodness the servant of god than even now when doubting gods existence one circumstance i note says he after all the nameless woe that inquiry which for me what it is not always was genuine love of truth had wrought me i nevertheless still loved truth and would bate no jot of my allegiance to her truth i cried though the heavens crush me for following her no falsehood though a whole celestial lubberland were the price of apostasy in conduct it was the same had a divine messenger from the clouds or miraculous handwriting on the wall convincingly proclaimed to me this thou shalt do with what passionate readiness as i often thought would i have done it had it been leaping into the infernal fire thus in spite of all motivegrinders and mechanical profitandloss philosophies with the sick ophthalmia and hallucination they had brought on was the infinite nature of duty still dimly present to me living without god in the world of gods light i was not utterly bereft if my as yet sealed eyes with their unspeakable longing could nowhere see him nevertheless in my heart he was present and his heavenwritten law still stood legible and sacred there  meanwhile under all these tribulations and temporal and spiritual destitutions what must the wanderer in his silent soul have endured the painfullest feeling writes he is that of your own feebleness unkraft ever as the english milton says to be weak is the true misery and yet of your strength there is and can be no clear feeling save by what you have prospered in by what you have done between vague wavering capability and fixed indubitable performance what a difference a certain inarticulate selfconsciousness dwells dimly in us which only our works can render articulate and decisively discernible our works are the mirror wherein the spirit first sees its natural lineaments hence too the folly of that impossible precept know thyself till it be translated into this partially possible one know what thou canst work at  but for me so strangely unprosperous had i been the netresult of my workings amounted as yet simply tonothing how then could i believe in my strength when there was as yet no mirror to see it in ever did this agitating yet as i now perceive quite frivolous question remain to me insoluble hast thou a certain faculty a certain worth such even as the most have not or art thou the completest dullard of these modern times alas the fearful unbelief is unbelief in yourself and how could i believe had not my first last faith in myself when even to me the heavens seemed laid open and i dared to love been all too cruelly belied the speculative mystery of life grew ever more mysterious to me neither in the practical mystery had i made the slightest progress but been everywhere buffeted foiled and contemptuously cast out a feeble unit in the middle of a threatening infinitude i seemed to have nothing given me but eyes whereby to discern my own wretchedness invisible yet impenetrable walls as of enchantment divided me from all living was there in the wide world any true bosom i could press trustfully to mine o heaven no there was none i kept a lock upon my lips why should i speak much with that shifting variety of socalled friends in whose withered vain and toohungry souls friendship was but an incredible tradition in such cases your resource is to talk little and that little mostly from the newspapers now when i look back it was a strange isolation i then lived in the men and women around me even speaking with me were but figures i had practically forgotten that they were alive that they were not merely automatic in the midst of their crowded streets and assemblages i walked solitary and except as it was my own heart not anothers that i kept devouring savage also as the tiger in his jungle some comfort it would have been could i like a faust have fancied myself tempted and tormented of the devil for a hell as i imagine without life though only diabolic life were more frightful but in our age of downpulling and disbelief the very devil has been pulled down you cannot so much as believe in a devil to me the universe was all void of life of purpose of volition even of hostility it was one huge dead immeasurable steamengine rolling on in its dead indifference to grind me limb from limb oh the vast gloomy solitary golgotha and mill of death why was the living banished thither companionless conscious why if there is no devil nay unless the devil is your god  a prey incessantly to such corrosions might not moreover as the worst aggravation to them the iron constitution even of a teufelsdrockh threaten to fail we conjecture that he has known sickness and in spite of his locomotive habits perhaps sickness of the chronic sort hear this for example how beautiful to die of brokenheart on paper quite another thing in practice every window of your feeling even of your intellect as it were begrimed and mudbespattered so that no pure ray can enter a whole drugshop in your inwards the fordone soul drowning slowly in quagmires of disgust  putting all which external and internal miseries together may we not find in the following sentences quite in our professors still vein significance enough from suicide a certain aftershine nachschein of christianity withheld me perhaps also a certain indolence of character for was not that a remedy i had at any time within reach often however was there a question present to me should some one now at the turning of that corner blow thee suddenly out of space into the other world or other noworld by pistolshothow were it on which ground too i have often in seastorms and sieged cities and other deathscenes exhibited an imperturbability which passed falsely enough for courage  so had it lasted concludes the wanderer so had it lasted as in bitter protracted deathagony through long years the heart within me unvisited by any heavenly dewdrop was smouldering in sulphurous slowconsuming fire almost since earliest memory i had shed no tear or once only when i murmuring halfaudibly recited fausts deathsong that wild selig der den er im siegesglanze findet happy whom he finds in battles splendor and thought that of this last friend even i was not forsaken that destiny itself could not doom me not to die having no hope neither had i any definite fear were it of man or of devil nay i often felt as if it might be solacing could the archdevil himself though in tartarean terrors but rise to me that i might tell him a little of my mind and yet strangely enough i lived in a continual indefinite pining fear tremulous pusillanimous apprehensive of i knew not what it seemed as if all things in the heavens above and the earth beneath would hurt me as if the heavens and the earth were but boundless jaws of a devouring monster wherein i palpitating waited to be devoured  full of such humor and perhaps the miserablest man in the whole french capital or suburbs was i one sultry dogday after much perambulation toiling along the dirty little rue saintthomas de lenfer among civic rubbish enough in a close atmosphere and over pavements hot as nebuchadnezzars furnace whereby doubtless my spirits were little cheered when all at once there rose a thought in me and i asked myself what art thou afraid of wherefore like a coward dost thou forever pip and whimper and go cowering and trembling despicable biped what is the sumtotal of the worst that lies before thee death well death and say the pangs of tophet too and all that the devil and man may will or can do against thee hast thou not a heart canst thou not suffer whatsoever it be and as a child of freedom though outcast trample tophet itself under thy feet while it consumes thee let it come then i will meet it and defy it and as i so thought there rushed like a stream of fire over my whole soul and i shook base fear away from me forever i was strong of unknown strength a spirit almost a god ever from that time the temper of my misery was changed not fear or whining sorrow was it but indignation and grim fireeyed defiance  thus had the everlasting no das ewige nein pealed authoritatively through all the recesses of my being of my me and then was it that my whole me stood up in native godcreated majesty and with emphasis recorded its protest such a protest the most important transaction in life may that same indignation and defiance in a psychological point of view be fitly called the everlasting no had said behold thou art fatherless outcast and the universe is mine the devils to which my whole me now made answer i am not thine but free and forever hate thee  it is from this hour that i incline to date my spiritual newbirth or baphometic firebaptism perhaps i directly thereupon began to be a man    chapter viii centre of indifference  though after this baphometic firebaptism of his our wanderer signifies that his unrest was but increased as indeed indignation and defiance especially against things in general are not the most peaceable inmates yet can the psychologist surmise that it was no longer a quite hopeless unrest that henceforth it had at least a fixed centre to revolve round for the firebaptized soul long so scathed and thunderriven here feels its own freedom which feeling is its baphometic baptism the citadel of its whole kingdom it has thus gained by assault and will keep inexpugnable outwards from which the remaining dominions not indeed without hard battling will doubtless by degrees be conquered and pacificated under another figure we might say if in that great moment in the rue saintthomas de lenfer the old inward satanic school was not yet thrown out of doors it received peremptory judicial notice to quitwhereby for the rest its howlchantings ernulphuscursings and rebellious gnashings of teeth might in the mean while become only the more tumultuous and difficult to keep secret  accordingly if we scrutinize these pilgrimings well there is perhaps discernible henceforth a certain incipient method in their madness not wholly as a spectre does teufelsdrockh now storm through the world at worst as a spectrafighting man nay who will one day be a spectrequeller if pilgriming restlessly to so many saints wells and ever without quenching of his thirst he nevertheless finds little secular wells whereby from time to time some alleviation is ministered in a word he is now if not ceasing yet intermitting to eat his own heart and clutches round him outwardly on the notme for wholesomer food does not the following glimpse exhibit him in a much more natural state  towns also and cities especially the ancient i failed not to look upon with interest how beautiful to see thereby as through a long vista into the remote time to have as it were an actual section of almost the earliest past brought safe into the present and set before your eyes there in that old city was a live ember of culinary fire put down say only two thousand years ago and there burning more or less triumphantly with such fuel as the region yielded it has burnt and still burns and thou thyself seest the very smoke thereof ah and the far more mysterious live ember of vital fire was then also put down there and still miraculously burns and spreads and the smoke and ashes thereof in these judgmenthalls and churchyards and its bellowsengines in these churches thou still seest and its flame looking out from every kind countenance and every hateful one still warms thee or scorches thee  of mans activity and attainment the chief results are aeriform mystic and preserved in tradition only such are his forms of government with the authority they rest on his customs or fashions both of clothhabits and of soulhabits much more his collective stock of handicrafts the whole faculty he has acquired of manipulating nature all these things as indispensable and priceless as they are cannot in any way be fixed under lock and key but must flit spiritlike on impalpable vehicles from father to son if you demand sight of them they are nowhere to be met with visible ploughmen and hammermen there have been ever from cain and tubalcain downwards but where does your accumulated agricultural metallurgic and other manufacturing skill lie warehoused it transmits itself on the atmospheric air on the suns rays by hearing and by vision it is a thing aeriform impalpable of quite spiritual sort in like manner ask me not where are the laws where is the government in vain wilt thou go to schonbrunn to downing street to the palais bourbon thou findest nothing there but brick or stone houses and some bundles of papers tied with tape where then is that same cunningly devised almighty government of theirs to be laid hands on everywhere yet nowhere seen only in its works this too is a thing aeriform invisible or if you will mystic and miraculous so spiritual geistig is our whole daily life all that we do springs out of mystery spirit invisible force only like a little cloudimage or armidas palace airbuilt does the actual body itself forth from the great mystic deep  visible and tangible products of the past again i reckon up to the extent of three cities with their cabinets and arsenals then tilled fields to either or to both of which divisions roads with their bridges may belong and thirdlybooks in which third truly the last invented lies a worth far surpassing that of the two others wondrous indeed is the virtue of a true book not like a dead city of stones yearly crumbling yearly needing repair more like a tilled field but then a spiritual field like a spiritual tree let me rather say it stands from year to year and from age to age we have books that already number some hundred and fifty human ages and yearly comes its new produce of leaves commentaries deductions philosophical political systems or were it only sermons pamphlets journalistic essays every one of which is talismanic and thaumaturgic for it can persuade men o thou who art able to write a book which once in the two centuries or oftener there is a man gifted to do envy not him whom they name citybuilder and inexpressibly pity him whom they name conqueror or cityburner thou too art a conqueror and victor but of the true sort namely over the devil thou too hast built what will outlast all marble and metal and be a wonderbringing city of the mind a temple and seminary and prophetic mount whereto all kindreds of the earth will pilgrimfool why journeyest thou wearisomely in thy antiquarian fervor to gaze on the stone pyramids of geeza or the clay ones of sacchara these stand there as i can tell thee idle and inert looking over the desert foolishly enough for the last three thousand years but canst thou not open thy hebrew bible then or even luthers version thereof  no less satisfactory is his sudden appearance not in battle yet on some battlefield which we soon gather must be that of wagram so that here for once is a certain approximation to distinctness of date omitting much let us impart what follows  horrible enough a whole marchfeld strewed with shellsplinters cannonshot ruined tumbrils and dead men and horses stragglers still remaining not so much as buried and those red mould heaps ay there lie the shells of men out of which all the life and virtue has been blown and now are they swept together and crammed down out of sight like blown eggshellsdid nature when she bade the donau bring down his mouldcargoes from the carinthian and carpathian heights and spread them out here into the softest richest levelintend thee o marchfeld for a cornbearing nursery whereon her children might be nursed or for a cockpit wherein they might the more commodiously be throttled and tattered were thy three broad highways meeting here from the ends of europe made for ammunitionwagons then were thy wagrams and stillfrieds but so many readybuilt casemates wherein the house of hapsburg might batter with artillery and with artillery be battered konig ottokar amid yonder hillocks dies under rodolfs truncheon here kaiser franz falls aswoon under napoleons within which five centuries to omit the others how has thy breast fair plain been defaced and defiled the greensward is torn up and trampled down mans fond care of it his fruittrees hedgerows and pleasant dwellings blown away with gunpowder and the kind seedfield lies a desolate hideous place of skullsnevertheless nature is at work neither shall these powderdevilkins with their utmost devilry gainsay her but all that gore and carnage will be shrouded in absorbed into manure and next year the marchfeld will be green nay greener thrifty unwearied nature ever out of our great waste educing some little profit of thy ownhow dost thou from the very carcass of the killer bring life for the living  what speaking in quite unofficial language is the net purport and upshot of war to my own knowledge for example there dwell and toil in the british village of dumdrudge usually some five hundred souls from these by certain natural enemies of the french there are successively selected during the french war say thirty ablebodied men dumdrudge at her own expense has suckled and nursed them she has not without difficulty and sorrow fed them up to manhood and even trained them to crafts so that one can weave another build another hammer and the weakest can stand under thirty stone avoirdupois nevertheless amid much weeping and swearing they are selected all dressed in red and shipped away at the public charges some two thousand miles or say only to the south of spain and fed there till wanted and now to that same spot in the south of spain are thirty similar french artisans from a french dumdrudge in like manner wending till at length after infinite effort the two parties come into actual juxtaposition and thirty stands fronting thirty each with a gun in his hand straightaway the word fire is given and they blow the souls out of one another and in place of sixty brisk useful craftsmen the world has sixty dead carcasses which it must bury and anew shed tears for had these men any quarrel busy as the devil is not the smallest they lived far enough apart were the entirest strangers nay in so wide a universe there was even unconsciously by commerce some mutual helpfulness between them how then simpleton their governors had fallen out and instead of shooting one another had the cunning to make these poor blockheads shootalas so is it in deutschland and hitherto in all other lands still as of old what devilry soever kings do the greeks must pay the piperin that fiction of the english smollett it is true the final cessation of war is perhaps prophetically shadowed forth where the two natural enemies in person take each a tobaccopipe filled with brimstone light the same and smoke in one anothers faces till the weaker gives in but from such predicted peaceera what bloodfilled trenches and contentious centuries may still divide us  thus can the professor at least in lucid intervals look away from his own sorrows over the manycolored world and pertinently enough note what is passing there we may remark indeed that for the matter of spiritual culture if for nothing else perhaps few periods of his life were richer than this internally there is the most momentous instructive course of practical philosophy with experiments going on towards the right comprehension of which his peripatetic habits favorable to meditation might help him rather than hinder externally again as he wanders to and fro there are if for the longing heart little substance yet for the seeing eye sights enough in these so boundless travels of his granting that the satanic school was even partially kept down what an incredible knowledge of our planet and its inhabitants and their works that is to say of all knowable things might not teufelsdrockh acquire  i have read in most public libraries says he including those of constantinople and samarcand in most colleges except the chinese mandarin ones i have studied or seen that there was no studying unknown languages have i oftenest gathered from their natural repertory the air by my organ of hearing statistics geographics topographics came through the eye almost of their own accord the ways of man how he seeks food and warmth and protection for himself in most regions are ocularly known to me like the great hadrian i meted out much of the terraqueous globe with a pair of compasses that belonged to myself only  of great scenes why speak three summer days i lingered reflecting and even composing dichtete by the pinechasms of vaucluse and in that clear lakelet moistened my bread i have sat under the palmtrees of tadmor smoked a pipe among the ruins of babylon the great wall of china i have seen and can testify that it is of gray brick coped and covered with granite and shows only secondrate masonrygreat events also have not i witnessed kings sweated down ausgemergelt into berlinandmilan customhouseofficers the world well won and the world well lost oftener than once a hundred thousand individuals shot by each other in one day all kindreds and peoples and nations dashed together and shifted and shovelled into heaps that they might ferment there and in time unite the birthpangs of democracy wherewith convulsed europe was groaning in cries that reached heaven could not escape me  for great men i have ever had the warmest predilection and can perhaps boast that few such in this era have wholly escaped me great men are the inspired speaking and acting texts of that divine book of revelations whereof a chapter is completed from epoch to epoch and by some named history to which inspired texts your numerous talented men and your innumerable untalented men are the better or worse exegetic commentaries and wagonload of toostupid heretical or orthodox weekly sermons for my study the inspired texts themselves thus did not i in very early days having disguised me as tavernwaiter stand behind the fieldchairs under that shady tree at treisnitz by the jena highway waiting upon the great schiller and greater goethe and hearing what i have not forgotten for  but at this point the editor recalls his principle of caution some time ago laid down and must suppress much let not the sacredness of laurelled still more of crowned heads be tampered with should we at a future day find circumstances altered and the time come for publication then may these glimpses into the privacy of the illustrious be conceded which for the present were little better than treacherous perhaps traitorous eavesdroppings of lord byron therefore of pope pius emperor tarakwang and the white waterroses chinese carbonari with their mysteries no notice here of napoleon himself we shall only glancing from afar remark that teufelsdrockhs relation to him seems to have been of very varied character at first we find our poor professor on the point of being shot as a spy then taken into private conversation even pinched on the ear yet presented with no money at last indignantly dismissed almost thrown out of doors as an ideologist he himself says the professor was among the completest ideologists at least ideopraxists in the idea in der idee he lived moved and fought the man was a divine missionary though unconscious of it and preached through the cannons throat that great doctrine la carriere ouverte aux talens the tools to him that can handle them which is our ultimate political evangel wherein alone can liberty lie madly enough he preached it is true as enthusiasts and first missionaries are wont with imperfect utterance amid much frothy rant yet as articulately perhaps as the case admitted or call him if you will an american backwoodsman who had to fell unpenetrated forests and battle with innumerable wolves and did not entirely forbear strong liquor rioting and even theft whom notwithstanding the peaceful sower will follow and as he cuts the boundless harvest bless  more legitimate and decisively authentic is teufelsdrockhs appearance and emergence we know not well whence in the solitude of the north cape on that june midnight he has a lightblue spanish cloak hanging round him as his most commodious principal indeed sole uppergarment and stands there on the worldpromontory looking over the infinite brine like a little blue belfry as we figure now motionless indeed yet ready if stirred to ring quaintest changes  silence as of death writes he for midnight even in the arctic latitudes has its character nothing but the granite cliffs ruddytinged the peaceable gurgle of that slowheaving polar ocean over which in the utmost north the great sun hangs low and lazy as if he too were slumbering yet is his cloudcouch wrought of crimson and clothofgold yet does his light stream over the mirror of waters like a tremulous firepillar shooting downwards to the abyss and hide itself under my feet in such moments solitude also is invaluable for who would speak or be looked on when behind him lies all europe and africa fast asleep except the watchmen and before him the silent immensity and palace of the eternal whereof our sun is but a porchlamp  nevertheless in this solemn moment comes a man or monster scrambling from among the rockhollows and shaggy huge as the hyperborean bear hails me in russian speech most probably therefore a russian smuggler with courteous brevity i signify my indifference to contraband trade my humane intentions yet strong wish to be private in vain the monster counting doubtless on his superior stature and minded to make sport for himself or perhaps profit were it with murder continues to advance ever assailing me with his importunate trainoil breath and now has advanced till we stand both on the verge of the rock the deep sea rippling greedily down below what argument will avail on the thick hyperborean cherubic reasoning seraphic eloquence were lost prepared for such extremity i deftly enough whisk aside one step draw out from my interior reservoirs a sufficient birmingham horsepistol and say be so obliging as retire friend er ziehe sich zuruck freund and with promptitude this logic even the hyperborean understands fast enough with apologetic petitionary growl he sidles off and except for suicidal as well as homicidal purposes need not return  such i hold to be the genuine use of gunpowder that it makes all men alike tall nay if thou be cooler cleverer than i if thou have more mind though all but no body whatever then canst thou kill me first and art the taller hereby at last is the goliath powerless and the david resistless savage animalism is nothing inventive spiritualism is all  with respect to duels indeed i have my own ideas few things in this so surprising world strike me with more surprise two little visual spectra of men hovering with insecure enough cohesion in the midst of the unfathomable and to dissolve therein at any rate very soonmake pause at the distance of twelve paces asunder whirl round and simultaneously by the cunningest mechanism explode one another into dissolution and offhand become air and nonextant deuce on it verdammt the little spitfiresnay i think with old hugo von trimberg god must needs laugh outright could such a thing be to see his wondrous manikins here below  but amid these specialties let us not forget the great generality which is our chief quest here how prospered the inner man of teufelsdrockh under so much outward shifting does legion still lurk in him though repressed or has he exorcised that devils brood we can answer that the symptoms continue promising experience is the grand spiritual doctor and with him teufelsdrockh has now been long a patient swallowing many a bitter bolus unless our poor friend belong to the numerous class of incurables which seems not likely some cure will doubtless be effected we should rather say that legion or the satanic school was now pretty well extirpated and cast out but next to nothing introduced in its room whereby the heart remains for the while in a quiet but no comfortable state  at length after so much roasting thus writes our autobiographer i was what you might name calcined pray only that it be not rather as is the more frequent issue reduced to a caputmortuum but in any case by mere dint of practice i had grown familiar with many things wretchedness was still wretched but i could now partly see through it and despise it which highest mortal in this inane existence had i not found a shadowhunter or shadowhunted and when i looked through his brave garnitures miserable enough thy wishes have all been sniffed aside thought i but what had they even been all granted did not the boy alexander weep because he had not two planets to conquer or a whole solar system or after that a whole universe ach gott when i gazed into these stars have they not looked down on me as if with pity from their serene spaces like eyes glistening with heavenly tears over the little lot of man thousands of human generations all as noisy as our own have been swallowed up of time and there remains no wreck of them any more and arcturus and orion and sirius and the pleiades are still shining in their courses clear and young as when the shepherd first noted them in the plain of shinar pshaw what is this paltry little dogcage of an earth what art thou that sittest whining there thou art still nothing nobody true but who then is something somebody for thee the family of man has no use it rejects thee thou art wholly as a dissevered limb so be it perhaps it is better so  tooheavyladen teufelsdrockh yet surely his bands are loosening one day he will hurl the burden far from him and bound forth free and with a second youth  this says our professor was the centre of indifference i had now reached through which whoso travels from the negative pole to the positive must necessarily pass    chapter ix the everlasting yea  temptations in the wilderness exclaims teufelsdrockh have we not all to be tried with such not so easily can the old adam lodged in us by birth be dispossessed our life is compassed round with necessity yet is the meaning of life itself no other than freedom than voluntary force thus have we a warfare in the beginning especially a hardfought battle for the godgiven mandate work thou in welldoing lies mysteriously written in promethean prophetic characters in our hearts and leaves us no rest night or day till it be deciphered and obeyed till it burn forth in our conduct a visible acted gospel of freedom and as the claygiven mandate eat thou and be filled at the same time persuasively proclaims itself through every nervemust not there be a confusion a contest before the better influence can become the upper  to me nothing seems more natural than that the son of man when such godgiven mandate first prophetically stirs within him and the clay must now be vanquished or vanquishshould be carried of the spirit into grim solitudes and there fronting the tempter do grimmest battle with him defiantly setting him at naught till he yield and fly name it as we choose with or without visible devil whether in the natural desert of rocks and sands or in the populous moral desert of selfishness and basenessto such temptation are we all called unhappy if we are not unhappy if we are but halfmen in whom that divine handwriting has never blazed forth allsubduing in true sunsplendor but quivers dubiously amid meaner lights or smoulders in dull pain in darkness under earthly vaporsour wilderness is the wide world in an atheistic century our forty days are long years of suffering and fasting nevertheless to these also comes an end yes to me also was given if not victory yet the consciousness of battle and the resolve to persevere therein while life or faculty is left to me also entangled in the enchanted forests demonpeopled doleful of sight and of sound it was given after weariest wanderings to work out my way into the higher sunlit slopesof that mountain which has no summit or whose summit is in heaven only  he says elsewhere under a less ambitious figure as figures are once for all natural to him has not thy life been that of most sufficient men tuchtigen manner thou hast known in this generation an outflush of foolish young enthusiasm like the first fallowcrop wherein are as many weeds as valuable herbs this all parched away under the droughts of practical and spiritual unbelief as disappointment in thought and act oftenrepeated gave rise to doubt and doubt gradually settled into denial if i have had a secondcrop and now see the perennial greensward and sit under umbrageous cedars which defy all drought and doubt herein too be the heavens praised i am not without examples and even exemplars  so that for teufelsdrockh also there has been a glorious revolution these mad shadowhunting and shadowhunted pilgrimings of his were but some purifying temptation in the wilderness before his apostolic work such as it was could begin which temptation is now happily over and the devil once more worsted was that high moment in the rue de lenfer then properly the turningpoint of the battle when the fiend said worship me or be torn in shreds and was answered valiantly with an apage satanasingular teufelsdrockh would thou hadst told thy singular story in plain words but it is fruitless to look there in those paperbags for such nothing but innuendoes figurative crotchets a typical shadow fitfully wavering propheticosatiric no clear logical picture how paint to the sensual eye asks he once what passes in the holyofholies of mans soul in what words known to these profane times speak even afaroff of the unspeakable we ask in turn why perplex these times profane as they are with needless obscurity by omission and by commission not mystical only is our professor but whimsical and involves himself now more than ever in eyebewildering chiaroscuro successive glimpses here faithfully imparted our more gifted readers must endeavor to combine for their own behoof  he says the hot harmattan wind had raged itself out its howl went silent within me and the longdeafened soul could now hear i paused in my wild wanderings and sat me down to wait and consider for it was as if the hour of change drew nigh i seemed to surrender to renounce utterly and say fly then false shadows of hope i will chase you no more i will believe you no more and ye too haggard spectres of fear i care not for you ye too are all shadows and a lie let me rest here for i am wayweary and lifeweary i will rest here were it but to die to die or to live is alike to me alike insignificantand again here then as i lay in that centre of indifference cast doubtless by benignant upper influence into a healing sleep the heavy dreams rolled gradually away and i awoke to a new heaven and a new earth the first preliminary moral act annihilation of self selbsttodtung had been happily accomplished and my minds eyes were now unsealed and its hands ungyved  might we not also conjecture that the following passage refers to his locality during this same healing sleep that his pilgrimstaff lies cast aside here on the high tableland and indeed that the repose is already taking wholesome effect on him if it were not that the tone in some parts has more of riancy even of levity than we could have expected however in teufelsdrockh there is always the strangest dualism light dancing with guitarmusic will be going on in the forecourt while by fits from within comes the faint whimpering of woe and wail we transcribe the piece entire  beautiful it was to sit there as in my skyey tent musing and meditating on the high tableland in front of the mountains over me as roof the azure dome and around me for walls four azureflowing curtainsnamely of the four azure winds on whose bottomfringes also i have seen gilding and then to fancy the fair castles that stood sheltered in these mountain hollows with their green flowerlawns and white dames and damosels lovely enough or better still the strawroofed cottages wherein stood many a mother baking bread with her children round herall hidden and protectingly folded up in the valleyfolds yet there and alive as sure as if i beheld them or to see as well as fancy the nine towns and villages that lay round my mountainseat which in still weather were wont to speak to me by their steeplebells with metal tongue and in almost all weather proclaimed their vitality by repeated smokeclouds whereon as on a culinary horologe i might read the hour of the day for it was the smoke of cookery as kind housewives at morning midday eventide were boiling their husbands kettles and ever a blue pillar rose up into the air successively or simultaneously from each of the nine saying as plainly as smoke could say such and such a meal is getting ready here not uninteresting for you have the whole borough with all its lovemakings and scandalmongeries contentions and contentments as in miniature and could cover it all with your hatif in my wide wayfarings i had learned to look into the business of the world in its details here perhaps was the place for combining it into general propositions and deducing inferences therefrom  often also could i see the black tempest marching in anger through the distance round some schreckhorn as yet grimblue would the eddying vapor gather and there tumultuously eddy and flow down like a mad witchs hair till after a space it vanished and in the clear sunbeam your schreckhorn stood smiling grimwhite for the vapor had held snow how thou fermentest and elaboratest in thy great fermentingvat and laboratory of an atmosphere of a world o natureor what is nature ha why do i not name thee god art not thou the living garment of god o heavens is it in very deed he then that ever speaks through thee that lives and loves in thee that lives and loves in me  foreshadows call them rather foresplendors of that truth and beginning of truths fell mysteriously over my soul sweeter than dayspring to the shipwrecked in nova zembla ah like the mothers voice to her little child that strays bewildered weeping in unknown tumults like soft streamings of celestial music to my tooexasperated heart came that evangel the universe is not dead and demoniacal a charnelhouse with spectres but godlike and my fathers  with other eyes too could i now look upon my fellowman with an infinite love an infinite pity poor wandering wayward man art thou not tried and beaten with stripes even as i am ever whether thou bear the royal mantle or the beggars gabardine art thou not so weary so heavyladen and thy bed of rest is but a grave o my brother my brother why cannot i shelter thee in my bosom and wipe away all tears from thy eyestruly the din of manyvoiced life which in this solitude with the minds organ i could hear was no longer a maddening discord but a melting one like inarticulate cries and sobbings of a dumb creature which in the ear of heaven are prayers the poor earth with her poor joys was now my needy mother not my cruel stepdame man with his so mad wants and so mean endeavors had become the dearer to me and even for his sufferings and his sins i now first named him brother thus was i standing in the porch of that sanctuary of sorrow by strange steep ways had i too been guided thither and ere long its sacred gates would open and the divine depth of sorrow lie disclosed to me  the professor says he here first got eye on the knot that had been strangling him and straightway could unfasten it and was free a vain interminable controversy writes he touching what is at present called origin of evil or some such thing arises in every soul since the beginning of the world and in every soul that would pass from idle suffering into actual endeavoring must first be put an end to the most in our time have to go content with a simple incomplete enough suppression of this controversy to a few some solution of it is indispensable in every new era too such solution comes out in different terms and ever the solution of the last era has become obsolete and is found unserviceable for it is mans nature to change his dialect from century to century he cannot help it though he would the authentic churchcatechism of our present century has not yet fallen into my hands meanwhile for my own private behoof i attempt to elucidate the matter so mans unhappiness as i construe comes of his greatness it is because there is an infinite in him which with all his cunning he cannot quite bury under the finite will the whole finance ministers and upholsterers and confectioners of modern europe undertake in jointstock company to make one shoeblack happy they cannot accomplish it above an hour or two for the shoeblack also has a soul quite other than his stomach and would require if you consider it for his permanent satisfaction and saturation simply this allotment no more and no less gods infinite universe altogether to himself therein to enjoy infinitely and fill every wish as fast as it rose oceans of hochheimer a throat like that of ophiuchus speak not of them to the infinite shoeblack they are as nothing no sooner is your ocean filled than he grumbles that it might have been of better vintage try him with half of a universe of an omnipotence he sets to quarrelling with the proprietor of the other half and declares himself the most maltreated of menalways there is a black spot in our sunshine it is even as i said the shadow of ourselves  but the whim we have of happiness is somewhat thus by certain valuations and averages of our own striking we come upon some sort of average terrestrial lot this we fancy belongs to us by nature and of indefeasible right it is simple payment of our wages of our deserts requires neither thanks nor complaint only such overplus as there may be do we account happiness any deficit again is misery now consider that we have the valuation of our own deserts ourselves and what a fund of selfconceit there is in each of usdo you wonder that the balance should so often dip the wrong way and many a blockhead cry see there what a payment was ever worthy gentleman so usedi tell thee blockhead it all comes of thy vanity of what thou fanciest those same deserts of thine to be fancy that thou deservest to be hanged as is most likely thou wilt feel it happiness to be only shot fancy that thou deservest to be hanged in a hairhalter it will be a luxury to die in hemp  so true is it what i then said that the fraction of life can be increased in value not so much by increasing your numerator as by lessening your denominator nay unless my algebra deceive me unity itself divided by zero will give infinity make thy claim of wages a zero then thou hast the world under thy feet well did the wisest of our time write it is only with renunciation entsagen that life properly speaking can be said to begin  i asked myself what is this that ever since earliest years thou hast been fretting and fuming and lamenting and selftormenting on account of say it in a word is it not because thou art not happy because the thou sweet gentleman is not sufficiently honored nourished softbedded and lovingly cared for foolish soul what act of legislature was there that thou shouldst be happy a little while ago thou hadst no right to be at all what if thou wert born and predestined not to be happy but to be unhappy art thou nothing other than a vulture then that fliest through the universe seeking after somewhat to eat and shrieking dolefully because carrion enough is not given thee close thy byron open thy goethe  es leuchtet mir ein i see a glimpse of it cries he elsewhere there is in man a higher than love of happiness he can do without happiness and instead thereof find blessedness was it not to preach forth this same higher that sages and martyrs the poet and the priest in all times have spoken and suffered bearing testimony through life and through death of the godlike that is in man and how in the godlike only has he strength and freedom which godinspiredd doctrine art thou also honored to be taught o heavens and broken with manifold merciful afflictions even till thou become contrite and learn it oh thank thy destiny for these thankfully bear what yet remain thou hadst need of them the self in thee needed to be annihilated by benignant feverparoxysms is life rooting out the deepseated chronic disease and triumphs over death on the roaring billows of time thou art not engulfed but borne aloft into the azure of eternity love not pleasure love god this is the everlasting yea wherein all contradiction is solved wherein whoso walks and works it is well with him  and again small is it that thou canst trample the earth with its injuries under thy feet as old greek zeno trained thee thou canst love the earth while it injures thee and even because it injures thee for this a greater than zeno was needed and he too was sent knowest thou that worship of sorrow the temple thereof founded some eighteen centuries ago now lies in ruins overgrown with jungle the habitation of doleful creatures nevertheless venture forward in a low crypt arched out of falling fragments thou findest the altar still there and its sacred lamp perennially burning  without pretending to comment on which strange utterances the editor will only remark that there lies beside them much of a still more questionable character unsuited to the general apprehension nay wherein he himself does not see his way nebulous disquisitions on religion yet not without bursts of splendor on the perennial continuance of inspiration on prophecy that there are true priests as well as baalpriests in our own day with more of the like sort we select some fractions by way of finish to this farrago  cease my muchrespected herr von voltaire thus apostrophizes the professor shut thy sweet voice for the task appointed thee seems finished sufficiently hast thou demonstrated this proposition considerable or otherwise that the mythus of the christian religion looks not in the eighteenth century as it did in the eighth alas were thy sixandthirty quartos and the sixandthirty thousand other quartos and folios and flying sheets or reams printed before and since on the same subject all needed to convince us of so little but what next wilt thou help us to embody the divine spirit of that religion in a new mythus in a new vehicle and vesture that our souls otherwise too like perishing may live what thou hast no faculty in that kind only a torch for burning no hammer for building take our thanks then andthyself away  meanwhile what are antiquated mythuses to me or is the god present felt in my own heart a thing which herr von voltaire will dispute out of me or dispute into me to the worship of sorrow ascribe what origin and genesis thou pleasest has not that worship originated and been generated is it not here feel it in thy heart and then say whether it is of god this is belief all else is opinionfor which latter whoso will let him worry and be worried  neither observes he elsewhere shall ye tear out one anothers eyes struggling over plenary inspiration and such like try rather to get a little even partial inspiration each of you for himself one bible i know of whose plenary inspiration doubt is not so much as possible nay with my own eyes i saw the godshand writing it thereof all other bibles are but leavessay in picturewriting to assist the weaker faculty  or to give the wearied reader relief and bring it to an end let him take the following perhaps more intelligible passage  to me in this our life says the professor which is an internecine warfare with the timespirit other warfare seems questionable hast thou in any way a contention with thy brother i advise thee think well what the meaning thereof is if thou gauge it to the bottom it is simply this fellow see thou art taking more than thy share of happiness in the world something from my share which by the heavens thou shalt not nay i will fight thee ratheralas and the whole lot to be divided is such a beggarly matter truly a feast of shells for the substance has been spilled out not enough to quench one appetite and the collective human species clutching at themcan we not in all such cases rather say take it thou tooravenous individual take that pitiful additional fraction of a share which i reckoned mine but which thou so wantest take it with a blessing would to heaven i had enough for theeif fichtes wissenschaftslehre be to a certain extent applied christianity surely to a still greater extent so is this we have here not a whole duty of man yet a half duty namely the passive half could we but do it as we can demonstrate it  but indeed conviction were it never so excellent is worthless till it convert itself into conduct nay properly conviction is not possible till then inasmuch as all speculation is by nature endless formless a vortex amid vortices only by a felt indubitable certainty of experience does it find any centre to revolve round and so fashion itself into a system most true is it as a wise man teaches us that doubt of any sort cannot be removed except by action on which ground too let him who gropes painfully in darkness or uncertain light and prays vehemently that the dawn may ripen into day lay this other precept well to heart which to me was of invaluable service do the duty which lies nearest thee which thou knowest to be a duty thy second duty will already have become clearer  may we not say however that the hour of spiritual enfranchisement is even this when your ideal world wherein the whole man has been dimly struggling and inexpressibly languishing to work becomes revealed and thrown open and you discover with amazement enough like the lothario in wilhelm meister that your america is here or nowhere the situation that has not its duty its ideal was never yet occupied by man yes here in this poor miserable hampered despicable actual wherein thou even now standest here or nowhere is thy ideal work it out therefrom and working believe live be free fool the ideal is in thyself the impediment too is in thyself thy condition is but the stuff thou art to shape that same ideal out of what matters whether such stuff be of this sort or that so the form thou give it be heroic be poetic o thou that pinest in the imprisonment of the actual and criest bitterly to the gods for a kingdom wherein to rule and create know this of a truth the thing thou seekest is already with thee here or nowhere couldst thou only see  but it is with mans soul as it was with nature the beginning of creation islight till the eye have vision the whole members are in bonds divine moment when over the tempesttost soul as once over the wildweltering chaos it is spoken let there be light ever to the greatest that has felt such moment is it not miraculous and godannouncing even as under simpler figures to the simplest and least the mad primeval discord is hushed the rudely jumbled conflicting elements bind themselves into separate firmaments deep silent rockfoundations are built beneath and the skyey vault with its everlasting luminaries above instead of a dark wasteful chaos we have a blooming fertile heavenencompassed world  i too could now say to myself be no longer a chaos but a world or even worldkin produce produce were it but the pitifullest infinitesimal fraction of a product produce it in gods name tis the utmost thou hast in thee out with it then up up whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy whole might work while it is called today for the night cometh wherein no man can work    chapter x pause  thus have we as closely and perhaps satisfactorily as in such circumstances might be followed teufelsdrockh through the various successive states and stages of growth entanglement unbelief and almost reprobation into a certain clearer state of what he himself seems to consider as conversion blame not the word says he rejoice rather that such a word signifying such a thing has come to light in our modern era though hidden from the wisest ancients the old world knew nothing of conversion instead of an ecce homo they had only some choice of hercules it was a newattained progress in the moral development of man hereby has the highest come home to the bosoms of the most limited what to plato was but a hallucination and to socrates a chimera is now clear and certain to your zinzendorfs your wesleys and the poorest of their pietists and methodists  it is here then that the spiritual majority of teufelsdrockh commences we are henceforth to see him work in welldoing with the spirit and clear aims of a man he has discovered that the ideal workshop he so panted for is even this same actual illfurnished workshop he has so long been stumbling in he can say to himself tools thou hast no tools why there is not a man or a thing now alive but has tools the basest of created animalcules the spider itself has a spinningjenny and warpingmill and powerloom within its head the stupidest of oysters has a papinsdigester with stoneandlime house to hold it in every being that can live can do something this let him dotools hast thou not a brain furnished furnishable with some glimmerings of light and three fingers to hold a pen withal never since aarons rod went out of practice or even before it was there such a wonderworking tool greater than all recorded miracles have been performed by pens for strangely in this so solidseeming world which nevertheless is in continual restless flux it is appointed that sound to appearance the most fleeting should be the most continuing of all things the word is well said to be omnipotent in this world man thereby divine can create as by a fiat awake arise speak forth what is in thee what god has given thee what the devil shall not take away higher task than that of priesthood was allotted to no man wert thou but the meanest in that sacred hierarchy is it not honor enough therein to spend and be spent  by this art which whoso will may sacrilegiously degrade into a handicraft adds teufelsdrockh have i thenceforth abidden writings of mine not indeed known as mine for what am i have fallen perhaps not altogether void into the mighty seedfield of opinion fruits of my unseen sowing gratifyingly meet me here and there i thank the heavens that i have now found my calling wherein with or without perceptible result i am minded diligently to persevere  nay how knowest thou cries he but this and the other pregnant device now grown to be a worldrenowned farworking institution like a grain of right mustardseed once cast into the right soil and now stretching out strong boughs to the four winds for the birds of the air to lodge inmay have been properly my doing some ones doing it without doubt was from some idea in some single head it did first of all take beginning why not from some idea in mine does teufelsdrockh here glance at that society for the conservation of property eigenthumsconservirende gesellschaft of which so many ambiguous notices glide spectralike through these inexpressible paperbags an institution hints he not unsuitable to the wants of the time as indeed such sudden extension proves for already can the society number among its officebearers or corresponding members the highest names if not the highest persons in germany england france and contributions both of money and of meditation pour in from all quarters to if possible enlist the remaining integrity of the world and defensively and with forethought marshal it round this palladium does teufelsdrockh mean then to give himself out as the originator of that so notable eigenthumsconservirende owndomconserving gesellschaft and if so what in the devils name is it he again hints at a time when the divine commandment thou shalt not steal wherein truly if well understood is comprised the whole hebrew decalogue with solons and lycurgruss constitutions justinians pandects the code napoleon and all codes catechisms divinities moralities whatsoever that man has hitherto devised and enforced with altarfire and gallowsropes for his social guidance at a time i say when this divine commandment has all but faded away from the general remembrance and with little disguise a new opposite commandment thou shalt steal is everywhere promulgatedit perhaps behooved in this universal dotage and deliration the sound portion of mankind to bestir themselves and rally when the widest and wildest violations of that divine right of property the only divine right now extant or conceivable are sanctioned and recommended by a vicious press and the world has lived to hear it asserted that we have no property in our very bodies but only an accidental possession and liferent what is the issue to be looked for hangmen and catchpoles may by their noosegins and baited falltraps keep down the smaller sort of vermin but what except perhaps some such universal association can protect us against whole meatdevouring and mandevouring hosts of boaconstrictors if therefore the more sequestered thinker have wondered in his privacy from what hand that perhaps not illwritten program in the public journals with its high prizequestions and so liberal prizes could have proceededlet him now cease such wonder and with undivided faculty betake himself to the concurrenz competition  we ask has this same perhaps not illwritten program or any other authentic transaction of that propertyconserving society fallen under the eye of the british reader in any journal foreign or domestic if so what are those prizequestions what are the terms of competition and when and where no printed newspaperleaf no farther light of any sort to be met with in these paperbags or is the whole business one other of those whimsicalities and perverse inexplicabilities whereby herr teufelsdrockh meaning much or nothing is pleased so often to play fastandloose with us   here indeed at length must the editor give utterance to a painful suspicion which through late chapters has begun to haunt him paralyzing any little enthusiasm that might still have rendered his thorny biographical task a labor of love it is a suspicion grounded perhaps on trifles yet confirmed almost into certainty by the more and more discernible humoristicosatirical tendency of teufelsdrockh in whom underground humors and intricate sardonic rogueries wheel within wheel defy all reckoning a suspicion in one word that these autobiographical documents are partly a mystification what if many a socalled fact were little better than a fiction if here we had no direct cameraobscura picture of the professors history but only some more or less fantastic adumbration symbolically perhaps significantly enough shadowing forth the same our theory begins to be that in receiving as literally authentic what was but hieroglyphically so hofrath heuschrecke whom in that case we scruple not to name hofrath noseofwax was made a fool of and set adrift to make fools of others could it be expected indeed that a man so known for impenetrable reticence as teufelsdrockh would all at once frankly unlock his private citadel to an english editor and a german hofrath and not rather deceptively inlock both editor and hofrath in the labyrinthic tortuosities and coveredways of said citadel having enticed them thither to see in his halfdevilish way how the fools would look  of one fool however the herr professor will perhaps find himself short on a small slip formerly thrown aside as blank the ink being all but invisible we lately noticed and with effort decipher the following what are your historical facts still more your biographical wilt thou know a man above all a mankind by stringing together beadrolls of what thou namest facts the man is the spirit he worked in not what he did but what he became facts are engraved hierograms for which the fewest have the key and then how your blockhead dummkopf studies not their meaning but simply whether they are well or ill cut what he calls moral or immoral still worse is it with your bungler pfuscher such i have seen reading some rousseau with pretences of interpretation and mistaking the illcut serpentofeternity for a common poisonous reptile was the professor apprehensive lest an editor selected as the present boasts himself might mistake the teufelsdrockh serpentofeternity in like manner for which reason it was to be altered not without underhand satire into a plainer symbol or is this merely one of his halfsophisms halftruisms which if he can but set on the back of a figure he cares not whither it gallop we say not with certainty and indeed so strange is the professor can never say if our suspicion be wholly unfounded let his own questionable ways not our necessary circumspectness bear the blame  but be this as it will the somewhat exasperated and indeed exhausted editor determines here to shut these paperbags for the present let it suffice that we know of teufelsdrockh so far if not what he did yet what he became the rather as his character has now taken its ultimate bent and no new revolution of importance is to be looked for the imprisoned chrysalis is now a winged psyche and such wheresoever be its flight it will continue to trace by what complex gyrations flights or involuntary waftings through the mere external lifeelement teufelsdrockh reaches his university professorship and the psyche clothes herself in civic titles without altering her now fixed naturewould be comparatively an unproductive task were we even unsuspicious of its being for us at least a false and impossible one his outward biography therefore which at the blumine loversleap we saw churned utterly into sprayvapor may hover in that condition for aught that concerns us here enough that by survey of certain pools and plashes we have ascertained its general direction do we not already know that by one way and other it has long since rained down again into a stream and even now at weissnichtwo flows deep and still fraught with the philosophy of clothes and visible to whoso will cast eye thereon over much invaluable matter that lies scattered like jewels among quarryrubbish in those papercatacombs we may have occasion to glance back and somewhat will demand insertion at the right place meanwhile be our tiresome diggings therein suspended  if now before reopening the great clothesvolume we ask what our degree of progress during these ten chapters has been towards right understanding of the clothesphilosophy let not our discouragement become total to speak in that old figure of the hellgate bridge over chaos a few flying pontoons have perhaps been added though as yet they drift straggling on the flood how far they will reach when once the chains are straightened and fastened can at present only be matter of conjecture  so much we already calculate through many a little loophole we have had glimpses into the internal world of teufelsdrockh his strange mystic almost magic diagram of the universe and how it was gradually drawn is not henceforth altogether dark to us those mysterious ideas on time which merit consideration and are not wholly unintelligible with such may by and by prove significant still more may his somewhat peculiar view of nature the decisive oneness he ascribes to nature how all nature and life are but one garment a living garment woven and ever aweaving in the loom of time is not here indeed the outline of a whole clothesphilosophy at least the arena it is to work in remark too that the character of the man nowise without meaning in such a matter becomes less enigmatic amid so much tumultuous obscurity almost like diluted madness do not a certain indomitable defiance and yet a boundless reverence seem to loom forth as the two mountainsummits on whose rockstrata all the rest were based and built  nay further may we not say that teufelsdrockhs biography allowing it even as suspected only a hieroglyphical truth exhibits a man as it were preappointed for clothesphilosophy to look through the shows of things into things themselves he is led and compelled the passivity given him by birth is fostered by all turns of his fortune everywhere cast out like oil out of water from mingling in any employment in any public communion he has no portion but solitude and a life of meditation the whole energy of his existence is directed through long years on one task that of enduring pain if he cannot cure it thus everywhere do the shows of things oppress him withstand him threaten him with fearfullest destruction only by victoriously penetrating into things themselves can he find peace and a stronghold but is not this same looking through the shows or vestures into the things even the first preliminary to a philosophy of clothes do we not in all this discern some beckonings towards the true higher purport of such a philosophy and what shape it must assume with such a man in such an era  perhaps in entering on book third the courteous reader is not utterly without guess whither he is bound nor let us hope for all the fantastic dreamgrottos through which as is our lot with teufelsdrockh he must wander will there be wanting between whiles some twinkling of a steady polar star     book iii   chapter i incident in modern history  as a wonderloving and wonderseeking man teufelsdrockh from an early part of this clothesvolume has more and more exhibited himself striking it was amid all his perverse cloudiness with what force of vision and of heart he pierced into the mystery of the world recognizing in the highest sensible phenomena so far as sense went only fresh or faded raiment yet ever under this a celestial essence thereby rendered visible and while on the one hand he trod the old rags of matter with their tinsels into the mire he on the other everywhere exalted spirit above all earthly principalities and powers and worshipped it though under the meanest shapes with a true platonic mysticism what the man ultimately purposed by thus casting his greekfire into the general wardrobe of the universe what such more or less complete rending and burning of garments throughout the whole compass of civilized life and speculation should lead to the rather as he was no adamite in any sense and could not like rousseau recommend either bodily or intellectual nudity and a return to the savage state all this our readers are now bent to discover this is in fact properly the gist and purport of professor teufelsdrockhs philosophy of clothes  be it remembered however that such purport is here not so much evolved as detected to lie ready for evolving we are to guide our british friends into the new goldcountry and show them the mines nowise to dig out and exhaust its wealth which indeed remains for all time inexhaustible once there let each dig for his own behoof and enrich himself  neither in so capricious inexpressible a work as this of the professors can our course now more than formerly be straightforward step by step but at best leap by leap significant indications stand out here and there which for the critical eye that looks both widely and narrowly shape themselves into some groundscheme of a whole to select these with judgment so that a leap from one to the other be possible and in our old figure by chaining them together a passable bridge be effected this as heretofore continues our only method among such lightspots the following floating in much wild matter about perfectibility has seemed worth clutching at  perhaps the most remarkable incident in modern history says teufelsdrockh is not the diet of worms still less the battle of austerlitz waterloo peterloo or any other battle but an incident passed carelessly over by most historians and treated with some degree of ridicule by others namely george foxs making to himself a suit of leather this man the first of the quakers and by trade a shoemaker was one of those to whom under ruder or purer form the divine idea of the universe is pleased to manifest itself and across all the hulls of ignorance and earthly degradation shine through in unspeakable awfulness unspeakable beauty on their souls who therefore are rightly accounted prophets godpossessed or even gods as in some periods it has chanced sitting in his stall working on tanned hides amid pincers pastehorns rosin swinebristles and a nameless flood of rubbish this youth had nevertheless a living spirit belonging to him also an antique inspired volume through which as through a window it could look upwards and discern its celestial home the task of a daily pair of shoes coupled even with some prospect of victuals and an honorable mastership in cordwainery and perhaps the post of thirdborough in his hundred as the crown of long faithful sewingwas nowise satisfaction enough to such a mind but ever amid the boring and hammering came tones from that far country came splendors and terrors for this poor cordwainer as we said was a man and the temple of immensity wherein as man he had been sent to minister was full of holy mystery to him  the clergy of the neighborhood the ordained watchers and interpreters of that same holy mystery listened with unaffected tedium to his consultations and advised him as the solution of such doubts to drink beer and dance with the girls blind leaders of the blind for what end were their tithes levied and eaten for what were their shovelhats scooped out and their surplices and cassockaprons girt on and such a churchrepairing and chaffering and organing and other racketing held over that spot of gods earthif man were but a patent digester and the belly with its adjuncts the grand reality fox turned from them with tears and a sacred scorn back to his leatherparings and his bible mountains of encumbrance higher than aetna had been heaped over that spirit but it was a spirit and would not lie buried there through long days and nights of silent agony it struggled and wrestled with a mans force to be free how its prisonmountains heaved and swayed tumultuously as the giant spirit shook them to this hand and that and emerged into the light of heaven that leicester shoeshop had men known it was a holier place than any vatican or lorettoshrineso bandaged and hampered and hemmed in groaned he with thousand requisitions obligations straps tatters and tagrags i can neither see nor move not my own am i but the worlds and time flies fast and heaven is high and hell is deep man bethink thee if thou hast power of thought why not what binds me here want wantha of what will all the shoewages under the moon ferry me across into that far land of light only meditation can and devout prayer to god i will to the woods the hollow of a tree will lodge me wild berries feed me and for clothes cannot i stitch myself one perennial suit of leather  historical oilpainting continues teufelsdrockh is one of the arts i never practiced therefore shall i not decide whether this subject were easy of execution on the canvas yet often has it seemed to me as if such first outflashing of mans freewill to lighten more and more into day the chaotic night that threatened to engulf him in its hindrances and its horrors were properly the only grandeur there is in history let some living angelo or rosa with seeing eye and understanding heart picture george fox on that morning when he spreads out his cuttingboard for the last time and cuts cowhides by unwonted patterns and stitches them together into one continuous allincluding case the farewell service of his awl stitch away thou noble fox every prick of that little instrument is pricking into the heart of slavery and worldworship and the mammongod thy elbows jerk as in strong swimmerstrokes and every stroke is bearing thee across the prisonditch within which vanity holds her workhouse and ragfair into lands of true liberty were the work done there is in broad europe one free man and thou art he  thus from the lowest depth there is a path to the loftiest height and for the poor also a gospel has been published surely if as dalembert asserts my illustrious namesake diogenes was the greatest man of antiquity only that he wanted decency then by stronger reason is george fox the greatest of the moderns and greater than diogenes himself for he too stands on the adamantine basis of his manhood casting aside all props and shoars yet not in halfsavage pride undervaluing the earth valuing it rather as a place to yield him warmth and food he looks heavenward from his earth and dwells in an element of mercy and worship with a still strength such as the cynics tub did nowise witness great truly was that tub a temple from which mans dignity and divinity was scornfully preached abroad but greater is the leather hull for the same sermon was preached there and not in scorn but in love   george foxs perennial suit with all that it held has been worn quite into ashes for nigh two centuries why in a discussion on the perfectibility of society reproduce it now not out of blind sectarian partisanship teufelsdrockh himself is no quaker with all his pacific tendencies did not we see him in that scene at the north cape with the archangel smuggler exhibit firearms  for us aware of his deep sansculottism there is more meant in this passage than meets the ear at the same time who can avoid smiling at the earnestness and boeotian simplicity if indeed there be not an underhand satire in it with which that incident is here brought forward and in the professors ambiguous way as clearly perhaps as he durst in weissnichtwo recommended to imitation does teufelsdrockh anticipate that in this age of refinement any considerable class of the community by way of testifying against the mammongod and escaping from what he calls vanitys workhouse and ragfair where doubtless some of them are toiled and whipped and hoodwinked sufficientlywill sheathe themselves in closefitting cases of leather the idea is ridiculous in the extreme will majesty lay aside its robes of state and beauty its frills and traingowns for a second skin of tanned hide by which change huddersfield and manchester and coventry and paisley and the fancybazaar were reduced to hungry solitudes and only day and martin could profit for neither would teufelsdrockhs mad daydream here as we presume covertly intended of levelling society levelling it indeed with a vengeance into one huge drowned marsh and so attaining the political effects of nudity without its frigorific or other consequencesbe thereby realized would not the rich man purchase a waterproof suit of russia leather and the highborn belle step forth in red or azure morocco lined with shamoy the black cowhide being left to the drudges and gibeonites of the world and so all the old distinctions be reestablished  or has the professor his own deeper intention and laughs in his sleeve at our strictures and glosses which indeed are but a part thereof    chapter ii churchclothes  not less questionable is his chapter on churchclothes which has the farther distinction of being the shortest in the volume we here translate it entire  by churchclothes it need not be premised that i mean infinitely more than cassocks and surplices and do not at all mean the mere haberdasher sunday clothes that men go to church in far from it churchclothes are in our vocabulary the forms the vestures under which men have at various periods embodied and represented for themselves the religious principle that is to say invested the divine idea of the world with a sensible and practically active body so that it might dwell among them as a living and lifegiving word  these are unspeakably the most important of all the vestures and garnitures of human existence they are first spun and woven i may say by that wonder of wonders society for it is still only when two or three are gathered together that religion spiritually existent and indeed indestructible however latent in each first outwardly manifests itself as with cloven tongues of fire and seeks to be embodied in a visible communion and church militant mystical more than magical is that communing of soul with soul both looking heavenward here properly soul first speaks with soul for only in looking heavenward take it in what sense you may not in looking earthward does what we can call union mutual love society begin to be possible how true is that of novalis it is certain my belief gains quite infinitely the moment i can convince another mind thereof gaze thou in the face of thy brother in those eyes where plays the lambent fire of kindness or in those where rages the lurid conflagration of anger feel how thy own so quiet soul is straightway involuntarily kindled with the like and ye blaze and reverberate on each other till it is all one limitless confluent flame of embracing love or of deadlygrappling hate and then say what miraculous virtue goes out of man into man but if so through all the thickplied hulls of our earthly life how much more when it is of the divine life we speak and inmost me is as it were brought into contact with inmost me  thus was it that i said the church clothes are first spun and woven by society outward religion originates by society society becomes possible by religion nay perhaps every conceivable society past and present may well be figured as properly and wholly a church in one or other of these three predicaments an audibly preaching and prophesying church which is the best second a church that struggles to preach and prophesy but cannot as yet till its pentecost come and third and worst a church gone dumb with old age or which only mumbles delirium prior to dissolution whoso fancies that by church is here meant chapterhouses and cathedrals or by preaching and prophesying mere speech and chanting let him says the oracular professor read on light of heart getrosten muthes  but with regard to your church proper and the churchclothes specially recognized as churchclothes i remark fearlessly enough that without such vestures and sacred tissues society has not existed and will not exist for if government is so to speak the outward skin of the body politic holding the whole together and protecting it and all your craftguilds and associations for industry of hand or of head are the fleshly clothes the muscular and osseous tissues lying under such skin whereby society stands and worksthen is religion the inmost pericardial and nervous tissue which ministers life and warm circulation to the whole without which pericardial tissue the bones and muscles of industry were inert or animated only by a galvanic vitality the skin would become a shrivelled pelt or fastrotting rawhide and society itself a dead carcassdeserving to be buried men were no longer social but gregarious which latter state also could not continue but must gradually issue in universal selfish discord hatred savage isolation and dispersionwhereby as we might continue to say the very dust and dead body of society would have evaporated and become abolished such and so allimportant allsustaining are the churchclothes to civilized or even to rational men  meanwhile in our era of the world those same churchclothes have gone sorrowfully outatelbows nay far worse many of them have become mere hollow shapes or masks under which no living figure or spirit any longer dwells but only spiders and unclean beetles in horrid accumulation drive their trade and the mask still glares on you with its glass eyes in ghastly affectation of lifesome generationandhalf after religion has quite withdrawn from it and in unnoticed nooks is weaving for herself new vestures wherewith to reappear and bless us or our sons or grandsons as a priest or interpreter of the holy is the noblest and highest of all men so is a shampriest scheinpriester the falsest and basest neither is it doubtful that his canonicals were they popes tiaras will one day be torn from him to make bandages for the wounds of mankind or even to burn into tinder for general scientific or culinary purposes  all which as out of place here falls to be handled in my second volume on the palingenesia or newbirth of society which volume as treating practically of the wear destruction and retexture of spiritual tissues or garments forms properly speaking the transcendental or ultimate portion of this my work on clothes and is already in a state of forwardness  and herewith no farther exposition note or commentary being added does teufelsdrockh and must his editor now terminate the singular chapter on churchclothes    chapter iii symbols  probably it will elucidate the drift of these foregoing obscure utterances if we here insert somewhat of our professors speculations on symbols to state his whole doctrine indeed were beyond our compass nowhere is he more mysterious impalpable than in this of fantasy being the organ of the godlike and how man thereby though based to all seeming on the small visible does nevertheless extend down into the infinite deeps of the invisible of which invisible indeed his life is properly the bodying forth let us omitting these high transcendental aspects of the matter study to glean whether from the paperbags or the printed volume what little seems logical and practical and cunningly arrange it into such degree of coherence as it will assume by way of proem take the following not injudicious remarks  the benignant efficacies of concealment cries our professor who shall speak or sing silence and secrecy altars might still be raised to them were this an altarbuilding time for universal worship silence is the element in which great things fashion themselves together that at length they may emerge fullformed and majestic into the daylight of life which they are thenceforth to rule not william the silent only but all the considerable men i have known and the most undiplomatic and unstrategic of these forbore to babble of what they were creating and projecting nay in thy own mean perplexities do thou thyself but hold thy tongue for one day on the morrow how much clearer are thy purposes and duties what wreck and rubbish have those mute workmen within thee swept away when intrusive noises were shut out speech is too often not as the frenchman defined it the art of concealing thought but of quite stifling and suspending thought so that there is none to conceal speech too is great but not the greatest as the swiss inscription says sprechen ist silbern schweigen ist golden speech is silvern silence is golden or as i might rather express it speech is of time silence is of eternity  bees will not work except in darkness thought will not work except in silence neither will virtue work except in secrecy let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth neither shalt thou prate even to thy own heart of those secrets known to all is not shame schaam the soil of all virtue of all good manners and good morals like other plants virtue will not grow unless its root be hidden buried from the eye of the sun let the sun shine on it nay do but look at it privily thyself the root withers and no flower will glad thee o my friends when we view the fair clustering flowers that overwreathe for example the marriagebower and encircle mans life with the fragrance and hues of heaven what hand will not smite the foul plunderer that grubs them up by the roots and with grinning grunting satisfaction shows us the dung they flourish in men speak much of the printing press with its newspapers du himmel what are these to clothes and the tailors goose  of kin to the so incalculable influences of concealment and connected with still greater things is the wondrous agency of symbols in a symbol there is concealment and yet revelation here therefore by silence and by speech acting together comes a double significance and if both the speech be itself high and the silence fit and noble how expressive will their union be thus in many a painted device or simple sealemblem the commonest truth stands out to us proclaimed with quite new emphasis  for it is here that fantasy with her mystic wonderland plays into the small prose domain of sense and becomes incorporated therewith in the symbol proper what we can call a symbol there is ever more or less distinctly and directly some embodiment and revelation of the infinite the infinite is made to blend itself with the finite to stand visible and as it were attainable there by symbols accordingly is man guided and commanded made happy made wretched he everywhere finds himself encompassed with symbols recognized as such or not recognized the universe is but one vast symbol of god nay if thou wilt have it what is man himself but a symbol of god is not all that he does symbolical a revelation to sense of the mystic godgiven force that is in him a gospel of freedom which he the messias of nature preaches as he can by act and word not a hut he builds but is the visible embodiment of a thought but bears visible record of invisible things but is in the transcendental sense symbolical as well as real  man says the professor elsewhere in quite antipodal contrast with these highsoaring delineations which we have here cut short on the verge of the inane man is by birth somewhat of an owl perhaps too of all the owleries that ever possessed him the most owlish if we consider it is that of your actually existing motivemillwrights fantastic tricks enough man has played in his time has fancied himself to be most things down even to an animated heap of glass but to fancy himself a dead ironbalance for weighing pains and pleasures on was reserved for this his latter era there stands he his universe one huge manger filled with hay and thistles to be weighed against each other and looks longeared enough alas poor devil spectres are appointed to haunt him one age he is hagridden bewitched the next priestridden befooled in all ages bedevilled and now the genius of mechanism smothers him worse than any nightmare did till the soul is nigh choked out of him and only a kind of digestive mechanic life remains in earth and in heaven he can see nothing but mechanism has fear for nothing else hope in nothing else the world would indeed grind him to pieces but cannot he fathom the doctrine of motives and cunningly compute these and mechanize them to grind the other way  were he not as has been said purblinded by enchantment you had but to bid him open his eyes and look in which country in which time was it hitherto that mans history or the history of any man went on by calculated or calculable motives what make ye of your christianities and chivalries and reformations and marseillaise hymns and reigns of terror nay has not perhaps the motivegrinder himself been in love did he never stand so much as a contested election leave him to time and the medicating virtue of nature  yes friends elsewhere observes the professor not our logical mensurative faculty but our imaginative one is king over us i might say priest and prophet to lead us heavenward or magician and wizard to lead us hellward nay even for the basest sensualist what is sense but the implement of fantasy the vessel it drinks out of ever in the dullest existence there is a sheen either of inspiration or of madness thou partly hast it in thy choice which of the two that gleams in from the circumambient eternity and colors with its own hues our little islet of time the understanding is indeed thy window too clear thou canst not make it but fantasy is thy eye with its colorgiving retina healthy or diseased have not i myself known five hundred living soldiers sabred into crowsmeat for a piece of glazed cotton which they called their flag which had you sold it at any marketcross would not have brought above three groschen did not the whole hungarian nation rise like some tumultuous moonstirred atlantic when kaiser joseph pocketed their iron crown an implement as was sagaciously observed in size and commercial value little differing from a horseshoe it is in and through symbols that man consciously or unconsciously lives works and has his being those ages moreover are accounted the noblest which can the best recognize symbolical worth and prize it the highest for is not a symbol ever to him who has eyes for it some dimmer or clearer revelation of the godlike  of symbols however i remark farther that they have both an extrinsic and intrinsic value oftenest the former only what for instance was in that clouted shoe which the peasants bore aloft with them as ensign in their bauernkrieg peasants war or in the walletandstaff round which the netherland gueux glorying in that nickname of beggars heroically rallied and prevailed though against king philip himself intrinsic significance these had none only extrinsic as the accidental standards of multitudes more or less sacredly uniting together in which union itself as above noted there is ever something mystical and borrowing of the godlike under a like category too stand or stood the stupidest heraldic coatsofarms military banners everywhere and generally all national or other sectarian costumes and customs they have no intrinsic necessary divineness or even worth but have acquired an extrinsic one nevertheless through all these there glimmers something of a divine idea as through military banners themselves the divine idea of duty of heroic daring in some instances of freedom of right nay the highest ensign that men ever met and embraced under the cross itself had no meaning save an accidental extrinsic one  another matter it is however when your symbol has intrinsic meaning and is of itself fit that men should unite round it let but the godlike manifest itself to sense let but eternity look more or less visibly through the timefigure zeitbild then is it fit that men unite there and worship together before such symbol and so from day to day and from age to age superadd to it new divineness  of this latter sort are all true works of art in them if thou know a work of art from a daub of artifice wilt thou discern eternity looking through time the godlike rendered visible here too may an extrinsic value gradually superadd itself thus certain iliads and the like have in three thousand years attained quite new significance but nobler than all in this kind are the lives of heroic godinspired men for what other work of art is so divine in death too in the death of the just as the last perfection of a work of art may we not discern symbolic meaning in that divinely transfigured sleep as of victory resting over the beloved face which now knows thee no more read if thou canst for tears the confluence of time with eternity and some gleam of the latter peering through  highest of all symbols are those wherein the artist or poet has risen into prophet and all men can recognize a present god and worship the same i mean religious symbols various enough have been such religious symbols what we call religions as men stood in this stage of culture or the other and could worse or better body forth the godlike some symbols with a transient intrinsic worth many with only an extrinsic if thou ask to what height man has carried it in this manner look on our divinest symbol on jesus of nazareth and his life and his biography and what followed therefrom higher has the human thought not yet reached this is christianity and christendom a symbol of quite perennial infinite character whose significance will ever demand to be anew inquired into and anew made manifest  but on the whole as time adds much to the sacredness of symbols so likewise in his progress he at length defaces or even desecrates them and symbols like all terrestrial garments wax old homers epos has not ceased to be true yet it is no longer our epos but shines in the distance if clearer and clearer yet also smaller and smaller like a receding star it needs a scientific telescope it needs to be reinterpreted and artificially brought near us before we can so much as know that it was a sun so likewise a day comes when the runic thor with his eddas must withdraw into dimness and many an african mumbojumbo and indian pawaw be utterly abolished for all things even celestial luminaries much more atmospheric meteors have their rise their culmination their decline  small is this which thou tellest me that the royal sceptre is but a piece of gilt wood that the pyx has become a most foolish box and truly as ancient pistol thought of little price a right conjurer might i name thee couldst thou conjure back into these wooden tools the divine virtue they once held  of this thing however be certain wouldst thou plant for eternity then plant into the deep infinite faculties of man his fantasy and heart wouldst thou plant for year and day then plant into his shallow superficial faculties his selflove and arithmetical understanding what will grow there a hierarch therefore and pontiff of the world will we call him the poet and inspired maker who prometheuslike can shape new symbols and bring new fire from heaven to fix it there such too will not always be wanting neither perhaps now are meanwhile as the average of matters goes we account him legislator and wise who can so much as tell when a symbol has grown old and gently remove it  when as the last english coronation  i was preparing concludes this wonderful professor i read in their newspapers that the champion of england he who has to offer battle to the universe for his new king had brought it so far that he could now mount his horse with little assistance i said to myself here also we have a symbol wellnigh superannuated alas move whithersoever you may are not the tatters and rags of superannuated wornout symbols in this ragfair of a world dropping off everywhere to hoodwink to halter to tether you nay if you shake them not aside threatening to accumulate and perhaps produce suffocation        that of george ived    chapter iv helotage  at this point we determine on adverting shortly or rather reverting to a certain tract of hofrath heuschreckes entitled institute for the repression of population which lies dishonorably enough with torn leaves and a perceptible smell of aloetic drugs stuffed into the bag pisces not indeed for the sake of the tract itself which we admire little but of the marginal notes evidently in teufelsdrockhs hand which rather copiously fringe it a few of these may be in their right place here  into the hofraths institute with its extraordinary schemes and machinery of corresponding boards and the like we shall not so much as glance enough for us to understand that heuschrecke is a disciple of malthus and so zealous for the doctrine that his zeal almost literally eats him up a deadly fear of population possesses the hofrath something like a fixed idea undoubtedly akin to the more diluted forms of madness nowhere in that quarter of his intellectual world is there light nothing but a grim shadow of hunger open mouths opening wider and wider a world to terminate by the frightfullest consummation by its too dense inhabitants famished into delirium universally eating one another to make air for himself in which strangulation choking enough to a benevolent heart the hofrath founds or proposes to found this institute of his as the best he can do it is only with our professors comments thereon that we concern ourselves  first then remark that teufelsdrockh as a speculative radical has his own notions about human dignity that the zahdarm palaces and courtesies have not made him forgetful of the futteral cottages on the blank cover of heuschreckes tract we find the following indistinctly engrossed  two men i honor and no third first the toilworn craftsman that with earthmade implement laboriously conquers the earth and makes her mans venerable to me is the hard hand crooked coarse wherein notwithstanding lies a cunning virtue indefeasibly royal as of the sceptre of this planet venerable too is the rugged face all weathertanned besoiled with its rude intelligence for it is the face of a man living manlike oh but the more venerable for thy rudeness and even because we must pity as well as love thee hardlyentreated brother for us was thy back so bent for us were thy straight limbs and fingers so deformed thou wert our conscript on whom the lot fell and fighting our battles wert so marred for in thee too lay a godcreated form but it was not to be unfolded encrusted must it stand with the thick adhesions and defacements of labor and thy body like thy soul was not to know freedom yet toil on toil on thou art in thy duty be out of it who may thou toilest for the altogether indispensable for daily bread  a second man i honor and still more highly him who is seen toiling for the spiritually indispensable not daily bread but the bread of life is not he too in his duty endeavoring towards inward harmony revealing this by act or by word through all his outward endeavors be they high or low highest of all when his outward and his inward endeavor are one when we can name him artist not earthly craftsman only but inspired thinker who with heavenmade implement conquers heaven for us if the poor and humble toil that we have food must not the high and glorious toil for him in return that he have light have guidance freedom immortalitythese two in all their degrees i honor all else is chaff and dust which let the wind blow whither it listeth  unspeakably touching is it however when i find both dignities united and he that must toil outwardly for the lowest of mans wants is also toiling inwardly for the highest sublimer in this world know i nothing than a peasant saint could such now anywhere be met with such a one will take thee back to nazareth itself thou wilt see the splendor of heaven spring forth from the humblest depths of earth like a light shining in great darkness  and again it is not because of his toils that i lament for the poor we must all toil or steal howsoever we name our stealing which is worse no faithful workman finds his task a pastime the poor is hungry and athirst but for him also there is food and drink he is heavyladen and weary but for him also the heavens send sleep and of the deepest in his smoky cribs a clear dewy heaven of rest envelops him and fitful glitterings of cloudskirted dreams but what i do mourn over is that the lamp of his soul should go out that no ray of heavenly or even of earthly knowledge should visit him but only in the haggard darkness like two spectres fear and indignation bear him company alas while the body stands so broad and brawny must the soul lie blinded dwarfed stupefied almost annihilated alas was this too a breath of god bestowed in heaven but on earth never to be unfoldedthat there should one man die ignorant who had capacity for knowledge this i call a tragedy were it to happen more than twenty times in the minute as by some computations it does the miserable fraction of science which our united mankind in a wide universe of nescience has acquired why is not this with all diligence imparted to all  quite in an opposite strain is the following the old spartans had a wiser method and went out and hunted down their helots and speared and spitted them when they grew too numerous with our improved fashions of hunting herr hofrath now after the invention of firearms and standing armies how much easier were such a hunt perhaps in the most thickly peopled country some three days annually might suffice to shoot all the ablebodied paupers that had accumulated within the year let governments think of this the expense were trifling nay the very carcasses would pay it have them salted and barrelled could not you victual therewith if not army and navy yet richly such infirm paupers in workhouses and elsewhere as enlightened charity dreading no evil of them might see good to keep alive  and yet writes he farther on there must be something wrong a fullformed horse will in any market bring from twenty to as high as two hundred friedrichs dor such is his worth to the world a fullformed man is not only worth nothing to the world but the world could afford him a round sum would he simply engage to go and hang himself nevertheless which of the two was the more cunningly devised article even as an engine good heavens a white european man standing on his two legs with his two fivefingered hands at his shacklebones and miraculous head on his shoulders is worth i should say from fifty to a hundred horses  true thou goldhofrath cries the professor elsewhere too crowded indeed meanwhile what portion of this inconsiderable terraqueous globe have ye actually tilled and delved till it will grow no more how thick stands your population in the pampas and savannas of america round ancient carthage and in the interior of africa on both slopes of the altaic chain in the central platform of asia in spain greece turkey crim tartary the curragh of kildare one man in one year as i have understood it if you lend him earth will feed himself and nine others alas where now are the hengsts and alarics of our stillglowing stillexpanding europe who when their home is grown too narrow will enlist and like firepillars guide onwards those superfluous masses of indomitable living valor equipped not now with the battleaxe and warchariot but with the steam engine and ploughshare where are theypreserving their game    chapter v the phoenix  putting which four singular chapters together and alongside of them numerous hints and even direct utterances scattered over these writings of his we come upon the startling yet not quite unlookedfor conclusion that teufelsdrockh is one of those who consider society properly so called to be as good as extinct and that only the gregarious feelings and old inherited habitudes at this juncture hold us from dispersion and universal national civil domestic and personal war he says expressly for the last three centuries above all for the last three quarters of a century that same pericardial nervous tissue as we named it of religion where lies the lifeessence of society has been smote at and perforated needfully and needlessly till now it is quite rent into shreds and society long pining diabetic consumptive can be regarded as defunct for those spasmodic galvanic sprawlings are not life neither indeed will they endure galvanize as you may beyond two days  call ye that a society cries he again where there is no longer any social idea extant not so much as the idea of a common home but only of a common overcrowded lodginghouse where each isolated regardless of his neighbor turned against his neighbor clutches what he can get and cries mine and calls it peace because in the cutpurse and cutthroat scramble no steel knives but only a far cunninger sort can be employed where friendship communion has become an incredible tradition and your holiest sacramental supper is a smoking tavern dinner with cook for evangelist where your priest has no tongue but for platelicking and your high guides and governors cannot guide but on all hands hear it passionately proclaimed laissez faire leave us alone of your guidance such light is darker than darkness eat you your wages and sleep  thus too continues he does an observant eye discern everywhere that saddest spectacle the poor perishing like neglected foundered draughtcattle of hunger and overwork the rich still more wretchedly of idleness satiety and overgrowth the highest in rank at length without honor from the lowest scarcely with a little mouthhonor as from tavernwaiters who expect to put it in the bill oncesacred symbols fluttering as empty pageants whereof men grudge even the expense a world becoming dismantled in one word the state fallen speechless from obesity and apoplexy the state shrunken into a policeoffice straitened to get its pay  we might ask are there many observant eyes belonging to practical men in england or elsewhere which have descried these phenomena or is it only from the mystic elevation of a german wahngasse that such wonders are visible teufelsdrockh contends that the aspect of a deceased or expiring society fronts us everywhere so that whoso runs may read what for example says he is the universally arrogated virtue almost the sole remaining catholic virtue of these days for some halfcentury it has been the thing you name independence suspicion of servility of reverence for superiors the very dogleech is anxious to disavow fools were your superiors worthy to govern and you worthy to obey reverence for them were even your only possible freedom independence in all kinds is rebellion if unjust rebellion why parade it and everywhere prescribe it  but what then are we returning as rousseau prayed to the state of nature the soul politic having departed says teufelsdrockh what can follow but that the body politic be decently interred to avoid putrescence liberals economists utilitarians enough i see marching with its bier and chanting loud paeans towards the funeral pile where amid wailings from some and saturnalian revelries from the most the venerable corpse is to be burnt or in plain words that these men liberals utilitarians or whatsoever they are called will ultimately carry their point and dissever and destroy most existing institutions of society seems a thing which has some time ago ceased to be doubtful  do we not see a little subdivision of the grand utilitarian armament come to light even in insulated england a living nucleus that will attract and grow does at length appear there also and under curious phasis properly as the inconsiderable fagend and so far in the rear of the others as to fancy itself the van our european mechanizers are a sect of boundless diffusion activity and cooperative spirit has not utilitarianism flourished in high places of thought here among ourselves and in every european country at some time or other within the last fifty years if now in all countries except perhaps england it has ceased to flourish or indeed to exist among thinkers and sunk to journalists and the popular masswho sees not that as hereby it no longer preaches so the reason is it now needs no preaching but is in full universal action the doctrine everywhere known and enthusiastically laid to heart the fit pabulum in these times for a certain rugged workshop intellect and heart nowise without their corresponding workshop strength and ferocity it requires but to be stated in such scenes to make proselytes enoughadmirably calculated for destroying only not for rebuilding it spreads like a sort of dogmadness till the whole worldkennel will be rabid then woe to the huntsmen with or without their whips they should have given the quadrupeds water adds he the water namely of knowledge and of life while it was yet time  thus if professor teufelsdrockh can be relied on we are at this hour in a most critical condition beleaguered by that boundless armament of mechanizers and unbelievers threatening to strip us bare the world says he as it needs must is under a process of devastation and waste which whether by silent assiduous corrosion or open quicker combustion as the case chances will effectually enough annihilate the past forms of society replace them with what it may for the present it is contemplated that when mans whole spiritual interests are once divested these innumerable striptoff garments shall mostly be burnt but the sounder rags among them be quilted together into one huge irish watchcoat for the defence of the body onlythis we think is but jobsnews to the humane reader  nevertheless cries teufelsdrockh who can hinder it who is there that can clutch into the wheelspokes of destiny and say to the spirit of the time turn back i command theewiser were it that we yielded to the inevitable and inexorable and accounted even this the best  nay might not an attentive editor drawing his own inferences from what stands written conjecture that teufelsdrockh individually had yielded to this same inevitable and inexorable heartily enough and now sat waiting the issue with his natural diabolicoangelical indifference if not even placidity did we not hear him complain that the world was a huge ragfair and the rags and tatters of old symbols were raining down everywhere like to drift him in and suffocate him what with those unhunted helots of his and the uneven sic vos non vobis pressure and hardcrashing collision he is pleased to discern in existing things what with the so hateful empty masks full of beetles and spiders yet glaring out on him from their glass eyes with a ghastly affectation of lifewe feel entitled to conclude him even willing that much should be thrown to the devil so it were but done gently safe himself in that pinnacle of weissnichtwo he would consent with a tragic solemnity that the monster utilitaria held back indeed and moderated by noserings halters footshackles and every conceivable modification of rope should go forth to do her workto tread down old ruinous palaces and temples with her broad hoof till the whole were trodden down that new and better might be built remarkable in this point of view are the following sentences  society says he is not dead that carcass which you call dead society is but her mortal coil which she has shuffled off to assume a nobler she herself through perpetual metamorphoses in fairer and fairer development has to live till time also merge in eternity wheresoever two or three living men are gathered together there is society or there it will be with its cunning mechanisms and stupendous structures overspreading this little globe and reaching upwards to heaven and downwards to gehenna for always under one or the other figure it has two authentic revelations of a god and of a devil the pulpit namely and the gallows  indeed we already heard him speak of religion in unnoticed nooks weaving for herself new vesturesteufelsdrockh himself being one of the loomtreadles elsewhere he quotes without censure that strange aphorism of saint simons concerning which and whom so much were to be said lage dor quune aveugle tradition a place jusquici dans le passe est devant nous the golden age which a blind tradition has hitherto placed in the past is before usbut listen again  when the phoenix is fanning her funeral pyre will there not be sparks flying alas some millions of men and among them such as a napoleon have already been licked into that higheddying flame and like moths consumed there still also have we to fear that incautious beards will get singed  for the rest in what year of grace such phoenixcremation will be completed you need not ask the law of perseverance is among the deepest in man by nature he hates change seldom will he quit his old house till it has actually fallen about his ears thus have i seen solemnities linger as ceremonies sacred symbols as idle pageants to the extent of three hundred years and more after all life and sacredness had evaporated out of them and then finally what time the phoenix deathbirth itself will require depends on unseen contingenciesmeanwhile would destiny offer mankind that after say two centuries of convulsion and conflagration more or less vivid the firecreation should be accomplished and we to find ourselves again in a living society and no longer fighting but workingwere it not perhaps prudent in mankind to strike the bargain  thus is teufelsdrockh content that old sick society should be deliberately burnt alas with quite other fuel than spicewood in the faith that she is a phoenix and that a new heavenborn young one will rise out of her ashes we ourselves restricted to the duty of indicator shall forbear commentary meanwhile will not the judicious reader shake his head and reproachfully yet more in sorrow than in anger say or think from a doctor utriusque juris titular professor in a university and man to whom hitherto for his services society bad as she is has given not only food and raiment of a kind but books tobacco and gukguk we expected more gratitude to his benefactress and less of a blind trust in the future which resembles that rather of a philosophical fatalist and enthusiast than of a solid householder paying scotandlot in a christian country    chapter vi old clothes  as mentioned above teufelsdrockh though a sansculottist is in practice probably the politest man extant his whole heart and life are penetrated and informed with the spirit of politeness a noble natural courtesy shines through him beautifying his vagaries like sunlight making a rosyfingered rainbowdyed aurora out of mere aqueous clouds nay brightening londonsmoke itself into gold vapor as from the crucible of an alchemist hear in what earnest though fantastic wise he expresses himself on this head  shall courtesy be done only to the rich and only by the rich in goodbreeding which differs if at all from highbreeding only as it gracefully remembers the rights of others rather than gracefully insists on its own rights i discern no special connection with wealth or birth but rather that it lies in human nature itself and is due from all men towards all men of a truth were your schoolmaster at his post and worth anything when there this with so much else would be reformed nay each man were then also his neighbors schoolmaster till at length a rudevisaged unmannered peasant could no more be met with than a peasant unacquainted with botanical physiology or who felt not that the clod he broke was created in heaven  for whether thou bear a sceptre or a sledgehammer art not thou alive is not this thy brother alive there is but one temple in the world says novalis and that temple is the body of man nothing is holier than this high form bending before men is a reverence done to this revelation in the flesh we touch heaven when we lay our hands on a human body  on which ground i would fain carry it farther than most do and whereas the english johnson only bowed to every clergyman or man with a shovelhat i would bow to every man with any sort of hat or with no hat whatever is not he a temple then the visible manifestation and impersonation of the divinity and yet alas such indiscriminate bowing serves not for there is a devil dwells in man as well as a divinity and too often the bow is but pocketed by the former it would go to the pocket of vanity which is your clearest phasis of the devil in these times therefore must we withhold it  the gladder am i on the other hand to do reverence to those shells and outer husks of the body wherein no devilish passion any longer lodges but only the pure emblem and effigies of man i mean to empty or even to cast clothes nay is it not to clothes that most men do reverence to the fine frogged broadcloth nowise to the straddling animal with bandy legs which it holds and makes a dignitary of who ever saw any lord mylorded in tattered blanket fastened with wooden skewer nevertheless i say there is in such worship a shade of hypocrisy a practical deception for how often does the body appropriate what was meant for the cloth only whoso would avoid falsehood which is the essence of all sin will perhaps see good to take a different course that reverence which cannot act without obstruction and perversion when the clothes are full may have free course when they are empty even as for hindoo worshippers the pagoda is not less sacred than the god so do i too worship the hollow cloth garment with equal fervor as when it contained the man nay with more for i now fear no deception of myself or of others  did not king toomtabard or in other words john baliol reign long over scotland the man john baliol being quite gone and only the toom tabard empty gown remaining what still dignity dwells in a suit of cast clothes how meekly it bears its honors no haughty looks no scornful gesture silent and serene it fronts the world neither demanding worship nor afraid to miss it the hat still carries the physiognomy of its head but the vanity and the stupidity and goosespeech which was the sign of these two are gone the coatarm is stretched out but not to strike the breeches in modest simplicity depend at ease and now at last have a graceful flow the waistcoat hides no evil passion no riotous desire hunger or thirst now dwells not in it thus all is purged from the grossness of sense from the carking cares and foul vices of the world and rides there on its clotheshorse as on a pegasus might some skyey messenger or purified apparition visiting our low earth  often while i sojourned in that monstrous tuberosity of civilized life the capital of england and meditated and questioned destiny under that inksea of vapor black thick and multifarious as spartan broth and was one lone soul amid those grinding millionsoften have i turned into their oldclothes market to worship with awestruck heart i walk through that monmouth street with its empty suits as through a sanhedrim of stainless ghosts silent are they but expressive in their silence the past witnesses and instruments of woe and joy of passions virtues crimes and all the fathomless tumult of good and evil in the prison men call life friends trust not the heart of that man for whom old clothes are not venerable watch too with reverence that bearded jewish highpriest who with hoarse voice like some angel of doom summons them from the four winds on his head like the pope he has three hatsa real triple tiara on either hand are the similitude of wings whereon the summoned garments come to alight and ever as he slowly cleaves the air sounds forth his deep fateful note as if through a trumpet he were proclaiming ghosts of life come to judgment reck not ye fluttering ghosts he will purify you in his purgatory with fire and with water and one day newcreated ye shall reappear oh let him in whom the flame of devotion is ready to go out who has never worshipped and knows not what to worship pace and repace with austerest thought the pavement of monmouth street and say whether his heart and his eyes still continue dry if field lane with its long fluttering rows of yellow handkerchiefs be a dionysius ear where in stifled jarring hubbub we hear the indictment which poverty and vice bring against lazy wealth that it has left them there cast out and trodden under foot of want darkness and the devilthen is monmouth street a mirzas hill where in motley vision the whole pageant of existence passes awfully before us with its wail and jubilee mad loves and mad hatreds churchbells and gallowsropes farcetragedy beastgodhoodthe bedlam of creation   to most men as it does to ourselves all this will seem overcharged we too have walked through monmouth street but with little feeling of devotion probably in part because the contemplative process is so fatally broken in upon by the brood of moneychangers who nestle in that church and importune the worshipper with merely secular proposals whereas teufelsdrockh might be in that happy middle state which leaves to the clothesbroker no hope either of sale or of purchase and so be allowed to linger there without molestationsomething we would have given to see the little philosophical figure with its steeplehat and loose flowing skirts and eyes in a fine frenzy pacing and repacing in austerest thought that foolish street which to him was a true delphic avenue and supernatural whisperinggallery where the ghosts of life rounded strange secrets in his ear o thou philosophic teufelsdrockh that listenest while others only gabble and with thy quick tympanum hearest the grass grow  at the same time is it not strange that in paperbag documents destined for an english work there exists nothing like an authentic diary of this his sojourn in london and of his meditations among the clothesshops only the obscurest emblematic shadows neither in conversation for indeed he was not a man to pester you with his travels have we heard him more than allude to the subject  for the rest however it cannot be uninteresting that we here find how early the significance of clothes had dawned on the now so distinguished clothesprofessor might we but fancy it to have been even in monmouth street at the bottom of our own english inksea that this remarkable volume first took being and shot forth its salient point in his soulas in chaos did the egg of eros one day to be hatched into a universe    chapter vii organic filaments  for us who happen to live while the worldphoenix is burning herself and burning so slowly that as teufelsdrockh calculates it were a handsome bargain would she engage to have done within two centuries there seems to lie but an ashy prospect not altogether so however does the professor figure it in the living subject says he change is wont to be gradual thus while the serpent sheds its old skin the new is already formed beneath little knowest thou of the burning of a worldphoenix who fanciest that she must first burn out and lie as a dead cinereous heap and therefrom the young one start up by miracle and fly heavenward far otherwise in that firewhirlwind creation and destruction proceed together ever as the ashes of the old are blown about do organic filaments of the new mysteriously spin themselves and amid the rushing and the waving of the whirlwind element come tones of a melodious deathsong which end not but in tones of a more melodious birthsong nay look into the firewhirlwind with thy own eyes and thou wilt see let us actually look then to poor individuals who cannot expect to live two centuries those same organic filaments mysteriously spinning themselves will be the best part of the spectacle first therefore this of mankind in general  in vain thou deniest it says the professor thou art my brother thy very hatred thy very envy those foolish lies thou tellest of me in thy splenetic humor what is all this but an inverted sympathy were i a steamengine wouldst thou take the trouble to tell lies of me not thou i should grind all unheeded whether badly or well  wondrous truly are the bonds that unite us one and all whether by the soft binding of love or the iron chaining of necessity as we like to choose it more than once have i said to myself of some perhaps whimsically strutting figure such as provokes whimsical thoughts wert thou my little brotherkin suddenly covered up within the largest imaginable glass bellwhat a thing it were not for thyself only but for the world post letters more or fewer from all the four winds impinge against thy glass walls but have to drop unread neither from within comes there question or response into any postbag thy thoughts fall into no friendly ear or heart thy manufacture into no purchasing hand thou art no longer a circulating venousarterial heart that taking and giving circulatest through all space and all time there has a hole fallen out in the immeasurable universal worldtissue which must be darned up again  such venousarterial circulation of letters verbal messages paper and other packages going out from him and coming in are a bloodcirculation visible to the eye but the finer nervous circulation by which all things the minutest that he does minutely influence all men and the very look of his face blesses or curses whomso it lights on and so generates ever new blessing or new cursing all this you cannot see but only imagine i say there is not a red indian hunting by lake winnipeg can quarrel with his squaw but the whole world must smart for it will not the price of beaver rise it is a mathematical fact that the casting of this pebble from my hand alters the centre of gravity of the universe  if now an existing generation of men stand so woven together not less indissolubly does generation with generation hast thou ever meditated on that word tradition how we inherit not life only but all the garniture and form of life and work and speak and even think and feel as our fathers and primeval grandfathers from the beginning have given it uswho printed thee for example this unpretending volume on the philosophy of clothes not the herren stillschweigen and company but cadmus of thebes faust of mentz and innumerable others whom thou knowest not had there been no moesogothic ulfila there had been no english shakspeare or a different one simpleton it was tubalcain that made thy very tailors needle and sewed that courtsuit of thine  yes truly if nature is one and a living indivisible whole much more is mankind the image that reflects and creates nature without which nature were not as palpable lifestreams in that wondrous individual mankind among so many lifestreams that are not palpable flow on those main currents of what we call opinion as preserved in institutions polities churches above all in books beautiful it is to understand and know that a thought did never yet die that as thou the originator thereof hast gathered it and created it from the whole past so thou wilt transmit it to the whole future it is thus that the heroic heart the seeing eye of the first times still feels and sees in us of the latest that the wise man stands ever encompassed and spiritually embraced by a cloud of witnesses and brothers and there is a living literal communion of saints wide as the world itself and as the history of the world  noteworthy also and serviceable for the progress of this same individual wilt thou find his subdivision into generations generations are as the days of toilsome mankind death and birth are the vesper and the matin bells that summon mankind to sleep and to rise refreshed for new advancement what the father has made the son can make and enjoy but has also work of his own appointed him thus all things wax and roll onwards arts establishments opinions nothing is completed but ever completing newton has learned to see what kepler saw but there is also a fresh heavenderived force in newton he must mount to still higher points of vision so too the hebrew lawgiver is in due time followed by an apostle of the gentiles in the business of destruction as this also is from time to time a necessary work thou findest a like sequence and perseverance for luther it was as yet hot enough to stand by that burning of the popes bull voltaire could not warm himself at the glimmering ashes but required quite other fuel thus likewise i note the english whig has in the second generation become an english radical who in the third again it is to be hoped will become an english rebuilder find mankind where thou wilt thou findest it in living movement in progress faster or slower the phoenix soars aloft hovers with outstretched wings filling earth with her music or as now she sinks and with spheral swansong immolates herself in flame that she may soar the higher and sing the clearer  let the friends of social order in such a disastrous period lay this to heart and derive from it any little comfort they can we subjoin another passage concerning titles  remark not without surprise says teufelsdrockh how all high titles of honor come hitherto from fighting your herzog duke dux is leader of armies your earl jarl is strong man your marshal cavalry horseshoer a millennium or reign of peace and wisdom having from of old been prophesied and becoming now daily more and more indubitable may it not be apprehended that such fighting titles will cease to be palatable and new and higher need to be devised  the only title wherein i with confidence trace eternity is that of king konig king anciently konning means kenning cunning or which is the same thing canning ever must the sovereign of mankind be fitly entitled king  well also says he elsewhere was it written by theologians a king rules by divine right he carries in him an authority from god or man will never give it him can i choose my own king i can choose my own king popinjay and play what farce or tragedy i may with him but he who is to be my ruler whose will is to be higher than my will was chosen for me in heaven neither except in such obedience to the heavenchosen is freedom so much as conceivable   the editor will here admit that among all the wondrous provinces of teufelsdrockhs spiritual world there is none he walks in with such astonishment hesitation and even pain as in the political how with our english love of ministry and opposition and that generous conflict of parties mind warming itself against mind in their mutual wrestle for the public good by which wrestle indeed is our invaluable constitution kept warm and alive how shall we domesticate ourselves in this spectral necropolis or rather city both of the dead and of the unborn where the present seems little other than an inconsiderable film dividing the past and the future in those dim longdrawn expanses all is so immeasurable much so disastrous ghastly your very radiances and straggling lightbeams have a supernatural character and then with such an indifference such a prophetic peacefulness accounting the inevitably coming as already here to him all one whether it be distant by centuries or only by days does he sitand live you would say rather in any other age than in his own it is our painful duty to announce or repeat that looking into this man we discern a deep silent slowburning inextinguishable radicalism such as fills us with shuddering admiration  thus for example he appears to make little even of the elective franchise at least so we interpret the following satisfy yourselves he says by universal indubitable experiment even as ye are now doing or will do whether freedom heavenborn and leading heavenward and so vitally essential for us all cannot peradventure be mechanically hatched and brought to light in that same ballotbox of yours or at worst in some other discoverable or devisable box edifice or steammechanism it were a mighty convenience and beyond all feats of manufacture witnessed hitherto is teufelsdrockh acquainted with the british constitution even slightlyhe says under another figure but after all were the problem as indeed it now everywhere is to rebuild your old house from the top downwards since you must live in it the while what better what other than the representative machine will serve your turn meanwhile however mock me not with the name of free when you have but knit up my chains into ornamental festoonsor what will any member of the peace society make of such an assertion as this the lower people everywhere desire war not so unwisely there is then a demand for lower peopleto be shot  gladly therefore do we emerge from those soulconfusing labyrinths of speculative radicalism into somewhat clearer regions here looking round as was our hest for organic filaments we ask may not this touching heroworship be of the number it seems of a cheerful character yet so quaint so mystical one knows not what or how little may lie under it our readers shall look with their own eyes  true is it that in these days man can do almost all things only not obey true likewise that whoso cannot obey cannot be free still less bear rule he that is the inferior of nothing can be the superior of nothing the equal of nothing nevertheless believe not that man has lost his faculty of reverence that if it slumber in him it has gone dead painful for man is that same rebellious independence when it has become inevitable only in loving companionship with his fellows does he feel safe only in reverently bowing down before the higher does he feel himself exalted  or what if the character of our so troublous era lay even in this that man had forever cast away fear which is the lower but not yet risen into perennial reverence which is the higher and highest  meanwhile observe with joy so cunningly has nature ordered it that whatsoever man ought to obey he cannot but obey before no faintest revelation of the godlike did he ever stand irreverent least of all when the godlike showed itself revealed in his fellowman thus is there a true religious loyalty forever rooted in his heart nay in all ages even in ours it manifests itself as a more or less orthodox heroworship in which fact that heroworship exists has existed and will forever exist universally among mankind mayest thou discern the cornerstone of living rock whereon all polities for the remotest time may stand secure  do our readers discern any such cornerstone or even so much as what teufelsdrockh is looking at he exclaims or hast thou forgotten paris and voltaire how the aged withered man though but a sceptic mocker and millinery courtpoet yet because even he seemed the wisest best could drag mankind at his chariotwheels so that princes coveted a smile from him and the loveliest of france would have laid their hair beneath his feet all paris was one vast temple of heroworship though their divinity moreover was of feature too apish  but if such things continues he were done in the dry tree what will be done in the green if in the most parched season of mans history in the most parched spot of europe when parisian life was at best but a scientific hortus siccus bedizened with some italian gumflowers such virtue could come out of it what is to be looked for when life again waves leafy and bloomy and your herodivinity shall have nothing apelike but be wholly human know that there is in man a quite indestructible reverence for whatsoever holds of heaven or even plausibly counterfeits such holding show the dullest clodpoll show the haughtiest featherhead that a soul higher than himself is actually here were his knees stiffened into brass he must down and worship  organic filaments of a more authentic sort mysteriously spinning themselves some will perhaps discover in the following passage  there is no church sayest thou the voice of prophecy has gone dumb this is even what i dispute but in any case hast thou not still preaching enough a preaching friar settles himself in every village and builds a pulpit which he calls newspaper therefrom he preaches what most momentous doctrine is in him for mans salvation and dost not thou listen and believe look well thou seest everywhere a new clergy of the mendicant orders some barefooted some almost barebacked fashion itself into shape and teach and preach zealously enough for copper alms and the love of god these break in pieces the ancient idols and though themselves too often reprobate as idolbreakers are wont to be mark out the sites of new churches where the true godordained that are to follow may find audience and minister said i not before the old skin was shed the new had formed itself beneath it  perhaps also in the following wherewith we now hasten to knit up this ravelled sleeve  but there is no religion reiterates the professor fool i tell thee there is hast thou well considered all that lies in this immeasurable frothocean we name literature fragments of a genuine churchhomiletic lie scattered there which time will assort nay fractions even of a liturgy could i point out and knowest thou no prophet even in the vesture environment and dialect of this age none to whom the godlike had revealed itself through all meanest and highest forms of the common and by him been again prophetically revealed in whose inspired melody even in these raggathering and ragburning days mans life again begins were it but afar off to be divine knowest thou none such i know him and name himgoethe  but thou as yet standest in no temple joinest in no psalmworship feelest well that where there is no ministering priest the people perish be of comfort thou art not alone if thou have faith spake we not of a communion of saints unseen yet not unreal accompanying and brotherlike embracing thee so thou be worthy their heroic sufferings rise up melodiously together to heaven out of all lands and out of all times as a sacred miserere their heroic actions also as a boundless everlasting psalm of triumph neither say that thou hast now no symbol of the godlike is not gods universe a symbol of the godlike is not immensity a temple is not mans history and mens history a perpetual evangel listen and for organmusic thou wilt ever as of old hear the morning stars sing together    chapter viii natural supernaturalism  it is in his stupendous section headed natural supernaturalism that the professor first becomes a seer and after long effort such as we have witnessed finally subdues under his feet this refractory clothesphilosophy and takes victorious possession thereof phantasms enough he has had to struggle with clothwebs and cobwebs of imperial mantles superannuated symbols and what not yet still did he courageously pierce through nay worst of all two quite mysterious worldembracing phantasms time and space have ever hovered round him perplexing and bewildering but with these also he now resolutely grapples these also he victoriously rends asunder in a word he has looked fixedly on existence till one after the other its earthly hulls and garnitures have all melted away and now to his rapt vision the interior celestial holyofholies lies disclosed  here therefore properly it is that the philosophy of clothes attains to transcendentalism this last leap can we but clear it takes us safe into the promised land where palingenesia in all senses may be considered as beginning courage then may our diogenes exclaim with better right than diogenes the first once did this stupendous section we after long painful meditation have found not to be unintelligible but on the contrary to grow clear nay radiant and allilluminating let the reader turning on it what utmost force of speculative intellect is in him do his part as we by judicious selection and adjustment shall study to do ours  deep has been and is the significance of miracles thus quietly begins the professor far deeper perhaps than we imagine meanwhile the question of questions were what specially is a miracle to that dutch king of siam an icicle had been a miracle whoso had carried with him an airpump and vial of vitriolic ether might have worked a miracle to my horse again who unhappily is still more unscientific do not i work a miracle and magical open sesame every time i please to pay twopence and open for him an impassable schlagbaum or shut turnpike  but is not a real miracle simply a violation of the laws of nature ask several whom i answer by this new question what are the laws of nature to me perhaps the rising of one from the dead were no violation of these laws but a confirmation were some far deeper law now first penetrated into and by spiritual force even as the rest have all been brought to bear on us with its material force  here too may some inquire not without astonishment on what ground shall one that can make iron swim come and declare that therefore he can teach religion to us truly of the nineteenth century such declaration were inept enough which nevertheless to our fathers of the first century was full of meaning  but is it not the deepest law of nature that she be constant cries an illuminated class is not the machine of the universe fixed to move by unalterable rules probable enough good friends nay i too must believe that the god whom ancient inspired men assert to be without variableness or shadow of turning does indeed never change that nature that the universe which no one whom it so pleases can be prevented from calling a machine does move by the most unalterable rules and now of you too i make the old inquiry what those same unalterable rules forming the complete statutebook of nature may possibly be  they stand written in our works of science say you in the accumulated records of mans experiencewas man with his experience present at the creation then to see how it all went on have any deepest scientific individuals yet dived down to the foundations of the universe and gauged everything there did the maker take them into his counsel that they read his groundplan of the incomprehensible all and can say this stands marked therein and no more than this alas not in anywise these scientific individuals have been nowhere but where we also are have seen some hand breadths deeper than we see into the deep that is infinite without bottom as without shore  laplaces book on the stars wherein he exhibits that certain planets with their satellites gyrate round our worthy sun at a rate and in a course which by greatest good fortune he and the like of him have succeeded in detectingis to me as precious as to another but is this what thou namest mechanism of the heavens and system of the world this wherein sirius and the pleiades and all herschels fifteen thousand suns per minute being left out some paltry handful of moons and inert balls had beenlooked at nicknamed and marked in the zodiacal waybill so that we can now prate of their whereabout their how their why their what being hid from us as in the signless inane  system of nature to the wisest man wide as is his vision nature remains of quite infinite depth of quite infinite expansion and all experience thereof limits itself to some few computed centuries and measured squaremiles the course of natures phases on this our little fraction of a planet is partially known to us but who knows what deeper courses these depend on what infinitely larger cycle of causes our little epicycle revolves on to the minnow every cranny and pebble and quality and accident of its little native creek may have become familiar but does the minnow understand the ocean tides and periodic currents the tradewinds and monsoons and moons eclipses by all which the condition of its little creek is regulated and may from time to time unmiraculously enough be quite overset and reversed such a minnow is man his creek this planet earth his ocean the immeasurable all his monsoons and periodic currents the mysterious course of providence through aeons of aeons  we speak of the volume of nature and truly a volume it iswhose author and writer is god to read it dost thou does man so much as well know the alphabet thereof with its words sentences and grand descriptive pages poetical and philosophical spread out through solar systems and thousands of years we shall not try thee it is a volume written in celestial hieroglyphs in the true sacredwriting of which even prophets are happy that they can read here a line and there a line as for your institutes and academies of science they strive bravely and from amid the thickcrowded inextricably intertwisted hieroglyphic writing pick out by dexterous combination some letters in the vulgar character and therefrom put together this and the other economic recipe of high avail in practice that nature is more than some boundless volume of such recipes or huge wellnigh inexhaustible domesticcookery book of which the whole secret will in this manner one day evolve itself the fewest dream  custom continues the professor doth make dotards of us all consider well thou wilt find that custom is the greatest of weavers and weaves airraiment for all the spirits of the universe whereby indeed these dwell with us visibly as ministering servants in our houses and workshops but their spiritual nature becomes to the most forever hidden philosophy complains that custom has hoodwinked us from the first that we do everything by custom even believe by it that our very axioms let us boast of freethinking as we may are oftenest simply such beliefs as we have never heard questioned nay what is philosophy throughout but a continual battle against custom an everrenewed effort to transcend the sphere of blind custom and so become transcendental  innumerable are the illusions and legerdemaintricks of custom but of all these perhaps the cleverest is her knack of persuading us that the miraculous by simple repetition ceases to be miraculous true it is by this means we live for man must work as well as wonder and herein is custom so far a kind nurse guiding him to his true benefit but she is a fond foolish nurse or rather we are false foolish nurslings when in our resting and reflecting hours we prolong the same deception am i to view the stupendous with stupid indifference because i have seen it twice or two hundred or two million times there is no reason in nature or in art why i should unless indeed i am a mere workmachine for whom the divine gift of thought were no other than the terrestrial gift of steam is to the steamengine a power whereby cotton might be spun and money and moneys worth

sanctuaries of mans soul even as all thinkers in all ages have devoutly read it there that time and space are not god but creations of god that with god as it is a universal here so is it an

a pale mournfully receding milestone to tell how many toilsome uncheered miles we have journeyed on alonebut a pale spectral illusion is the lost friend still mysteriously here even as we are here

time wherein once for all we are sent into this earth to live should condition and determine our whole practical reasonings conceptions and imagings or imaginings seems altogether fit just and unavoidable but that they should furthermore usurp such sway over pure spiritual meditation and blind us to the wonder everywhere lying close on us seems nowise so admit space and time to their due

to fancy that the miracle lies in miles of distance or in pounds avoirdupois of weight and not to see that the true inexplicable godrevealing miracle lies in this that i can stretch forth my hand at

instance had orpheus or amphion built the walls of thebes by the mere sound of his lyre yet tell me who built these walls of weissnichtwo summoning out all the sandstone rocks to dance along from the steinbruch now a huge troglodyte chasm with frightful greenmantled pools and shape themselves into doric and ionic pillars squared ashlar houses and noble streets was it not the still higher orpheus

without the music of some inspired orpheus was no city ever built no work that man glories in ever done  sweep away the illusion of time glance if thou have eyes from the near movingcause to its far

spirits that are shaped into a body into an appearance and that fade away again into air and invisibility this is no metaphor it is a simple scientific fact we start out of nothingness take figure and are apparitions round us as round the veriest spectre is eternity and to eternity minutes are as years and aeons come there not tones of love and faith as from celestial harpstrings like the song of beatified souls and again do not we squeak and gibber in our discordant screechowlish debatings and recriminatings and glide bodeful and feeble and fearful or uproar poltern and revel in our mad dance

readers actually arrived with us at the new promised country is the philosophy of clothes now at last opening around them long and adventurous has the journey been from those outmost vulgar palpable woollen hulls of man through his wondrous fleshgarments and his wondrous social garnitures inwards to the garments of his very souls soul to time and space themselves and now does the spiritual eternal essence of man and of mankind bared of such wrappages begin in any measure to reveal itself can many readers discern as through a glass darkly in huge wavering outlines some primeval rudiments of mans being what is changeable divided from what is unchangeable does that earthspirits speech in faust       tis thus at the roaring loom of time i ply      and weave for god the garment thou seest him by   or that other thousandtimes repeated speech of the magician shakespeare       and like the baseless fabric of this vision      the cloudcapt towers the gorgeous palaces      the solemn temples the great globe itself      and all which it inherit shall dissolve      and like this unsubstantial pageant faded      leave not a wrack behind  begin to have some meaning for us in a word do we at length stand safe in the far region of poetic creation and palingenesia where that phoenix deathbirth of human society and of all human things appears possible is seen to be inevitable  along this most insufficient unheardof bridge which the editor by heavens blessing has now seen himself enabled to conclude if not complete it cannot be his sober calculation but only his fond hope that many have travelled without accident no firm arch overspanning the impassable with paved highway could the editor construct only as was said some zigzag series of rafts floating tumultuously thereon alas and the leaps from raft to raft were too often of a breakneck character the darkness the nature of the element all was against us  nevertheless may not here and there one of a thousand provided with a discursiveness of intellect rare in our day have cleared the passage in spite of all happy few little band of friends be welcome be of courage by degrees the eye grows accustomed to its new whereabout the hand can stretch itself forth to work there it is in this grand and indeed highest work of palingenesia that ye shall labor each according to ability new laborers will arrive new bridges will be built nay may not our own poor ropeandraft bridge in your passings and repassings be mended in many a point till it grow quite firm passable even for the halt  meanwhile of the innumerable multitude that started with us joyous and full of hope where now is the innumerable remainder whom we see no longer by our side the most have recoiled and stand gazing afar off in unsympathetic astonishment at our career not a few pressing forward with more courage have missed footing or leaped short and now swim weltering in the chaosflood some towards this shore some towards that to these also a helping hand should be held out at least some word of encouragement be said  or to speak without metaphor with which mode of utterance teufelsdrockh unhappily has somewhat infected uscan it be hidden from the editor that many a british reader sits reading quite bewildered in head and afflicted rather than instructed by the present work yes long ago has many a british reader been as now demanding with something like a snarl whereto does all this lead or what use is in it  in the way of replenishing thy purse or otherwise aiding thy digestive faculty o british reader it leads to nothing and there is no use in it but rather the reverse for it costs thee somewhat nevertheless if through this unpromising horngate teufelsdrockh and we by means of him have led thee into the true land of dreams and through the clothesscreen as through a magical pierrepertuis thou lookest even for moments into the region of the wonderful and seest and feelest that thy daily life is girt with wonder and based on wonder and thy very blankets and breeches are miraclesthen art thou profited beyond moneys worth and hast a thankfulness towards our professor nay perhaps in many a literary teacircle wilt open thy kind lips and audibly express that same  nay farther art not thou too perhaps by this time made aware that all symbols are properly clothes that all forms whereby spirit manifests itself to sense whether outwardly or in the imagination are clothes and thus not only the parchment magna charta which a tailor was nigh cutting into measures but the pomp and authority of law the sacredness of majesty and all inferior worships worthships are properly a vesture and raiment and the thirtynine articles themselves are articles of wearingapparel for the religious idea in which case must it not also be admitted that this science of clothes is a high one and may with infinitely deeper study on thy part yield richer fruit that it takes scientific rank beside codification and political economy and the theory of the british constitution nay rather from its prophetic height looks down on all these as on so many weavingshops and spinningmills where the vestures which it has to fashion and consecrate and distribute are too often by haggard hungry operatives who see no farther than their nose mechanically woven and spun  but omitting all this much more all that concerns natural supernaturalism and indeed whatever has reference to the ulterior or transcendental portion of the science or bears never so remotely on that promised volume of the palingenesie der menschlichen gesellschaft newbirth of societywe humbly suggest that no province of clothesphilosophy even the lowest is without its direct value but that innumerable inferences of a practical nature may be drawn therefrom to say nothing of those pregnant considerations ethical political symbolical which crowd on the clothesphilosopher from the very threshold of his science nothing even of those architectural ideas which as we have seen lurk at the bottom of all modes and will one day better unfolding themselves lead to important revolutionslet us glance for a moment and with the faintest light of clothesphilosophy on what may be called the habilatory class of our fellowmen here too overlooking where so much were to be looked on the million spinners weavers fullers dyers washers and wringers that puddle and muddle in their dark recesses to make us clothes and die that we may livelet us but turn the readers attention upon two small divisions of mankind who like moths may be regarded as clothanimals creatures that live move and have their being in cloth we mean dandies and tailors  in regard to both which small divisions it may be asserted without scruple that the public feeling unenlightened by philosophy is at fault and even that the dictates of humanity are violated as will perhaps abundantly appear to readers of the two following chapters    chapter x the dandiacal body  first touching dandies let us consider with some scientific strictness what a dandy specially is a dandy is a clotheswearing man a man whose trade office and existence consists in the wearing of clothes every faculty of his soul spirit purse and person is heroically consecrated to this one object the wearing of clothes wisely and well so that as others dress to live he lives to dress the allimportance of clothes which a german professor of unequalled learning and acumen writes his enormous volume to demonstrate has sprung up in the intellect of the dandy without effort like an instinct of genius he is inspired with cloth a poet of cloth what teufelsdrockh would call a divine idea of cloth is born with him and this like other such ideas will express itself outwardly or wring his heart asunder with unutterable throes  but like a generous creative enthusiast he fearlessly makes his idea an action shows himself in peculiar guise to mankind walks forth a witness and living martyr to the eternal worth of clothes we called him a poet is not his body the stuffed parchmentskin whereon he writes with cunning huddersfield dyes a sonnet to his mistress eyebrow say rather an epos and clotha virumque cano to the whole world in macaronic verses which he that runs may read nay if you grant what seems to be admissible that the dandy has a thinkingprinciple in him and some notions of time and space is there not in this lifedevotedness to cloth in this so willing sacrifice of the immortal to the perishable something though in reverse order of that blending and identification of eternity with time which as we have seen constitutes the prophetic character  and now for all this perennial martyrdom and poesy and even prophecy what is it that the dandy asks in return solely we may say that you would recognize his existence would admit him to be a living object or even failing this a visual object or thing that will reflect rays of light your silver or your gold beyond what the niggardly law has already secured him he solicits not simply the glance of your eyes understand his mystic significance or altogether miss and misinterpret it do but look at him and he is contented may we not well cry shame on an ungrateful world which refuses even this poor boon which will waste its optic faculty on dried crocodiles and siamese twins and over the domestic wonderful wonder of wonders a live dandy glance with hasty indifference and a scarcely concealed contempt him no zoologist classes among the mammalia no anatomist dissects with care when did we see any injected preparation of the dandy in our museums any specimen of him preserved in spirits lord herringbone may dress himself in a snuffbrown suit with snuffbrown shirt and shoes it skills not the undiscerning public occupied with grosser wants passes by regardless on the other side  the age of curiosity like that of chivalry is indeed properly speaking gone yet perhaps only gone to sleep for here arises the clothesphilosophy to resuscitate strangely enough both the one and the other should sound views of this science come to prevail the essential nature of the british dandy and the mystic significance that lies in him cannot always remain hidden under laughable and lamentable hallucination the following long extract from professor teufelsdrockh may set the matter if not in its true light yet in the way towards such it is to be regretted however that here as so often elsewhere the professors keen philosophic perspicacity is somewhat marred by a certain mixture of almost owlish purblindness or else of some perverse ineffectual ironic tendency our readers shall judge which   in these distracted times writes he when the religious principle driven out of most churches either lies unseen in the hearts of good men looking and longing and silently working there towards some new revelation or else wanders homeless over the world like a disembodied soul seeking its terrestrial organizationinto how many strange shapes of superstition and fanaticism does it not tentatively and errantly cast itself the higher enthusiasm of mans nature is for the while without exponent yet does it continue indestructible unweariedly active and work blindly in the great chaotic deep thus sect after sect and church after church bodies itself forth and melts again into new metamorphosis  chiefly is this observable in england which as the wealthiest and worstinstructed of european nations offers precisely the elements of heat namely and of darkness in which such mooncalves and monstrosities are best generated among the newer sects of that country one of the most notable and closely connected with our present subject is that of the dandies concerning which what little information i have been able to procure may fitly stand here  it is true certain of the english journalists men generally without sense for the religious principle or judgment for its manifestations speak in their brief enigmatic notices as if this were perhaps rather a secular sect and not a religious one nevertheless to the psychologic eye its devotional and even sacrificial character plainly enough reveals itself whether it belongs to the class of fetishworships or of heroworships or polytheisms or to what other class may in the present state of our intelligence remain undecided schweben a certain touch of manicheism not indeed in the gnostic shape is discernible enough also for human error walks in a cycle and reappears at intervals a notinconsiderable resemblance to that superstition of the athos monks who by fasting from all nourishment and looking intensely for a length of time into their own navels came to discern therein the true apocalypse of nature and heaven unveiled to my own surmise it appears as if this dandiacal sect were but a new modification adapted to the new time of that primeval superstition selfworship which zerdusht quangfoutchee mahomet and others strove rather to subordinate and restrain than to eradicate and which only in the purer forms of religion has been altogether rejected wherefore if any one chooses to name it revived ahrimanism or a new figure of demonworship i have so far as is yet visible no objection  for the rest these people animated with the zeal of a new sect display courage and perseverance and what force there is in mans nature though never so enslaved they affect great purity and separatism distinguish themselves by a particular costume whereof some notices were given in the earlier part of this volume likewise so far as possible by a particular speech apparently some broken linguafranca or englishfrench and on the whole strive to maintain a true nazarene deportment and keep themselves unspotted from the world  they have their temples whereof the chief as the jewish temple did stands in their metropolis and is named almacks a word of uncertain etymology they worship principally by night and have their highpriests and highpriestesses who however do not continue for life the rites by some supposed to be of the menadic sort or perhaps with an eleusinian or cabiric character are held strictly secret nor are sacred books wanting to the sect these they call fashionable novels however the canon is not completed and some are canonical and others not  of such sacred books i not without expense procured myself some samples and in hope of true insight and with the zeal which beseems an inquirer into clothes set to interpret and study them but wholly to no purpose that tough faculty of reading for which the world will not refuse me credit was here for the first time foiled and set at naught in vain that i summoned my whole energies mich weidlich anstrengte and did my very utmost at the end of some short space i was uniformly seized with not so much what i can call a drumming in my ears as a kind of infinite unsufferable jewsharping and scrannelpiping there to which the frightfullest species of magnetic sleep soon supervened and if i strove to shake this away and absolutely would not yield there came a hitherto unfelt sensation as of delirium tremens and a melting into total deliquium till at last by order of the doctor dreading ruin to my whole intellectual and bodily faculties and a general breaking up of the constitution i reluctantly but determinedly forbore was there some miracle at work here like those fireballs and supernal and infernal prodigies which in the case of the jewish mysteries have also more than once scared back the alien be this as it may such failure on my part after best efforts must excuse the imperfection of this sketch altogether incomplete yet the completest i could give of a sect too singular to be omitted  loving my own life and senses as i do no power shall induce me as a private individual to open another fashionable novel but luckily in this dilemma comes a hand from the clouds whereby if not victory deliverance is held out to me round one of those bookpackages which the stillschweigensche buchhandlung is in the habit of importing from england come as is usual various waste printedsheets maculaturblatter by way of interior wrappage into these the clothesphilosopher with a certain mahometan reverence even for wastepaper where curious knowledge will sometimes hover disdains not to cast his eye readers may judge of his astonishment when on such a defaced straysheet probably the outcast fraction of some english periodical such as they name magazine appears something like a dissertation on this very subject of fashionable novels it sets out indeed chiefly from a secular point of view directing itself not without asperity against some to me unknown individual named pelham who seems to be a mystagogue and leading teacher and preacher of the sect so that what indeed otherwise was not to be expected in such a fugitive fragmentary sheet the true secret the religious physiognomy and physiology of the dandiacal body is nowise laid fully open there nevertheless scattered lights do from time to time sparkle out whereby i have endeavored to profit nay in one passage selected from the prophecies or mythic theogonies or whatever they are for the style seems very mixed of this mystagogue i find what appears to be a confession of faith or whole duty of man according to the tenets of that sect which confession or whole duty therefore as proceeding from a source so authentic i shall here arrange under seven distinct articles and in very abridged shape lay before the german world therewith taking leave of this matter observe also that to avoid possibility of error i as far as may be quote literally from the original  articles of faith  1 coats should have nothing of the triangle about them at the same time wrinkles behind should be carefully avoided  2 the collar is a very important point it should be low behind and slightly rolled  3 no license of fashion can allow a man of delicate taste to adopt the posterial luxuriance of a hottentot  4 there is safety in a swallowtail  5 the good sense of a gentleman is nowhere more finely developed than in his rings  6 it is permitted to mankind under certain restrictions to wear white waistcoats  7 the trousers must be exceedingly tight across the hips  all which propositions i for the present content myself with modestly but peremptorily and irrevocably denying  in strange contrast with this dandiacal body stands another british sect originally as i understand of ireland where its chief seat still is but known also in the main island and indeed everywhere rapidly spreading as this sect has hitherto emitted no canonical books it remains to me in the same state of obscurity as the dandiacal which has published books that the unassisted human faculties are inadequate to read the members appear to be designated by a considerable diversity of names according to their various places of establishment in england they are generally called the drudge sect also unphilosophically enough the white negroes and chiefly in scorn by those of other communions the raggedbeggar sect in scotland again i find them entitled hallanshakers or the stook of duds sect any individual communicant is named stook of duds that is shock of rags in allusion doubtless to their professional costume while in ireland which as mentioned is their grand parent hive they go by a perplexing multiplicity of designations such as bogtrotters redshanks ribbonmen cottiers peepofday boys babes of the wood rockites poorslaves which last however seems to be the primary and generic name whereto probably enough the others are only subsidiary species or slight varieties or at most propagated offsets from the parent stem whose minute subdivisions and shades of difference it were here loss of time to dwell on enough for us to understand what seems indubitable that the original sect is that of the poorslaves whose doctrines practices and fundamental characteristics pervade and animate the whole body howsoever denominated or outwardly diversified  the precise speculative tenets of this brotherhood how the universe and man and mans life picture themselves to the mind of an irish poorslave with what feelings and opinions he looks forward on the future round on the present back on the past it were extremely difficult to specify something monastic there appears to be in their constitution we find them bound by the two monastic vows of poverty and obedience which vows especially the former it is said they observe with great strictness nay as i have understood it they are pledged and be it by any solemn nazarene ordination or not irrevocably consecrated thereto even before birth that the third monastic vow of chastity is rigidly enforced among them i find no ground to conjecture  furthermore they appear to imitate the dandiacal sect in their grand principle of wearing a peculiar costume of which irish poorslave costume no description will indeed be found in the present volume for this reason that by the imperfect organ of language it did not seem describable their raiment consists of innumerable skirts lappets and irregular wings of all cloths and of all colors through the labyrinthic intricacies of which their bodies are introduced by some unknown process it is fastened together by a multiplex combination of buttons thrums and skewers to which frequently is added a girdle of leather of hempen or even of straw rope round the loins to straw rope indeed they seem partial and often wear it by way of sandals in headdress they affect a certain freedom hats with partial brim without crown or with only a loose hinged or valve crown in the former case they sometimes invert the hat and wear it brim uppermost like a universitycap with what view is unknown  the name poorslaves seems to indicate a slavonic polish or russian origin not so however the interior essence and spirit of their superstition which rather displays a teutonic or druidical character one might fancy them worshippers of hertha or the earth for they dig and affectionately work continually in her bosom or else shut up in private oratories meditate and manipulate the substances derived from her seldom looking up towards the heavenly luminaries and then with comparative indifference like the druids on the other hand they live in dark dwellings often even breaking their glass windows where they find such and stuffing them up with pieces of raiment or other opaque substances till the fit obscurity is restored again like all followers of natureworship they are liable to outbreakings of an enthusiasm rising to ferocity and burn men if not in wicker idols yet in sod cottages  in respect of diet they have also their observances all poorslaves are rhizophagous or rooteaters a few are ichthyophagous and use salted herrings other animal food they abstain from except indeed with perhaps some strange inverted fragment of a brahminical feeling such animals as die a natural death their universal sustenance is the root named potato cooked by fire alone and generally without condiment or relish of any kind save an unknown condiment named point into the meaning of which i have vainly inquired the victual potatoesandpoint not appearing at least not with specific accuracy of description in any european cookerybook whatever for drink they use with an almost epigrammatic counterpoise of taste milk which is the mildest of liquors and potheen which is the fiercest this latter i have tasted as well as the english blueruin and the scotch whiskey analogous fluids used by the sect in those countries it evidently contains some form of alcohol in the highest state of concentration though disguised with acrid oils and is on the whole the most pungent substance known to meindeed a perfect liquid fire in all their religious solemnities potheen is said to be an indispensable requisite and largely consumed  an irish traveller of perhaps common veracity who presents himself under the to me unmeaning title of the late john bernard offers the following sketch of a domestic establishment the inmates whereof though such is not stated expressly appear to have been of that faith thereby shall my german readers now behold an irish poorslave as it were with their own eyes and even see him at meat moreover in the so precious wastepaper sheet above mentioned i have found some corresponding picture of a dandiacal household painted by that same dandiacal mystagogue or theogonist this also by way of counterpart and contrast the world shall look into  first therefore of the poorslave who appears likewise to have been a species of innkeeper i quote from the original   poorslave household  the furniture of this caravansera consisted of a large iron pot two oaken tables two benches two chairs and a potheen noggin there was a loft above attainable by a ladder upon which the inmates slept and the space below was divided by a hurdle into two apartments the one for their cow and pig the other for themselves and guests on entering the house we discovered the family eleven in number at dinner the father sitting at the top the mother at the bottom the children on each side of a large oaken board which was scooped out in the middle like a trough to receive the contents of their pot of potatoes little holes were cut at equal distances to contain salt and a bowl of milk stood on the table all the luxuries of meat and beer bread knives and dishes were dispensed with the poorslave himself our traveller found as he says broadbacked blackbrowed of great personal strength and mouth from ear to ear his wife was a sunbrowned but wellfeatured woman and his young ones bare and chubby had the appetite of ravens of their philosophical or religious tenets or observances no notice or hint  but now secondly of the dandiacal household in which truly that oftenmentioned mystagogue and inspired penman himself has his abode   dandiacal household  a dressingroom splendidly furnished violetcolored curtains chairs and ottomans of the same hue two fulllength mirrors are placed one on each side of a table which supports the luxuries of the toilet several bottles of perfumes arranged in a peculiar fashion stand upon a smaller table of motherofpearl opposite to these are placed the appurtenances of lavation richly wrought in frosted silver a wardrobe of buhl is on the left the doors of which being partly open discover a profusion of clothes shoes of a singularly small size monopolize the lower shelves fronting the wardrobe a door ajar gives some slight glimpse of a bathroom foldingdoors in the backgroundenter the author our theogonist in person obsequiously preceded by a french valet in white silk jacket and cambric apron  such are the two sects which at this moment divide the more unsettled portion of the british people and agitate that evervexed country to the eye of the political seer their mutual relation pregnant with the elements of discord and hostility is far from consoling these two principles of dandiacal selfworship or demonworship and poorslavish or drudgical earthworship or whatever that same drudgism may be do as yet indeed manifest themselves under distant and nowise considerable shapes nevertheless in their roots and subterranean ramifications they extend through the entire structure of society and work unweariedly in the secret depths of english national existence striving to separate and isolate it into two contradictory uncommunicating masses  in numbers and even individual strength the poorslaves or drudges it would seem are hourly increasing the dandiacal again is by nature no proselytizing sect but it boasts of great hereditary resources and is strong by union whereas the drudges split into parties have as yet no rallyingpoint or at best only cooperate by means of partial secret affiliations if indeed there were to arise a communion of drudges as there is already a communion of saints what strangest effects would follow therefrom dandyism as yet affects to look down on drudgism but perhaps the hour of trial when it will be practically seen which ought to look down and which up is not so distant  to me it seems probable that the two sects will one day part england between them each recruiting itself from the intermediate ranks till there be none left to enlist on either side those dandiacal manicheans with the host of dandyizing christians will form one body the drudges gathering round them whosoever is drudgical be he christian or infidel pagan sweeping up likewise all manner of utilitarians radicals refractory potwallopers and so forth into their general mass will form another i could liken dandyism and drudgism to two bottomless boiling whirlpools that had broken out on opposite quarters of the firm land as yet they appear only disquieted foolishly bubbling wells which mans art might cover in yet mark them their diameter is daily widening they are hollow cones that boil up from the infinite deep over which your firm land is but a thin crust or rind thus daily is the intermediate land crumbling in daily the empire of the two buchanbullers extending till now there is but a footplank a mere film of land between them this too is washed away and thenwe have the true hell of waters and noahs deluge is outdeluged  or better i might call them two boundless and indeed unexampled electric machines turned by the machinery of society with batteries of opposite quality drudgism the negative dandyism the positive one attracts hourly towards it and appropriates all the positive electricity of the nation namely the money thereof the other is equally busy with the negative that is to say the hunger which is equally potent hitherto you see only partial transient sparkles and sputters but wait a little till the entire nation is in an electric state till your whole vital electricity no longer healthfully neutral is cut into two isolated portions of positive and negative of money and of hunger and stands there bottled up in two worldbatteries the stirring of a childs finger brings the two together and thenwhat then the earth is but shivered into impalpable smoke by that dooms thunderpeal the sun misses one of his planets in space and thenceforth there are no eclipses of the moonor better still i might liken  oh enough enough of likenings and similitudes in excess of which truly it is hard to say whether teufelsdrockh or ourselves sin the more  we have often blamed him for a habit of wiredrawing and overrefining from of old we have been familiar with his tendency to mysticism and religiosity whereby in everything he was still scenting out religion but never perhaps did these amaurosissuffusions so cloud and distort his otherwise most piercing vision as in this of the dandiacal body or was there something of intended satire is the professor and seer not quite the blinkard he affects to be of an ordinary mortal we should have decisively answered in the affirmative but with a teufelsdrockh there ever hovers some shade of doubt in the mean while if satire were actually intended the case is little better there are not wanting men who will answer does your professor take us for simpletons his irony has overshot itself we see through it and perhaps through him    chapter xi tailors  thus however has our first practical inference from the clothesphilosophy that which respects dandies been sufficiently drawn and we come now to the second concerning tailors on this latter our opinion happily quite coincides with that of teufelsdrockh himself as expressed in the concluding page of his volume to whom therefore we willingly give place let him speak his own last words in his own way   upwards of a century says he must elapse and still the bleeding fight of freedom be fought whoso is noblest perishing in the van and thrones be hurled on altars like pelion on ossa and the moloch of iniquity have his victims and the michael of justice his martyrs before tailors can be admitted to their true prerogatives of manhood and this last wound of suffering humanity be closed  if aught in the history of the worlds blindness could surprise us here might we indeed pause and wonder an idea has gone abroad and fixed itself down into a widespreading rooted error that tailors are a distinct species in physiology not men but fractional parts of a man call any one a schneider cutter tailor is it not in our dislocated hoodwinked and indeed delirious condition of society equivalent to defying his perpetual fellest enmity the epithet schneidermassig tailorlike betokens an otherwise unapproachable degree of pusillanimity we introduce a tailorsmelancholy more opprobrious than any leprosy into our books of medicine and fable i know not what of his generating it by living on cabbage why should i speak of hans sachs himself a shoemaker or kind of leathertailor with his schneider mit dem panier why of shakspeare in his taming of the shrew and elsewhere does it not stand on record that the english queen elizabeth receiving a deputation of eighteen tailors addressed them with a good morning gentlemen both did not the same virago boast that she had a cavalry regiment whereof neither horse nor man could be injured her regiment namely of tailors on mares thus everywhere is the falsehood taken for granted and acted on as an indisputable fact  nevertheless need i put the question to any physiologist whether it is disputable or not seems it not at least presumable that under his clothes the tailor has bones and viscera and other muscles than the sartorius which function of manhood is the tailor not conjectured to perform can he not arrest for debt is he not in most countries a taxpaying animal  to no reader of this volume can it be doubtful which conviction is mine nay if the fruit of these long vigils and almost preternatural inquiries is not to perish utterly the world will have approximated towards a higher truth and the doctrine which swift with the keen forecast of genius dimly anticipated will stand revealed in clear light that the tailor is not only a man but something of a creator or divinity of franklin it was said that he snatched the thunder from heaven and the sceptre from kings but which is greater i would ask he that lends or he that snatches for looking away from individual cases and how a man is by the tailor newcreated into a nobleman and clothed not only with wool but with dignity and a mystic dominionis not the fair fabric of society itself with all its royal mantles and pontifical stoles whereby from nakedness and dismemberment we are organized into polities into nations and a whole cooperating mankind the creation as has here been often irrefragably evinced of the tailor alonewhat too are all poets and moral teachers but a species of metaphorical tailors touching which high guild the greatest living guildbrother has triumphantly asked us nay if thou wilt have it who but the poet first made gods for men brought them down to us and raised us up to them  and this is he whom sitting downcast on the hard basis of his shopboard the world treats with contumely as the ninth part of a man look up thou muchinjured one look up with the kindling eye of hope and prophetic bodings of a noble better time too long hast thou sat there on crossed legs wearing thy anklejoints to horn like some sacred anchorite or catholic fakir doing penance drawing down heavens richest blessings for a world that scoffed at thee be of hope already streaks of blue peer through our clouds the thick gloom of ignorance is rolling asunder and it will be day mankind will repay with interest their longaccumulated debt the anchorite that was scoffed at will be worshipped the fraction will become not an integer only but a square and cube with astonishment the world will recognize that the tailor is its hierophant and hierarch or even its god  as i stood in the mosque of st sophia and looked upon these fourandtwenty tailors sewing and embroidering that rich cloth which the sultan sends yearly for the caaba of mecca i thought within myself how many other unholies has your covering art made holy besides this arabian whinstone  still more touching was it when turning the corner of a lane in the scottish town of edinburgh i came upon a signpost whereon stood written that such and such a one was breechesmaker to his majesty and stood painted the effigies of a pair of leather breeches and between the knees these memorable words sic itur ad astra was not this the martyr prisonspeech of a tailor sighing indeed in bonds yet sighing towards deliverance and prophetically appealing to a better day a day of justice when the worth of breeches would be revealed to man and the scissors become forever venerable  neither perhaps may i now say has his appeal been altogether in vain it was in this high moment when the soul rent as it were and shed asunder is open to inspiring influence that i first conceived this work on clothes the greatest i can ever hope to do which has already after long retardations occupied and will yet occupy so large a section of my life and of which the primary and simpler portion may here find its conclusion    chapter xii farewell  so have we endeavored from the enormous amorphous plumpudding more like a scottish haggis which herr teufelsdrockh had kneaded for his fellowmortals to pick out the choicest plums and present them separately on a cover of our own a laborious perhaps a thankless enterprise in which however something of hope has occasionally cheered us and of which we can now wash our hands not altogether without satisfaction if hereby though in barbaric wise some morsel of spiritual nourishment have been added to the scanty ration of our beloved british world what nobler recompense could the editor desire if it prove otherwise why should he murmur was not this a task which destiny in any case had appointed him which having now done with he sees his general dayswork so much the lighter so much the shorter   of professor teufelsdrockh it seems impossible to take leave without a mingled feeling of astonishment gratitude and disapproval who will not regret that talents which might have profited in the higher walks of philosophy or in art itself have been so much devoted to a rummaging among lumberrooms nay too often to a scraping in kennels where lost rings and diamondnecklaces are nowise the sole conquests regret is unavoidable yet censure were loss of time to cure him of his mad humors british criticism would essay in vain enough for her if she can by vigilance prevent the spreading of such among ourselves what a result should this piebald entangled hypermetaphorical style of writing not to say of thinking become general among our literary men as it might so easily do thus has not the editor himself working over teufelsdrockhs german lost much of his own english purity even as the smaller whirlpool is sucked into the larger and made to whirl along with it so has the lesser mind in this instance been forced to become portion of the greater and like it see all things figuratively which habit time and assiduous effort will be needed to eradicate  nevertheless wayward as our professor shows himself is there any reader that can part with him in declared enmity let us confess there is that in the wild muchsuffering muchinflicting man which almost attaches us his attitude we will hope and believe is that of a man who had said to cant begone and to dilettantism here thou canst not be and to truth be thou in place of all to me a man who had manfully defied the timeprince or devil to his face nay perhaps hanniballike was mysteriously consecrated from birth to that warfare and now stood minded to wage the same by all weapons in all places at all times in such a cause any soldier were he but a polack scytheman shall be welcome  still the question returns on us how could a man occasionally of keen insight not without keen sense of propriety who had real thoughts to communicate resolve to emit them in a shape bordering so closely on the absurd which question he were wiser than the present editor who should satisfactorily answer our conjecture has sometimes been that perhaps necessity as well as choice was concerned in it seems it not conceivable that in a life like our professors where so much bountifully given by nature had in practice failed and misgone literature also would never rightly prosper that striving with his characteristic vehemence to paint this and the other picture and ever without success he at last desperately dashes his sponge full of all colors against the canvas to try whether it will paint foam with all his stillness there were perhaps in teufelsdrockh desperation enough for this  a second conjecture we hazard with even less warranty it is that teufelsdrockh is not without some touch of the universal feeling a wish to proselytize how often already have we paused uncertain whether the basis of this so enigmatic nature were really stoicism and despair or love and hope only seared into the figure of these remarkable moreover is this saying of his how were friendship possible in mutual devotedness to the good and true otherwise impossible except as armed neutrality or hollow commercial league a man be the heavens ever praised is sufficient for himself yet were ten men united in love capable of being and of doing what ten thousand singly would fail in infinite is the help man can yield to man and now in conjunction therewith consider this other it is the night of the world and still long till it be day we wander amid the glimmer of smoking ruins and the sun and the stars of heaven are as if blotted out for a season and two immeasurable phantoms hypocrisy and atheism with the ghoul sensuality stalk abroad over the earth and call it theirs well at ease are the sleepers for whom existence is a shallow dream  but what of the awestruck wakeful who find it a reality should not these unite since even an authentic spectre is not visible to twoin which case were this enormous clothesvolume properly an enormous pitchpan which our teufelsdrockh in his lone watchtower had kindled that it might flame far and wide through the night and many a disconsolately wandering spirit be guided thither to a brothers bosomwe say as before with all his malign indifference who knows what mad hopes this man may harbor  meanwhile there is one fact to be stated here which harmonizes ill with such conjecture and indeed were teufelsdrockh made like other men might as good as altogether subvert it namely that while the beaconfire blazed its brightest the watchman had quitted it that no pilgrim could now ask him watchman what of the night professor teufelsdrockh be it known is no longer visibly present at weissnichtwo but again to all appearance lost in space some time ago the hofrath heuschrecke was pleased to favor us with another copious epistle wherein much is said about the populationinstitute much repeated in praise of the paperbag documents the hieroglyphic nature of which our hofrath still seems not to have surmised and lastly the strangest occurrence communicated to us for the first time in the following paragraph  ew wohlgeboren will have seen from the public prints with what affectionate and hitherto fruitless solicitude weissnichtwo regards the disappearance of her sage might but the united voice of germany prevail on him to return nay could we but so much as elucidate for ourselves by what mystery he went away but alas old lieschen experiences or affects the profoundest deafness the profoundest ignorance in the wahngasse all lies swept silent sealed up the privy council itself can hitherto elicit no answer  it had been remarked that while the agitating news of those parisian three days flew from mouth to month and dinned every ear in weissnichtwo herr teufelsdrockh was not known at the gans or elsewhere to have spoken for a whole week any syllable except once these three es geht an it is beginning shortly after as ew wohlgeboren knows was the public tranquillity here as in berlin threatened by a sedition of the tailors nor did there want evilwishers or perhaps mere desperate alarmists who asserted that the closing chapter of the clothesvolume was to blame in this appalling crisis the serenity of our philosopher was indescribable nay perhaps through one humble individual something thereof might pass into the rath council itself and so contribute to the countrys deliverance the tailors are now entirely pacificated  to neither of these two incidents can i attribute our loss yet still comes there the shadow of a suspicion out of paris and its politics for example when the saintsimonian society transmitted its propositions hither and the whole gans was one vast cackle of laughter lamentation and astonishment our sage sat mute and at the end of the third evening said merely here also are men who have discovered not without amazement that man is still man of which high longforgotten truth you already see them make a false application since then as has been ascertained by examination of the postdirector there passed at least one letter with its answer between the messieurs bazardenfantin and our professor himself of what tenor can now only be conjectured on the fifth night following he was seen for the last time  has this invaluable man so obnoxious to most of the hostile sects that convulse our era been spirited away by certain of their emissaries or did he go forth voluntarily to their headquarters to confer with them and confront them reason we have at least of a negative sort to believe the lost still living our widowed heart also whispers that ere long he will himself give a sign otherwise indeed his archives must one day be opened by authority where much perhaps the palingenesie itself is thought to be reposited   thus far the hofrath who vanishes as is his wont too like an ignis fatuus leaving the dark still darker  so that teufelsdrockhs public history were not done then or reduced to an even unromantic tenor nay perhaps the better part thereof were only beginning we stand in a region of conjectures where substance has melted into shadow and one cannot be distinguished from the other may time which solves or suppresses all problems throw glad light on this also our own private conjecture now amounting almost to certainty is that safemoored in some stillest obscurity not to lie always still teufelsdrockh is actually in london  here however can the present editor with an ambrosial joy as of overweariness falling into sleep lay down his pen well does he know if human testimony be worth aught that to innumerable british readers likewise this is a satisfying consummation that innumerable british readers consider him during these current months but as an uneasy interruption to their ways of thought and digestion and indicate so much not without a certain irritancy and even spoken invective for which as for other mercies ought not he to thank the upper powers to one and all of you o irritated readers he with outstretched arms and open heart will wave a kind farewell thou too miraculous entity who namest thyself yorke and oliver and with thy vivacities and genialities with thy all too irish

does the writer mean by baphometic firebaptism why cannot he lay aside his pedantry and write so as to make himself generally intelligible we quote by way of curiosity a sentence from the sartor resartus which may be read either backwards or forwards for it is equally intelligible either way indeed by beginning at the tail and so working up to the head we think the reader will stand the fairest chance of getting at its meaning the firebaptized soul long so scathed and thunderriven here feels its own freedom which feeling is its baphometic baptism the citadel of its whole kingdom it has thus gained by assault and will keep inexpugnable outwards from which the remaining dominions not indeed without hard battering will doubtless by degrees be conquered and pacificated here is asun newspaper 1st april 1834   iii northamerican reviewer   after a careful survey of the whole ground our belief is that no such persons as professors teufelsdrockh or counsellor heuschrecke ever existed that the six paperbags with their chinaink inscriptions and multifarious contents are a mere figment of the brain that the present editor is the only person who has ever written upon the philosophy of clothes and that the sartor resartus is the only treatise that has yet appeared upon that subjectin short that the whole account of the origin of the work before us which the supposed editor relates with so much gravity and of which we have given a brief abstract is in plain english a hum  without troubling our readers at any great length with our reasons for entertaining these suspicions we may remark that the absence of all other information on the subject except what is contained in the work is itself a fact of a most significant character the whole german press as well as the particular one where the work purports to have been printed seems to be under the control of stillschweigen and co silence and company if the clothesphilosophy and its author are making so great a sensation throughout germany as is pretended how happens it that the only notice we have of the fact is contained in a few numbers of a monthly magazine published at london how happens it that no intelligence about the matter has come out directly to this country we pique ourselves here in new england upon knowing at least as much of what is going on in the literary way in the old dutch motherland as our brethren of the fastanchored isle but thus far we have no tidings whatever of the extensive closeprinted closemeditated volume which forms the subject of this pretended commentary again we would respectfully inquire of the present editor upon what part of the map of germany we are to look for the city of weissnichtwoknownotwhereat which place the work is supposed to have been printed and the author to have resided it has been our fortune to visit several portions of the german territory and to examine pretty carefully at different times and for various purposes maps of the whole but we have no recollection of any such place we suspect that the city of knownotwhere might be called with at least as much propriety nobodyknowswhere and is to be found in the kingdom of nowhere again the village of entepfuhlduckpondwhere the supposed author of the work is said to have passed his youth and that of hinterschlag where he had his education are equally foreign to our geography duckponds enough there undoubtedly are in almost every village in germany as the traveller in that country knows too well to his cost but any particular village denominated duckpond is to us altogether terra incognita the names of the personages are not less singular than those of the places who can refrain from a smile at the yoking together of such a pair of appellatives as diogenes teufelsdrockh the supposed bearer of this strange title is represented as admitting in his pretended autobiography that he had searched to no purpose through all the heralds books in and without the german empire and through all manner of subscriberslists militiarolls and other namecatalogues but had nowhere been able to find the name teufelsdrockh except as appended to his own person we can readily believe this and we doubt very much whether any christian parent would think of condemning a son to carry through life the burden of so unpleasant a title that of counsellor heuschreckegrasshopperthough not offensive looks much more like a piece of fancywork than a fair business transaction the same may be said of blumineflowergoddessthe heroine of the fable and so of the rest  in short our private opinion is as we have remarked that the whole story of a correspondence with germany a university of nobodyknowswhere a professor of things in general a counsellor grasshopper a flowergoddess blumine and so forth has about as much foundation in truth as the late entertaining account of sir john herschels discoveries in the moon fictions of this kind are however not uncommon and ought not perhaps to be condemned with too much severity but we are not sure that we can exercise the same indulgence in regard to the attempt which seems to be made to mislead the public as to the substance of the work before us and its pretended german original both purport as we have seen to be upon the subject of clothes or dress clothes their origin and influence is the title of the supposed german treatise of professor teufelsdrockh and the rather odd name of sartor resartusthe tailor patchedwhich the present editor has affixed to his pretended commentary seems to look the same way but though there is a good deal of remark throughout the work in a halfserious halfcomic style upon dress it seems to be in reality a treatise upon the great science of things in general which teufelsdrockh is supposed to have professed at the university of nobodyknowswhere now without intending to adopt a too rigid standard of morals we own that we doubt a little the propriety of offering to the public a treatise on things in general under the name and in the form of an essay on dress for ourselves advanced as we unfortunately are in the journey of life far beyond the period when dress is practically a matter of interest we have no hesitation in saying that the real subject of the work is to us more attractive than the ostensible one but this is probably not the case with the mass of readers to the younger portion of the community which constitutes everywhere the very great majority the subject of dress is one of intense and paramount importance an author who treats it appeals like the poet to the young men end maddensvirginibus puerisqueand calls upon them by all the motives which habitually operate most strongly upon their feelings to buy his book when after opening their purses for this purpose they have carried home the work in triumph expecting to find in it some particular instruction in regard to the tying of their neckcloths or the cut of their corsets and meet with nothing better than a dissertation on things in general they willto use the mildest termnot be in very good humor if the last improvements in legislation which we have made in this country should have found their way to england the author we think would stand some chance of being lynched whether his object in this piece of supercherie be merely pecuniary profit or whether he takes a malicious pleasure in quizzing the dandies we shall not undertake to say in the latter part of the work he devotes a separate chapter to this class of persons from the tenor of which we should be disposed to conclude that he would consider any mode of divesting them of their property very much in the nature of a spoiling of the egyptians  the only thing about the work tending to prove that it is what it purports to be a commentary on a real german treatise is the style which is a sort of babylonish dialect not destitute it is true of richness vigor and at times a sort of singular felicity of expression but very strongly tinged throughout with the peculiar idiom of the german language this quality in the style however may be a mere result of a great familiarity with german literature and we cannot therefore look upon it as in itself decisive still less as outweighing so much evidence of an opposite characternorthamerican review no 89 october 1835   iv new england editors  the editors have been induced by the expressed desire of many persons to collect the following sheets out of the ephemeral pamphlets  in which they first appeared under the conviction that they contain in themselves the assurance of a longer date        frasers london magazine 183334  the editors have no expectation that this little work will have a sudden and general popularity they will not undertake as there is no need to justify the gay costume in which the author delights to dress his thoughts or the german idioms with which he has sportively sprinkled his pages it is his humor to advance the gravest speculations upon the gravest topics in a quaint and burlesque style if his masquerade offend any of his audience to that degree that they will not hear what he has to say it may chance to draw others to listen to his wisdom and what work of imagination can hope to please all but we will venture to remark that the distaste excited by these peculiarities in some readers is greatest at first and is soon forgotten and that the foreign dress and aspect of the work are quite superficial and cover a genuine saxon heart we believe no book has been published for many years written in a more sincere style of idiomatic english or which discovers an equal mastery over all the riches of the language the author makes ample amends for the occasional eccentricity of his genius not only by frequent bursts of pure splendor but by the wit and sense which never fail him  but what will chiefly commend the book to the discerning reader is the manifest design of the work which is a criticism upon the spirit of the agewe had almost said of the hourin which we live exhibiting in the most just and novel light the present aspects of religion politics literature arts and social life under all his gayety the writer has an earnest meaning and discovers an insight into the manifold wants and tendencies of human nature which is very rare among our popular authors the philanthropy and the purity of moral sentiment which inspire the work will find their way to the heart of every lover of virtuepreface to sartor resartus boston 1835 1837   sunt fuerunt vel fuere  london 30th june 1838
